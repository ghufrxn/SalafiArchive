<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Introduction to the English Edition</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise and thanks are due to Allaah, Lord of the worlds. May His peace and prayers be upon Muhammad and upon those who follow his Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">More than likely this book shall attract much attention. Perhaps it shall be a gift from a husband to his wife or perhaps those of us awaiting marriage will eagerly study these few pages to better understand what is expected of us and how we can strive towards it. Nevertheless there will be some who shall huff and utter annoyances under their breath claiming that yet again this is targeted at women (not men), censuring and restricting them. Unfortunately such people will rarely study the text but on flicking through these pages shall come to the conclusion that this has been written by a fanatical male Muslim to tyrannise and discredit the role of women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In six short, concise chapters Muhammad Shūmān has brought together a collection of authentic ahaadeeth and many <em>Aayaat</em> to aid the Muslimah towards righteousness and advise and encourage her with regards to her husbands rights upon her and how she can attain the pleasure of her Creator by doing so. You may find some of the wording harsh, or even strange, but the fault isn&#8217;t in the text, rather in ourselves due to this society where the &#8216;choices&#8217; are only the western liberal choices and hence we have become accustomed to moulding ourselves in a particular way &#8211; sometimes quite alien from Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our duty above all is to worship Allaah, obedience to Him taking precedence over the rest of creation. If He asks us to do something then that should become an aim we try our hardest to fulfill. With this in mind, when we now approach the issue of marriage then it should be made clear that obedience to one&#8217;s husband is an Islamic duty and hence earns the pleasure of our Lord. It must be pointed out that the author has kept his own words to a minimum and instead has based this book on the Sayings of Allaah and His Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) (with the explanation of some prominent scholars) &#8211; thus the Believer has no choice but to submit to it wholeheartedly. Allaah, the Most High says,</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤْمِنٍ وَلَا مُؤْمِنَةٍ إِذَا قَضَى اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَمْرًا أَن يَكُونَ لَهُمُ الْخِيَرَةُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِمْ ۗ وَمَن يَعْصِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَالًا مُّبِينًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;It is not fitting for any believing man or woman, when Allaah and His Messenger have decreed any matter that they should have any option in their affair, and whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger has strayed in plain error.&#8221;</span> (Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we read this and digest it with a sincere heart and recognise that there isn&#8217;t hardship imposed on the woman and ease for the man, rather that which is mentioned shall only lead to greater comfort, ease and satisfaction for both parties. A marriage which starts on the right footing where the husband and wife identify their own roles and compliment each other according to what is contained in the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah then theirs shall be the marriage in which there is happiness and joy &#8211; success in both worlds, for they have put their entire trust in Allaah, He who knows what benefits and rectifies the servants and what harms and corrupts them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Although the pages are few, the lessons are many and even if we were to act on half of them we would feel an immediate change in ourselves and our homes. It is about time that a book of this nature and dealing with such an important topic has become available to the Muslim women in the west where we are in much need of instruction from the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah so that we can easily reject western models and replace them with the best of examples.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We hope that this book will not be misused by husbands but rather that it will serve as a reminder to them also and a warning that they are not left to their customary conduct in this affair. There is advise and encouragement for the husband to live with his wife in a good and honourable manner, taking care of her &#8211; highlighting that the success and tranquility of the marriage does not just fall upon his wife, rather it is a shared responsibility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah to reward the author for this service and his efforts, and may all the Muslim women who read this try to mould their characteristics upon this noble way and may all the Muslim men help and encourage us towards attaining the rewards and excellence for being a righteous wife.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Author&#8217;s Foreword</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah. We praise Him, we seek His aid and we ask for His forgiveness. We seek Allaah&#8217;s refuge from the evils of ourselves and from our evil actions. Whosoever Allaah guides, there is no one who can misguide him; and whosoever Allaah misguides, there is no one who can guide him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone, who has no partner; and I testify that Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) is His slave and Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This treatise, &#8220;<strong>The Righteous Wife</strong>&#8221; is concise in its wording, important in its subject and valuable for the points of benefit it contains. We ask Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, to make this treatise of benefit to our Muslim sisters, and to all those who read it, and that He makes it a work done purely and sincerely to seek His Face. Indeed He is the one who gives bounteously and generously.</p>

1st Dhul-Qa&#8217;dah 1410H.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Seriousness of the Rights of the Husband</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">الرِّجَالُ قَوَّامُونَ عَلَى النِّسَاءِ بِمَا فَضَّلَ اللَّهُ بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ وَبِمَا أَنفَقُوا مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The men have authority over the women due to the excellence which Allaah has given to the man over the woman, and due to the wealth that they spend upon them.&#8221;</span> [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ibn Katheer </strong></span>says, &#8220;The man is in charge (<em>qayyim</em>) of the woman, i.e. he is the one in-charge of her, her chief, the one having authority over her and the one who corrects her if she inclines away from what is correct.&#8221; [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Abdur-Rahmaan as-Sa&#8217; dee </span></strong>said (regarding the above mentioned <em>Aayah</em>),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;That is due to the excellence of men over women, and the eminence which they have been given over them. So the pre-eminence of the men over the women is from many aspects: holding positions of leadership and authority is particular to men, likewise Prophethood and Messengership. They are also particularised by many acts of worship such as <em>jihaad</em> , the <em>eids</em> and the <em>Jum&#8217;ah</em> prayers. Also due to the characteristics given to them by Allaah, the like of which are not possessed by women such as sound intellect, composure, patience and endurance. Likewise they are particularised with having to spend upon their wives, and indeed spending in many ways which are particular to the men &#8211; which distinguish them from the women. So perhaps this is the reason for His saying:<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> </strong><strong>وَبِمَا أَنفَقُوا</strong> </span> &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;due to the wealth that they spend&#8230;</span>&#8221; &#8211; and exactly what they spend is not stated to indicate that the spending referred to is general. So from all this it is known that the man is like a governor and master for his wife, and she is with him like a captive. So his role is to take care of that which Allaah has placed him in-charge of, and her role is to be obedient to her Lord and to obey her husband.&#8221; [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Al-Qaasimee</span></strong> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">&#8221; <strong>الرِّجَالُ قَوَّامُونَ عَلَى النِّسَاءِ &#8221; </strong></span>&#8216;The men have authority (<em>qawwaamoon</em>) over the women&#8217; [04] &#8211; <em>qawwaamoon</em> is the plural of <em>qawwaam</em>. <em>Qawwaam</em> is the one who is responsible for taking care of their welfare, managing their affairs and disciplining them. That is, they are in-charge of and are to take care of the manners and behaviour of the women; ordering them and forbidding them, just as the ruler is responsible for his subjects. This is due to two reasons: (i) Due to the nature which Allaah gave them, and (ii) due to the role which they carry out.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first is indicated by the Saying of Allaah:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"> بِمَا فَضَّلَ اللَّهُ بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Due to the excellence which Allaah has given to the man over the woman.&#8221;</span> [05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This refers to the relation between the men and women, and means that the men have a position of dominance over them due to the superiority which Allaah has given to the men over the women.&#8221; [06]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَلِلرِّجَالِ عَلَيْهِنَّ دَرَجَةٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Men have a degree over the women.&#8221;</span> [07]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ibn Katheer</strong> </span>said, &#8220;Meaning: in excellence; in the nature given to them; in manners; in status; in the obedience due to them; in their spending and taking care of the (women&#8217;s) welfare; and in excellence in this life and the Hereafter.&#8221; [08]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#808000;"><em>Every soul from the children of Aadam is a master; so the man is the master of his family, and the woman is the mistress of her household</em>.</span> &#8221; [09]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8220;If I were to order anyone to prostrate to other than Allaah, I would have ordered the woman to prostrate to her husband. By Him in whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, the woman will not fulfill the rights of her Lord until she fulfills the rights of her husband; and even if he were to request her for herself (i.e. to have intercourse with her) whilst she was sitting upon a camel&#8217;s saddle </em></span>[10]<span style="color:#808000;"><em>, she should not refuse him.&#8221; </em></span>[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;It is not right that any human being should prostrate to another human being, and if it were right for a human being to prostrate to another human being I would have ordered the woman to prostrate to her husband due to the greatness of his right upon her. By Him in whose Hand is my soul, if from his foot to the crown of his head there was a wound pouring forth pus, and she (the wife) came and licked that, then she would (still) not have fulfilled his right. &#8220;</span></em> [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8220;The right of the husband over the wife is such that if he had a wound, or his nostrils were pouring forth pus or blood, then she were to swallow that down &#8211; then she would (still) not have fulfilled his right.&#8221;</em></span> [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Hurayrah, <em>radiyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, reports that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8220;It is not right for a woman to fast </em></span>[14]<span style="color:#808000;"><em> whilst the husband is present except with his permission; </em></span>[15]<span style="color:#808000;"><em> and whatever wealth she spends in charity without his order, then half of the reward is for him. &#8221; </em></span>[16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Shaykh al-Albaanee </span></strong>said<strong><span style="color:#000000;">,</span></strong> &#8220;Since it is an obligation upon the woman to obey her husband with regard to fulfillment of his desire with her, then it is even more fitting that it is obligatory upon her to obey him with regard to that which is even more important than that &#8211; such as what pertains to bringing up the children, correcting her family and the like &#8211; all such rights and obligations.&#8221; [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr </strong></span>said, &#8220;The hadeeth shows that the right of the husband upon the wife has priority over her performing optional good deeds, since his right is an obligation, and fulfillment of an obligation takes precedence over carrying out something optional.&#8221; [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah</span></strong>, <em>rahimahullaah</em>, was asked about a man who has a wife who fasts during the day and stands in prayer throughout the nights. Whenever he calls her to his bed she refuses and gives precedence to praying in the night and fasting during the day over obedience to the husband. So is this permissible? Shaykhul-Islaam replied, &#8220;That is not permissible for her by agreement of the Muslims. Rather it is obligatory upon her to obey when he calls her to the bed, this is a binding obligation upon her. However standing the night in prayer and fasting during the day is optional, so how can a believing woman give precedence to something optional over an obligation&#8230; and there is no right, after the rights of Allaah and His Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) more binding upon the woman than the rights of the husband.&#8221; [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mu&#8217;aadh ibn Jabal, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;If the woman knew the right of the husband, she would not sit when his morning and evening meals were presented until he finished. &#8220;</span></em> [20]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Encouragement of Obedience to the Husband and Seeking to Please Him</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Hurayrah, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;If a woman prays her five (daily prayers), fast her month (i.e. Ramadaan), guards her private parts, and obeys her husband, it will be said to her, &#8216;Enter Paradise through whichever of the gates of Paradise you wish.'&#8221;</span></em> [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8220;Your women from the people of Paradise are the beloved and fertile, the one who is an asset to her husband, who if her husband becomes angry- comes and places her hand in the hand of her husband and says, &#8216;I will not taste sleep until you are pleased (with me). &#8220;&#8216;</em></span> [22]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Warning Against Causing the Husband to Become Angry, Disobeying His Orders and Neglecting His Rights</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fadaalah ibn &#8216;Ubayd, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8220;There are three who are not to be asked about: </em></span>[23]<span style="color:#808000;"><em> A man who abandon s the Jamaa&#8217;ah </em></span>[24] <span style="color:#808000;"><em>and disobeys his ruler </em></span>[25]<span style="color:#808000;"><em> and dies in a state of disobedience &#8211; so do not ask about him; a female slave or a male slave who flees from his master; and a woman whose husband is away, and he has provided for her worldly needs, yet she adorns and displays herself </em></span>[26] <span style="color:#808000;"><em>and roams around freely</em></span> [27] <span style="color:#808000;"><em>without him &#8211; so do not ask about them. &#8221; </em></span>[28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;"> &#8220;There are three whose prayers will not be raised above their ears: the runaway slave until he returns; a woman who spends the night whilst her husband is angry with her; </span></em>[29]<em><span style="color:#808000;"> and one who leads a people in prayer and they dislike him.</span></em>[30] [31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Allaah will not Look at a woman who does not give thanks to her husband and she cannot do without him. &#8220;</span></em> [32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Hurayrah, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, reports that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;By Him in whose Hand is my soul, there is no man who calls his wife to his bed and she refuses him except that the One who is in the heaven is angry with her until he (her husband) is pleased with her. &#8220;</span></em> [33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;"> &#8220;When a woman spends the night forsaking the bed of her husband, then the angels curse her until she returns. &#8220;</span></em> [34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8220;If a man calls his wife to his bed and she refuses, and he spends the night angry with her, then the angels curse her until morning. &#8220;</em></span> [35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said to a woman, <em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Indeed he is your Paradise and your Fire.&#8221; </span></em>[36] Meaning her husband.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whichever woman obeys Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, with regard to her husband and fulfills his rights, then he will be her Paradise &#8211; meaning he will be a cause for her entering Paradise; and if she is disobedient to her husband &#8211; then the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mu&#8217;aadh ibn Jabal, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;A woman does not harm her husband in this world except that his wife from the large eyed hooris (al-Hoorul &#8216;Een) </span></em>[37]<em><span style="color:#808000;"> says, &#8216;Do not harm him, may Allaah kill you,for he is just a passing guest with you and is about to leave you and come to us.&#8217; &#8220;</span></em>[38]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Excellence of a Righteous Wife</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8216;Amr, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;All of this world is a utility and the best utility is a righteous wife. &#8220;</span></em> [39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa&#8217;d ibn Abee Waqqaas, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Four things are from prosperity: a righteous woman, a spacious dwelling, a righteous neighbour and an agreeable riding beast; and four things are from adversity: an evil neighbour, an evil woman, a bad riding beast and a cramped dwelling. &#8220;</span> </em>[40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thawbaan, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, nararted, &#8220;When revelation was sent down concerning silver and gold, [41] they said, &#8216;So which wealth shall we possess?&#8217; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;I shall find this out for you.&#8217; So he hastened upon his camel and went to the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) and I followed him. So he said, &#8216;O Messenger of Allaah, which wealth shall we possess?&#8217; So he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8216;<em>Let one of you possess a heart which is thankful, a tongue which makes mention of(Allaah), and a believing wife who helps one of you upon the affairs of the Hereafter.</em>&#8216;&#8221;</span> [42]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The righteous wife is the one whom the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) advised should be obtained right from the beginning. As Aboo Hurayrah, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, narrated from the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;A woman is married for four reasons: for her wealth; for her lineage; for her beauty; and for her religion (Deen). So marry the one who is good in her religion (Deen) &#8211; may your hands be covered in dust.&#8221;</span></em> [43]  [44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr said</span></strong>, &#8220;The meaning is that what is fitting for a person upon the religion and of good manners is that the religion should be the aim which he gives importance to in all of his affairs &#8211; particularly those affairs which he will be involved in for a long period of time. So the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) commanded him to obtain a woman who is good in her practice of the religion &#8211; which is the goal that is desired.&#8221; [45]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Attributes of the Righteous Wife</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">1. Devotion and obedience to Allaah, the Most High</span></strong>, such that she fulfills His rights, such as the prayer, fasting, chastity, covering herself, withholding her gaze and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">2. Obedience to her husband</span></strong> in that which does not involve disobedience to Allaah, the Most High, such that she fulfills his rights completely, and fro m them are what has proceeded in the first chapter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">3. That she guards and preserves herself and her honour, in the absence of her husband</span></strong>, from the hand of anyone wishing to touch her, the eye of anyone wishing to look upon her, and the ear of anyone wishing to listen to her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise that she preserves her husband&#8217;s children, home and wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">فَالصَّالِحَاتُ قَانِتَاتٌ حَافِظَاتٌ لِّلْغَيْبِ بِمَا حَفِظَ اللَّهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Therefore the righteous women are obedient to Allaah and their husbands, and guard that which Allaah has ordered them to guard (their chastity and their husbands property) in the absence of their husbands.&#8221;</span> [46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Sa&#8217;dee said, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>فَالصَّالِحَاتُ قَانِتَاتٌ</strong></span> meaning they are obedient to Allaah, the Most High; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>حَافِظَاتٌ لِّلْغَيْبِ</strong></span> meaning they are obedient to their husbands even when the husbands are absent, she guards herself and her husband&#8217;s property.&#8221; [47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;If a woman prays her five (daily prayers), fasts her month (i.e. Ramadaan), guards her private parts, and obeys her husband, it will be said to her, &#8216;Enter Paradise through whichever of the gates of Paradise you wish. &#8216;&#8221;</span></em> [48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">4. Serving her husband.</span> </strong>First of all by carrying out what is required in his house, such as bringing up and educating the children, preparing the meals and the beds and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Husayn ibn Mihsan who said that my paternal aunt said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;I came to Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) for some need, so he asked, &#8216;You there! Are you married?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He then asked, <span style="color:#808000;">&#8216;How are you towards your husband?&#8217;</span> She responded, &#8216;I do not fall short in his service except with regard to what I am unable to do. &#8216; He said, <span style="color:#808000;">&#8216;Then look to your standing with him, for indeed he is your Paradise and your Fire .&#8221;&#8216;</span> </em>[49]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here is an example of how Asmaa&#8217; bint Abee Bakr, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhumaa</em>, served her husband. She said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Az-Zubayr married me and he did not have any property or slaves or anything upon the earth except for a camel which drew water from the well and his horse. So I used to feed his horse, draw the water, stitch his water bucket, and prepare the dough, but I was not proficient in baking bread &#8211; so ladies from the Ansaar who were my neighbours and were honourable used to bake the bread for me. I also used to carry the date-stones upon my head, from the land given to az-Zubayr by Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) &#8211; and it was about two miles away. One day when I was coming with the date-stones on my head, I met Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) and a group of the Ansaar were with him. So he called me and said, &#8216;Ikh, ikh.&#8217; [50] in order to carry me behind him upon the camel. But I felt shy to proceed along with the men, and I thought of az-Zubayr and his sense of jealousy, and he was one of the most jealous of the people. So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) saw my shyness and so passed on. So I came to az-Zubayr and said, &#8216;Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) met me while I was carrying the date stones upon my head and with him were a group of his Companions. He caused his riding camel to kneel, but I felt shy and remembered your sense of jealousy.&#8217; So he said, &#8216;By Allaah your having to carry the date-stones is harder upon me than that you should ride along with him.&#8221;&#8216; She said, &#8220;Then later on Aboo Bakr sent me a servant to look after the horse, so it was as if he had set me free.&#8221; [51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars differ with regard to the ruling about a woman serving her husband. Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah said, &#8220;The scholars differed about whether she has to serve her husband with regard to the like of household bedding, preparing food and drinks, baking the bread, grinding the corn, and providing food for his slaves and cattle &#8211; such as providing fodder for his riding beast and so on. &#8220;Some of them say: It is not obligatory for her to serve him &#8211; and this is a weak saying, like the weakness of the saying that it is not obligatory upon her to live together with him and have intercourse with him! However what is correct is that it is obligatory to serve him, since the husband is her master according to the Book of Allaah, and she is a captive with him according to the Sunnah of the Prophet [52] (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم), and the captive and the slave have to serve &#8211; and this is something known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;the Saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">فَالصَّالِحَاتُ قَانِتَاتٌ حَافِظَاتٌ لِّلْغَيْبِ بِمَا حَفِظَ اللَّهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Therefore the righteous women are obedient to Allaah and their husbands, and guard that which Allaah has ordered them to guard (their chastity and their husbands property) in the absence of their husbands.&#8221;</span> [53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This <em>Aayah</em> shows that it is obligatory upon her to serve her husband unrestrictedly, including: serving him, travelling along with him , making herself available to him, and so on &#8211; just as it is obligatory to obey the parents, since the obedience due from her to the parents transfers to the husband.&#8221; [54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">5. Keeping the husbands secrets.</span></strong> Particularly what occurs between him and her in private &#8211; with regard to sexual matters and the private affairs within the marriage. Disclosing the husbands secrets will hurt him and anger him and this contradicts obedience to him and seeking to please him. Furthermore preserving his secrets is one of the duties of the righteous and obedient women, as described in the Saying of Allaah,</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">حَافِظَاتٌ لِّلْغَيْبِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Guarding that which (Allaah has commanded them to guard) in the absence of their husbands.&#8221;</span> [55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Part of their guarding what they are to guard in the absence of their husbands is that they should not broadcast their secrets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Asmaa&#8217; bint Yazeed, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhaa</em>, who said that she was in the company of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) and men and women were sitting, and he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8220;Perhaps a man mentions that which he did with his wife, and perhaps a woman informs of what she does with her husband?!&#8221; So the people were silent, so I said, &#8220;Yes, by Allaah, O Messenger of Allaah! The women certainly do that, and the men certainly do that.&#8221; He (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said, &#8220;Then do not do so, since that is just like a male devil meeting a female devil upon the way, and he has intercourse with her while the people are watching. &#8220;</em></span> [56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">6. She should appear before the husband in the best appearance</span></strong>, such that if he looks at her it pleases him. Aboo Hurayrah, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, narrates the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) was asked,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Which of the women is the best?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;The one who gives him </span></em>[57]<em><span style="color:#808000;"> pleasure when he looks;</span></em>[58]<em><span style="color:#808000;"> obeys him when he orders; and does not go against his wishes with regard to herself or her wealth by doing that which he dislikes. &#8220;</span></em> [59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">7. She should not spend any of his wealth or her wealth except with his permission.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From &#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8216;Amr ibn al-&#8216; Aas, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, who said that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8221; It is not permissible for a woman to give a gift except with the permission of her husband. &#8220;</span> </em>[60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Albaanee</strong> said, &#8220;However it is not becoming for the husband &#8211; if he is a sincere Muslim &#8211; that he should use this ruling to play the tyrant with his wife and to prevent her from utilizing her wealth in a manner which will not harm either of them. Indeed this right is very similar to the right of the girls guardian &#8211; who is such that she cannot get herself married except with his permission. But if he unjustly prevents her, then the matter is raised to the Islamic judge for justice to be attained. Likewise is the ruling with regard to a woman&#8217;s wealth if her husband oppresses her and prevents her from spending her wealth in a lawful and prescribed manner &#8211; then the judge will also bring about justice for her. So there is no problem with the ruling itself, rather the problem is in how it is misused.&#8221; [61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">8. She should not permit anyone to enter her husbands house except with his permission.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Hurayrah, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, who said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;It is not permissible for a woman to fast when her husband is present except with his permission; nor may she permit anyone to enter his house except with his permission; and whatever she spends in charity without his order &#8211; then half of the reward is for him. &#8220;</span></em> [62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>9. She should not ask her husband for divorce without a reason necessitating that.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Thawbaan, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, who said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Whichever woman asks her husband for divorce without a strong reason &#8211; then the fragrance of Paradise will be forbidden for her. &#8220;</span></em> [63]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">10. Avoidance of cursing.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Sa&#8217;eed al-Khudree, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, said</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em> &#8220;The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) went out to the prayer-ground for the (prayer of) Adhaa or Fitr, and he passed by the women and said, &#8216;O women! Give in charity,for I have been shown that you shall be the majority of the people of the Fire .&#8217; So they asked, &#8216;Why is that, 0 Messenger of Allaah?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;You curse frequently and are ungrateful to your husbands. &#8216;&#8221;</em> </span>[64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">11. Being thankful to the husband for the good he does and for his good treatment of his wife.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is accomplished by good words, and by her obedience to him in what is good, and by not forgetting his good treatment and avoiding denying this, since that is one of the reasons which brings about entry into the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn &#8216;Abbaas, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, who said that the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;I was shown the Fire and found that the majority of its inhabitants were women, due to ingratitude. It was said: &#8220;Is it that they disbelieve in Allaah?&#8221; He said: They are ungrateful to their husbands and deny the good they do. If you were to treat one of them well always, and she then saw something (displeasing) from you she would say: &#8216;I have never seen any good from you. &#8216;&#8221;</span></em> [65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Allaah will not look at a woman who is not thankful to her husband and she cannot do without him.&#8221;</span></em> [66]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">12. She should not remove her clothes outside her husbands house.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Whichever woman removes her clothes in other than her house, then Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, will tear down His cover from her. &#8220;</span> </em>[67]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Manaawee said</strong>, &#8216;&#8221;Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, will tear down His cover from her&#8217; since because she has failed to take care of what she has been commanded with regard to covering herself from strangers, then this is the recompense she receives, the recompense being of the type of the action. What is apparent is that removal of her clothing means uncovering herself to strange males, for the purpose of sexual intercourse or that which leads to it. As opposed to the case if she were to remove her clothes amongst women, whilst covering her private parts, since there is no reason for that to enter into this warning.&#8221; [68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">13. Striving to please the husband by every possible means.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hadeeth has already preceded containing the saying of the righteous wife, &#8220;<strong>&#8230; I will not taste sleep until you are pleased (with me)</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There also occurs in <em>al-Kabaa&#8217;ir</em> of adh-Dhahabee, &#8220;What is obligatory upon the woman is that she seeks the pleasure of her husband, and avoids angering him, and does not refuse him whenever he wants her. The woman must also know that she is like a slave to her husband, so she should not do anything affecting herself or her husbands wealth except with his permission. She should give precedence to his rights over her rights, and the rights of his relatives over the rights of her relatives, and she should keep herself clean and be ready for him to enjoy her. She should not boast at his expense of her beauty, nor rebuke him for any ugliness found in him. The woman must also be always modest and reserved in the presence of her husband, lower her eyes in front of him, obey his commands, remain silent when he speaks, keep far away from everything which angers him, avoid treachery when he is absent, with regard to his bed, his wealth and his house. She should ensure that her aroma is pleasant, be accustomed to using musk and perfume and cleaning her mouth with siwaak. She should be constant in adorning herself in his presence and not when he is absent. She should treat his family and relatives honourably, and consider something small from him as something great.&#8221; [69]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Means to Help the Wife to Attain These Attributes</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowing the greatness and exaltedness of Allaah, the Most High, and that He is the True God, the One who watches over His creation, and that His Religion is the true and straight way, and the laws He had prescribed are the straight path, and to know the perfectness of His Wisdom in whatever He orders and forbids, and whatever He decrees and chooses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore that His knowledge comprehends everything to be known, what is apparent and what is hidden: so He knows what benefits the servants and what harms them. He knows what will rectify them and what will ruin and corrupt them. He, the One free of all imperfections, is also the Most Merciful of all those who show mercy, so He does not order His servants except with that which is good for them in their Religion and their worldly-life, and brings about felicity for them in this world and the Hereafter; and He does not forbid them except from that which will bring misery for them in this world and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whatever He, the One free of all imperfections, has prescribed is a mercy and a blessing; and whoever proceeds upon that way and follows it will be one of those who are happy and successful in both worlds, and will live a fine life filled with happiness and joy, they will not be miserable at all except in those things where they contradict the commandments of their Lord, the Mighty and Majestic. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ عَمِلَ صَالِحًا مِّن ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنثَىٰ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَلَنُحْيِيَنَّهُ حَيَاةً طَيِّبَةً ۖ وَلَنَجْزِيَنَّهُمْ أَجْرَهُم بِأَحْسَنِ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Whoever does a righteous deed, whether male or female, and is a true-Believer, we will give him a good life (by granting him contentment) and we will reward them in the Hereafter in accordance with the best of what they used to do.&#8221;</span> [70]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the One free of all imperfections, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَنْ أَعْرَضَ عَن ذِكْرِي فَإِنَّ لَهُ مَعِيشَةً ضَنكًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And whoever turns away from my reminder, then there is for him a life of hardship and wretchedness.&#8221;</span> [71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the wife is aware of the greatness of Allaah, the Most High, and His perfect wisdom, and His all-encompassing knowledge, and His extensive mercy, then she will strive to obey Him, the Majestic and Most High, and to be obedient to her husband as He has commanded her. She will hasten to fulfill his rights without hesitation or laziness, and she will not say: &#8216;why is it the case that the man is in authority over me?!&#8217; &#8216;why do I have to obey him?!&#8217; &#8216;why &#8230; why?!&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤْمِنٍ وَلَا مُؤْمِنَةٍ إِذَا قَضَى اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَمْرًا أَن يَكُونَ لَهُمُ الْخِيَرَةُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِمْ ۗ وَمَن يَعْصِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَالًا مُّبِينًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;It is not for any believing man or woman, when Allaah and His Messenger have decreed any matter that they should have any option in their affair, and whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger has strayed in plain error.&#8221;</span> [72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the One free of all imperfections, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">فَلَا وَرَبِّكَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ حَتَّىٰ يُحَكِّمُوكَ فِيمَا شَجَرَ بَيْنَهُمْ ثُمَّ لَا يَجِدُوا فِي أَنفُسِهِمْ حَرَجًا مِّمَّا قَضَيْتَ وَيُسَلِّمُوا تَسْلِيمًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;So no, by your Lord, they cannot be Believers until they make you, 0 Muhammad, judge in all disputes between them, then they do not find any opposition in themselves against your judgements, and they accept them with full submission.&#8221;</span> [73]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the means which will help her to attain the attribute of the righteous women is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">• Desire for that which Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, has prepared for the righteous women in Paradise </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The comprehensive good and the huge reward which is such as has been seen by no eye, heard by no ear, nor imagined by any human heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>• Fear of the retribution and Anger of Allaah, the One free of all imperfections and the Most High </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fear of all that He has prepared for the disobedient in the Hereafter with regard to punishment, disgrace, and severe and painful torment, may Allaah save us from that, by His grace and favour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have also already brought two chapters: one in encouragement of looking after the rights of the husband, and the other warning against neglecting his rights.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">• Seeking the Aid of Allaah, the Most High</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since the attainment of the smallest good is not possible unless Allaah, the Most High, guides and sets one straight. Concerning this Allaah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">فَالصَّالِحَاتُ قَانِتَاتٌ حَافِظَاتٌ لِّلْغَيْبِ بِمَا حَفِظَ اللَّهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Therefore the righteous women are obedient to Allaah and their husbands, and guard that which Allaah has ordered them to guard (their chastity and their husbands property) in the absence of their husbands.&#8221;</span> [74]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the meaning of  <strong>بِمَا حَفِظَ اللَّهُ </strong> is:&#8217;by Allaah&#8217;s guarding and protecting them when they become like that.&#8217; This is what at-Tabaree [75] and a group of the scholars of tafseer said.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">From the greatest aids to a wife&#8217;s righteousness is:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>• That she keeps company with righteous and pious women, that she listens to them, and seeks to be like them; and that she avoids the company of corrupt women, and avoids sitting with them and listening to them. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed she should beware of observing their making a display of themselves, and showing their nakedness, and their evil manners, whether this is seen by means of television, video or whatever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;The example of the righteous companion and the evil companion is like that of a seller of musk and the blacksmiths bellows. From the musk seller you will either buy some musk or at least enjoy its good smell. But the bellows of the blacksmith will either burn your house or your clothes, or at least you will receive a bad smell from it. &#8220;</span></em> [76]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>An-Nawawee</strong> <strong>said</strong></span>, &#8220;It shows the excellence of sitting with the righteous, and the people of good, and those possessing good character and fine manners and piety, and the people of knowledge and refinement; and the forbiddence of sitting with the people of evil, and the people of innovation, and those who backbite the people, or those who are commonly involved in shamelessness and idleness, and such reprehensible folk.&#8221; [77]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Ar-Raaghib said</span></strong>, &#8220;This hadeeth indicates that it is a duty upon a person to strive to the utmost of his ability to accompany and sit with good people, since this may cause a bad person to become a person of good, just as accompanying evil people may turn a person from good to bad. So just as it is seen that water and air can be corrupted by being next to a rotting corpse, then what do you think will be the effect upon human souls which are such that they accept and take on the good and the evil which they see?!&#8221; [78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from that which will make it easier for a woman to attain the attributes of the righteous women: is that she should choose a righteous husband, and the woman should straight away reject any proposal of marriage unless they come from a person who is good in his practice of the Religion and his manners, who is such that he will assist her upon the affairs of the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;If there comes to you </span></em>[79] <em><span style="color:#808000;">one </span></em>[80]<em><span style="color:#808000;"> whose character and Religion are pleasing to you, then marry (her) to him; if you do not do so it will result in tribulation upon the earth and widespread corruption.&#8221; </span></em>[81]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Epilogue</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As it is the case that the woman is commanded to be obedient to her husband, and to seek to please him, and to take care of his rights, then it is also the case that the husband is commanded to treat her well, and with kindness, and to have patience with any bad characteristics and the like that may be seen from her. He must give her rights of provision and clothing, and that he lives with her in a good and honourable manner, as Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَعَاشِرُوهُنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And live with them in a good manner.&#8221;</span> [82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#808000;"><em>Take care of the women.</em></span>&#8221; [83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said, &#8220;<em><span style="color:#808000;">The most complete of the Believers are the best of them in manners, and the best of them are those who are best to their women</span></em>.&#8221; [84]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Iyaas ibn &#8216; Abdullaah ibn Abee Dhubaab, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em> , who said that the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8221;Do not beat the female servants of Allaah. So &#8216;Umar came to the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) and said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah! The women have become emboldened towards their husbands. </em></span>[85]<span style="color:#808000;"><em> So he gave permission to strike them, so they were struck. Then many women came to the wives of Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) (complaining about their husbands), so in the morning he said: Seventy women have this night visited the family of Muhammad, each of them complaining about her husband. So you will not find those </em></span>[86] [87]<span style="color:#808000;"><em> men to be the best amongst you.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This concludes what we wished to draw attention to in this brief treatise, which, if Allaah wills, will be beneficial. &#8220;How free and far removed from all imperfections You are, O Allaah, and all praise is for You. I declare You free of all defects and praise You alone. I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but You. I seek Your forgiveness and turn in repentance to You.&#8221; [88]</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>‘THE VIRTUE OF TWO RAK`AHS OF OPTIONAL PRAYER&#8230;’:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From ‘Silsilatul-Ahaadeethis-Saheehah’(no.1388) of Shaikh Muhammad Naasiruddeen al-Albaanee -rahimahullaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Ibn Saa`id reported in his additions to ‘az-Zuhd’ [of Ibn al-Mubaarak] (159/1), from ‘al-Kawaakib, 575, no.31: Indian edn.):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Muhammad ibn Yazeed, Aboo Hishaam ar-Rifaa`ee, narrated to us: Hafs ibn Ghiyaath narrated to us: from Aboo Maalik, and he is Sa`d ibn Taariq al-Ashja`ee: from Aboo Haazim: from Aboo Hurairah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) passed by a grave in which a person had been newly buried, and he said:<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/the-virtue-of-two-rakahs-of-optional-prayer.png"><img data-attachment-id="52312" data-permalink="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/08/13/the-virtue-of-two-rakahs-of-optional-prayer/the-virtue-of-two-rakahs-of-optional-prayer-2/" data-orig-file="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/the-virtue-of-two-rakahs-of-optional-prayer.png" data-orig-size="742,137" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="The Virtue of Two Rakahs of Optional Prayer" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/the-virtue-of-two-rakahs-of-optional-prayer.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/the-virtue-of-two-rakahs-of-optional-prayer.png?w=715" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52312" src="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/the-virtue-of-two-rakahs-of-optional-prayer.png?w=715" alt=""   srcset="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/the-virtue-of-two-rakahs-of-optional-prayer.png?w=550&amp;h=102 550w, https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/the-virtue-of-two-rakahs-of-optional-prayer.png?w=100&amp;h=18 100w, https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/the-virtue-of-two-rakahs-of-optional-prayer.png?w=300&amp;h=55 300w, https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/the-virtue-of-two-rakahs-of-optional-prayer.png 742w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Two light rak`ahs, which you would regard as being something slight, and which you pray as something extra; if he- and he pointed to his grave- were able to add them to his deeds it would be more beloved to him than </strong>(having)<strong> everything in your world</strong></span>. &gt;&gt;’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaanee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Ibn Saa`id said: ‘It is a hadeeth with a singular chain which is <em>hasan</em>.’ I say: Its narrators are reliable, all of them are narrators of Muslim, except that this narrator ar-Rifaa`ee has been spoken against by some of them. al-Haafiz said: ‘He is not strong&#8230;al-Bukhaaree said: I saw them being united upon his being weak.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: However he is not alone in reporting it, since Aboo Nu`aym reported it in ‘Akhbaar Asbahaan’ (2/225), and likewise at-Tabaraanee in ‘al-Awsat’ (no.907), through two other chains of narration from Hafs ibn Ghiyaath that he narrated it to us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: And this is a chain of narration saheeh to the standard of Muslim, so the hadeeth is Saheeh through this chain, and all praise is for Allaah. And al-Mundhiree said in ‘at-Targheeb’ (1/146): ‘at-Tabaraanee reported it with a hasan chain’, and al-Haythamee said: ‘Its narrators are reliable’.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>AL-HASAN IBN ABIL HASAN AL-BASREE</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Abridged from ‘Siyar A`laamin Nubalaa·’ of Imaam adh-Dhahabee)<br />
Translated by Abu Talha Dawud Burbank <em>rahimahullaah</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“al-Hasan ibn Abil-Hasan Yasaar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Imaam, Shaikhul-Islaam, Aboo Sa`eed al-Basree. It is said that he used to be a <em>mawlaa</em> (slave) belonging to Zayd ibn Thaabit, and it is said: a slave belonging to Jameel ibn Qutbah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His mother was Khayrah, the slave-girl of Umm Salamah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He grew up in al-Madeenah; and memorized the Qur·aan in the Khilaafah of `Uthmaan, and heard him give the Khutbah many times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the day of the killing of `Uthmaan he was fourteen years old.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he grew older and was constant upon Jihaad, and constant upon knowledge and action. He was one of the courageous folk who were mentioned for that…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the rule of Mu`aawiyah he was a scribe for the governor of Khuraasaan &#8211; ar-Rabee` ibn Ziyaad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He narrated from `Uthmaan, `Imraan ibn Husayn, al-Mugheerah ibn Shu`bah, `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Samurah, Samurah ibn Jundub, Jundub al- Bajalee, Ibn `Abbaas, Ibn `Umar, Aboo Bakrah, `Amr ibn Taghlib, Jaabir, and many others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who narrated from him include: Qataadah, Ayyoob (as- Sakhtiyaanee), Ibn `Awn, Yoonus (ibn `Ubayd), Khaalid al-Hadhdhaa·, Hishaam ibn Hassaan, Humayd at-Taweel, Jareer ibn Haazim, Shaybaan an- Nahawee, Yazeed ibn Ibraaheem at-Tusturee, Mubaarak ibn Fadaalah, ar- Rabee` ibn Sabeeh, Abaan ibn Yazeed al-`Attars, Qurrah ibn Khaalid, and many others besides them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Sa`d said: “<strong>He was a comprehensive scholar, lofty, reliable a proof, trustworthy, a worshipper, one who performed frequent acts of worship and sacrifice. He was abundant in knowledge; spoke eloquently, and was handsome</strong>”…, until he said: “He is not a proof in those narrations which he narrated in ‘<em>mursal</em>’ form, and he was a ‘<em>mudallis</em>’. So when he says ‘From..’ with regard to those he did not meet, then he is not taken as proof.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He sometimes performed ‘<em>tadlees</em>’ from those he had met, omitting the intermediary between himself and them, and Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However he was a great memorizer, a great scholar; from the oceans of knowledge; a jurist concerning the soul; of tremendous status; having no equal. His reminders were beautiful. His admonitions were eloquent and penetrating. He was a chief in the various types of good; and I have written a biography for him in a single volume which I have entitled <em>‘az-Zukhruful- Qasriyy</em>’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He died in the year 110 H at the age of 88 &#8211;<em>rahimahullaahu ta`aalaa</em>.” [‘Tadhkiratul-Huffaaz’: (1/71-72)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His father Yasaar was a slave taken captive in Maysaan [North of Basrah, in Southern Iraaq]. He settled in al-Madeenah, and was set free, and married.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Hasan was born two years before the end of the Khilaafah of `Umar and he grew up in Waadee al-Quraa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">adh-Dhahabee said: “<strong>He was the noblest of the people of his time, in knowledge and action</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mu`tamir ibn Sulaymaan said: My father used to say: “<strong>al-Hasan is the Shaikh of the people of Basrah</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He learned the recitation of the Qur·aan from Hittaan ibn `Abdillaah ar- Raqaashee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">adh-Dhahabee said: “<strong>He was a man who was of perfect build. His form was fine, and he was handsome; and he was described as being one of those who were courageous.</strong>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Burdah said: “I did not see anyone who more closely resembled the Companions of Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) than him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Humayd ibn Hilaal said: Aboo Qataadah said to us: “Adhere to this Shaikh, for I have not seen anyone closer in opinion to `Umar than him &#8211; meaning al-Hasan.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jurthoomah said: “I saw al-Hasan dyeing his beard yellow every Jumu`ah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qataadah said: “I never compared the knowledge of al-Hasan to that of anyone from the scholars except that I found him having superiority over him; except that if anything was problematic for him he would write to Sa`eed ibn al-Musayyib, asking him about it; and I never sat with a jurist except that I saw the superiority of al-Hasan.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Humayd and Yoonus said: “We did not see anyone more perfect in behavior than al-Hasan.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yoonus ibn `Ubayd said: “I have not seen anyone whose speech more closely matches his actions than al-Hasan.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ar-Rabee` ibn Anas said: “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I used to go to al-Hasan for ten years, or as Allaah wished, and there was not a single day except that I would hear from him something which I had not heard before</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hawshab narrated from al-Hasan that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“O son of Aadam! By Allaah! If you recite the Qur·aan and then truly believe in it, then your grief in this world will be lengthened, your fear in this world will become severe, and your weeping in this world will be plentiful.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘Siyar A`laamin-Nubalaa·’ (4/563-588)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zaa·idah ibn Qudaamah: from Hishaam ibn Hassaan: al-Hasan said: “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>When a man used to seek knowledge, then (its effect) would soon be seen upon what he looked at, upon his humility and submission, upon his tongue, upon his ties of kinship, and upon his avoidance of the unnecessary things of the world (<em>zuhd</em>)</strong></span>.” He said: “And al-Hasan used to say: “<strong><span style="color:#000000;">Do not sit with the people of the innovated sects (<em>Ahwaa</em>·); do not debate with them; and do not listen to anything from them</span>.</strong>”</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>MUJAAHID IBN JABR</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Mujaahid ibn Jabr, the Imaam. Abul-Hajjaaj al-Makhzoomee &#8211; their mawlaa (freed-slave), al- Makkee, the reciter, the Mufassir, al-Haafiz. The slave belonging to as-Saa·ib ibn Abis-Saa·ib al-Makhzoomee. He learned from Sa`d, `Aa·ishah, Aboo Hurairah, Umm Haani·, `Abdullaah ibn `Umar, and Ibn `Abbaas and he closely accompanied him for some time, and he learnt the reading of the Qur·aan from him and Tafseer and Fiqh. He was one of the stores of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who narrated from him included `Ikrimah, Taawoos, and `Ataa· &#8211; and they were his contemporaries; and `Amr ibn Deenar, Abuz-Zubayr, alHakam ibn `Utaybah, Ibn Abee Najeeh, Mansoor ibn al-Mu`tamir, Sulaymaan ibn A`mash, Ayyoob as-Sakhtiyaanee, Ibn `Awn, `Umar ibn Dharr, Ma`roof ibn Mushkaan, Qataadah ibn Di`aamah, al-Fadl ibn Maymoon, Ibraaheem ibn Muhaajir, Humayd al-A`raj, Bukayr ibn alAkhnas, al-Hasan al-Fuqaymee, Khusayf, Sulaymaan al-Ahwal, Sayf ibn Sulaymaan, `Abdul-Kareem al-Jazaree, Aboo Haseen, al-`Awwaam ibn Hawshab, Fitr ibn Khaleefah, an-Nadr ibn `Arabee, and many others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A group learned the recitation from him, including <strong>Ibn Katheer</strong> ad-Daaree, Aboo `Amr ibn al-`Alaa·, and Ibn Muhaysin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujaahid said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I read the entire Qur·aan to Ibn `Abbaas three times, stopping at each Aayah and asking what it was sent down concerning and how it was.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qataadah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The most knowledgeable one remaining with regard to tafseer is Mujaahid.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Juraij said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“To have learned from Mujaahid would have been more beloved to me than my family and my wealth.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khusayf said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The most knowledgeable of them concerning tafseer is Mujaahid.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyaan ath-Thawree said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Take Tafseer from four: Mujaahid, Sa`eed ibn Jubayr, `Ikrimah, and ad-Dahhaak.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">adh-Dhahabee said: It is said that he settled in Koofah at the end of his life, and he used to frequently travel and move about.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-A`mash said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“When I used to see Mujaahid I would think little of him; he would be wearing worn-out clothing, as if he were a mule-driver who had lost his donkey and was concerned about it; but when he spoke, pearls [[of wisdom]] came out from his mouth.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…A number of people said: he died in the year 103 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Waaqidee narrated from Ibn Jurayj that he said: “He reached the age of eighty three.”…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ya`laa ibn `Ubayd: from al-A`mash: from Mujaahid that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I do not know which of the two favours is greater: that He guided me to Islaam, or that He saved me from these innovated sects.”</strong></span> [adh-Dhahabee said: Such as those of the Raafidah, the Qadariyyah, and the Jahmiyyah.”]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahyaa ibn Sulaym said: `Abdul-Wahhaab ibn Mujaahid narrated to us, saying: I was with my father when his son Ya`qoob came and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘O my father, we have companions who claim that Eemaan of the inhabitants of the heavens and the inhabitants of the earth is one (and the same.) So he said: “O my son, those people are not my companions. Allaah does not make a person who is drowned in sins just like a person who has no sin.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Nu`aym said: Mujaahid died whilst prostrating in the year 102 H…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hibbaan said: “He died in Makkah in the year 102 or 103 H in prostration having been born in the year 21 H in the Khilaafah of `Umar.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyaan ath-Thawree said: “<strong><span style="color:#000000;">If tafseer comes to you from Mujaahid then that is enough for you</span></strong>.” Therefore his tafseer was relied upon by ash-Shaafi`ee, al-Bukhaaree and others from the people of knowledge, and likewise by Imaam Ahmad and others who complied works of tafseer: they repeatedly bring chains of narration from Mujaahid; more often than from anyone besides him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘Tahdheebut-Tahdheeb’, ‘Majmoo`ul-Fataawaa’ (13/332), ‘Siyar A`laamin-Nubalaa·’ (4/449-457), ‘Tadhkiratul-Huffaaz’ (1/92)]]</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Great Importance Given to the <em>’Aqeedah</em> in the Madinan Period</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  and his Companions migrated to al-Madeenah, and the Islamic state was established through the efforts of the <em>Muhaajirs</em> and the <em>Ansaar</em>, and upon the foundation of <em>tawheed</em>, then the greatest importance continued to be given to <em>tawheed</em>. The <em>Aayaat</em> of the Qur&#8217;aan continued to be sent down with it, and the directions and the orders of the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  revolved around it.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  did not suffice even with all this. Rather he used to take pledge of allegiance from the greater Companions, not to mention the others, upon it from time to time. Whenever the opportunity arose, he would take their pledge of allegiance upon it. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ إِذَا جَاءَكَ الْمُؤْمِنَاتُ يُبَايِعْنَكَ عَلَىٰ أَن لَّا يُشْرِكْنَ بِاللَّهِ شَيْئًا وَلَا يَسْرِقْنَ وَلَا يَزْنِينَ وَلَا يَقْتُلْنَ أَوْلَادَهُنَّ وَلَا يَأْتِينَ بِبُهْتَانٍ يَفْتَرِينَهُ بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِنَّ وَأَرْجُلِهِنَّ وَلَا يَعْصِينَكَ فِي مَعْرُوفٍ ۙ فَبَايِعْهُنَّ وَاسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُنَّ اللَّهَ ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<span style="color:#008000;">When the Believing women come to give you their pledge that they will not associate anything in worship with Allaah; nor steal; nor commit fornication; nor kill their children; nor attribute to their husbands children which are not theirs; nor disobey you, O Muhammad </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(</span><span style="color:#008000;">صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, in that which is good and commanded by Allaah; </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(and not wail over the dead)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, then accept their pledge and ask Allaah to forgive them. Indeed Allaah forgives those who repent to Him and is Most Merciful to them.</span>”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]  </a>Soorah al-Mumtahinah (60):12</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though this <em>Aayah</em> is with regard to the women’s pledge, Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  also used to take pledge from the men upon its contents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From ’Ubaadah ibn as-Saamit, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“Allaah’s Messenger (</em><em>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</em><em>) was in an assembly (of his Companions) and said, ‘Swear allegiance to me with the pledge that you will not associate anything in worship with Allaah, and that you will not steal, nor commit fornication, nor kill your children, (and upon the Aayah which was taken as a pledge from the women [60:12]). So whoever fulfills this pledge from you, then he will be rewarded by Allaah. And whoever falls into sin with any of that and is punished for it, then it is an expiation for it. And whoever falls into any of these sins and Allaah conceals his sin, then it is up to Allaah: if He wills He may forgive him, and if He wills He may punish him.’” </em><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also Ibn Katheer quotes a large number of <em>ahaadeeth</em> that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  used to take pledge from the women upon that which this <em>Aayah</em> contains.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> From these <em>ahaadeeth</em> is that of ’Aa’ishah; the <em>hadeeth </em>of Umayyah bint Ruqayqah;<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> the <em>hadeeth</em> of Umm ’Atiyyah;<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> the <em>hadeeth</em> of Salmaa bint Qays, one of the maternal aunts of the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) ;<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6)</a> and the <em>hadeeth </em>of Raa’itah bint Sufyaan al-Khuzaa’iyyah.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> Then he (i.e. Ibn Katheer) said, “<strong>And Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  used to take this pledge from the women repeatedly</strong>.” Then he quoted the <em>hadeeth</em> of Ibn ’Abbaas,<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> and other <em>ahaadeeth</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also used to take this pledge repeatedly from the men. This is indicated by the <em>hadeeth</em> of ’Ubaadah ibn as-Saamit which has preceded, and also by the <em>hadeeth</em> of ’Auf ibn Maalik al-Ashja’ee, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“We were with Allaah’s Messenger (</em><em>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</em><em>)  and numbered nine, eight or seven people, so he said, ‘Will you not give your pledge to Allaah’s Messenger?’ So we said, ‘We have already given you our pledge, O Messenger of Allaah!’ Then he said, ‘Will you not give your pledge to Allaah’s Messenger?’ So we stretched out our hands and said, ‘We will indeed give you our pledge, O Messenger of Allaah, but what will our pledge be?’ He said, ‘That you will worship Allaah and not worship anything else besides Him; the five obligatory Prayers; that you obey (and he said a word quietly); and that you do not ask the people for anything.’ So I have as a result seen some of those people, their whip would fall down from their hand (while riding) and he would not ask anyone to pick it up for him.” </em><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) He (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  used to send callers, teachers, judges and governors, to kings and tyrants, and to various areas, calling to <em>tawheed</em>. From Anas, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhu, </em>the servant of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) ,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Prophet of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  sent letters to Kisraa (Chosroes), and Caesar, and the Najaashee (Negus) and to every tyrant ruler calling them to Allaah. And this Negus was not the one whom the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  prayed Funeral Prayer for.”<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This point is shown very clearly by the text of his letter to the Caesar, and that his purpose was to call to <em>tawheed</em>. Its text is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“In the Name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Muhammad, the Slave of Allaah and His Messenger, to Hiraql, the Emperor of the Byzantines.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Peace and safety are for those who follow the Guidance. To proceed. I invite you with the call of Islaam. Accept Islaam and you will be safe, and Allaah will grant you a double reward. But if you turn your back upon it, then you will carry the burdens of the sins of your subjects.”<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said, “Whoever calls to guidance then there is for him a reward similar to the reward of those who follow him, nothing being reduced from their reward. And whoever calls to misguidance, then there is a burden of sin upon him similar to the sin of those who follow him, nothing being reduced from their sins.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O People of the Book, come to a word of justice between us, that we will single Allaah out with all worship and will not worship anything besides Him and disassociate ourselves from everything that is worshipped besides Him. Nor will we take one another as lords besides Allaah by obeying one another in that which involves disobedience to Allaah. So if they turn away, then say, ‘Bear witness that we are Muslims, submitting to Allaah and making our worship purely and sincerely for Him and not worshipping anything else besides Him.’”</strong><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the letter reached the Caesar he sent for Aboo Sufyaan ibn Harb and some riders of Quraysh. They were at that time trading in the area of Palestine/Syria, and were within the time of the truce period agreed between Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  and the unbelievers of Quraysh. So they came to Caesar at Jerusalem and he asked Aboo Sufyaan a number of questions. From them was that he asked, “What does he (i.e. Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) ) command you?” Aboo Sufyaan said, “I replied, ‘He says, “<em>Worship Allaah alone and do not worship anything else besides Him and abandon the saying of your fathers. He orders prayer, truthfulness, chastity and joining ties of relationship</em>.”’”<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) Furthermore he used to organise armies to fight <em>Jihaad</em> in the path of Allaah in order to establish and raise high the word of <em>tawheed</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He who fights in order that Allaah’s Word is the highest then he is the one who is fighting in the Path of Allaah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Buraydah ibn al-Husayyib, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhu</em>, who said, “When Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  appointed the chief of a raiding party or an army, he used to counsel him to have taqwaa of Allaah concerning himself and with regard to good treatment of the Muslims with him, and he said, ‘When you meet your enemy from the mushriks then call them to accept one of three things, whichever of them they agree to, then accept it and leave them alone:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) Invite them to accept Islaam. If they accept that then accept it from them, and leave them alone. Invite them in that case to leave their homes and to migrate to the land of the Muhaajirs&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) But if they refuse (to accept Islaam), then ask them to pay the <em>jizya</em> tax. If they agree to that then accept that from them and leave them alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(iii) But if they refuse then seek the aid of Allaah and fight them. And if you besiege a fortified place and they ask you to allow them to surrender upon the judgement of Allaah, then do not allow them to surrender upon that since you do not know what Allaah’s judgement concerning them is. Rather allow them to surrender in accordance with what you judge in the matter. Then decide as you wish concerning them.’”<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like the <em>hadeeth</em> of Buraydah is the <em>hadeeth</em> of an-Nu’maan ibn Muqarrin al-Muzanee, <em>radiyallaahu</em> <em>’anhu, </em>which is indicated by Muslim, Aboo Daawood and Ibn Maajah, who all said, “’Alqamah said: I narrated it to Muqaatil ibn Hayyaan. He said: Muslim ibn Haysam narrated to me, from an-Nu&#8217;maan ibn Muqarrin from the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  with its like.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4) Furthermore he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  sent Mu’aadh to Yemen as a Governor, a judge and a teacher. Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said to him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“You are a going to a people from the People of the Book, so let the first thing you call them to be the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, (and in a narration: that they should single Allaah out with all worship), and I am the Messenger of Allaah. So if they obey you in that, then inform them that Allaah has made five Prayers obligatory upon them in each day and night. So if they obey you in that, then inform them that Allaah has obligated upon them a charity which is to be taken from their rich and given to their poor. If they obey you in that, then beware of taking the best parts of their wealth, and beware of the supplication of the oppressed, because there is no screen between it and Allaah.”</em><a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that he used to give this same advice to all the callers, governors and judges whom he sent out.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5) <em>Jihaad </em>was prescribed for the establishment of <em>tawheed</em> and to purify the earth from the scourge of <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَاتِلُوهُمْ حَتَّىٰ لَا تَكُونَ فِتْنَةٌ وَيَكُونَ الدِّينُ لِلَّهِ ۖ فَإِنِ انتَهَوْا فَلَا عُدْوَانَ إِلَّا عَلَى الظَّالِمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Fight the <em>Mushriks</em> until there remains no worship of anything besides Allaah, and all worship is for Allaah alone and His religion is uppermost. So if they desist from <em>shirk</em> and enter into Islaam then let there be no transgression except those that worship others along with Allaah”</span> </strong><a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>  [Soorah al-Baqarah (2):193]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jareer (at-Tabaree),<em> rahimahullaah</em>, said in his <em>Tafseer</em> (2/194-195):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah, the Most High, says to His Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم),  Meaning: &#8220;so that there is no <em>shirk</em> with Allaah, and no one besides Him is worshipped; and worship of the idols, false gods and those set up as rivals is extinguished. And worship and obedience is for Allaah alone to the exclusion of idols and images&#8230; Qataadah said, ‘So that there is no <em>shirk</em>.’ He quotes his chain of narration with this explanation from Qataadah, Mujaahid, as-Suddee and Ibn &#8216;Abbaas. He said, ‘What is meant by <em>Deen </em>(religion) which Allaah mentions in this place is: Worship and obedience to Allaah in what He orders and forbids.’ He said, ‘With this meaning there occurs the saying of al-A’shee: He caused the (tribes of) ar-Ribaab to submit and become obedient when they hated obedience &#8211; Achieving it through continual fighting and attacks.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he quoted his chain of narration of ar-Rabee’ who said concerning,  Meaning: “Until none but Allaah is worshipped,” which is the meaning of <em>laa ilaaha illallaah</em> (none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah). That is what Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  fought for and called to.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Hurayrah, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“I have been ordered to fight the people until they say laa ilaaha illallaah (none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah). So whoever says: laa ilaaha illallaah, then his wealth and his person is safe from me, except due to any right of it, and his reckoning is with Allaah.”</em><a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also the Chief of the Believers &#8216;Umar, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>said to Aboo Bakr, the <em>Khaleefah</em> of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) , when he resolved to fight the apostates and also those with them who refused to hand over the <em>zakaat</em>, ’Umar, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>said, “How can you fight those people when Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said, ‘I have been ordered to fight the people until they testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, so whoever says this then his wealth and his person are safe from me except due to any right of it, and his reckoning is with Allaah.’” So Aboo Bakr, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>said, “By Allaah, I will fight those who seek to separate between the Prayer and the <em>zakaat</em>. Indeed the <em>Zakaat</em> is a right due upon wealth. By Allaah, were they to hold a single young goat from me which they used to pay to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) , I would fight them for it.”<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Jaabir ibn ’Abdillaah, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhumaa, </em>who said that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“I have been ordered to fight the people until they say, ‘None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah.’ So when they say that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah then their blood and their property are safe from me except due to a right pertaining to it, and their reckoning is with Allaah.” </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he recited,<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَذَكِّرْ إِنَّمَا أَنتَ مُذَكِّرٌ  لَّسْتَ عَلَيْهِم بِمُصَيْطِرٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">Indeed We have only sent you, O Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم), as an admonisher to them. You are not to force them to believe against their will</span>.”  [Soorah al-Ghaashiyah (88):21-22] <a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>, <a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn &#8216;Umar, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhumaa, </em>who said that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“I have been ordered to fight the people until they bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and they establish the Prayer, and pay the zakaat. So if they do that then their blood and their wealth are safe from me except due to its right, and their reckoning is with Allaah.”</em><a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it may be noticed that the <em>ahaadeeth</em> of ’Umar, Aboo Bakr, Aboo Hurayrah and Jaabir are restricted to mentioning the matter of <em>tawheed</em> and do not mention the other matters. So perhaps the reason for this is the very great concern which the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  gave to this matter so that he would mention it to them time after time on its own, as an indication of its greatness and importance. Also because of the fact that he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  realised that they understood that all the other affairs of Islaam follow on from it, and are required by it and are from its rights, particularly the pillars of Islaam and <em>eemaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say, because of the fact that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  often used to mention only that which related to <em>‘aqeedah</em>, &#8216;Umar used this saying as an evidence. Then the reply of Aboo Bakr to support his stance, was to make a direct analogy between the <em>Zakaat</em> and the Prayer, “By Allaah, I will fight anyone who makes a difference between the Prayer and the <em>Zakaat</em>&#8230;” So if he knew the narration as it was reported by Ibn ’Umar he would have used that as a clear and decisive proof.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also if ’Umar knew of the narration as reported by his son he would not have raised any objection to the saying of Aboo Bakr. Then if those present at the time, included Aboo Hurayrah, knew the naration of Ibn ’Umar, then they would have mentioned it to the two <em>Shaykhs</em>.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a> So perhaps the reason behind this was indeed as we have said, the great importance which the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  gave to <em>’aqeedah</em>, and his propogation of it, and the frequency with which he spoke about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then also because the most prominent and most important aspect of the teachings which the Prophets conveyed from their Lord was <em>Tawheedul-Uloohiyyah</em> (singling out Allaah with all worship), and this was the greatest reason for strife between the Prophets and their enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore the most significant of the aspects of falsehood and misguidance, against which the Prophets (<em>’alayhimus-salaatu was-salaam</em>) fought, and which the <em>Mushriks</em> who denied the truth of their message furiously fought to defend, in every nation was: the worship of images and idols, and the building of tombs upon the graves of the pious and the Prophets, and veneration of them, and making offerings to them, and attachment of people’s hearts to them, both of the rulers and the ruled, an attachment of hope and fear, desiring and anticipating that they would intercede for them with Allaah, enabling the accomplishment of their wishes. This was indeed major <em>shirk</em> which will not be forgiven, so we must mention, along with that which we have already quoted whilst speaking about the methodology of the Prophets, particularly when we spoke concerning Ibraaheem, the <em>Imaam</em> of the Pious and the destroyer of the worthless idols, something about the full scale war which Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  waged against major <em>shirk</em> which was seen in his smashing the idols physically and by blocking up all the ways which Satan uses to lead his followers to worshipping them and taking them as rivals to Allaah, by using the terms ‘gods’ or <em>awliyaa</em>&#8216; (pious ones beloved to Allaah) or hiding beneath any of the misleading titles they use.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from this war which is clearly seen in the Qur&#8217;aan and was waged by the Messenger of the One Who sent the Qur&#8217;aan, is the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَفَرَأَيْتُمُ اللَّاتَ وَالْعُزَّىٰ  وَمَنَاةَ الثَّالِثَةَ الْأُخْرَىٰ  أَلَكُمُ الذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ الْأُنثَىٰ  تِلْكَ إِذًا قِسْمَةٌ ضِيزَىٰ  إِنْ هِيَ إِلَّا أَسْمَاءٌ سَمَّيْتُمُوهَا أَنتُمْ وَآبَاؤُكُم مَّا أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ بِهَا مِن سُلْطَانٍ ۚ إِن يَتَّبِعُونَ إِلَّا الظَّنَّ وَمَا تَهْوَى الْأَنفُسُ ۖ وَلَقَدْ جَاءَهُم مِّن رَّبِّهِمُ الْهُدَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Have you seen, O <em>Mushriks</em>, (the idols:) <em>al-Laat</em>, <em>al-’Uzzaa, </em>and the other one <em>Manaat</em>, the third of them</strong></span>.<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> You prefer and love the male offspring for yourselves and then falsely attribute daughters, which is something you hate for yourselves, to Allaah. This is indeed an unjust division. Rather these idols are mere names which you <em>Mushriks</em> and your forefathers have invented. Allaah has sent down no proof for that. Rather they follow only conjecture and their own deisres, even though clear guidance has come to them from their Lord proving the futility of worshipping these idols and that worship is the right of Allaah alone.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24"><span style="color:#008000;">[24]</span></a><span style="color:#008000;"> </span>[Soorah an-Najm (53):19-23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a clear statement of contempt for the idols which they worshipped, and war against them. Also, Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ذَٰلِكَ وَمَن يُعَظِّمْ حُرُمَاتِ اللَّهِ فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّهُ عِندَ رَبِّهِ ۗ وَأُحِلَّتْ لَكُمُ الْأَنْعَامُ إِلَّا مَا يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ ۖ فَاجْتَنِبُوا الرِّجْسَ مِنَ الْأَوْثَانِ وَاجْتَنِبُوا قَوْلَ الزُّورِ  حُنَفَاءَ لِلَّهِ غَيْرَ مُشْرِكِينَ بِهِ ۚ وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَكَأَنَّمَا خَرَّ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ فَتَخْطَفُهُ الطَّيْرُ أَوْ تَهْوِي بِهِ الرِّيحُ فِي مَكَانٍ سَحِيقٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“So shun the filth of worshipping idols and shun false speech. Worshipping Allaah alone in <em>tawheed</em> making worship purely for Him, and not worshipping anything besides Him. And whoever worships anything else along with Allaah, then he is like one who fell down from the sky and was ripped to pieces by the birds, or like one cast by the wind in a far distant place.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a> [Soorah al-Hajj (22):30-31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِنَّمَا الْخَمْرُ وَالْمَيْسِرُ وَالْأَنصَابُ وَالْأَزْلَامُ رِجْسٌ مِّنْ عَمَلِ الشَّيْطَانِ فَاجْتَنِبُوهُ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who believe, intoxicants, gambling, stone altars erected for sacrifice and divining-arrows are an abomination from the handiwork of Satan. So shun all of that so that you may be successful.”</span> </strong><a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a> [ Soorah al-Maa’idah (5):90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from ’Amr ibn ’Abasah, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhu, </em>and his <em>hadeeth</em> has preceded, and in it there occurs, <em>“I said, ‘Did Allaah send you as a Messenger?’ He said, ‘Yes,’ I asked, ‘With what message did he send you?’ He replied, ‘That Allaah should be singled out and worshipped in tawheed, and that nothing should be worshipped besides Him, and to smash the idols and to join ties of relationship.’”</em><a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in the <em>hadeeth </em>of Ja’far which has preceded there occurs, “&#8230;until Allaah sent a Messenger to us from amongst us. We knew his lineage and his truthfulness and his chastity. He called us to single out Allaah in <em>tawheed</em> and to worship Him alone, and to renounce the stones and idols and whatever we and our fathers used to worship besides Him&#8230;”<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the <em>hadeeth </em>of Aboo Sufyaan and his conversation with Heraclius, the King of the Byzantines, there occurs, “He says, (i.e., the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) ), <em>‘Worship Allaah alone and do not worship anything along with Him, and renounce what the forefathers say&#8230;’”</em><a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the <em>hadeeth</em> of Aboo Umaamah, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>there occurs, <em>“Indeed Allaah sent me as a mercy for the worlds, and as a guide for the worlds, and my Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, ordered me to destroy all musical instruments and flutes, and idols and the cross, and such things from the days of Ignorance&#8230;”</em><a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the leaders of Quraysh went out of their minds in anger, unable to put up with the attack of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  against their idols, whether it was concerning the Qur&#8217;aan sent down to him, or his <em>da’wah</em> in secret, or his <em>da’wah</em> in the open. This was something about which there could be no indulgence, and it was something which had to be due to his true and sincere call.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn ’Abbaas, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhumaa,</em> who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“When Aboo Taalib became ill a group of Quraysh entered upon him, amongst them Aboo Jahl, and they said, ‘The son of your brother abuses our gods, and does such and such, and says such and such. So if only you were to send a message forbidding him.’ So he sent a message and the Prophet (</em><em>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</em><em> )   came and entered the house&#8230; Aboo Taalib said to him, ‘O son of my brother! Why is it that your people complain about you? They claim that you abuse their idols and say such and such?!’ They spoke a great deal against him, and Allaah’s Messenger (</em><em>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</em><em> )   spoke and said, ‘O Uncle! I only desire that they should say a single phrase which if they say it, then the Arabs will become obedient to them and the non-Arabs will pay the Jizyah tax to them.’ So they were very surprised at what he said and they said, ‘A single phrase? Yes, by your father, even ten.’ So they asked, ‘And what is it?’ Aboo Taalib said, ‘And which saying is it, O son of my brother?’ So he (</em><em>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</em><em> )   said, ‘None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah.’ So they stood up, shaking their clothes saying, ‘Does he declare that worship should be for a single God?! this is something bizarre.’”</em><a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from Jaabir, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Quraysh gathered together one day and said, ‘See who is the most knowledgeable of you with regard to sorcery, divining and poetry, then let him go to this man who splits our united body, causes schism between us and abuses our religion. So let him speak to him and see how best to reply to him.’ So they said, ‘We do not know anyone but ’Utbah ibn Rabee’ah.’ So they said, ‘Then it is to be you O Abul-Waleed.’ So ’Utbah went to him and said, ‘O Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) ! Are you better or ’Abdullaah?’<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a> Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  remained silent. ‘Are you better or ’Abdul-Muttalib?’<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a> Again Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  remained silent. So he said, ‘If you claim that they are better than you, then they certainly worshipped the idols which you abuse. If however you claim that you are better than them, then speak so that we may hear what you have to say. Indeed we have never seen a youngster who has boded evil for his people more so than yourself. You have split our unity and caused schism in our affair, and you have abused our religion and shamed us in front of the Arabs. It has spread amongst them that there is a sorceror within Quraysh, and a diviner within Quraysh. By Allaah we do not expect that we will have to wait for the time it takes a new-born to cry out before we will fight amongst oursleves with swords and wipe oursleves out. O man, if it is poverty that is your problem, then we will gather wealth for you until you will be the richest man of Quraysh. If it is that you have a need to marry, then choose whichever of the women of Quraysh you like and we will marry you ten of them.’ So Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said, ‘Have you finished?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ So Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">until he reached</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">حم  تَنزِيلٌ مِّنَ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ&#8230;.  فَإِنْ أَعْرَضُوا فَقُلْ أَنذَرْتُكُمْ صَاعِقَةً مِّثْلَ صَاعِقَةِ عَادٍ وَثَمُودَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“In the name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy. <em>Haa Meem</em>. This Qur&#8217;aan is the Revelation sent down by the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy &#8230;. So if these <em>mushriks</em> turn away from the proof which We have made clear to them, O Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  , then say, ‘I warn you of a terrible punishment like that which befell ’Aad and Thamood.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a>  [Soorah Fussilat (41):1-13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Utbah said, ‘Enough! Enough! Do you have nothing other than this?’ He said, ‘No.’ So he returned to Quraysh and they said, ‘What has occurred?’ He said, ‘I didn&#8217;t leave anything which I thought that you would wish to say except that I said it to him.’ They said, ‘Did he respond to you?’ He said, ‘No, by the one who caused the <em>Ka’bah</em> to be built, I did not understand anything which he said except that he warned you of a terrible punishment like that of ’Aad and Thamood.’ They said, ‘Woe to you, the man speaks to you in Arabic and you don&#8217;t understand what he says?!’ He said, ‘No, by Allaah, I did not understand anything that he said except for his mention of the terrible punishment.’”<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this war was fought with words and the soul, with biting attacks and belittlement and derision, by overcoming the falsehood and ignorance of the <em>Mushriks. </em>At the same time, establishing the proof against them so that whoever went to destruction did so aware of the clear proof, and those who lived did so upon the clear proof. So from the results of this war, and from the results of this clear declaration was that Allaah guided many of the Arabs from the Quraysh and from the other tribes, and from <em>Aws</em> and the <em>Khazraj</em>. Allaah granted them clear discernment and they realised the reality of <em>tawheed</em> and its status. They also knew the vileness of committing <em>shirk</em> with idols or anything else, and also, at the same time, its seriousness and evil consequences for the <em>Mushriks</em> in this world and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these were the great and good fruits which came as a result of the <em>Jihaad</em> of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  and his Companions and their steadfastness in the field of true <em>da’wah</em> to Allaah, and their intensive striving against the idols and false objects of worship. Then when Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  took <em>tawheed</em> to a new practical level which was to physically annihilate, smash and eradicate the idols and purify the earth from them, being fully aware of their seriousness, since they are the primary source of danger for every generation of mankind since the dawn of history until the end of history, just as the leader of those upon the true and straight religion said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ رَبِّ اجْعَلْ هَٰذَا الْبَلَدَ آمِنًا وَاجْنُبْنِي وَبَنِيَّ أَن نَّعْبُدَ الْأَصْنَامَ رَبِّ إِنَّهُنَّ أَضْلَلْنَ كَثِيرًا مِّنَ النَّاسِ ۖ فَمَن تَبِعَنِي فَإِنَّهُ مِنِّي ۖ وَمَنْ عَصَانِي فَإِنَّكَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols, O my Lord, they have indeed caused the misguidance of many people.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a>  [Soorah Ibraaheem (14):35-36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore the greatest Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  resolved to carry out the task of purifying the earth from idols, and to level the graves since tombs are the partner of the idols in causing the misguidance of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From ’Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  entered Makkah and there were three hundred and sixty idols erected around the <em>Ka’bah</em>. So he began striking them with a stick which he had in his hand and was saying, ‘<em>The truth has arrived and falsehood has perished. The truth has arrived and falsehood cannot begin or return</em>.’”<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  prepared an attachment to go from al-Madeenah to the tribe of Khath’am to attack Dhul-Khalasah, which they did. From Jareer ibn ’Abdullaah, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said, “There was a house<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a> called Dhul-Khalasah, or the <em>Yemeni Ka’bah</em> or the <em>Shaamee Ka’bah</em>, and the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said to me, <em>‘Will you not relieve me of Dhul-Khulasah?’</em> So I set out with a hundred and fifty riders of the Ahmas tribe. So we broke it down and killed whomever we found there. Then I came to the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  and informed him, so he made supplication for blessing for us and for the tribe of Ahmas.”<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wording used by al-Bukhaaree, Muslim and Ahmad is, <em>“Will you not relieve me of Dhul-Khalasah?”</em> See the wording used by the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) ?! It was as if the existence of idols deprived him of sleep and disturbed him, so that he could not settle or be at ease.<a href="#_ftn79" name="_ftnref79"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref23" name="_ftn23">[23]</a> <strong>Translator’s Note:</strong> <em>Al-Laat</em> had its origin in a man of the tribe of <em>Thaqeef</em> who used to mix gruel for pilgrims in the times of ignorance near to a certain rock in <em>Taa’if</em>. Then after his death the people built a tomb around the rock, upon his grave. They then worshipped this and gave it the name <em>al-Laat</em> which they invented by twisting the name of Allaah. Allaah’s Messenger (*) sent al-Mugheerah ibn Shu’bah and Aboo Sufyaan to destroy it. They did so and in its place the mosque of Taa’if was built.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <em>al-’Uzzaa</em>, then it was in the form of a tree surrounded by a curtained building in a palm grove between Taa’if and Makkah. The Quraysh used to venerate it. An-Nasaa’ee reports in his <em>Tafseer</em> (2/357 no.567) that when Allaah’s Messenger (*) conquered Makkah he sent Khaalid ibn al-Waleed to it. He found that it was built around three trees, so he cut them down and destroyed the building. He then went to the Prophet (*) and informed him, but he said, “Return for you have done nothing.” So he returned and saw the keepers of the idol fleeing into the hills saying, “O <em>&#8216;Uzzaa</em>!” So Khaalid came and found a naked female with dishevelled hair, throwing dust upon her head. So he struck her with his sword and killed her, then he returned to the Prophet (*) and informed him. So he said, “That was <em>al-’Uzzaa.</em>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <em>Manaat</em> then it was situated at <em>Mushallal,</em> near to Qudayd, between Makkah and al-Madeenah. It was venerated by various tribes in the times of ignorance. Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (*) sent ’Alee to demolish it in the year of the Conquest of Makkah. Ibn Ishaaq said in his <em>Seerah</em>, “The Arabs took other structures besides the <em>Ka’bah</em>, buildings which they worshipped and venerated just as they honoured the <em>Ka’bah</em>. These shrines had keepers and guards, and offerings would be made to them just as with the <em>Ka’bah</em>. The people would also make <em>tawaaf</em> around them and make sacrifices there&#8230;” (<em>Tafseer Ibn Katheer</em> and <em>Tayseerul-’Azeezil-Hameed</em>, (p.177)).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">(Abridged from ‘Siyar A`laamin Nubalaa·’ of Imaam adh-Dhahabee)<br />
Translated by Abu Talha Dawud Burbank <em>rahimahullaah</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdullaah ibn `Amr ibn al-`Aas ibn Waa·il ibn Haashim ibn Sa`eed ibn Sa`d ibn Sahm ibn `Amr ibn Husays ibn Ka`b ibn Lu·ayy ibn Ghaalib, the Imaam, the great scholar, the worshipper. The Companion of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and the son of his Companion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Muhammad and it is said: Aboo `Abdir-Rahmaan, and it is said: Aboo Naseer; al-Qurashee, as-Sahmee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His mother was Raa·itah bint al-Hajjaaj ibn Munabbih as-Sahmiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His father was no older than him except by eleven years or thereabouts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has reached us that he accepted Islaam before his father; and it is said that his name was ‘<em><strong>al-`Aas</strong></em>’ [the disobedient one], so when he accepted Islaam the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) changed it to `<strong>Abdullaah</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He possessed many merits and virtues, and had a high position with regard to knowledge and action. He carried a great deal of knowledge from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was one of those who performed the <em>Hijrah</em> along with his father prior to the conquest of Makkah. His father was only eleven years older than him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) used to prefer him over his father, and in the time of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) he was a person who fasted a great deal, stood in (Night) Prayer a great deal, and recited the Qur·aan a great deal, and who sought a great deal of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He wrote down a lot of knowledge from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), and Aboo Hurairah acknowledged the great amount of knowledge he possessed, and said: “<strong>Because he used to write things down from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and I had not used to write</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ahaadeeth he narrates from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) reach seven hundred in number. al-Bukhaaree and Muslim were united in reporting seven of his ahaadeeth, al-Bukhaaree was alone in reporting eight, and Muslim twenty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He wrote down a great deal of narrations with the permission of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdullaah also narrated from Aboo Bakr, `Umar, Mu`aadh, Suraaqah ibn Maalik, and his father `Amr, and `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn `Awf, Abud-Dardaa· and a group; also from the people of the Book, and he closely examined their books and gave attention to that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was a person of excellence and was earnest in his affairs, and he criticized his father for taking part in affairs in the time of tribulation; however he feared falling into the sin of disobedience if he abandoned his father, so he was therefore present at the battle of Siffeen, but he did not unsheathe a sword.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He acquired a number of the books of the People of the Book and closely examined them, and found some amazing things in them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His father left him a vast amount of property, and he possessed slaves and servants. He also had a garden in Taa·if called <em>al-Waht</em> that was worth a thousand thousand (1,000,000) dirhams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of Egypt took a great deal of knowledge from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He passed away in Egypt in the year 65 H, during the nights of the siege of the capital &#8211;<em>al-Fustaat</em>&#8211; so when he died they were not able to take his funeral out because of the war between Marwaan ibn al-Hakam and the army of Ibn az-Zubayr. So he was buried in his home &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who narrated from him included Ibn al-Musayyib, `Ikrimah, Aboo `Abdir-Rahmaan al-Hubulee, `Urwah, Wahb, Ibn Abee Mulaykah, and Aboo `Amr Shu`ayb ibn Muhammad his grandson.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who narrated from him were: his son Muhammad &#8211; even though there is dispute about this, and narrations of Muhammad from him are reported in Aboo Daawood, at-Tirmidhee and an-Nasaa·ee; and his freed-slave Aboo Qaaboos, and his grandson Shu`ayb ibn Muhammad &#8211; who reported a great deal from him; and he served him and kept his company constantly, and he was brought up in his apartment because Shu`ayb’s father Muhammad died in the life time of his father `Abdullaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His students were many and included: his freed-slave Ismaa`eel, and his freed-slave Saalim, and Anas ibn Maalik, Aboo Umaamah ibn Sahl, and Jubayr ibn Nufayr; and Sa`eed ibn al-Musayyib, `Urwah, Aboo Salamah ibn `Abdir-Rahmaan, Zirr ibn Hubaysh, Humayd ibn `Abdir-Rahmaan ibn `Awf, Khaythamah ibn `Abdir-Rahmaan al-Ju`fee, Taawoos, ash-Sha`bee, `Ikrimah, `Ataa·, Mujaahid, al-Hasan al-Basree, `Abdullaah ibn Buraydah, Ibn Abee Mulaykah, `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Jubayr, `Ataa· ibn Yasaar, `Uqbah ibn Muslim, `Amr ibn Deenaar, Masrooq ibn al-Ajda`, Aboo Burdah ibn Abee Moosaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qataadah said: “He was a stout man.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hammaad ibn Salamah narrated: from `Alee ibn Zayd [[ibn Jud`aan]]: from al-`Uryaan ibn al-Haytham who said: “I came in a deputation along with my father to Yazeed. So a very tall man came. He was reddish and had a large belly. So he sat down. I said: ‘Who is this?’ So it was said: `Abdullaah ibn `Amr.”…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahyaa ibn Ayyoob narrated: from Aboo Qabeel: from `Abdullaah ibn `Amr that he said: “<strong>We used to write down what Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said in his presence.</strong>”..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[…Yoosuf ibn Maahak: from `Abdullaah ibn `Amr who said: I used to write down everything which I heard from Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), wanting to memorize it. So the Quraish forbade me and said: ‘Do you write everything when Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) is a man, and speaks when angry and when pleased!’ So I stopped writing, and then mentioned it to Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), so he indicated with his finger to his mouth and said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Write, for by the One in Whose Hand is my soul, nothing comes out of it except what is true.</strong> &gt;&gt; (Saheeh: as-Saheehah: no. 1532)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is established from `Amr ibn Deenaar: from Wahb ibn Munabbih: from his brother Hammaam that he heard Aboo Hurairah say: “<strong>No Companion of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) had more ahaadeeth than me, except for `Abdullaah ibn `Amr, because he used to write and I do not write</strong>.”…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qutaybah narrated: al-Layth narrated to us, along with someone else: from `Ayyaash ibn `Abbaas: from Aboo `Abdir-Rahmaan al-Hubulee: I heard `Abdullaah ibn `Amr say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“That I should be the tenth of ten poor people on the Day of Resurrection is more beloved to me than that I should be the tenth of ten wealthy people; for those with most will be the ones with the least on the Day of Resurrection, except for those who do like this and like this: meaning: they give in charity to the right and to the left.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[al-Bukhaaree narrated in his ‘Saheeh’ (no. 5052): Moosaa narrated to us: Aboo `Awaanah narrated to us: from Mugheerah: from Mujaahid: from `Abdullaah ibn `Amr who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“My father got me married to a woman of a noble family, so he often used to ask my wife about me. So she said: ‘What a fine man he is, for a man who does not come to my bed, nor has he approached me since he married me.’ So when that continued for a long time he mentioned it to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) who said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Let me meet him</strong>. &gt;&gt; So I met him afterwards and he said: &lt;&lt; <strong>How do you observe fasting?</strong> &gt;&gt; So I replied: “I fast every day.” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>How long does it take you to complete reading the Qur·aan?</strong> &gt;&gt; I said: “I do so every night.” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Fast for three days every month and recite the Qur&#8217;aan once every month</strong>. &gt;&gt; I said: “I have strength to do more than that.” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Then fast the most excellent fast: the fast of Daawood: Fasting one day and refraining from fasting the next day; and finish the recitation of the whole Qur·aan once in seven nights.</strong> &gt;&gt; Would that I had accepted the concession of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), as I have become a weak old man.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he used to recite one seventh of the Qur&#8217;aan to some of his family during the day to make sure that he remembered it for the night; and whenever he wanted to gain some strength he would abstain from fasting for some days, count them and fast them later on for he disliked leaving something which he used to do during the time of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I [i.e. adh-Dhahabee] say: He inherited a very great deal of Egyptian gold from his father, so he was one of the kings amongst the Companions. …`Abdullaah accepted Islaam, and migrated after the seventh year and took part in some of the battles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo `Ubayd said: “He was in command of the right flank of the army of Mu`aawiyah on the day of Siffeen.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khaleefah ibn Khayyaat mentions him as one of Mu`aawiyah’s governors of Koofah. He said: Then he removed him from that position and replaced him with al-Mugheerah ibn Shu`bah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There occurs in the ‘<em>Musnad</em>’ of Ahmad: Yazeed narrated to us: al- `Awwaam related to us: Aswad ibn Mas`ood narrated to me: from Hanzalah ibn Khuwaylid al-`Anbaree who said: “I was in the presence of Mu`aawiyah when two men came to him disputing with regard to the head of `Ammaar &#8211; <em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em>, so each one of them was saying: ‘I killed him.’ So `Abdullaah ibn `Amr said: “Each one of you should be pleased that it was his companion who killed him, and not himself, for I heard Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) say: &lt;&lt; <strong>The transgressing party will kill him</strong>. &gt;&gt; So Mu`aawiyah said: “O `Amr! Will you not spare us this crazy person of yours? Then why are you with us?!” He [i.e. `Abdullaah ibn `Amr] said: “My father made a complaint to Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), so he said to me: &lt;&lt; <strong>Obey your father as long as he lives.</strong> &gt;&gt; So therefore I am with you, but I will not fight.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[‘Saheeh’: ‘as-Saheehul-Musnad’ of Shaikh Muqbil]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Naafi` ibn `Umar related: from Ibn Abee Mulaykah who said: `Abdullaah ibn `Amr &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhumaa</em>&#8211; said: <em>“What have I to do with Siffeen! What have I to do with fighting against the Muslims! I wish that I had died twenty years &#8211; or he said: ten years-before it. Yet even so, by Allaah, I did not strike a sword, nor fire any arrow”;</em> and it is mentioned that he held the flag.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Husayn al-Mu`allim related: from Ibn Buraydah: from Sulaymaan ibn ar- Rabee’ al-`Adawee: that he performed Hajj in the time of Mu`aawiyah amongst a group of the reciters: so it was told to us that `Abdullaah [ibn `Amr] is to be found in the lower part of Makkah. So we went towards him and found a very great party of people and baggage, with three hundred camels: one hundred for riding and two hundred for carrying, whereas we used to be told that he was one of the most humble of people. So we said: ‘What is all this?’ They said: ‘It is for his brothers; he conveys them, and whoever stays as a guest with him upon them.’ So we were surprised. So they said: He is a wealthy man, and they told us where to find him in the Masjidul-Haraam. So we went to him and found that he was a short man with mucus upon his eye-lids, and he was wearing a simple cloak and waistwrapper and a turban, and he let his shoes hang at his left side.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…Yahyaa ibn Bukayr said: “<strong>`Abdullaah ibn `Amr died in Egypt, and was buried in his small house, in the year 65 H.</strong>” This saying about the year of his death was also stated by Khaleefah, Aboo `Ubayd, al-Waaqidee, al- Fallaas and others.</p>

ABOO MUHAMMAD IBN HAZM &#8211;<em>rahimahullaah</em>&#8211; said in  ‘<em>al-Muhallaa</em>’ (1/77-80)<br />
[Translated by Aboo Talhah Dawud ibn Ronald Burbank <em>rahimahullaah</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“ISSUE (no. 116): <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And reciting the Qur&#8217;aan, and prostration during it, and touching the <em>Mus-haf</em>, and (words of) remembrance of Allaah-the Most High-are all permissible, whether upon <em>wudoo</em>· or without <em>wudoo</em>·, and for the ‘<em>junub</em>’ and for the menstruating woman</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof of that is that recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan, and prostration during it, and touching the <em>Mus-haf</em>, and the remembrance of Allaah-the Most High- are actions of good, and are recommended, and their doer is rewarded. So whoever claims that they are prohibited in some states, then he is required to bring proof.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for the recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan,</span></strong> then the present opponents agree with us about this matter with regard to the person who is not in a state of <em>wudoo</em>·, however they disagree regarding the <em>junub</em> and the menstruating woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a group said: The menstruating woman and the <em>junub</em> may not recite anything from the Qur&#8217;aan; and it is a saying related from `Umar ibn al-Khattaab, `Alee ibn Abee Taalib-<em>radiyallaahu `anhumaa</em>-and from others besides them, such as: al-Hasan al-Basree, Qataadah, an-Nakha`ee, and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And a group said: As for the menstruating woman, then she may recite whatever she wishes from the Qur&#8217;aan; but as for the <em>junub</em>, then he may recite two <em>Aayahs</em> or the like; and it was the saying of Maalik; and some of them said: He should not read a complete <em>Aayah</em>; and it was the saying of Aboo Haneefah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So as for those who prevent the <em>junub</em> from recitation anything from the Qur&#8217;aan, then they use as evidence that which `Abdullaah ibn Salamah narrated from `Alee ibn Abee Taalib &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em>&#8211; “That nothing would prevent Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) from the Qur&#8217;aan, except from <em>janaabah</em>.” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is no proof for them in this, since it does not contain a prohibition of the junub reciting the Qur&#8217;aan; rather it is just an action from him-<em>`alaihis-Salaam</em>&#8211; which does not make it something binding. Nor did he &#8211; `<em>alaihis-Salaam</em>-explain that he only withheld from reciting the Qur&#8217;aan on account of <em>janaabah</em>. So it may have been the case that he just happened to have left off reciting in that state, but not because of <em>Janaabah</em>. So he &#8211;<em>`alaihis-Salaam</em>-never fasted a whole month besides Ramaadaan; nor did he increase in its standing in Prayer upon thirteen rak`ahs; nor did he ever dine upon a small table; nor did he eat whilst reclining. So is it, therefore, forbidden to fast a whole month besides Ramaadaan, or that a person prays <em>tahajjud</em> with more than thirteen rak`ahs, or that he dines upon a small table, or that he eats whilst reclining? They do not say this, and there is much like this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also narrations occur prohibiting the <em>junub</em> and one who is not upon purification from reciting anything from the Qur&#8217;aan, but <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>nothing from them is authentic</strong></span>; and we have explained the weaknesses of their chains of narrations elsewhere; and if they had been authentic, then they would have been a proof against those who permit him to recite a complete <em>Aayah</em>, or part of an Aa<em>y</em>ah, since they all totally prohibit recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan for the <em>junub</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who say that the junub may recite an <em>Aayah</em> or so, or who say that he should not recite a whole <em>Aayah</em>; or who permit the menstruating woman and forbid the junub, then these are futile sayings because they are claims not supported by a proof: neither from the Qur&#8217;aan, nor from the Sunnah-neither from what is authentic nor from what is weak, nor from Consensus, nor by the saying of a Companion, nor by analogy, nor by sound opinion. So part of an <em>Aayah</em>, and one <em>Aayah</em> are Qur&#8217;aan, without a doubt, and there is no difference between permitting him to recite one <em>Aayah</em> and (permitting) another; not between preventing one <em>Aayah</em> and preventing another. And those who hold these sayings hold it to be reprehensible to oppose a Companion who is not known to have anyone who disagreed with him; yet they have opposed in this matter `Umar ibn al-Khattaab, `Alee ibn Abee Taalib, and Salmaan al- Faarisee -and no one from the Companions is known to have disagreed with them <em>radiyallaahu `anhum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also there are some <em>Aayahs</em> that comprise a single word, such as:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">وَالضُّحَىٰ</span></strong> &#8211; 93:1 [[Sooratud-Duhaa (93):1]], and:<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>مُدْهَامَّتَانِ</strong> </span>&#8211; 55:64 [[Sooratur-Rahmaan (55): 64]], and:<br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">وَالْعَصْرِ</span> </strong>&#8211; 103:1 [[Sooratul-`Asr (103):1]], and:<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>وَالْفَجْرِ</strong> </span>&#8211; 89:1 [[Sooratul-Fajr (89): 1]];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and there are some that comprise many Words, such as the <em>Aayah</em> concerning a debt [[<em>Aayah</em> 282 of <em>Sooratul-Baqarah</em>]]. So when there is no doubt concerning this, then their permitting him to recite the <em>Aayah</em> of debt, and that which follows it, and <em>Aayatul-Kursee</em>, or part of it and not completing it, and their preventing him from reciting:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#008000;">وَالْفَجْرِ  وَلَيَالٍ عَشْرٍ وَالشَّفْعِ وَالْوَتْرِ </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Sooratul-Fajr (89):1-3]]; or their preventing him from completing:[[Sooratur-Rahmaan (55): 64]], is astonishing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise their making a distinction between the menstruating woman and the junub, based upon the fact that the affair of the menstruating woman is prolonged, then this is absurd; since if her reciting the Qur&#8217;aan is forbidden, then the length of her period will not make it lawful for her; and if that is lawful for her, then using as evidence the fact that her period is prolonged has no meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Muhammad ibn Sa`eed ibn Nabaat narrated to us: `Abdullaah ibn Nasr narrated to us: from Qaasim ibn Asbigh: from Muhammad ibn Waddaah: from Moosaa ibn Mu`aawiyah: Ibn Wahb narrated to us: from Yoonus ibn Yazeed: from Rabee`ah, who said: “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There is no harm in the junub reciting the Qur&#8217;aan</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-And with it to Moosaa ibn Mu`aawiyah: Yoosuf ibn Khaalid as-Samtee narrated to us: Idrees narrated to us: from Hammaad, who said: “I asked Sa`eed ibn al-Musayyib about the junub: should he recite the Qur&#8217;aan? So he said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>How should he not recite it, when it is retained inside him?</strong></span>!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-And with it, to Yoosuf as-Samtee: from Nasr al-Baahilee, who said: “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ibn `Abbaas used to recite al-Baqarah whilst he was junub</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Muhammad ibn Sa`eed ibn Nabaatah related to me: Ahmad ibn `Awnillaah narrated to us: Qaasim ibn Asbigh narrated to us: Muhammad ibn `Abdis-Salaam al- Khushanee narrated to us: Muhammad ibn Bashshaar narrated to us: Ghundar narrated to us: Shu`bah narrated to us: from Hammaad ibn Abee Sulaymaan, who said: <strong>“<span style="color:#000000;">I asked Sa`eed ibn Jubayr about the junub reciting, so he did not see any harm in it, and he said: Is the Qur&#8217;aan not within him?!</span>”</strong> And it is the saying of Daawood, and all of our Companions [2].</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for the prostration whilst reciting the Qur&#8217;aan</span></strong>, then it is not Prayer at all, because of what `Abdullaah ibn Rabee` narrated to us: Muhammad ibn Mu`aawiyah narrated to us: Ahmad ibn Shu`ayb narrated to us: Muhammad ibn Bashshaar narrated to us: `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Mahdee narrated to us, and Muhammad ibn Ja`far, both saying: Shu`bah narrated to us: from Ya`laa ibn `Ataa, that he heard `Alee al-Azdee-and he is `Alee ibn `Abdillaah al-Baariqee: reliable-that he heard Ibn `Umar say: from Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) that he said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Prayer of the night and the day is in pairs</strong> &gt;&gt; [3]; and it is authentic from him- <em>`alaihis-Salaam</em>-that he said: &lt;&lt; <strong>The Witr is a single rak`ah at the end of the night</strong>. &gt;&gt; [4] So it is correct that whatever is not a complete rak`ah or two rak`ah’s, or more, then it is not Prayer; and prostration whilst reciting the Qur&#8217;aan is not a rak`ah, nor two rak`ahs so it is not Prayer; and because it is not Prayer it is permissible without <em>wudoo</em>·, and for the <em>junub</em>, and for the menstruating woman, and towards other than the <em>qiblah</em>, just like the rest of the dhikr; and there is not difference since <em>wudoo</em>· is not binding except for the Prayer alone, as nothing occurs in the Qur&#8217;aan, the Sunnah, Consensus, or Analogy to make it obligatory for other than the Prayer. So if it is said that the prostration is a part of the Prayer, and a part of the Prayer is Prayer, then we say, and success is granted by Allaah, this is futile, because a part of the Prayer will not be Prayer unless it is completed in the manner in which the praying person has been commanded to perform it. So if a person were to say a <em>takbeer</em>, and then perform <em>rukoo</em>`, and then deliberately break off, then no one from the people of Islaam would say that he had prayed anything; rather they would all say that he had not prayed; but if he were to complete it as a <em>rak`ah</em> of the <em>witr</em>, or two <em>rak`ah’s</em> for the <em>Jumu`ah</em>, or the Dawn Prayer, or travelling, or optional Prayer, then he would have prayed without any disagreement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we say to them: The standing is a part of the prayer, and the <em>takbeer</em> is a part of the Prayer, and the recitation of the Foundation of the Book is a part of the Prayer, and the Sitting is a part of the Prayer, and the Salutation is a part of the Prayer, so upon this basis it is essential that you do not permit anyone to stand, or to say <em>takbeer</em>, or to recite the Foundation of the Book, or to sit, or to give the Salutation except upon <em>wudoo</em>·. So this is something which they do not say, so their argument is nullified, and Allaah-the Most High-grants success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if they say: This is by Consensus [5], then,we say to them: Then you have assented to the correctness of a consensus which shows the futility of your argument, and the unsoundness of your reasoning, and Allaah-the Most High-grants success.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for touching the mus-haf</span></strong>, then the narrations used as evidence by those who do not permit the junub to touch it, then nothing from them is authentic, because they are either ‘<em>mursal</em>’, a manuscript which does not have a fully connected chain [6], something from an unknown person, or something from a weak narrator; and we have examined them in detail elsewhere.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for what is authentic, then it is just what `Abdullaah ibn Rabee` narrated to us, saying: Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Mufarraj narrated to us: Sa`eed ibn as-Sakan related to us: al-Firabree narrated to us: al-Bukhaaree narrated to us: al-Hakam ibn Naafi` narrated to us: Shu`ayb narrated to us: from az-Zuhree: `Ubaydullaah ibn `Abdillaah ibn `Utbah related to me: that Ibn `Abbaas informed him: that Aboo Sufyaan informed him that he was with Hiraql, and Hiraql called for the letter of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) with which he had sent Dihyah to the ruler of Busraa, so he gave it to Hiraql, and he read it, and it contained:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“In the name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy. From Muhammad, the slave of Allaah and His Messenger to Hiraql the ruler of the Byzantines. Peace be upon whoever follows the guidance. To proceed. Then I call you with the call of Islaam: accept Islaam and you shall be safe, and if you turn away then the sin of the common folk will be upon you; and:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ يَا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ تَعَالَوْا إِلَىٰ كَلِمَةٍ سَوَاءٍ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمْ أَلَّا نَعْبُدَ إِلَّا اللَّهَ وَلَا نُشْرِكَ بِهِ شَيْئًا وَلَا يَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُنَا بَعْضًا أَرْبَابًا مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ ۚ فَإِن تَوَلَّوْا فَقُولُوا اشْهَدُوا بِأَنَّا مُسْلِمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Soorah Aal-`Imraan (3): 64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;">O people of the Scripture! Come to a true and just word to which we should all adhere: that we single out Allaah with all worship, and we do not associate anything along with Him; and that none of us should take others as lords besides Allaah. So if they turn away, then say: Bear witness that we are Muslims, submitting to our Lord</span>.]].[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So here Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) sent this letter, containing an Aayah, to Christians, and he knew that they would certainly touch that letter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if they mentioned what `Abdullah ibn Rabee` narrated to us: Muhammad ibn Mu`aawiyah narrated to us: Ahmad ibn Shu`ayb narrated to us: Qutaybah ibn Sa`eed narrated to us: al-Layth narrated to us: from Naafi`: from Ibn `Umar who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) forbade travelling to the land of the enemies with the Qur&#8217;aan, for fear that the enemy would gain possession of it</strong>.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then this is true; it is binding to follow it; and it does not contain anything about the junub or the Disbeliever not touching the mus-haf, rather all that it contains is that the people of the land of war should not gain possession of the Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if they say: Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) only sent a single Aayah to Hiraql (Heraclius), then it is said to them: Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) did not prevent anything in addition to it; and you are people of analogy, and if you will not draw analogy between one <em>Aayah</em> and that which is more than it, then do not make analogy between this [particular] <em>Aayah</em> and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if they mention the Saying of Allaah -the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فِي كِتَابٍ مَّكْنُونٍ   لَّا يَمَسُّهُ إِلَّا الْمُطَهَّرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;">In a well-guarded Book, which none touch but the purified ones</span>]] [Sooratul-Waaqi`ah (56):78-79]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">then there is no proof for them in it, since it does not contain a command; rather it is just a statement of fact, and Allaah-the Most High-does not speak except truth; and it is not permissible to divert the wording of a statement to the meaning of a command, except by the presence of a clear text or a certain Consensus. So when we see that the <em>mus-haf</em> is touched by those who are pure and those who are not pure, then we know that He-the Mighty and Majestic- <strong>did not mean the <em>mus-haf</em>, but rather He meant another Book,</strong> just as Muhammad ibn Sa`eed ibn Nabaatah related to us: Ahmad ibn `Abdil-Baseer narrated to us: Qaasim ibn Asbigh narrated to us: Muhammad ibn `Abdis-Salaam al-Khushanee narrated to us: Muhammad ibn al-Muthannaa narrated to us `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Mahdee narrated to us: Sufyaan ath-Thawree narrated to us: from Jaami` ibn Abee Raashid: from Sa`eed Ibn Jubayr, regarding the Saying of Allaah-the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَّا يَمَسُّهُ إِلَّا الْمُطَهَّرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Sooratul-Waaqi`ah (56):79]<br />
[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;">None touch it except the purified</span>]], he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>The Angels who are in the Heavens</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Himmaam ibn Ahmad narrated to us: Ibn Mufarraj narrated to us: Ibnul-A`raabee to us: ad-Dabaree narrated to us: `Abdur-Razzaaq narrated to us: Yahyaa ibn al-`Alaa· narrated to us: from al-A`mash: from Ibraaheem an-Nakha`ee: from `Alqamah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>We went to Salmaan al-Faarisee, and he came out to us from a toilet of his, so we said to him: ‘If you were to perform wudoo·, O Aboo `Abdillaah, and then recite such and such Soorah to us.</strong>” So Salmaan said: “Allaah the Mighty and Majestic-only said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَّا يَمَسُّهُ إِلَّا الْمُطَهَّرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Sooratul-Waaqi`ah (56):79]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;">In a well-guarded Book, which none touch but the purified ones</span>]], and it is the Reminder which is in the heavens: none touch it except the Angels.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad ibn Sa`eed ibn Nabaat narrated to us: Ahmad ibn `Abdil-Baseer narrated to us: Qaasim ibn Asbigh narrated to us: Muhammad ibn `Abdis-Salaam al- Khushanee narrated to us: Muhammad ibn Bashshaar narrated to us: Muhammad ibn Ja`far narrated to us: Shu`bah narrated to us: Mansoor ibn al-Mu`tamir narrated to us: from Ibraaheem an-Nakha`ee: from `Alqamah ibn Qays: that <strong>when he wanted to take a mus-haf, he would order a Christian to transcribe it for him</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Aboo Haneefah said: “There is no harm in the junub carrying the mus-haf by its strap, and he may not carry it without a strap”, and the one who is not upon wudoo· is the same with them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Maalik said: “The junub, and the one who is not in a state of wudoo· may not carry the mus-haf: neither by its strap, nor upon a pillow; but if it is in a saddle-bag, or a box, then there is no harm in the Jew, the Christian, the junub, and the one who is not in a state of purification carrying it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Alee [[i.e. Ibn Hazm-rahimahullaah]] said: &#8220;<strong>There is no proof for the correctness of these distinctions; neither in the Qur&#8217;aan nor in the Sunnah-in what is authentic or what is weak, nor in Consensus, nor in analogy, nor in the saying of a Companion. So if the saddle-bag is a barrier between the carrier and the Qur&#8217;aan, then a book-cover and the back of a page should also be a barrier between the toucher and the Qur&#8217;aan, and there is no difference, and Allaah grants success</strong>.”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>SUFYAAN IBN SA`EED IBN MASROOQ, ATH-THAWREE</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Abridged from ‘Siyar A`laamin Nubalaa·’ of Imaam adh-Dhahabee)<br />
Translated by Abu Talha Dawud Burbank <em>rahimahullaah</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Sufyaan ibn Sa`eed ibn Masrooq, the Imaam, Shaikhul-Islaam, The chief of the memorizers, Aboo `Abdillaah, ath-Thawree: from Thawr of the tribe of Mudar, not Thawr of Hamadaan; al-Koofee, the Jurist (Faqeeh).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He narrated from his father, and from: Zubayd ibn al-Haarith, Habeeb ibn Abee Thaabit, al-Aswad ibn Qays, Ziyaad ibn `Ilaaqah, Muhaarib ibn Dithaar, and their level.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who narrated from him included: Ibn al-Mubaarak, Yahyaa alQattaan, Ibn Wahb, Wakee`, al-Firyaabee, Qabeesah, Aboo Nu`aym, Muhammad ibn Katheer, Ahmad ibn Yoonus al-Yarboo`ee, and very many others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shu`bah, Yahyaa ibn Ma`een, and a group said: <strong>Sufyaan is the Chief of the Believers in Hadeeth</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Mubaarak said: <strong>&#8220;I wrote (narrations) from one thousand one hundred Shaikhs, and there was not amongst them anyone more excellent than Sufyaan.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shu`bah used to say: “<strong>Sufyaan is a better memorizer than me.</strong>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Warqaa· said: “<strong>ath-Thawree did not see the like of himself</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad said: “<strong>No one takes precedence over him in my heart</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Qattaan said: “<strong>I have never seen a better memorizer then him: if you asked him about a question or about a hadeeth which he did not possess, it would trouble him greatly</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdur-Razzaaq said: Sufyaan said: “<strong>I never stored anything in my heart and then found it letting me down</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Awzaa`ee said: “<strong>No one whom the Ummah is united upon in their being pleased with him and holding him to be correct remains except for Sufyaan</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Mubaarak said: “<strong>I do not know anyone upon the face of the earth who is more knowledgeable than Sufyaan</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wakee` said: “<strong>Sufyaan was an ocean</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Qattaan said: “<strong>Sufyaan is above Maalik in everything</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Usaamah said: “Whoever informs you that he has seen the like of Sufyaan, then do not believe him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abee Dhi·b said: “I have not seen in Iraaq anyone who resembles your Thawree.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ath-Thawree said: “<strong>I would love that I am saved regarding knowledge: so that it is neither for nor against me; and there is no action which I fear more for myself than it &#8211; meaning Hadeeth</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahyaa ibn Yamaan said: I heard Sufyaan say: “<strong>The scholar is the doctor of the Religion and dirhams are the disease for the Religion. So if the doctor catches the disease, then when will he be able to treat others?!”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Khuraybee said: “I heard ath-Thawree say: <strong>“Seeking Hadeeth (itself) is not a preparation for death, rather it is an ailment which a man prescribes himself with.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (i.e. adh-Dhahabee) say: ‘He has spoken the truth, by Allaah. Seeking Hadeeth is something other than Hadeeth itself. So seeking Hadeeth is a term commonly used to cover a number of affairs which are additional to actually acquiring Hadeeth itself, and many of them are just steps towards knowledge; and most of these are affairs which the narrator of hadeeth becomes engrossed with, such as: acquiring fine manuscripts; seeking shorter chains; increasing the number of one’s Shaikhs; being overjoyed at titles and praise; and hoping for a long life so that he can narrate more; and loving to be alone in narrating something; and many affairs which are closely allied to personal goals, and not to actions for the Lord. So if your seeking the Prophetic Hadeeth is surrounded by these calamities, then when will you escape from them towards acting purely and sincerely for Allaah. Then if the knowledge of narrations can be tainted, then what do you think about the knowledge of logic, controversial debating, philosophy of the earlier peoples; which strip away Eemaan and produce doubts and throw a person into confusion. These were not, by Allaah, from the knowledge of the Companions, nor the Taabi`een, nor from the knowledge of alAwzaa`ee, ath-Thawree, Maalik, Aboo Haneefah, Ibn Abee Dhi·b, or Shu`bah; nor, by Allaah, were they known by Ibn al-Mubaarak; nor by Aboo Yoosuf who said: “Whoever seeks the Religion through rhetorical theology (al-kalaam) will become an evil heretic”; nor by Wakee`, Ibn Mahdee, Ibn Wahb, ash-Shaafi`ee, `Affaan, Aboo `Ubayd, Ibn al-Madeenee, Ahmad Aboo Thawr, al-Muzanee, al-Bukhaaree, al-Athram, Muslim, anNasaa·ee, Ibn Khuzaymah, Ibn Suraij, Ibn al-Mundhir, and their like. Rather their knowledge was the Qur·aan, the Hadeeth, Fiqh, Grammar, and the like. Yes Sufyaan also said, in what al-Firyaabee heard from him: “There is no action more excellent than seeking the Hadeeth, as long as the intention is correct regarding it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: And I heard him say: “If we wanted to narrate Hadeeth to you exactly as we heard it, then we would not narrate a single hadeeth to you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Firyaabee said: I heard Sufyaan say: “I entered upon al-Mahdee and I said: “It reached me that Ibn `Umar spent twelve deenars upon his Hajj, and you are involved in what you are involved in.” So he became angry and said: ‘Do you want me to be as you are?!’ So I said: ‘If you are not as I am, then at least reduce from what you are doing. “Damurah said: I heard Maalik say: “Iraaq used to wage war upon us with dirhams and garments, and then it waged war upon us with Sufyaan ath-Thawree.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: The virtues of this Imaam occur in a volume complied by Ibn alJawzee; and I have abridged it and brought a good quantity of that in my ‘Taareekh’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saalih Jazarah said: “Sufyaan was a greater memorizer and had more hadeeth than Maalik. However Maalik carefully selected the narrators; and Sufyaan was a greater memorizer then Shu`bah. His ahaadeeth amounted to thirty thousand, whereas the ahaadeeth of Shu`bah were about ten thousand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Sufyaan was born in the year 97 H. He began seeking Hadeeth whilst he was a youth, since his father was one of the scholars of Koofah. He (Sufyaan) died in Basrah, in hiding from al-Mahdee, since he was one who spoke out with the truth and strongly criticized. He died in Sha`baan in the year 161 H -radiyallaahu `anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is authentic from Ma`daan: from ath-Thawree, regarding His Saying -He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Sooratul-Hadeed (57): 4]<br />
[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He is with you</strong></span>]], so he said: “His knowledge,” and this is what is reported from a group of the people of Tafseer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Laalikaa·ee in ‘as-Sunnah’: al-Mukhallis related to us: Abul-Fadl Shu`ayb ibn Muhammad related to us: `Alee ibn Harb ibn Bassaam related to us: I heard Shu`ayb ibn Harb say: I said to Sufyaan ath-Thawree:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">‘Tell me a saying about the Sunnah, through which Allaah will benefit me, and when I stand in front of Him and He asks me about it I can say: ‘O my Lord! Sufyaan told this to me.’ So that I will be saved and you will be taken.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">He said: “Write: In the name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy. The Qur·aan is the Speech of Allaah. It is not created. It came from Him, and it will return to Him. Whoever says other than this then he is an Disbeliever; and <em>Eemaan</em> is statement and action and intention, it increases and decreases; and to give precedence to the two Shaikhs [i.e. Aboo Bakr and `Umar]…” until he said: “O Shu`ayb, what you have written will not benefit you until you hold wiping over the leather socks, and until you hold reciting ‘<em>Bismillaahir-Rahmaanir-Raheem</em>’ quietly (in the Prayer) to be better than reciting it loudly; and until you have <em>Eemaan</em> in Pre-Decree (al-Qadr); and until you hold praying behind every righteous or sinful (<em>imaam</em>); and that the Jihaad continues until the Day of Resurrection; and having patience under the flag of the ruler, whether he is tyrannical or just.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">So I said: ‘O Aboo `Abdillaah, is that every Prayer?’ He said: “No, rather the <em>Jumu`ah</em> Prayer, and the two `Eid Prayers: pray them behind whoever you reach. As for the rest of that, then you have a choice, so do not pray except behind one whom you trust in, and you know that he is from the people of the Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">If you stand before Allaah and He asks you about this, then say: “O my Lord, Sufyaan ibn Sa`eed related it to me; and then leave me to my Lord &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is established from Sufyaan, and the Shaikh of al-Mukhallis is reliable -may Allaah have mercy upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘Tadhkiratul-Huffaaz’ (1/203-207)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[For the full narration, and a longer biography of Sufyaan refer to the book ‘Mountains of Knowledge.’]]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The <em>Dawah</em> of Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The noblest of all the Prophets and the last of them, Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdullaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم). The one sent with the greatest, most complete and most comprehensive message. The one whom Allaah sent as a mercy for the worlds, and as a bringer of good tidings and a warner, and as a Caller to Allaah with His permission, and a shining light. He did not leave anything good except that he guided his <em>ummah</em> to it and pointed it out to them, nor anything evil except that he warned them against it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">So which of the fundamentals of Islaam did this exalted Prophet begin with? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">What was the starting point for his <em>da’wah</em>? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) began with what all the Prophets began with, and started where they started in their <em>da’wah</em>: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>calling to the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of <em>tawheed</em>, and calling for all worship to be made purely and sincerely for Allaah alone</strong></span>. He began with the testification, “None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah,” (<em>Laa ilaaha illallaah Muhammadur Rasoolullaah</em>). Can it be imagined that he or any of the other Prophets would begin with anything but this great principle, the foundation of all the divine Messages?! Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) began with this fundamental principle, so the first thing which the people heard was, &#8216;Witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah.&#8217; So the proud and haughty said.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَجَعَلَ الْآلِهَةَ إِلَٰهًا وَاحِدًا ۖ إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَشَيْءٌ عُجَابٌ  &#8211; وَانطَلَقَ الْمَلَأُ مِنْهُمْ أَنِ امْشُوا وَاصْبِرُوا عَلَىٰ آلِهَتِكُمْ ۖ إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَشَيْءٌ يُرَادُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“The unbelievers said, ‘Has he made all that is to be worshipped a single God, who alone is to be called upon and hears all invocations. This is a very curious thing which we have not heard of.’ So the leaders amongst them went off saying to one another, ‘Continue in what you are upon and persist in worshipping your idols. He only says this to gain ascendancy over us.’”  </strong></span>[Soorah Saad (38):5-6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continued calling to this lofty principle and highest goal throughout the Meccan period of his Messengership, for thirteen years. He did not become weary or languid. He patiently bore all types of harm to propagate this principle, since no religious duties or pillars of Islaam were obligated upon him, except for the Prayer which was obligated in the tenth year of Prophethood, and apart from the excellent manners of keeping ties of relationship, truthfulness and chastity which he commanded his people with. However the core of his <em>da’wah</em> and the cause of dispute and opposition to him was that great fundamental principle. So Allaah charged this noble Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) with the particular duty of establishing this great principle. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ الْكِتَابَ بِالْحَقِّ فَاعْبُدِ اللَّهَ مُخْلِصًا لَّهُ الدِّينَ  &#8211; أَلَا لِلَّهِ الدِّينُ الْخَالِصُ ۚ وَالَّذِينَ اتَّخَذُوا مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَاءَ مَا نَعْبُدُهُمْ إِلَّا لِيُقَرِّبُونَا إِلَى اللَّهِ زُلْفَىٰ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ فِي مَا هُمْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Indeed We have sent down the Book to you, O Muhammad, with the truth, so worship Allaah alone making all religion purely and sincerely for Him. Indeed the religion that is free of all taint of <em>shirk</em> is alone what is acceptable to Allaah. As for those who take and invoke helpers and protectors besides Allaah, then they say, ‘We only worship them so that they should intercede for us and bring us nearer to Allaah.’ Indeed Allaah will establish judgement between them regarding the matters of religion about which they dispute.”</span>  [</strong>Soorah az-Zumar (39):2-3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ إِنِّي أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَعْبُدَ اللَّهَ مُخْلِصًا لَّهُ الدِّينَ  &#8211; وَأُمِرْتُ لِأَنْ أَكُونَ أَوَّلَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ &#8211;  قُلْ إِنِّي أَخَافُ إِنْ عَصَيْتُ رَبِّي عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ &#8211; قُلِ اللَّهَ أَعْبُدُ مُخْلِصًا لَّهُ دِينِي</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say, O Muhammad </strong>(صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, ‘Allaah has commanded that I should worship Him alone, purely and sincerely, not associating anything with Him, and I am commanded to be the first of this nation who submits to Him as a Muslim, making all worship purely for Him.’ Say, O Muhammad, ‘I fear should I disobey my Lord in this, the torment of a great Day.’ Say, ‘It is Allaah alone that I worship, making all of my worship purely and sincerely for Him, and not worshipping anything else besides Him.’”</span></strong>[Soorah az-Zumar (39):11-14]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ إِنَّ صَلَاتِي وَنُسُكِي وَمَحْيَايَ وَمَمَاتِي لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ &#8211; لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ ۖ وَبِذَٰلِكَ أُمِرْتُ وَأَنَا أَوَّلُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say, O Muhammad </strong>(صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, ‘Indeed my Prayer, my sacrifice, my living and my dying are all purely and solely for Allaah, Lord of all the Worlds. There is no share of any of that for other than Him. That is what My Lord ordered me, and I am the first of this nation to submit to Allaah as a Muslim.’”</span></strong>[Soorah al-An’aam (6):162-163]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also commanded him to call all of the people to fulfil and implement this principle, and to proceed upon it. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اعْبُدُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ &#8211; الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الْأَرْضَ فِرَاشًا وَالسَّمَاءَ بِنَاءً وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً فَأَخْرَجَ بِهِ مِنَ الثَّمَرَاتِ رِزْقًا لَّكُمْ ۖ فَلَا تَجْعَلُوا لِلَّهِ أَندَادًا وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“O Mankind, single out your Lord with worship; He who created you and all those who came before you so that you may be of those who seek to avoid Allaah’s punishment and anger; those whom Allaah is pleased with. He Who has made the earth a resting place for you and has made the sky a canopy, and sent down rain from the sky, and brought out with it crops and fruits from the earth as provision for you. So do not set up rivals with Allaah in your worship whilst you know that you have no Lord besides Him.”</span>  </strong>[Soorah al-Baqarah (2):21-22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِلَٰهُكُمْ إِلَٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ ۖ لَّا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الرَّحْمَٰنُ الرَّحِيمُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“The God Who alone has the right to be worshipped is a Single God. So do not worship anything besides Him, nor associate anything in worship with Him, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.”</span>  </strong>[Soorah al-Baqarah (2):163]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنِّي رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ جَمِيعًا الَّذِي لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۖ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ ۖ فَآمِنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ النَّبِيِّ الْأُمِّيِّ الَّذِي يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَكَلِمَاتِهِ وَاتَّبِعُوهُ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say, O Muhammad </strong>(صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)<strong>, to all of the people, ‘I am the Messenger of Allaah to you all. Allaah, to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and everything therein. None has the right to be worshipped but Him. He Who alone gives life and death. So affirm true faith in Allaah and in His sole right to worship, and believe in His Messenger, the Unlettered Prophet </strong>(Muhammad صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> who believes in Allaah and His Words, and follow him, so that you may be rightly guided.’”</span></strong>[Soorah al-A’raaf (7):158]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Aayaat </em>in this regard are very many, and what we have quoted is an example showing the methodology of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   in calling to <em>tawheed</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then with regard to the<em> Sunnah</em>, there are many things clearly showing that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) began his <em>da’wah</em> with <em>tawheed</em> and completed it with it, and continued calling to it from the beginning to the end, throughout his (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) ’Amr ibn ’Abasah as-Sulamee, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“During the times of Ignorance I used hold that the people were upon error and futility, and they used to worship the idols, then I heard of a man in Makkah who received revelation. So I set out upon my riding beast and came to him. At that time he was in hiding due to oppression of his people. So I behaved in a way that enabled me to gain access to him in Makkah, which I did. So I said to him, ‘What are you?’ He replied, ‘I am a Prophet.’ So I said, ‘And what is a Prophet?’ He said, ‘Allaah has sent me as a Messenger.’ So I said, ‘And what is it that He has sent you with?’ He said, ‘I have been sent to order the joining of ties of relationship, to break the idols, so that Allaah is worshipped alone and nothing at all is associated in worship along with Him.’ So I said, ‘And who is with you upon this?’ He said, ‘A free man and a slave.’ He said, ‘And at that time Aboo Bakr and Bilaal were with him from those who believed in him&#8230;’“ </em></p>
<p>[Reported by Muslim (Eng. trans. 2/395 no.1812) and Ahmad in <em>al-Musand</em> (4/112)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) When ’Amr ibn al-’Aas and ’Abdullaah ibn Rabee’ah al-Makhzoomee went to an-Najaashee, the ruler of Abyssinia, to speak to him in order to incite him against the Muslims who had emigrated to Abyssinia, they said, ‘O king, some of our foolish youths have abandoned their religion and come to your land. They have split away from their own people and have not entered your religion. Rather they have come up with an innovated religion which is not known either to us or to you&#8230;’ So the Najaashee asked the Muslims, ‘What is this religion which you have split from your people and not entered my religion or the religion of any of these nations?!’ So Ja’far ibn Abee Taalib was the one who replied, and he said to him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O king, we were a people from the people of ignorance who worshipped idols, and we ate unslaughtered meat and committed foul acts, and we cut off ties of relationship, treated our neighbours in an evil manner and the strong amongst us used to devour the weak. So we were upon that until Allaah sent a Messenger to us from amongst us. We knew his lineage, his truthfulness, his trustworthiness and his chastity. <strong>So he called us to Allaah, that we should single Him out and worship Him alone and renounce everything which we and our fathers used to worship besides Him, all stones and idols</strong>; he commanded us to speak the truth and to fulfil trusts; to join ties of relationship; to live in a good manner with our neighbours; to avoid forbidden acts and shedding blood; and he forbade us from foul acts and from falsehood; and he forbade us from unlawfully devouring the wealth of orphans and falsely accusing chaste women. <strong>He ordered us to worship Allaah alone and not to worship anything along with Him&#8230;</strong>’ He said, ‘So he told him the affairs of Islaam,’ &#8216;So we attested to his truthfulness and believed him and followed him in that which he came with. So we worshipped Allaah alone, and did not worship anything else besides Him, and we made forbidden that which He forbade us, and declared lawful that which He allowed for us. So our people became enemies to us and tortured us and tormented us to turn back from our religion to the worship of idols, and so that we should allow the filthy actions which we used to allow. So when they oppressed us, treated us cruelly and made it unbearable for us, and came between us and our religion, then we left and came to your land, and we preferred you to others and wished to live in your company, and we hoped that we would not be oppressed while with you&#8230;’” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) Also amongst the questions which Hirqal (Heraclius) asked Aboo Sufyaan, at the time of the peace of Hudaybiyyah, about Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) was that he asked Aboo Sufyaan, “What does he command you?” So Aboo Sufyaan replied, “He says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Worship Allaah alone and do not worship anything else along with Him, and abandon what your fathers say. And he orders Prayer, charity, chastity and the joining of ties of relationship.</strong>’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by al-Bukhaaree (Eng. trans. 1/7/no. 6) and it is a long <em>hadeeth]</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these <em>ahaadeeth</em> clearly show us what the <em>da’wah</em> of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  was in both the Makkan and Madinan periods.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Reported by Imaam Ahmad in his <em>Musnad</em> (1/202) and (5/290). Ahmad said, “Ya’qoob (meaning Ibraaheem ibn Sa&#8217;d az-Zuhree) narrated to us (reliable): My father narrated to us, from Muhammad ibn Ishaaq: Muhammad ibn Muslim ibn ’Ubaydillaah ibn Shihaab narrated to me: from Aboo Bakr ibn ’Abdir-Rahmaan ibn al-Haarith ibn Hishaam al-Makhzoomee:from Umm Salamah bint Abee Umayyah (meaning the Mother of the Believers, <em>radiyallaahu ’anha</em>).” It is a chain of narration that is fully <em>saheeh</em>, except for Muhammad ibn Ishaaq, but he clearly states that he heard it directly and so his narration is <em>hasan</em> (good and acceptable).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>`ABDULLAAH IBN `ABBAAS -radiyallaahu `anhumaa</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;">(Abridged from ‘Siyar A`laamin Nubalaa·’ of Imaam adh-Dhahabee)</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;">Translated by Abu Talha Dawud Burbank <em>rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“`Abdullaah ibn `Abbaas ibn `Abdul-Muttalib -radiyallaahu `anhumaa- the Imaam, the ocean of knowledge, the great scholar (<em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>abr</em>) of the Ummah, and the Imaam of Tafseer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul-`Abbaas, al-Haashimee, the son of the paternal uncle of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), and the father of the khulafaa· [i.e. the later `Abbaasid caliphs.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was born in the mountain pass of Banoo Haashim, three years before the Hijrah. He accompanied the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) for about thirty months, and Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) died when he was thirteen years old. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) supplicated for him that Allaah should grant him knowledge and understanding of the Religion, and should teach him explanation of the Book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khaalid al-Hadhdhaa· said: from `Ikrimah: from Ibn `Abbaas who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) stroked my head and supplicated for wisdom for me.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Aboo `Aasim: Shabeeb ibn Bishr related to us: `Ikrimah related to us: from Ibn `Abbaas who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) went to relieve himself, then he moved away and found a covered pot (of water), so he said: &lt;&lt; Who brought this? &gt;&gt; So `Abdullaah (ibn `Abbaas) said: “It was I”, so he said: &lt;&lt; O Allaah teach him explanation of the Qur·aan. &gt;&gt;</span></strong> [Saheeh: ‘Sharhut-Tahaawiyyah’ (no. 180), ‘as-Saheehah’ (no. 2589)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-al-A`mash: from `Abud-Duhaa: from Masrooq who said: Ibn Mas`ood said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“What a fine explainer of the Qur·aan is Ibn `Abbaas! If he had reached our age, then none of us would have attained a tenth of his knowledge.”</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> “`Alee placed Ibn `Abbaas in charge of the Hajj, so he gave a khutbah that day which was such that if it had been heard by the Turks and the Romans they would have accepted Islaam.

<p style="text-align:justify;">He narrated a good number of narrations from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), and from `Umar. `Alee, Mu`aadh, his father al-`Abbaas, `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn `Awf, Aboo Sufyaan Sakhr ibn Harb, Aboo Dharr, Ubayy ibn Ka`b, Zayd ibn Thaabit, and a large number of others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He recited Qur·aan with Ubayy (ibn Ka`b) and Zayd (ibn Thaabit). Mujaahid, Sa`eed ibn Jubayr, and a group took the recitation from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who narrated from him are: his son `Alee, the son of his brother `Abdullaah ibn Ma`bad, and his freed slaves: `Ikrimah, Miqsam, and Aboo Ma`bad Naafidh; and Anas ibn Maalik, Abut-Tufayl, Aboo Umaamah ibn Sahl, and his brother Katheer ibn `Abbaas; and `Urwah ibn az-Zubayr, `Ubaydullaah ibn `Umar, Taawoos, Abush-Sha`thaa· Jaabir, `Alee ibn al- Husayn, Sa`eed ibn Jubayr, Mujaahid ibn Jabr, al-Qaasim ibn Muhammad, Aboo Saalih as-Sammaan, Aboo Rajaa· al-`Utaaridee, Abul-`Aaliyah, `Ubayd ibn `Umayr and his son `Abdullaah `Ataa· ibn Yasaar, Ibraaheem ibn `Abdullaah ibn Ma`bad, and Arbadah at-Tameemee &#8211; the companion of the ‘Tafseer’, and Aboo Saalih Baadhaam, Taleeq ibn Qays al-Hanafee, `Ataa· ibn Abee Rabaah, ash-Sha`bee, al-Hasan, Ibn Seereen, Muhammad ibn Ka`b al-Qurazee, Shahr ibn Hawshab, Ibn Mulaykah, `Amr ibn Deenaar, `Ubaydullaah ibn Abee Yazeed, Aboo Jamrah Nasr ibn `Imraan ad-Duba`ee ad-Dahhaak ibn Muzaahim, Abuz-Zubayr al-Makkee, Bakr ibn `Abdullaah al-Muzanee, Habeeb ibn Abee Thaabit, Sa`eed ibn Abil-Hasan, Ismaa`eel as-Suddee, and many others besides them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And ‘at-Tahdheeb’ mentions <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>a hundred and ninety seven people who narrated from him</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-al-Madaa·inee: from Nu`aym ibn Hafs: that Aboo Bakr said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Ibn `Abbaas came to us in Basrah, and there was not anyone the like of him amongst the `Arabs in his body, his knowledge, his explanation , his handsomeness and his completeness.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-`Abdur-Razzaaq: from Ma`mar who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The greater part of the knowledge of Ibn `Abbaas was taken from three men: `Umar, `Alee and Ubayy ibn Ka`b &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhum</em>.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Aboo Bakr ibn `Ayyaash: from Muhammad ibn `Amr: from Aboo Salamah: from Ibn `Abbaas who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I used to hear that a man would have a hadeeth, so I would go to him and sit until he came out. So then I would ask him; and if I had wished I could have got him to come out to me.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Zaa·idah: `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn `Abdullaah ibn al-Asbahaanee related to us: that `Abdullaah ibn Shaddaad, will you not be amazed? A boy came to me after I had laid down to take the noon siesta, and said: ‘There is a man at the door requesting permission to enter.’ So I said: “He must have come for some need, so grant him permission to enter.” He said: So he entered and said: ‘Will you not inform me about that man.’ So I said: “Which man?” So he said: ‘`Alee ibn Abee Taalib: when will he be returned to life?’ So I said: “Subhaan Allaah! (I declare Allaah free of all imperfections!) When everybody in the graves is resurrected.” So he said: ‘I do not see except that you are saying the same as those stupid people.’ So I said: “Get him out or I will beat him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Ma`mar: from Qataadah: from Mutarrif who said: “I heard Ibn `Abbaas say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Revising knowledge for an hour is better than spending the whole night awake (in Prayer).”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His mother was Ummul-Fadl Lubaabah bint al-Haarith ibn Huzn ibn Bujayr al-Hilaaliyyah, descended from Hilaal ibn `Aamir.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He had a group of children; the eldest being al `Abbaas -after whom he took his kunyah; and `Alee -the father of the khulafaa· and he was the youngest of them, and al-Fadl, and Muhammad, and `Ubaydullaah, and Lubaabah and Asmaa·.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was a person who was pleasant-looking and handsome, tall in stature, imposing, complete intellect, quick in understanding, a man complete in his characteristics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His children al-Fadl, Muhammad and `Ubaydullaah died without offspring; whereas Lubaabah produced children and descendants from her husband `Alee ibn `Abdullaah ibn Ja`far ibn Abee Taalib; and his other daughter Asmaa·, who was married to her paternal cousin `Abdullaah ibn `Ubaydullaah ibn al-`Abbaas, gave birth to Hasan and Husayn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Abbaas went with his parents to the place of Hijrah [al-Madeenah] in the year of the Conquest, having accepted Islaam before that. So it is established from him that he said: <strong>“I and my mother were from the weak ones (who were excused from migrating): I was a child and my mother from the women.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khaalid al-Hadhdhaa·: from `Ikrimah: from Ibn `Abbaas that he said:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Shihaab narrated: from `Ubaydullaah: from Ibn `Abbaas who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I came riding an ass, and I was close to puberty, and Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) was leading the people in Prayer in Minaa.”</strong></span> [[al-Bukhaaree: no. 492]…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Sa`eed ibn Yoonus said: Ibn `Abbaas went on military expedition to Africa with Ibn Abee Sarh; and fifteen of the people of Egypt narrated from him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo `Abdillaah ibn Mandah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“His mother was Ummul-Fadl, the sister of Ummul-Mu·mineen Maymoonah, and he was born two years before the Hijrah.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was light-skinned and tall; his complexion was tinged with yellow. He was stout and he was handsome, fair of face, and he had hair up to the ears. He dyed with henna, and the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) supplicated for wisdom for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: He was the maternal cousin of Khaalid ibn al-Waleed al- Makhzoomee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa`eed ibn Saalim narrated: Ibn Jurayj narrated to us, saying: we were sitting with `Ataa· in al-Masjidul-Haraam and were speaking about Ibn `Abbaas. So `Ataa· said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I never see the moon on the fourteenth night [[i.e. when full and bright]] except that it reminds me of the face of Ibn `Abbaas.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibraaheem ibn al-Hakam ibn Abaan narrated: from his father: from `Ikrimah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“When Ibn `Abbaas passed along a path-way the women in the walled gardens would say: ‘Is it musk that has gone by, or was it Ibn `Abbaas?’.”…</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hammaad ibn Salamah and others narrate: from `Abdullaah ibn `Uthmaan ibn Khuthaym: from Sa`eed ibn Jubayr: from `Abdullaah [Ibn `Abbaas who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I spent the night in the house of my maternal aunt Maymoonah and I placed some water for the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to take a bath, so he said: &lt;&lt; Who has placed this? &gt;&gt; So they said: ‘`Abdullaah’, so he said: &lt;&lt; O Allaah grant him knowledge of explanation, and grant him understanding of the Religion. &gt;&gt;</strong></span> [[Saheeh: Ahmad, at-Tabaraanee…]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Zur`ah ad-Dimashqee reports in his ‘Taareekh’ from Ibn `Umar that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“He [i.e. Ibn `Abbaas] is the most knowledgeable of the people regarding that which Allaah sent down to Muhammad.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Nu`aym reports in ‘<em>al-Hilyah</em>’ from Shaqeeq who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Ibn `Abbaas delivered a khutbah to us whilst he was in charge of the Hajj. So he started reciting Sooratul-Baqarah. So he would recite and then explain. So I began saying to myself: I have never seen or heard the speech of a man the like of it; if the Persians and the Romans were to hear it they would enter into Islaam. ….</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saalih ibn Rustum al-Khazzaaz narrated: from Ibn Abee Mulaykah: I accompanied Ibn `Abbaas from Makkah to al-Madeenah. So when he camped at a place he would spend half of the night standing in Prayer. So Ayyoob asked him: ‘How had his recitation used to be?’ He said: He recited:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَجَاءَتْ سَكْرَةُ الْمَوْتِ بِالْحَقِّ ۖ ذَٰلِكَ مَا كُنتَ مِنْهُ تَحِيدُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;">And the stupor of death will come in truth: this is what you sought to flee from</span>]]. [Soorah Qaaf (50): 19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he would recite it slowly and carefully, and be sobbing a great deal.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jurayj narrated: from Ibn Abee Mulaykah: that Ibn `Abbaas said: “The people have passed away and the apes remain.” It was said: ‘What are the ‘apes’?’ So he replied: “Those who resemble the people but are not people.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taawoos narrated: from his father: from Ibn `Abbaas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Mu`aawiyah said to me: ‘Are you upon the way of `Alee?!’ So I replied: ‘No, nor upon the way of `Uthmaan. I am upon the way of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Taawoos who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I did not see anyone greater in the respect they showed to Allaah’s prohibitions than Ibn `Abbaas [and whenever I remember him I wished I would weep].</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jareer ibn Haazim narrated: from Ya`laa ibn Hakeem: from `Ikrimah: from Ibn `Abbaas who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;">“When Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) passed away, I said to a man from the Ansaar: “Come let us ask questions of the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) because they are many at this time.” So he said: ‘How surprising of you, O Ibn `Abbaas! Do you think that the people will come to need you, when there are amongst the people the Companions of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) those whom you see?!’ So he left that ,and I began asking. So whenever I heard that a man had a hadeeth I would go to him whilst he was taking the noon siesta. So I would place my cloak as a pillow at his door, and the wind would blow dust over me. Then the man would come out and see me and say: “O cousin of Allaah’s Messenger! Why didn’t you send a message so that I should come to you?’ So I would say: “It is more fitting that I should come to you and ask you.” So the man [of the Ansaar] remained until he found the people gathering around me, so he said ‘This youth was more intelligent than me.’”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdul-Malik ibn Abee Sulaymaan narrated from Sa`eed ibn Jubayr who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;">“Some men of the Muhaajiroon felt that they had a grievance with `Umar because of the fact that he brought Ibn `Abbaas close to him [in gatherings] and did not do so with them; and he used to question him. So `Umar said: “Today I will show you something that will cause you to recognize his excellence.” So he asked them about this Soorah:</span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا جَاءَ نَصْرُ اللَّهِ وَالْفَتْحُ</span></h3>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">[When comes the Help of Allah (to you, O Muhammad (Peace be upon him) against your enemies) and the conquest (of Makkah)] </span><span style="color:#000080;">[Sooratun-Nasr (110)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;">So some of them said: ‘It is a command from Allaah for His Prophet that when he saw them entering into Allaah’s Religion in crowds he was to praise Him and seek His forgiveness.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;">So `Umar said: ‘O Ibn `Abbaas! Speak!’ So he said: “He informed him when he was going to die. Meaning: It will be a sign for the approach of your death, so praise your Lord and seek His forgiveness.” [[So `Umar said: I do not know about it except what you have said.]]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yazeed ibn Ibraaheem narrated: from Sulaymaan al-Ahwal: from Taawoos: from Ibn `Abbaas that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Concerning a single matter I would ask thirty of the Companions of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Its chain of narration is ‘Saheeh’…]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Ikrimah: I heard Mu`aawiyah say to me:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Your master [i.e. Ibn `Abbaas], by Allaah, is the most knowledgeable one of those who have died and those who are alive.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is related from `Aa·ishah that she said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The most knowledgeable person about the Hajj who remains is Ibn `Abbaas.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: And he used to hold Hajj Tamattu` as being what is essential.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">..Ibn Jurayj narrated: from Taawoos who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;I did not see anyone with more piety than Ibn `Umar, nor anyone more knowledgeable than Ibn `Abbaas.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujaahid said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“I never saw anyone the like of Ibn `Abbaas; and he was, at the time he died, the great scholar of this Ummaah.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-A`mash narrated: from Mujaahid who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Ibn `Abbaas used to be called ‘the ocean’ (<em>al-Bahr</em>) because of his extensive knowledge.”…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Masrooq narrated, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“When I would see Ibn `Abbaas I would say: ‘He is the most handsome of the people’, and when he uttered something I would say: ‘He is the most eloquent of the people’, and when he talked I would say: ‘He is the most knowledgeable of the people.’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Qaasim ibn Muhammad said: “I never saw anything futile in the gathering of Ibn `Abbaas.”…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo `Awaanah narrated: from Abul-Juwayriyah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> ‘I saw the Izaar of Ibn `Abbaas half way down his shins, or above that and he had a roman cloak upon him and he was praying.’…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hazm said in his book ‘al-Ihkaam’: Aboo Bakr Muhammad ibn Moosaa ibn Ya`qoob ibn al-Ma·moon, one of the imaams of Islaam, gathered together the verdicts of Ibn `Abbaas in twenty volumes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The debate of Ibn `Abbaas -radiyallaahu `anhumaa- with the Khawaarijee</strong></span> which resulted in the majority of them returning from their innovation to the truth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AT-TABARAANEE reported in ‘<em>al-Mu`jamul Kabeer</em>’ (no. 10598): “Ishaaq ibn Ibraaheem ad-Dabaree narrated to us: from `Abdur-Razzaaq. Further Isnaad: And `Alee ibn `Abdil-`Azeez narrated to us: Aboo Hudhayfah Moosaa ibn Mas`ood narrated to us: both of them from `Ikrimah ibn `Ammaar that Aboo Zameel al-Hanafee narrated to us: that `Abdullaah ibn `Abbaas narrated to us, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">“When the (<em>Khawaarij</em>) separated themselves off in Haarooraa and gathered themselves together in some abode. So I said to `Alee: “O Ameerul Mu·mineen pray the Prayer in its earliest time so that I can then go and speak to those people.” So he said: ‘I fear for you from them.’ So I dressed in the best clothes I could and wore this Yemeni cloak. So I went to them and entered upon them whilst they were resting at the time of the start of the afternoon heat. So I entered upon a people who were such that I have never seen a people who strove harder in worship than them. Their hands were like the knees of camels, and their faces were scarred with the traces of prostration. So when I entered they said: ‘Welcome, O Ibn `Abbaas, what has brought you here?’ So he said: “I came to narrate to you from the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم): the Revelation came down and they know best about its explanation.” So some of them said: ‘Don’t speak with him’ and others said: ‘Rather we will speak with him.’ He said: I said: “Tell me the criticism you have of the son of the uncle of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), his son in law, and the first of those who believed in him; and the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) are along with him.” They said: ‘We criticize him for three things.’ I said: “What are they?” </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">They said: ‘The first of them is that he caused men to pass judgement in Allaah’s Religion, whereas Allaah said:</span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنِ الْحُكْمُ إِلَّا لِلَّهِ</span></h3>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">He said: “And what else?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"> So they said: ‘He fought but did not take any females captured as slaves girls, nor did he seize war-booty. So if the enemy were Disbelievers, then their property was lawful for us; and if they were Believers, then it was forbidden for us to shed their blood.’ </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">He said: I said: “And what else?” </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">They said: ‘He erased his title ‘Ameerul-Mu·mineen’ (chief of the Believers), so if he is not the chief of the Believers, then he must be the chief of the Disbelievers.’ </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">He said: I said: “What do you think if I recite to you from the decisive Book of Allaah, and I narrate to you from the Sunnah of your Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) that which you cannot deny, will you turn back?” They said: ‘Yes’. He said: So I said: </span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">I adjure you by Allaah; does the judgement of men for the sparing of their blood and their persons and rectification of relations between them have more right, or their judgement with regard to a rabbit whose price is a quarter of a dirham?” They said: ‘O Allaah: For sparing their blood and rectifying between them.’ He said: “Have you abandoned this criticism?” They said: ‘O Allaah, yes.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">Then as for your saying that they fought but did not take captured females as slave-girls and did not take war-booty: then would you take your mother as a slave-girl and make lawful from her that which you make lawful regarding other then her, for in that case you would be Disbelievers; and if you claim that she [i.e. `Aa·ishah-<em>radiyallaahu `anhaa</em>] is not your mother, then you are Disbelievers and have left Islaam because Allaah -the Mighty and Majestic-says:</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">النَّبِيُّ أَوْلَىٰ بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ مِنْ أَنفُسِهِمْ ۖ وَأَزْوَاجُهُ أُمَّهَاتُهُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;">The Prophet has more right upon the Believers than their own selves, and his wives are as their mothers</span>]] [Sooratul-Ahzaab (33): 6]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">so you are between two deviations and may choose whichever of them you please. Do you abandon this argument?” They said: ‘O Allaah, yes.’ </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">He said: “As for your saying that he erased his title of ‘Ameerul- Mu·mineen’, then Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) called, on the day of Hudaybiyyah to write an agreement between him and them. So he said: &lt;&lt; Write: This is the judgement agreed to by Muhammad, the Messenger of Allaah. &gt;&gt; So they said: ‘By Allaah, if we knew you to be Allaah’s Messenger we would not prevent you from the House, nor would we have fought against you. But rather write: Muhammad the son of `Abdullaah.’ So he said: &lt;&lt; By Allaah I am the Messenger of Allaah even if you reject me. Write, O `Alee: Muhammad the son of `Abdullaah. &gt;&gt; So Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) was more excellent than `Alee. So do you abandon this criticism?” They said: ‘O Allaah, yes.’ </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">So twenty thousand of them returned and four thousand remained and were killed.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Hasan: ‘as-Saheehul-Musnad min Fadaa·ilis-Sahaabah’ of Mustafaa al- `Adawee (pp. 427-428)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Abbaas died in Taa·if in the year 68 H, and Muhammad ibn al- Hanafiyyah [the son of `Alee ibn Abee Taalib and Khawlah bint al- Hanafiyyah] lead the funeral prayer over him, and said: “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Today the wise scholar (rabbaanee) of this Ummah has died</strong></span>.” -radiyallaahu `anhumaa.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>ABOO HURAIRAH -radiyallaahu `anhu</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Abridged from ‘Siyar A`laamin Nubalaa·’ of Imaam adh-Dhahabee)<br />
Translated by Abu Talha Dawud Burbank <em>rahimahullaah</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Aboo Hurairah ad-Dawsee, al-Yamaanee, the great memorizer, the jurist, the Companion of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم): <strong>`Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Sakhr</strong> in the most well-known saying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His name in the times of ignorance was <strong>`Abd-Shams</strong>. He said: “My father gave me the ‘kunyah’ of Aboo Hurairah (‘Father of the kitten’) because I used to tend some sheep and I found some wild kittens. So when he saw them and heard them he said: ‘You are the father of the cat,’ and my name was `Abd-Shams.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">at-Tabaraanee said: His mother -radiyallaahu `anhaa- was Maymoonah bint Sabeeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Hurairah performed hijrah and arrived at the time of the conquest of Khaybar in the seventh year.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He memorized a huge amount of knowledge from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), no one else acquired as much as him. He also took from Aboo Bakr, `Umar, Ubayy ibn Ka`b and Ka`b.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who narrated from him included al-Agharr Aboo Muslim, Sa`eed ibn al-Musayyib, Basheer ibn Naheek, Hafs ibn `Aasim, Humayd ibn `AbdirRahmaan az-Zuhree, Humayd ibn `Abdir-Rahmaan al-Himyaree, Aboo Saalih as-Sammaan, Khallaas ibn `Amr, Saalim Abul-Ghayth, Sa`eed alMaqburee -and his father Aboo Sa`eed, Sa`eed ibn Marjaanah, Salmaan alAgharr, Aboo Haazim Salaman al-Ashja`ee, Aboo Yoonus Sulaym ibn Jubayr, Sulaymaan ibn Yasaar, Shahr ibn Hawshab, Saalih mawlaa atTaw·amah, Damdam ibn Jaus, Taawoos, ash-Sha`bee, Aboo Idrees alKhawlaanee, Aboo `Uthmaan an-Nahdee, `Abdur-Rahmaan al-A`raj, Iraak ibn Khaalid, `Ikrimah, `Urwah, `Ataa·, Mujaahid, Ibn Seereen, Muhammad ibn Ziyaad al-Jumahee, Muhammad ibn Ka`b, Moosaa ibn Wardaan, Nu`aym al-Mujmir, Naafi` mawlaa Ibn `Umar, Hammaam ibn Munabbih, and a very great number of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was one of the treasure-houses of knowledge, and one of the major imaams in verdicts, along with his great dignity and excellence, his worship and his humility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Bukhaaree said: &#8220;<strong>Eight hundred people narrated from him</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said: He was yellowish-brown, broad-shouldered, having his central incisor teeth widely spaced, he had two locks of hair and he used to dye with red dye. He was a poor man from the people of ‘as-Suffah’, he experienced hunger and need.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then after the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) his condition improved and his wealth increased, and he was a person who worshipped and remembered Allaah a great deal. He came to be the governor of al-Madeenah and deputed for Marwaan in his leadership, and he used to pass through the market of al-Madeenah with a bundle of firewood, saying: “Make room on the path for the chief”, and he used to joke -radiyallaahu `anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul-Qaasim ibn Nahhaas: I heard Aboo Bakr ibn Abee Daawood say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> “I saw Aboo Hurairah in a dream, whilst I was in Sijjistaan and was compiling his ahaadeeth, and he had a thick beard, was brown, and was wearing coarse clothes. So I said to him: “I love you”. So he replied: “I am the first student of ahaadeeth in the world.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ismaa`eel ibn Abee Khaalid: from Qays: from Aboo Hurairah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“When I migrated to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) I said along the way: ‘Oh what a long wearing night; yet it brought about rescue from the land of Unbelief’.” He said: “And a slave belonging to me ran away. So when I came and gave the pledge of allegiance the slave appeared, so the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: &lt;&lt; This is your slave, O Hurairah. &gt;&gt; So I said: “He is free for the Face of Allaah”, so I set him free.”</span></strong> [al-Bukhaaree: (no. 2531)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Ayyoob: from Muhammad: that Aboo Hurairah used to say to his daughter:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Do not wear gold, because I fear for you the blazing flame.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Saalim ibn Hayyaan: from his father: from Aboo Hurairah that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;I grew up as an orphan, and performed <em>Hijrah</em> as a poor man, and I used to be a hired worker for the daughter of Ghazwaan and my wages were food for my stomach and a turn upon the riding beast. So I would drive the camels along when they rode, and I would collect firewood when they stopped somewhere. So All praise is for Allaah Who gave strength and authority to the Religion and Who made Aboo Hurairah an <em>Imaam</em>.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-az-Zuhree: from Saalim: that he heard Aboo Hurairah say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“A people in the state of <em>ihraam</em> asked me about people not in the state of <em>ihraam</em> giving them as a gift some game that had been hunted, so I told them to eat it. Then I met `Umar and informed him of this, so he said: ‘If you had given them a different verdict I would have punished you’.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Qays ibn Abee Haazim: from Aboo Hurairah who said: “I came on the day of Khaybar after they had finished fighting.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Ibn Seereen said: Aboo Hurairah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“I would sometimes faint between the grave and the <em>minbar</em> because of severe hunger to the extent that the people would say: ‘He is possessed’, so a man would sit upon my chest. So I would raise up my head and say: “It is not what you think, it is just hunger.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Ahmad narrated in his ‘Musnad’ from Aboo Katheer as-Suhaymee from Aboo Hurairah who said: Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>O Allaah make this slave of yours -meaning Aboo Hurairah- and his mother beloved to your believing servants, and make them beloved to the two of them</strong>.</span> &gt;&gt; [Muslim: (2491)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Ibn Abee Dhi·b: from al-Maqburee: from Aboo Hurairah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“ I preserved two sack-fulls of knowledge from Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). So as for one of them, then I distributed it amongst the people; and as for the other one, then if I had opened it, then my throat would have been cut off.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[alBukhaaree: (no. 120): Ibn Hajr said in ‘Fathul-Baaree’: The scholars understand the sack of knowledge which he did not spread to be the ahaadeeth which gave the names of the evil rulers, and their conditions, and their times; and Aboo Hurairah used to allude to some of that but not state it plainly, out of fear of them for himself.]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-al-A`mash: from Aboo Saalih as-Sammaan who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Aboo Hurairah was one of the greatest memorizers amongst the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-ash-Shaafi`ee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Aboo Hurairah was the greatest memorizer who narrated hadeeth in his time.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kahmas narrated from `Abdullaah ibn Shaqeeq who said: Aboo Hurairah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> “I do not know anyone from the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) who memorized more of his ahaadeeth than me.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Aboo Daawood at-Tayaalisee: `Imraan al-Qattaan related to us: from Bakr ibn `Abdillaah: from Aboo Raafi`: from Aboo Hurairah that he met Ka`b and began narrating to him and asking him. So Ka`b said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I have not seen anyone who has not read the <em>Tawraat</em> having better knowledge of what is contained in it than Aboo Hurairah.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Hushaym: from Ya`laa ibn `Ataa·: from al-Waleed ibn `Abdir-Rahmaan: from Ibn `Umar that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> “O Aboo Hurairah: You were the one amongst us who most closely accompanied Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and the most knowledgeable of us of his ahaadeeth.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Hammaad ibn Zayd: from `Abbaas al-Jurayree: I heard Aboo `Uthmaan anNahdee who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I took Aboo Hurairah as a guest for seven days; so he, his wife and his servant followed each other, dividing the night into three. One would pray and then awaken the next who would pray, and would then awaken the third.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Ibraaheem ibn Yoosuf related to us: Ibn Rawaahah related to us: as-Silafee related to us: Ibn al-Busree related to us: as-Sukkaree related to us: asSaffaar related to us: ar-Ramaadee related to us: `Abdur-Razzaaq related to us: Ma`mar related to us: from Muhammad ibn Ziyaad who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Mu`aawiyah used to appoint Aboo Hurairah to be the governor of alMadeenah, but if he became angry with him he would send Marwaan to replace him, but it would not be long before he would re-appoint Aboo Hurairah and remove Marwaan. So he said to a black slave: “Stand at the door and do not prevent anyone from entering except Marwaan. So the servant did so. Then later when it became the turn of Marwaan he entered and said: “We were prevented (from entry)!” So he replied: ‘‘The one having the most right that I should not deny him is you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khuthaym ibn `Iraak narrated from his father: from Aboo Hurairah that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) had gone off to Khaybar when I came as a muhaajir to al-Madeenah. So I prayed the Dawn Prayer behind Sibaa` ibn `Urfutah whom he had left in charge and in the first rak`ah he recited Soorah Maryam, and in the other one [Sooratul-Mutaffifeen] So I said: “Woe to my father! How rare it is to find a man in the land of the Azd except that he has two measures: a measure for himself and another one to short-change the people with.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Humayd ibn `Abdir-Rahmaan al-Himyaree said: “He accompanied (the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) for four years.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He suffered hunger and poverty, and adhered to the mosque. When he migrated he had a slave of his along with him but he fled and got away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hishaam: from Muhammad [i.e. Ibn Seereen] who said: we were in the presence of Aboo Hurairah [and he was wearing two linen garments dyed with red clay], and he blew his nose and wiped it upon his upper garment and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“All praise is for Allaah who has provided Aboo Hurairah with linen to blow his nose on! For I have seen a time when I would faint between the house of `Aa·ishah and the minbar because of severe hunger. So then a man would pass by and sit upon my chest </span></strong><span style="color:#000000;">[thinking that I had become possessed]</span><strong><span style="color:#000000;">. So I would raise up my head and say: “It is not what you think, it is just hunger.”</span></strong>[[al-Bukhaaree: no. 7324]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I [i.e. adh-Dhahabee] say: Those who saw him would think that he was possessed, and so sit on him to recite ‘ruqyah’ upon him, or the like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…from `Aamir: from Aboo Hurairah that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> “I was in as-Suffah </strong>[[a shaded place at the rear of the mosque of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) where the poor and those with no accommodation would stay]]<strong> so Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) sent some `Ajwah dates to us, so we would take two dates together because of our hunger; and when one of us wanted to take two dates at a time he would say to his companion: I am taking two dates at a time, so do likewise.”</strong></span>[[‘as-Saheehah’: 2323]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujaahid narrated: that Aboo Hurairah used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"> “By Allaah, besides Whom none has the right to be worshipped, I used to lay down on the ground resting upon my liver because of hunger, and I used to tie a stone upon my belly because of hunger. One day I sat by the way where the people would come out, and Aboo Bakr passed by. So I asked him about an Aayah from the Book of Allaah, and I only asked him so that he would satisfy my hunger, but then he carried on and did not do so. Then `Umar passed by me and so I asked him about an Aayah from the Book of Allaah, and I only asked him so that he would satisfy my hunger, but then he carried on and did not do so. Then Abul-Qaasim (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) passed by me and smiled when he saw me and recognized what was in my heart and on my face. He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>O Aboo Hirr!</strong> &gt;&gt; I replied: “At your service, O Messenger of Allaah.” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Follow me</strong> &gt;&gt;. So he proceeded and I followed him, and he entered his house. So I requested permission to enter and was admitted. So he entered and found some milk in a bowl. So he said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Where is this milk from?</strong> &gt;&gt; So they said: ‘It was presented as a gift by such and such man, or such and such woman.’ He said: &lt;&lt;<strong> O Aboo Hirr!</strong> &gt;&gt; I said: “At your service, O Messenger of Allaah!” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>go to the people of ‘Suffah’ and call them to me</strong> &gt;&gt; and the people of ‘Suffah’ were the guests of Islaam: they did not have families, wealth or any person to support them. So whenever some charity came to him he would send it to them, and he would not take anything from it himself; and whenever something was sent to him as a gift he would send something to them and take some of it himself, and cause them to share in it. So his order upset me and I said (to myself): ‘How will this small quantity of milk be enough for the people of ‘as-Suffah’?!’ I felt I was more entitled to drink from that milk in order to strengthen myself by it. But if they came, then he would command me to give it to them; and then what would remain of that milk for me?!’ However I could not but obey Allaah and obey His Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). So I went to them and invited them and they came. So they sought permission to enter and he admitted them. So they took their seats in the house. He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>O Aboo Hirr!</strong> &gt;&gt; I said “At your service, O Messenger of Allaah!” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Take it and give it to them</strong>. &gt;&gt; So I took it and started by giving it to one man who drank until he was full, and then he returned it to me. Then I gave it to the next man who drank until he was full and then returned it to me, until I came to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and all of the people had drank until they were full. So he took the bowl and placed it upon his hand, then he looked at me and smiled, and said: &lt;&lt; <strong>O Aboo Hirr!</strong> &gt;&gt; I said: “At your service, O Messenger of Allaah!” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>There remain I and you</strong>. &gt;&gt; I said: “You have spoken the truth, O Messenger of Allaah.” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Sit down and drink.</strong> &gt;&gt; So I sat down and drank. He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Drink!</strong> &gt;&gt; So I drank, and he kept on saying: “Drink!” until I said: “No, by the One Who sent you with the truth, I have no more room for it.” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Hand it to me</strong>. &gt;&gt; So I gave him the bowl, and he praised Allaah and mentioned Allaah’s Name upon it and drank the remainder.”</span> [al-Bukhaaree: (no. 6452)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…Aboo Katheer as-Suhaymee and his name was Yazeed ibn `AbdirRahmaan narrated: that Aboo Hurairah narrated to me, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“By Allaah, Allaah has not created a true Believer who hears of me except that he loves me.” I said: ‘How do you know that?’ He said: “My mother was a Mushrik woman, and I used to call her to Islaam but she would not accept it from me. So I called her one day but she said something disagreeable to me about Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). So I went to Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and I was weeping. So I informed him and asked him to supplicate for her, so he said: &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#808000;">O Allaah guide the mother of Aboo Hurairah</span>.</span> &gt;&gt; So then I went out running to give her the good news. So I arrived and the door was closed and I heard the splashing of water, and she heard the sound of my footsteps. So she said: ‘Wait as you are!’ Then she opened the door, and she had put her gown on, and had been too hasty to put on her khimaar. So she said: ‘I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and that Muhammad is His Slave and His Messenger.’ He said: “So I went back to Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) weeping with joy just as I had wept from sorrow, and I informed him, and I said: “Make supplication to Allaah that he should cause me and my mother to be beloved to His believing servants. So he said: &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#808000;">O Allaah make this slave of Yours and his mother beloved to Your believing servants, and cause them to be loved by these two</span>. &gt;&gt;” &#8211;</strong></span>“Its chain of narration is ‘hasan’.” [[Reported by Ahmad (2/319-320), and Muslim (no. 2491)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Shihaab: from Sa`eed [Ibn al-Musayyib] and Aboo Salamah: that Aboo Hurairah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> “You people say that ‘Aboo Hurairah narrates too many ahaadeeth from Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)! And you say that why is it not the case that the <em>Muhaajiroon</em> and the <em>Ansaar</em> do not narrate like him!’ But my brothers from the <em>Muhaajiroon</em> were busy in the markets, and my brothers from the <em>Ansaar</em> were busy working upon their property. But I was a poor man from the poor people of ‘<em>as-Suffah</em>’. I used to adhere to Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and be content with what filled my stomach. So I would be present when they were absent, and remember when they would forget; and Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said to us one day: &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#808000;">No one will spread out his garment till I have finished what I am saying, and then gather his garment upon himself except that he will preserve whatever I say</span>. &gt;&gt; So I spread out a striped cloak which I had upon me until he finished what he was saying, and then gathered it upon my chest. So I did not forget anything from that narration.”</span></strong> [[al-Bukhaaree (no. 2047) and Muslim (no. 2492)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">az-Zuhree, also: from al-A`raj: from Aboo Hurairah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> “You claim that I narrate excessively from Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)! Whereas the truth is known by Allaah. I was a poor man who accompanied Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and contented myself with whatever filled my stomach. So he narrated to us one day and said: &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#808000;">Whoever will spread out his garment, will never forget anything which he heard from me.</span> &gt;&gt; So I did so, and by the One Who sent him with the truth I have never forgotten anything which I heard from him.”</span></strong> [[al-Bukhaaree (nos. 118 &amp; 2350); Muslim (no. 2492)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…al-Maqburee: from Aboo Hurairah who said: I said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“O Messenger of Allaah who will be the most fortunate of people to attain your intercession?” He said: &lt;&lt;<span style="color:#808000;"> I thought that none would ask me about this before you, because I have seen your eagerness upon learning hadeeth: The most fortunate of the people to attain my intercession on the day of resurrection will be whoever says: ‘None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah’, sincerely from his heart</span>. &gt;&gt;</strong></span> [[al-Bukhaaree (no. 99)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ash-Shaafi`ee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Aboo Hurairah was the best memorizer of those who narrated hadeeth in his time</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…from Hammaam [ibn Munabbih] who said: I heard Aboo Hurairah say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“There is no one from the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) who has more hadeeth than me, except for `Abdullaah ibn `Amr because he used to write, whereas I did not write.”</strong></span> [[al-Bukhaaree (no. 113)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdul-Waahid ibn Ziyaad and others: `Aasim ibn Kulayb narrated to us: My father narrated to us that he heard Aboo Hurairah, and he used to begin narrating hadeeth by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: &lt;&lt; Who ever lies upon me deliberately, then let him take his place in the Fire. &gt;&gt;”</strong></span> [[Ahmad: (2/413)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…from Ibn `Umar that he said to Aboo Hurairah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>O Aboo Hurairah! You were the one from us who most closely adhered to Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), and the one from us who best memorized his ahaadeeth</strong></span>.” [[‘Saheeh Sunanit-Tirmidhee (no. 3836)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Hurairah passed away in the year 58 H, and this was stated by a group; and others said: 59 H; and it was said: 57 H -radiyallaahu `anhu- at the age of 78.”</p>

Translated by Abu <u>T</u>al<u>h</u>ah Dawud Burbank <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Author’s Introduction</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah, Lord of the worlds and may His praises and peace be upon the noblest of Messengers and upon his family and all his Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>To proceed:</strong> I have included in this treatise the answer to a question asked about that which has been named <em><strong>Fiqh ul- Waaqi&#8217;</strong></em> , its ruling, how great is the Muslims’ need for it and an explanation of its correct form in the <em>Sharee’ah</em>. The basis for this treatise was an unprepared answer in a sitting from the sittings of knowledge, in which there were, all praise is for Allaah, a number of Muslim youth keen to seek correct knowledge, drawn from the Book and the Sunnah, upon the <em>manhaj</em> of the <em>Salaf us- Saalih</em> (the Pious Predecessors), the best of this Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of these brothers, may Allaah reward him with good, transcribed my words from cassette-tape and presented it to me. I corrected it, added to it and revised it for publication, such that its benefit would be more universal and of greater worth , if Allaah wills. I ask Allaah to make this brief treatise of benefit to it’s reader and to make it of use to those who seek it. Indeed He is the One. who hears and responds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad Naasir ud-Deen al-Albaanee<br />
Ammaan, 29th of Shawwaal 1412H.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Knowledge of Current Affairs</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah. We praise Him, seek His aid, seek His forgiveness and we seek Allaah&#8217;s refuge from the evil of ourselves and from our evil actions. Whosoever Allaah guides, then none can misguide him and whosoever Allaah misguides, then none can guide him. I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Allaah alone, having no partners and I bear witness that Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) is His slave and Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The nations are about to call each other and set upon you just as the diners sets upon food.” </strong></span><strong style="color:#000000;">It was said, Will it be because of our small number that day. </strong><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said, “Rather, on that day you will be many, but you will be like foam, like the foam on the river and Allaah will remove the fear of you from the hearts of your enemies and will throw weakness (<em>wahn</em>) into your hearts.” </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> Someone said, O Messenger of Allaah, what is <em>wahn</em>? </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said, “Love of the world and hatred for death.”</strong></span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<em>Saheeh</em> &#8211; related by Abu Daawood (4297), ar-Rooyaanee in <em>al-Musnad</em> (2/ 134/25), Ibn Asaakir in <em>Taareekh Dimashq</em> (2/ 97/ 8) from Thawbaan &#8211;<em> radiallaahu ’anhu</em>. It was authenticated in <em>as-Saheehah</em> (958) of Shaikh al-Albaanee.]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The State of Affairs of the Muslims</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This noble prophetic hadeeth has manifested, with the strongest expression and clearest image, the very great trial (<em>fitnah</em>) that has come upon the Muslims, which has destroyed their unity, weakened their resolve and split their ranks. Part of this trial has struck at the root of the hearts of a great number of <em>du’aat</em> and students of knowledge so that they have become divided , regretfully, between themselves. Some of them speaking ill of others and the others criticizing the remainder and refuting them.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Recognizing the Truth through Refutation</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These rebuttals on their own, or these criticisms alone, will harm neither the one refuting, nor the one refuted. Since, with the people of Justice, the truth is recognized by its light and its proofs. This is not so with the people of blind-sectarianism and deviation. But what will harm them is speech without knowledge, talking without restraint and speaking untruthfully about the servants of Allaah!</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Matter of <em>Fiqh ul-Waaqi’</em></strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During this trial, various questions have sprung-up concerning <em>fiqh</em>, <em>manhaj</em> and <em>da’wah</em> and we were able to answer them at that time with answers backed by knowledge and all praise is for Allaah, the Most Perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Amongst the questions brought about by this trial, about which there had been much talk is that which some have decided to start calling F<em>iqh ul- Waaqi</em>. I do not argue concerning the form of this knowledge for which they have newly invented this name which is <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi’</em> , since many of the scholars have previously written that those who should take on the responsibility of guiding the Ummah and providing answers to their problems (that they) should be aware of and know their state of affairs. Therefore, from amongst those sayings well-known is: Passing judgement about a matter comes after comprehending it. This does not come about except by knowing the situation surrounding the matter under discussion. This is a basic principle of giving religious verdicts (<em>fataawaa</em>) in particular and from the principles of knowledge in general.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">S0 <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi</em>’, is to find out those things which are of importance to the Muslims from their affairs, or the plans of their enemies, in order to warn them and uplift them practically. It is not speculative talk nor preoccupying oneself with news and reports about the unbelievers nor drowning oneself in analyzing them and their thoughts!</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Importance of Knowing the State of Affairs</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So knowing the situation in order to arrive by it at the <em>Sharee’ah</em> ruling is an important obligation from the obligations which have to be carried out by a discerning section of the specialist Muslim students of knowledge. Just like any branch of <em>Sharee’ah</em> knowledge, or social, economic or military affairs or any knowledge which benefits the Ummah of lslaam and brings it closer to the roads leading to a return of its strength, splendour and supremacy; especially when these branches of knowledge develop with the change of time and place.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Some Categories of <em>Fiqh</em> which are Obligatory</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It must be mentioned here, that the category of <em>Fiqh</em> [<span style="color:#ff0000;">2</span>] required from the Muslims as a whole is not just the <em>Fiqh</em> of the schools of thought, which they know and are instructed in, nor this <em>Fiqh</em> which some of the young <em>du’aat</em> have become aware of and started to call the attention of others towards. Since the categories of Fiqh which are obligatory upon the Muslims to master, even if they are only of the level of being obligatory upon some (<em>Fard Kifaayah</em>) are greater than all of this, and more widespread.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">2</span>] <em>Fiqh</em>: Understanding. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said. as is related by al-Bukhaaree (1/25) and at-Tahaawee in <em>Mushkil ul-Aathaar</em> (2/278): “<em><strong>When Allaah intends excellence for someone, He gives them the understanding (Fiqh) of the Deen. Indeed I am the distributor and Allaah is the giver</strong>.</em> (Publisher’s Note)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from this, for example, is <em>Fiqh ul-Kitaab</em> (understanding the Book), <em>Fiqh us-Sunnah</em> (understanding the Sunnah), <em>Fiqh ul-Lughah</em> (understanding the Language), <em>Fiqh us-Sunan ul-Kawniyyah</em> (understanding the ways in which the creation Operates), <em>Fiqh ul-Khilaaf</em> (understanding the differences between the scholars) and their like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These categories of <em>Fiqh</em> , in general, are of no lesser importance than the two types of Fiqh previously indicated, whether the Fiqh that is well- known or <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi</em> ’ which we are at the moment trying to clarify here. Despite all of this, we do not find anyone who calls the attention of the people to these categories of Fiqh! Particularly <em>Fiqh ul-Kitaab was-Sunnah</em>, which is the head of these categories and is their foundation. This Fiqh, which if someone were to say that it is obligatory upon every individual (<em>Fard ’Ayn</em>), then he would not be far wrong, due to the dire need of the Muslims for it and how necessary it is for them. Yet, in spite of this, we do not hear those who speak constantly about it, laying down its methodology, nor occupying the youth with it, nor training and cultivating them upon it!</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What We Need is the <em>Manhaj</em>, not Mere Talk</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, there are many, all praise is for Allaah, who speak about the Book and the Sunnah today and point to them. However, the obligation that we require is not in merely writing a small work here and giving a lecture there, but rather What we need is that the Book and the Sunnah are made the general framework for every small or large matter and that their <em>manhaj</em> is made the undergarment and overgarment of <em>Da’wah</em> &#8211; its beginning and its end and that the thinking of those youths and others who are giving <em>Da’wah</em> should be lead in accordance with this great <em>manhaj</em> , upon which is the only means for the well-being of the Ummah. So there has to be scholars in every branch of <em>Fiqh</em> that has preceded, particularly <em>Fiqh</em> of the Book and the Sunnah, with clear criteria and principles.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Partitioning of the People through <em>Fiqh ul-Waaqi’</em></span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have heard and noticed that many Muslim youth have become trapped in a predicament about this branch of knowledge which they have called <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi’</em> and have regretfully partitioned into two groups at variance with each other. Some have gone beyond the bounds in this matter and others have fallen short of the mark! Since you will see and hear from those who over-inflate the importance of <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi’</em> and place it in a very high position, above its correct place amongst the branches of knowledge, that they want every scholar of the <em>Sharee’ ah</em> to be a scholar of what they call <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi</em>’! Just as the reverse also occurs from them. Those who listen to them and are instructed by them are made to think that everyone who is aware of the state of affairs (<em>waaqi</em>’) of the Islaamic world is (also) a scholar of the Book and the Sunnah and is upon the <em>manhaj</em> of the <em>Salaf us-Saalih</em>. This does not automatically follow, as is clear.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Completeness is Something Very Rare</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not expect to find a human being who is complete in every sense of the word, i.e., that we find one (person) who is a scholar of all these branches of knowledge that we have indicated and spoken about. Therefore, it is obligatory that all those who have spent their time and effort in coming to know the state of affairs of the Islaamic Ummah and the plots against it should work and co-operate with the scholars of the Book and the Sunnah, upon the <em>manhaj</em> of the <em>Salaf</em> of this Ummah. So they should put forward their Views and ideas and the scholars should explain Allaah&#8217;s ruling, Most perfect is He, based upon the authentic proof and clear evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who speaks about <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi</em>’ ; in the minds of those who hear him, he becomes one of the scholars and <em>muftees</em>, for no other reason than that he speaks about this <em>Fiqh</em> which we have indicated. This is something not in any way supported by truth. Then his words are taken as a stepping stone to reject the religious verdicts given by the scholars and to invalidate their <em>ijtihaad</em> and rulings which they have clarified.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Mistake of a Scholar Does Not Mean that He is to be Renounced</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is important to mention here that a scholar may make a mistake in passing judgement about a particular matter from these questions relating to the state of affairs, this has happened and will happen. Does this mean that the scholar is to be renounced and that those who disagree with him should describe him with improper words which it is not permissible to use for him? For example and it has been said: He is a scholar of the <em>Sharee’ah</em> and he is not a scholar of the current affairs! This is a statement which conflicts both with the <em>Sharee’ah</em> and the true state of affairs!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to this saying of theirs, it is as if they make it obligatory for the scholars of the Book and the Sunnah to also be fully aware of economics, social-affairs, politics, military affairs, use of modern weapons-systems and other matters also! I do not think that there is a sensible human who imagines all of these branches of knowledge and disciplines combined in the heart of a single man, however great a scholar or however complete!</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Mistake of Being Ignorant of the State of Affairs</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have also heard people saying: It is not important for us to know the state of affairs. This is also an error. Rather justice demands that it be said: There must be for every branch of knowledge those who know about it and specialize in it and that they all work together as required by Islaam as sincere brothers, not due to partisanship , nor sectarianism &#8211; in order to realize that which is of benefit to the Islaamic Ummah and to establish the Islaamic society that every Muslim aspires to, such that Allaah’s <em>Sharee’ah</em> is applied upon His earth. Each of these branches of knowledge are obligatory upon some of the scholars of the Muslims and it is not obligatory at all that a single person gathers all of them, not to mention the impossibility of that actually occurring!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example: In some cases, it is not permissible for a surgeon to carry out a particular operation until he has obtained the View of a scholar of the Book of Allaah, the Most Perfect and the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), upon the <em>manhaj</em> of the <em>Salafus-Saalih</em>. Since it is difficult, if we do say impossible, to find a proficient surgeon who also has good knowledge of the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, their <em>Fiqh</em> and the rulings derived from them.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Obligation of Co-operation</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, there has to be co-operation, acting upon the saying of the Lord of the worlds in His noble Book:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَتَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَىٰ ۖ وَلَا تَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Help you one another in righteousness and piety and do not help one another in sin and transgression.</span> [Sooratul-Maa‘idah (5):2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Through this, the good that is hoped for, for the Islaamic <em>Ummah</em> may be attained. This matter is something obvious, since a Muslim cannot think of a scholar having great knowledge of the Book and the Sunnah and then further that he is a skilled surgeon. Then on top of that, he is fully aware of what they call today <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi</em>’. Since, when he occupies himself with one branch of knowledge, that will reduce his time spent on other branches of knowledge. Thus, if he gives greater importance to a certain field then he will naturally be detracted from other fields and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Completeness will not come about except by all of them working together, each of them in his special field. By this means and this means alone, what the <em>Sharee’ah</em> wishes, for all the Muslims, can be achieved and they can be saved from clear ruin. The Lord of the worlds says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَالْعَصْرِ &#8211; </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ &#8211; </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِلَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالْحَقِّ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">By Time! Verily man is in loss. Except those who believe and do righteous deeds and help one another to the truth and help one another to patience.‘</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<em>Sooratul-‘Asr</em> (103) :1-3]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Going Beyond Bounds Regarding that which is Essential</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet what we have noticed and still notice, is that the wild and fervent emotions which know no bounds have a number of negative results.From them is going beyond bounds in that which is essential. Since that which is obligatory and essential is of two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: That which is obligatory upon every Muslim (<em>Fard ’Ayn</em>)<br />
<strong>Secondly</strong>: That which, if carried out by some, then it is not required from the rest (<em>Fard Kifaaee</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible to treat the <em>Fard Kifaaee</em> like the <em>Fard ’Ayn</em> and to make them equal. Even if we were to say, for the sake of argument, that it were obligatory upon the up and coming students of knowledge to know <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi</em>’. How could that be? Since we are not even able to apply this unrestricted statement to the major scholars of the Muslims, not to mention making it obligatory upon the students of knowledge to know the state of affairs, along with the necessary <em>Fiqh</em> demanded by this knowledge, so that each case can be given its fitting ruling.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Fiqh ul-Waaqi</em>’ is not to be Rejected</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, since this is the case, it is not permissible for any of the students of knowledge to reject the necessity of this <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi</em>’. Since it is not possible to obtain that which was lost and is hoped for by all the Muslims, which is freeing ourselves from the colonialization of the Muslim lands by the unbelievers , or at the very least, some of them, except by knowing their mutual plots and agreements, in order to beware and warn, so that their colonialization and enslavement of the Islaamic world ceases to continue. A large part of this goal cannot be attained except by educating and cultivating the Muslim youth correctly in <em>Aqeedah</em>, knowledge and <em>manhaj</em>, built upon the purification (<em>tasfiyah</em>) of Islaam from all the accretions that have been added to it and upon the principle of cultivation and education (<em>tarbiyah</em>) upon this pure Islaam, just as Allaah sent it down upon the heart of His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم).</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Between the Scholars and the Rulers</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From those matters which need to be mentioned here is that the ones who have the ability to bring the Ummah to carry out that which is obligatory upon it, whether upon all or some of them, are not those passionate speakers, nor the academic scholars, rather they are the rulers (<em>hukkaam</em>) who have the power of giving orders and having them implemented and to enact and to dissolve, nor are they the enthusiastic youth, nor emotional <em>du’aat</em> who carry no weight, nor authority with them!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the speakers, the scholars and the callers must educate and train the Muslims to accept the law of Islaam and to submit to it and also to call the rulers with that which is best, to that which is right. To use the scholars properly with their various levels and types of knowledge: <em>Fiqh</em> of the Book and the Sunnah, <em>Fiqh</em> of the Language, <em>Fiqh</em> of the ways in which the creation operates, <em>Fiqh</em> of the state of affairs and likewise for all important matters. Putting into effect the great Islaamic principle of <em>Shooraa</em> (carrying out the affairs through consultation), then on that day will the affairs be straightened out and the Believers rejoice at the victory from Allaah:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَإِنْ أَعْرَضُوا فَمَا أَرْسَلْنَاكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَفِيظًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">But if they turn away, then We have not sent you as a protector over them.</span> [Sooratush-Shooraa (42):48]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Reason Behind the Degradation of the Muslims</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A very important matter must be explained here, about which many are unaware. The reason why the Muslims continue to be downtrodden and enslaved by the unbelievers, even by the Jews of some Islaamic lands, is not that many of the people of knowledge are ignorant about the state of affairs, not knowing the plots and the plans of the Unbelievers, as some think!</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">From the Mistake of Some <em>Du’aat</em></span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, I hold that giving extra and undue importance to <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi</em> , such that it becomes a total program for the <em>du’aat</em> and the youth, upon which they are educated and educate others, thinking that it is the way to salvation, is an evident error and a clear mistake! The matter about which no two scholars differ and about which no two goats would lock horns over is that the primary reason for the degradation which has settled upon the Muslims is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: The ignorance of the Muslims of the Islaam which Allaah sent down upon the heart of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: That many of the Muslims who know about the Islaamic rulings for some of their affairs do not put them into practice, but neglect them and allow them to fall into disuse.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Tasfiyah and Tarbiyah</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the key to a return of the glory of Islaam is: Implementation of beneficial knowledge (’<em>Ilm un-Naafi’</em>) and establishing righteous action (’<em>Amal us-Saalih</em>) and this is a very great affair which the Muslims cannot reach, except through the <em>manhaj</em> of <em>tasfiyah</em> and <em>tarbiyah</em>. These are two very great obligations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By the first of these the following is intended:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: Purifying the Islaamic ’<em>Aqeedah</em> from that which is alien to it, such as Shirk (associating partners along with Allaah in those things that are specific to Him), <em>ta’teel</em> (denial of Allaah’s attributes), <em>ta’weel</em> (twisting the meanings of Allaah’s attributes) and refusing authentic ahaadeeth because they are connected to ’<em>Aqeedah</em>, and their like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: Purifying the Islaamic Fiqh from the erroneous judgements made, which are contrary to the Book and the Sunnah, freeing the minds from the bonds of blind-following and the darkness of sectarianism.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>: Purifying the books of <em>tafseer</em>, <em>fiqh</em>, <em>raqaaiq</em> (matters concerning the heart) and other than that, from <em>ahaadeeth</em> that are weak (<em>da’eef</em>), fabricated (<em>maudoo</em>’) and unsupported narrations of the people of the Book (<em>Israaeeleeyaat</em>) and reprehensible matters (<em>munkaraat</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As regards the second obligation:</strong> Then by it I mean cultivating the young generation upon this Islaam, purified from all that we have mentioned, giving them a correct Islaamic education from the beginning, without any influence of the infidel western education.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt, that bringing these two obligations about requires huge efforts and sincere co-operation between all of the Muslims organisations and individuals, from all of those who are truly concerned with establishing the desired Islaamic society, each one working in his own field and speciality.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Correct Islaam</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the scholars who know the rulings from the correct Islaam must take pains to call the Muslims to this correct Islaam and bring them to understand it, then to cultivate them upon it, just as Allaah says:</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَٰكِن كُونُوا رَبَّانِيِّينَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تُعَلِّمُونَ الْكِتَابَ وَبِمَا كُنتُمْ تَدْرُسُونَ</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Rather, be you <em>Rabbaani’yyeen</em>,</span>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">01</span>] <span style="color:#008000;">because you teach the Book and you study it. </span><br />
[Soorah Aal-‘Imraan (3):79]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">01</span>] <em>Rabbaanee</em> (plural: <em>Rabbaaniyyeen</em>) is the scholar who acts upon his knowledge and has insight into the condition of the people, so that he raises them upon the primary matters of knowledge before that which is more detailed. </span><span style="color:#999999;">In his Jaami’ us-Saheeh (1/192 &#8211; with Fath), al-Bukhaaree &#8211; <em>rahimahullaah</em> &#8211; says: Ibn ‘Abbaas said: “<em>Be Rabbaaniyyeen. wise-ones and scholars</em>.” It is said: The <em>Rabbaanee</em> is one who teaches people simple knowledge before the more difficult one. (Publisher’s note)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the only solution, which comes in the Book and the Sunnah, as is in His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> إِن تَنصُرُوا اللَّهَ يَنصُرْكُمْ وَيُثَبِّتْ أَقْدَامَكُمْ</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">If you help Allaah then Allaah will help you and establish your feet firmly.</span><br />
[Soorah Muhammad (47) : 7]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>How Will Allaah’s Help Come?</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah. From those things about which there is total agreement between the Muslims is that:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِن تَنصُرُوا اللَّهَ يَنصُرْكُمْ </strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">If you help Allaah then Allaah will help you. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means if you carry out what He has ordered you to do, then Allaah will grant you victory over your enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the most important texts that support this meaning and which totally fits the state of affairs in which we are presently living, in that the disease and the cure are both mentioned together is his (صلى الله عليه وسلم) saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“When you indulge in <em>eenah</em> transactions and take hold of the tails of cows and become satisfied with cultivation and abandon <em>Jihaad</em> , then Allaah will cover you with humiliation, which He will not remove from you, until you return to your <em>Deen</em>.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[<em>Saheeh</em> &#8211; related by Abu Daawood (3426), ad-Dawlaabee. in <em>al-Kunaa</em> (2/65), aI-Baihaqee in <em>as-Sunan ul-Kubraa</em> (5 / 3l 6) and others, from Ibn ’Umar &#8211; <em>radiallaahu ’anhu</em>. It was authenticated by al-Albaanee in <em>as-Saheehah</em> (11).]</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Reason for the Sickness of the Muslims</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the sickness of the Muslims today is not because of their ignorance of any particular branch of knowledge. Although, I agree that every branch of knowledge which is of benefit to the Muslims is obligatory in proportion to this. But the reason for the degradation which has come upon the Muslims is not their ignorance of this knowledge known today as <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi&#8217;</em> ’. Rather, the reason, as occurs in the authentic <em>hadeeth</em>, is their neglecting action in accordance with the rulings of the <em>Deen</em>, from the Book and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His (صلى الله عليه وسلم) saying: “<strong>When you indulge in <em>eenah</em> transactions</strong>” is an indication of a type of usurious transaction, seeking a means around the <em>Sharee’ah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His (صلى الله عليه وسلم) saying: “<strong>and take hold of the tails of cows</strong>” is an indication of giving importance to worldly matters and pre-occupying oneself with them and not giving importance to the <em>Sharee’ah</em> and its rulings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise is his (صلى الله عليه وسلم) saying: “<strong>and become satisfied with cultivation</strong>” and his (صلى الله عليه وسلم) saying: “<strong>and abandon jihaad</strong> ” is a result of desiring this world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مَا لَكُمْ إِذَا قِيلَ لَكُمُ انفِرُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ اثَّاقَلْتُمْ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ ۚ أَرَضِيتُم بِالْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا مِنَ الْآخِرَةِ ۚ فَمَا مَتَاعُ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا فِي الْآخِرَةِ إِلَّا قَلِيلٌ</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! What is the matter with you, that when you are asked to go forth in the path of Allaah you cling heavily to the earth? Do you prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter? But little is the comfort of this world in comparison to the Hereafter.</span> [Sooratut-Tawbah (9):38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His (صلى الله عليه وسلم) saying: “<strong>Allaah will cover you with humiliation, which He will not remove from you, until you return to your Deen</strong>” contains a clear indication that the <em>Deen</em> which it is obligatory to return to is that which Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, mentions in a number of verses, such as His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّ الدِّينَ عِندَ اللَّهِ الْإِسْلَامُ</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed the Deen with Allaah is Islaam.</span><br />
[Soorah Aal-‘Imraan (3):19]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ الْإِسْلَامَ دِينًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">This day have I perfected your Deen for you, completed My favours upon you and have chosen for you Islaam as Deen. </span>[Sooratul-Maa‘idah (5):3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">lmaam Maalik’s famous comment about this aayah clearly explains what is meant, when he &#8211; <em>rahimahullaah</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>What was not on that day considered <em>Deen</em>, is not <em>Deen</em> today. So the latter part of this <em>Ummah</em> will not be set right except by that which set right its first part</strong>.”</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Going Beyond Bounds in <em>Fiqh ul-Waaqi’</em></span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards those <em>du’aat</em> today who concentrate heavily on <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi’</em> and over inflate it’s importance and give it a higher position than is due. They go into excesses in this understanding and giving others the understanding, perhaps unintentionally, that it is obligatory upon every scholar, indeed every student of knowledge to have knowledge of this Fiqh!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas, many of those <em>du’aat</em> know fully that this <em>Deen</em> with which our Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, is pleased for us, has been greatly misunderstood within the Muslim <em>Ummah</em> for a long time, even with regards to <em>Aqeedah</em>, to the extent that we find many people indeed who say <em>Laa ilaaha illallaah</em> and carry out the pillars and even carry out optional worship, such as standing in prayer during the night, giving charity and their like, but they deviate from the sayings of Allaah, the Most High, (such as):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَاعْلَمْ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Know that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah</span>. [SoorahMuhammad (47):19]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The State of the <em>Du’aat</em> with regards to <em>Fiqh ul-Waaqi’</em></strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We know that many of these <em>du’aat</em> agree with us fundamentally in recognizing the reason for the evil situation in which the Muslims live. That is their being far from the correct understanding of Islaam that is obligatory upon every individual to have, not just obligatory upon some only. So what is obligatory is to correct the beliefs, correct the worship and correct the manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Where in this <em>Ummah</em> are those who are seeking to establish this obligation which is an obligation upon all (<em>Fard ’Ayn</em>) and not just upon some (<em>Fard Kifaaee</em>)? ? Since the <em>Fard Kifaaee</em> should come after the <em>Fard Ayn</em>, as has been established and not before! Therefore, being pre-occupied with and giving undue importance in calling the elite of the Muslim Ummah, to take care of a <em>Fard Kifaaee</em>, which is <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi</em> and giving less importance to the <em>Fiqh</em> which is <em>Fard ’Ayn</em> upon every Muslim, which is Fiqh of the Book and Sunnah, as I have indicated, is an excess and a neglect of that which is obligatory upon every individual of the Muslim <em>Ummah</em>. It is going beyond bounds in raising the importance of something, which in reality, is no more than <em>Fa&#8217;rd Kifaayah</em>!</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The True and Just Saying about <em>Fiqh ul-Waaqi’</em></strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the matter is as Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَكَذَٰلِكَ جَعَلْنَاكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Thus have We made you a justly-balanced Ummah.</span><br />
[Sooratul-Baqarah (2):143]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi&#8217;</em> with its correct <em>Sharee’ah</em> meaning is obligatory without doubt, but it is obligatory upon some, not all. If some of the scholars attain it, then it is not obligatory upon the rest of the scholars, not to mention the students of knowledge or the common Muslims!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is essential to keep matters in due proportion when calling the Muslims to awareness of <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi’</em> and not to drown them with political news and analysis of western thinkers. Rather, what is obligatory always, is to concentrate on the <em>tasfiyah</em> (purification) of Islaam from corruption, then the <em>tarbi&#8217;yah</em> (cultivation) of the Muslims, groups and individuals, upon this pure Islaam; connecting them to the pure and correct <em>manhaj</em> (methodology) of <em>Da’wah</em>: The Book and the Sunnah with the understanding of the Salaf of this Ummah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Obligation of Mutual Love and Ties of Relationship</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From that which is also obligatory upon the scholars, with their various specialities, not to mention the rest of the Ummah , is that they should comply with the saying of their Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>The example of the Believers in their mutual love and mercy is like a single body</strong>.” [<span style="color:#ff0000;">01</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">01</span>] <em>Saheeh</em> &#8211; related by Muslim (8/20), Ahmad (4/70) and at-Tiyaalasee (790). from an- Numaan ibn Basheer <em>radiallaalm ’anhu</em>. The full text of the hadeeth being: “<em>The example of the Believers in their mutual love and mercy is like a single body. When one part of it feels pain then the whole of the body suffers in sleeplessness and fever</em>.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This great prophetic simile, with its beautiful meaning, will not be realized except by the scholars working in co-operation with the individuals of the society, teaching and learning, calling and acting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, those who know the <em>Fiqh</em> of the <em>Sharee’ah</em> with its evidences and rulings, should co-operate with those who know <em>Fiqh ul-Waaqi’</em> in its correct and practical form, not merely as a discussion. S0 one supports the other with what they have of knowledge and understanding and one alerts the other to what is clear to them so that they can be aware and warn. From this sincere co-operation between the scholars and the <em>Du’aat</em>, with their different areas of expertise, it will be possible to fulfill the hope of every sincere Muslim.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Danger of Accusing the Scholars</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards accusing some of the scholars or students of knowledge and labelling them as being ignorant of <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi’</em> and accusing them with such things as one would feel shame to mention, then this is a mistake and an error. It is not permissible for this to continue, since it is from hatred and many ahaadeeth prohibit the Muslims having hatred for each other, rather the opposite has been ordered, that is, to have mutual love, to come together and to co-operate.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">How Can We Cure the Mistakes</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Any Muslim who sees a matter about which a scholar or caller has made a mistake, then it is obligatory upon him to remind and advise them. If the mistake was in a particular place, then it should be called to their attention there and then in the best way without broadcasting or publicizing it; in order to bring about what is more befitting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the mistake was made publicly and broadcasted, then there is no harm in calling the mistake to attention and explaining it openly, but as Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color:#000000;">ادْعُ إِلَىٰ سَبِيلِ رَبِّكَ بِالْحِكْمَةِ وَالْمَوْعِظَةِ الْحَسَنَةِ ۖ وَجَادِلْهُم بِالَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching and argue with them in ways that are best. </span>[Sooratun-Nahl (16):125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is important to explain that the correction of an error meant here, is not the correction founded upon the emotions and feelings of the youth without any knowledge or proof. Rather, what is meant is correction based upon clear proof and sound evidence.This correction, in this mild and wise manner, will not be achieved except between sincere scholars and well-wishing and sincere students of knowledge, who are together in their knowledge and <em>Da’wah</em> built upon the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> and upon the <em>manhaj</em> of the <em>Salaf us-Saalih</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards the case if the one who is to be corrected is one who knowingly deviates from this methodology, then there is for him a particular treatment and method befitting the scale of his deviation and distance from the truth and correct way.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Danger of Present-Day Politics</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Finally</strong>, we must advise the Muslims of a very important matter in this regard. Our approval of <em>Fiqh ul-Waaqi’</em> with its approved form in the <em>Sharee’ah</em> or our preoccupation with it, must not lead us to opening the doors of modern politics (<em>siyaasah</em>) of the transgressors. Those fooled by the words of the rulers, willing pupils of their methods and those drowned in their ways.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, what is obligatory, is to pursue the politics of the <em>Sharee’ah</em> &#8211; which is to protect and take care of the affairs of the Ummah. This cannot be except in the light of the Book and the Sunnah upon the <em>manhaj</em> of the <em>Salaf us-Saalih</em> and in the hands of the active scholars and the just rulers. Since Allaah curbs with the rulers those whom He does not curb with the Qur‘aan.[1]</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[1] See <em>ad-Durrul-Manthoor</em> (4/99) of as-Suyootee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for the western politics, which open the doors and deceives its people; it has no <em>Deen</em> with it. It flows onwards with those caught in its tide, or drowned in its sea. Its harm comes upon him and he is afflicted by its fire, since he preoccupied himself with the subsidiary (<em>furoo</em>’) and left the fundamentals (<em>usool</em>)!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah have mercy upon the one who said: <em>Whosoever seeks to hasten something before its time is ripe, is punished by being deprived of its achievement.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our final call is that all praise is for Allaah, Lord of the worlds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Introduction to Tafseer – Ibn Taymiyyah (<em>rahimahullaah</em>)<br />
Taken from Tafseer Soorat-in-Naba’<br />
Compiled and translated by Abu Talhah (<em>rahimahullaah</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah. We praise Him, we seek His aid, and we ask for His forgiveness. We seek Allaah’s refuge from the evils of our selves and from the evil consequences of our deeds. Whomever Allaah guides then none can misguide him, and whomever He misguides then none can guide him. I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone, having no partner; and I testify that Muhammad is his Slave and His Messenger.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ حَقَّ تُقَاتِهِ وَلَا تَمُوتُنَّ إِلَّا وَأَنتُم مُّسْلِمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Meaning: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe in Allaah and His Messenger! Fear and be dutiful to Allaah, by obeying Him and avoiding disobedience to Him, as He deserves to be feared </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Obey Him and do not disobey Him; give thanks to Him and do not show ingratitude; remember Him and do not forget Him)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">; and do not die except as Muslims: obediently submitting to Him, and worshipping Him alone</span></strong>.] [Soorah Aali `Imraan (3): 102]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اتَّقُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُم مِّن نَّفْسٍ وَاحِدَةٍ وَخَلَقَ مِنْهَا زَوْجَهَا وَبَثَّ مِنْهُمَا رِجَالًا كَثِيرًا وَنِسَاءً ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ الَّذِي تَسَاءَلُونَ بِهِ وَالْأَرْحَامَ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ عَلَيْكُمْ رَقِيبًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O Mankind! Fear and be dutiful to your Lord, Who alone created you from a single person</strong> (Aadam)<strong>, and from him He created his mate, and from these two He produced many men and women; and fear and be dutiful to Allaah through Whom you ask each other for your rights, and beware of cutting ties of kinship. Allaah is ever a Watcher over you</strong></span>.]] [Sooratun-Nisaa· (4): 1]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَقُولُوا قَوْلًا سَدِيدًا &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">يُصْلِحْ لَكُمْ أَعْمَالَكُمْ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ذُنُوبَكُمْ ۗ وَمَن يُطِعِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَقَدْ فَازَ فَوْزًا عَظِيمًا </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who believe in Allaah and His Messenger! Fear and be dutiful to Allaah and speak with truth and justice, and He will rectify your deeds for you and forgive your sins; and whoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger has attained tremendous success</strong></span>.]] [Sooratul-Ahzaab (33): 70-71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>To proceed:</strong></span> Then the truest speech is the Book of Allaah -the Most High, and the best way is the way of Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم); and the worst of affairs are those things which are new introductions (into the Religion) and every new introduction is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance, and all misguidance will be in the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Ummah (the Islamic nation) has a great and pressing need to understand the Qur·aan, which is the strong Rope of Allaah, and the wise Reminder; one who follows it will not be led astray by desires, and it will not become confused upon the tongues. It does not become dull through repetition, its wonders never cease, and the scholars can never have enough of it. Whoever speaks in accordance with it will speak the truth, whoever acts in accordance with it will be rewarded; whoever judges by it has judged justly, and whoever calls to it then he invites to the straight path. Whichever tyrant abandons it then Allaah will break him, and whoever seeks guidance in other than it then Allaah will misguide him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He -the Most High- said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَإِمَّا يَأْتِيَنَّكُم مِّنِّي هُدًى فَمَنِ اتَّبَعَ هُدَايَ فَلَا يَضِلُّ وَلَا يَشْقَىٰ &#8211; وَمَنْ أَعْرَضَ عَن ذِكْرِي فَإِنَّ لَهُ مَعِيشَةً ضَنكًا وَنَحْشُرُهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ أَعْمَىٰ &#8211; قَالَ رَبِّ لِمَ حَشَرْتَنِي أَعْمَىٰ وَقَدْ كُنتُ بَصِيرًا &#8211; قَالَ كَذَٰلِكَ أَتَتْكَ آيَاتُنَا فَنَسِيتَهَا ۖ وَكَذَٰلِكَ الْيَوْمَ تُنسَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then if guidance comes to you from Me, then whoever follows My Guidance shall not go astray and he shall not be wretched; but whoever turns away from My Reminder then he shall have a bleak and constricted life, and on the Day of Resurrection We shall raise him up blind. He will say: ‘O my Lord! Why have you raised me up blind when I used to have sight in the world?’ He will say: ‘Thus it is: Our signs came to you and you turned away from and abandoned them, and so this Day you shall be abandoned</strong></span>.]] [Soorah TaaHaa (20): 123-126]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He -the Most High- said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> قَدْ جَاءَكُمْ رَسُولُنَا يُبَيِّنُ لَكُمْ كَثِيرًا مِّمَّا كُنتُمْ تُخْفُونَ مِنَ الْكِتَابِ وَيَعْفُو عَن كَثِيرٍ ۚ قَدْ جَاءَكُم مِّنَ اللَّهِ نُورٌ وَكِتَابٌ مُّبِينٌ &#8211;  يَهْدِي بِهِ اللَّهُ مَنِ اتَّبَعَ رِضْوَانَهُ سُبُلَ السَّلَامِ وَيُخْرِجُهُم مِّنَ الظُّلُمَاتِ إِلَى النُّورِ بِإِذْنِهِ وَيَهْدِيهِمْ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There has come to you Our Messenger Muhammad </strong>(صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)<strong>, explaining to you much of that which you used to hide from the Scripture, and overlooking much. There has come to you from Allaah a light and a clear Book. By it Allaah guides those who seek His Pleasure to the path which leads to safety and salvation; and He brings them out of darkness into the light, by His Permission, and He guides to the Straight Path</strong></span>.]] [Sooratul-Maa·idah (5): 15-16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He -the Most High- said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الر ۚ كِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَاهُ إِلَيْكَ لِتُخْرِجَ النَّاسَ مِنَ الظُّلُمَاتِ إِلَى النُّورِ بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِمْ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطِ الْعَزِيزِ الْحَمِيدِ &#8211; اللَّهِ الَّذِي لَهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Alif Laam Raa. This is a book which We have sent down to you, in order that you might lead mankind out of darkness into light, by the permission of their Lord, to the path of the All-Mighty, the One worthy of all praise: Allaah, to Whom belongs everything that is in the heavens and in the earth</strong></span>.]] [Soorah Ibraaheem (14): 1-2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He -the Most High- said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَكَذَٰلِكَ أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ رُوحًا مِّنْ أَمْرِنَا ۚ مَا كُنتَ تَدْرِي مَا الْكِتَابُ وَلَا الْإِيمَانُ وَلَٰكِن جَعَلْنَاهُ نُورًا نَّهْدِي بِهِ مَن نَّشَاءُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا ۚ وَإِنَّكَ لَتَهْدِي إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">صِرَاطِ اللَّهِ الَّذِي لَهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ ۗ أَلَا إِلَى اللَّهِ تَصِيرُ الْأُمُورُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And likewise We have revealed this Qur·aan to you, as a mercy, by Our Command. You did not know what the Book is, nor what is Faith. But We have made it a light by which We guide whomever We wish from Our servants. And you certainly guide Our servants towards the Straight Path: the Path of Allaah, to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. Certainly all affairs shall return to Allaah for judgement</strong></span>.]] [Sooratush-Shooraa (42): 52-53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230; It is binding that a person should know that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) explained the meaning of the Qur·aan to his Companions, just as he made clear to them its Words.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His Saying -He the Most High:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> وَأَنزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ الذِّكْرَ لِتُبَيِّنَ لِلنَّاسِ مَا نُزِّلَ إِلَيْهِمْ </span></h3>
<p>[Sooratun-Nahl (16): 44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We sent down this Qur·aan to you, O Muhammad </strong>(صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)<strong>, as a reminder to them, so that you should then explain clearly to the people what has been sent down to them</strong></span>][1] includes both this and that [i.e. the Words and the meaning.]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Aboo `Abdir-Rahmaan as-Sulamee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Those who taught us the recitation of the Qur·aan, such as `Uthmaan ibn `Affaan, `Abdullah ibn Mas`ood, and others, when they had learned ten Aayahs from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), would not go beyond them until they had learned what they contained from knowledge and action. They said: So we learned the Qur·aan, and knowledge, and action, together.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore they used to remain for a period of time learning a Soorah, and Anas said: “<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>When a man had learned </strong>[Soorah] <strong>al-Baqarah and </strong>[Soorah] <strong>Aali `Imraan he attained stature in our eyes</strong></span>” [3], and Ibn `Umar took some years to learn al-Baqarah, it is said that it was eight years; Maalik mentioned it. [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that was because Allaah -the Most High- has said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">كِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَاهُ إِلَيْكَ مُبَارَكٌ لِّيَدَّبَّرُوا آيَاتِهِ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This Qur·aan is a Book which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, so that they may reflect upon its Aayahs</strong></span>.]] { [Soorah Saad (38): 29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَفَلَا يَتَدَبَّرُونَ الْقُرْآنَ ۚ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Will they not carefully reflect upon the Qur·aan?</strong></span>]]<br />
[Sooratun-Nisaa· (4): 82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَفَلَمْ يَدَّبَّرُوا الْقَوْلَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Have they not reflected upon the Qur·aan?</strong></span>]]<br />
[Sooratul-Mu·minoon (23): 68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And carefully reflecting upon speech is not possible without understanding its meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise He -the Most High- said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَاهُ قُرْآنًا عَرَبِيًّا لَّعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</span></h3>
<p>[Soorah Yoosuf (12): 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur·aan, in order that you may comprehend its meaning]]</span></strong>, and comprehending speech includes understanding it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also known that what is intended from all speech is that its meaning be understood, not just its wording, so the Qur·aan has more right to that; and also the normal behaviour of the people prevents them from reading a book in any field of knowledge, be it medicine or mathematics, and then not seeking necessary explanation of it. So how about the Speech of Allaah, which is their essential safeguard, and through which they are to attain salvation and bliss, and by means of which their Religion and their worldly lives are correctly established?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why disagreement amongst the Companions with regard to the tafseer of the Qur·aan was extremely rare; and even though it occurred more amongst the Taabi`een (the Successors of the Companions) than it did amongst the Companions, then still it was little in comparison to what occurred with those who came after them. So the more excellent a time was, then the greater the unity, the harmony, the knowledge, and the clarity of understanding was in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from the Taabi`een there were those who learned the whole tafseer from the Companions, just as Mujaahid said: “<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>I went through the whole mus-haf with Ibn `Abbaas, stopping him at every Aayah and asking him about it</strong></span>.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore ath-Thawree said: “<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>If tafseer comes to you from Mujaahid, then it will suffice you</strong></span>.” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore his tafseer was relied upon by ash-Shaafi`ee, al-Bukhaaree, and others from the people of knowledge; and likewise Imaam Ahmad, and others who wrote works of tafseer, would repeatedly quote chains of narration from Mujaahid, more so than from others besides him. So what is intended is that the Taabi`een took the tafseer from the Companions, just as they took knowledge of the Sunnah from them&#8230;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Tafseer, then the people who were most knowledgeable about it were the people of Makkah, since they were the students of Ibn `Abbaas, such as: <strong>Mujaahid</strong>, `<strong>Ataa· ibn Abee Rabaah</strong>, `<strong>Ikrimah</strong>-the freed slave of Ibn `Abbaas, and others from the students of Ibn `Abbaas, such as: <strong>Taawoos</strong>, <strong>AbushSha`thaa</strong>·, <strong>Sa`eed ibn Jubayr</strong>, and their like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise the people of al-Koofah, from the students of Ibn Mas`ood, and they had distinction in some of that over others; and the scholars of tafseer from the people of al-Madeenah, such as Zayd ibn Aslam &#8211; whom Maalik took tafseer from, and likewise his [i.e. Zayd’s] son `Abdur-Rahmaan took it from him (also), and `Abdullaah ibn Wahb took it from `AbdurRahmaan&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in summary, whoever turns away from the positions of the Companions and the Taabi`een, and their tafseer, in favour of something contrary to that, then he is in error in doing that, indeed he is an innovator; unless if he is performing legitimate ijtihaad, in which case his error is forgiven&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if someone were to say: ‘<strong>What is the best approach with regard to Tafseer?</strong>’ Then the answer is that the most correct approach is to explain the Qur·aan with the Qur·aan. So what has been left unspecified at one place will be explained at another place, and what is mentioned briefly at one point will be detailed elsewhere&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you become unable to do that, then take hold of the Sunnah, for the Sunnah explains and clarifies the Qur·aan&#8230;, and when we do not find the tafseer in the Qur·aan, nor in the Sunnah, then we refer back for that to the sayings of the Companions, for they knew best about it because of what they actually witnessed relating to the Qur·aan, and because of the circumstances particular to them, and because of their complete understanding, their correct knowledge, and their righteous deeds&#8230; And if you do not find the tafseer in the Qur·aan, nor in the Sunnah, nor do you find it from the Companions, then many of the imaams refer back in that case to the statements of the Taabi`een, such as Mujaahid ibn Jabr&#8230; and such as Sa`eed ibn Jubayr, `Ikrimah-the freed slave of Ibn `Abbaas, `Ataa· ibn Abee Rabaah, al-Hasan al-Basree, Masrooq ibn al-Ajda`, Sa`eed ibn alMusayyib, Abul-`Aaliyah, ar-Rabee` ibn Anas, Qataadah, ad-Dahhaak ibn Muzaahim, and others from the Taabi`een, and those who succeeded them, and those who came after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So their sayings are mentioned with regard to an Aayah, and the wordings which they used may differ, and so one who has no knowledge may think that they are disagreements, when this is not actually the case. So some of them may refer to something by mentioning that which it necessitates, or by mentioning that which corresponds to it, and some of them may state the actual thing itself; and all of these actually have the same meaning, and this occurs in many places, so let the discerning person be alert to this; and Allaah is the One Who guides.” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] as-Suyootee quoted in his ‘<em>Miftaahul-Jannah fil-I`tisaam bis-Sunnah</em>’ (p. 58): “Ibn Mas`ood said, as reported by Ibn Abee Haatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is nothing except that it has been made clear to us in the Qur·aan, however our understanding falls short of reaching it, so therefore He -the Most High- said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">بِالْبَيِّنَاتِ وَالزُّبُرِ ۗ وَأَنزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ الذِّكْرَ لِتُبَيِّنَ لِلنَّاسِ مَا نُزِّلَ إِلَيْهِمْ وَلَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So that you, O Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), should then explain clearly to the people what has been sent down to them</strong></span>]].’ { [Sooratun-Nahl (16): 44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] as-Suyootee quoted in his ‘<em>Miftaahul-Jannah fil-I`tisaam bis-Sunnah</em>’ (2/437): “at-Tabaree reported it in his ‘Tafseer’ (1/60), and as-Samarqandee in his ‘Tafseer’ (1/71) and Ibn Sa`d in ‘at-Tabaqaat’ (6/172), and Ibn Abee Shaybah in ‘al-Musannaf’:..6/117, and its chain of narration contains `Ataa· ibn as-Saa·ib:Sadooq (truthful), whose memory deteriorated; however the narrator from him is Hammaad ibn Zayd, as occurs in ‘as-Siyar’ (4/269), and his narrations from him are good&#8230;”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Reported by Imaam Ahmad (3/120). Shu`ayb al-Arnawoot said in his checking of the ‘Musnad’ (no. 12236): “Its chain of narration is ‘saheeh’ to the standard of the two Shaikhs.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Imaam Maalik stated in his ‘Muwatta·’ (1/205) that it had reached him (balaaghan) that `Abdullaah ibn `Umar had remained for eight years learning Sooratul-Baqarah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Fawwaaz Ahmad Zumarlee said in his checking of as-Suyootee’s ‘<em>al-Itqaan</em>’ (2/473): “It was reported in ‘al-Hilyah’ (3/280)..; and it was reported by at-Tabaree in his ‘Tafseer’(1/65), and Aboo Nu`aym in ‘al-Hilyah’ (3/279-280); and its chain of narration contains Muhammad ibn Ishaaq who narrated it with both of them with `an`anah (without stating that he had heard it directly from the narrator before him); however it has another chain of narration which supports it, since it was also reported by al-Qaasim ibn Sallaam in ‘Fadaa·ilul-Qur·aan’ (p. 216), and by Ahmad in ‘al-Fadaa·il’ (no. 1866), and its chain of narration contains Ibn Abee Najeeh, who reported a great amount from Mujaahid; but he would narrate from him things that he had not heard directly from him. Refer to ‘Tabaqaatul-Mudalliseen’ (p. 9).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Reported by at-Tabaree in his ‘Tafseer’ (1/65).</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">AT-TABAREE:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad ibn Jareer ibn Yazeed, Aboo Ja`far at-Tabaree: “The imaam, the outstanding scholar, the Mujtahid. The scholar of his time: Aboo Ja`far at-Tabaree, the author of excellent works.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was from the people of Aamul in Tabaristaan (a town 80 miles NE of Tehran in Persia). He was born in the year 224 H, and began seeking knowledge after the year 240 H. He travelled greatly and met the preeminent men. He was singular amongst the people of his time in knowledge, intellect and in the great number of his works. It is rare that anyone the like of him is seen&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadee said of him: ‘He gathered such branches of knowledge as were not attained by anyone from the people of his time. He had memorised the Book of Allaah; he was knowledgeable of the different modes of recitation; he had insight of the meaning; he was a learned jurist with regard to the rulings contained in the Qur·aan; he was a scholar of the details of the Sunnah and of its chains of narration; the authentic and the unauthentic; he knew the abrogating texts and the abrogated texts; he was knowledgeable of the sayings of the Companions and the Taabi`een; he was well-acquainted with the past events and history of the peoples, and he compiled the famous book: ‘Narratives and history of the nations’; and he compiled his ‘Tafseer’: the like of which has not been written. He also wrote a book entitled ‘Tahdheeb-Aathaar’, and I have not seen a similar work the like of it, but he did not complete it. He also wrote many books about the principles and details of Fiqh, and his preferred sayings from the sayings of the jurists. He had certain verdicts specific to him which were preserved’.” [‘Siyar A`laamin-Nubalaa·’ of adh-Dhahabee: (14/267-)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning his Tafseer (printed in thirty volumes) Aboo Haamid alIsfaraayeenee said: “If a person were to travel to China to obtain the Tafseer of Muhammad ibn Jareer it would not be too much.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikhul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah said: “As for the Tafseers that the people have with them, then the most authentic of them is the Tafseer of Muhammad ibn Jareer at-Tabaree, because he mentions the sayings reported from the Salaf with established chains of narration, and it does not contain innovation, and he does not report from those accused of being liars such as Muqtaatil ibn Bukayr and al-Kalbee.” [‘Majmoo`ul-Fataawaa’:13/385]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer said, concerning his ‘Tafseer’: “He authored a complete Tafseer which is such that it has no equal,” and concerning him: “He had high standing in worship, zuhd (abstaining from the unnecessary things of this world), piety, and establishing the truth: not being prevented from that by the blame of anyone. He had a fine voice in recitation, along with complete knowledge of the modes of recitation &#8211; upon the finest characteristics. He was one of the major righteous people, and one of the scholars of hadeeth who gathered in Egypt in the time of Ibn Tooloon; and they were: Muhammad ibn Ishaaq ibn Khuzaymah &#8211; the imaam of the imaams, Muhammad ibn Nasr al-Marwazee, Muhammad ibn Haaroon arRuwayaanee, and this one: Muhammad ibn Jareer at-Tabaree…” [‘al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah’ (11/156-)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Firghaanee said: “Muhammad ibn Jareer was of those who did not care about the blame of anyone for Allaah’s sake, along with the very great harm he suffered and the slanders he received from the ignorant, envious and apostates; but as for the people of knowledge and Religion, then they do not deny his knowledge, his abstinence with regard to this world and how he renounced it. He sufficed himself with a small inheritance left for him by his father in Tabaristaan.” And al-Firghaanee said: “I heard him say: “My father’s inheritance has been delayed, so I had to remove the sleeves of my robe and sell them.” [‘Tabaqaatush-Shaafi`iyyah’: (3/120), quoted in Dr. `Abdullaah at-Turkee’s introduction to ‘Jaami`ul-Bayaan’.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was mentioned about him that everyday for forty years he would fill forty pages with his writing; and that he originally proposed dictating his ‘history’ of a length of thirty thousand pages, and his Tafseer of similar length, but was dissuaded by his students and so reduced each of them to a tenth of the intended size, saying: “Indeed we belong to Allaah! Peoples’ eagerness has died!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">as-Suyootee said in ‘al-Itqaan’ (2/476): “So if you were to say: ‘Which of the tafseers do you direct us towards, and tell a person to rely upon?’ Then I say: The tafseer of Aboo Ja`far ibn Jareer at-Tabaree, about which the reputable scholars have agreed that its like has not been written in the field of tafseer. an-Nawawee said in his ‘Tahdheeb’: ‘No one has written the like of the book of Ibn Jareer in tafseer’.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He passed away at the time of Maghrib on the night of the 28th of Shawwal in the year 310 H, at the age of 86 -rahimahullaah.</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">AS-SAM`AANEE:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The imaam, the outstanding scholar, the Muftee of Khuraasaan, Shaikh of the Shaafi`ees; Abul-Muzaffar Mansoor ibn Muhammad ibn `Abdil-Jabbaar ibn Ahmad, at-Tameemee, as-Sam`aanee, al-Marwazee, previously alHanafee, then ash-Shaafi`ee. He was born in the year 426 H…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He went out on foot to perform Hajj at a time when riding parties were prevented from travelling, so he and a group of people were captured by brigands. So he bore this with patience until Allaah freed him from these bedouins, and he performed Hajj and accompanied az-Zanjaanee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He used to relate: &lt; They took us captive, so I used to tend their camels. So it happened that their chief wanted to marry off his daughter, so they said: we will have to travel to a town to find someone to perform the marriage for us. So one of their men said: ‘The man who tends our camels is the jurist of Khuraasaan.’ So they asked me about some matters, and I answered them, and I spoke to them in correct Arabic, so they became embarrassed and excused themselves. So I performed the marriage for them, and said the (marriage) address, so they were happy and asked me to accept some reward from that, but I refused. So they conveyed me to Makkah in the middle of the year. &gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdul-Ghaafir said in his ‘Taareekh’: “He was the singular scholar of his age in excellence and behaviour, and in zuhd and piety. He came from a household of knowledge and zuhd. He acquired knowledge of Fiqh from his father, and he became one of the foremost amongst the people of speculation. He then studied the books of hadeeth, performed Hajj and returned, and abandoned the way upon which he had debated for thirty years and became a Shaafi`ee. He manifested this in the year 468 H and the people of Marw were thrown into turmoil and the common folk became perplexed. So letters were sent concerning him by the Ameer of Balkh which spoke harshly against him. So he left Marw in the company of DhulMajdayn Abul-Qaasim al-Moosawee and a group of students, and he was attended to by a number of the jurists. So he went to Toos, and proceeded on to Naysaaboor. So he was met by the students with a great reception in the time of Nizaamul-Mulk, and `Ameedul-Hadrah Aboo Sa`d. So they honoured him and gave him a position of great respect, and a gathering for admonition was established for him in the Shaafi`ee school; and he was an ocean with regard to admonition and he was a great memorizer, so he was greatly accepted by the people. He attained firmness and prominence in the Shaafi`ee madhhab and then he returned to Marw and taught there in the Shaafi`ee school, and an-Nizaam gave him precedence over his peers, and his students became apparent. Then he went off to Asbahaan in a state of high standing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He wrote the book ‘al-Istilaam,’ and the book ‘al-Burhaan,’ and ‘alAmaalee’ in Hadeeth, and he stood firmly with the people of the Hadeeth, the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah; and he was a thorn in the eyes of the opponents, and a proof for the people of the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[His grandson] Aboo Sa`d said: ‘My grandfather wrote a work of Tafseer, and in Fiqh, Usool and Hadeeth. His Tafseer is of three volumes’ … The Imaam Aboo `Alee ibn as-Saffaar said: ‘When I debate with AbulMuzaffar then it is as if I am debating with an imaam from the Taabi`een, because of the signs of the righteous people which I see in him.’ He also said about himself: “I never forgot anything which I had memorized.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230; He died in the year 489 H, having lived for sixty-three years &#8211; rahimahullaah.” [‘Siyar A`laamin-Nubalaa·’ (19/114-119)] Ibn al-`Imaad said about him in ‘Shadharaatudh-Dhahab’ (3/393): “The imaam, the eminent scholar, Abul-Muzaffar as-Sam`aanee Mansoor ibn Muhammad, at-Tameemee, al-Marwazee, al-Hanafee, then ash-Shaafi`ee. He learned Fiqh from this father and from others, and he was the imaam of his age in the madhhab of Aboo Haneefah. But when he performed Hajj, that which necessitated his moving to the madhhab of ash-Shaafi`ee became clear to him in al-Hijaaz. So when he returned to Marw he suffered great harm because of his changing over. He wrote many books regarding the Shaafi`ee madhhab and he wrote in refutation of the opponents, and he wrote ‘at-Tabaqaat’ which he excelled in, and he wrote a good and fine Tafseer…” -rahimahullaah.</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">AL-BAGHAWEE:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Shaikhul-Islaam, the outstanding exemplary scholar, the Haafiz: ShaikhulIslaam, the reviver of the Sunnah, Aboo Muhammad al-Husayn ibn Mas`ood ibn Muhammad ibn al-Farraa·, al-Baghawee, ash-Shaafi`ee: the scholar of Tafseer; the compiler of works such as ‘Sharhus-Sunnah,’ ‘Ma`aalimut-Tanzeel,’ ‘al-Masaabeeh’ and the book ‘at-Tahdheeb’ upon the madhhab, and ‘al-Jam`u baynas-Saheehayn,’ and ‘al-Arba`eena hadeethan’ and other works.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He acquired knowledge of Fiqh from the Shaikh of the Shaafi`ees al-Qaadee Husayn ibn Muhammad al-Marwaroodhee, the author of ‘at-Ta`leeqah,’ before the year 460 H….</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Baghawee was given the title ‘Muhiyyus-Sunnah’ (the reviver of the Sunnah), and the ‘the pillar of the Religion’, and he was a person of nobility and an Imaam. He was a person of knowledge and outstanding scholar. He abstained from the superfluous things of this world and was satisfied with a little. He used to eat dry bread on its own, but was criticised by people for that, so he began accompanying it with oil. His father used to make and sell fur garments (al-Farraa·). He was granted blessing in his writings, and granted complete acceptance with regard to them: this was on account of his fine resolve, and true and sincere intention. The scholars vied in acquiring his works, and he would not deliver a lesson except in a state of purification. He was moderate in his dress: he wore a crude robe, and a small turban &#8211; upon the way of the Salaf- which he wore and tied as they did. He was firmly established in Tafseer, and fully proficient in Fiqh -may Allaah have mercy upon him…” [‘Siyar A`laamin-Nubalaa·’ of adh-Dhahabee: (19/439-)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was born in the town of Bagh (30 miles NW of Herat in Afghanistan) in Khuraasaan, and travelled throughout Khuraasaan seeking knowledge, finally settling in Marw ar-Roodh (SE Turkmenistan) where he taught and compiled his works, and died in the year of 516 H at over eighty years of age.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer said: “…He excelled in the branches of knowledge, and he was the foremost scholar of his time in them. He adhered to the Religion, was pious, a ‘zaahid,’ and a righteous worshipper.” -rahimahullaah. [‘al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah (12/206).’]</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">IBN KATHEER:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He is Abul-Fidaa·, `Imaadud-Deen, Ismaa`eel ibn (ash-Shaikh Abee Hafs Shihaabud-Deen) `Umar &#8211; who was the ‘khateeb of his village &#8211; ibn Katheer ibn Daw· ibn Katheer ibn Zar’ al-Qurashee, al-Basrawee in origin, adDimashqee with regard to his upbringing, nurturing and education. He was born in the town of Mijdal, in the district of the town of Busraa, to the [north-] east of Damascus, in the year of 701 H, and his father was a khateeb. His father died when he was four years old, so he was brought up by his brother, the Shaikh `Abdul-Wahhaab, and he learned Fiqh from him at the beginning of his affair.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he moved to Damascus in the year 706 H, at the age of five. He then acquired knowledge of Fiqh from Shaikh Burhaanuddeen Ibraaheem ibn</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdur-Rahmaan al-Fazaaree, well known as Ibn al-Firkaah &#8211; who died in the year 729 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also heard in Damascus from `Eesaa ibn al-Muta&#8220;im, and from Ahmad ibn Abee Taalib &#8211; who lived more than a hundred years and who was well known as Ibnush-Shihnah, and also known as al-Hajjaar -who died in year 730 H. Also from al-Qaasim ibn `Asaakir, and Ibnush-Sheeraazee, Ishaaq ibn al-Aamidee, and Muhammad ibn Zarraad. He closely accompanied the Shaikh Jamaaluddeen Yoosuf ibn az-Zakiyy al-Mizzee &#8211; the author of ‘Tahdheebul-Kamaal’ and ‘Atraaful-Kutubis-Sittah’ who died in the year 742 H; and he greatly benefited from him and became proficient in knowledge, and he married his daughter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also studied a great deal with Shaikhul-Islaam Taqiyyuddeen Ibn Taimiyyah, who died in the year 728 H. He closely accompanied him, loved him and benefited from his knowledge. He also studied with the Shaikh, the Haafiz, the historian Shamsuddeen adh-Dhahabee Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Qaaymaaz, who died in the year 748 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was granted ‘ijaazah’ (permission to narrate) in Egypt by Aboo Moosaa al-Qaraafee, and al-Husaynee, and `Alee ibn `Umar al-Waanee, Yoosuf alHutanee and others. Al-Haafiz Shamsuddeen adh-Dhahabee said of him in ‘al-Mu`jamulMukhtass’: “The imaam, the muftee, the outstanding muhaddith, the precise jurist, the critical and precise scholar of tafseer. He has a number of beneficial works.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajr said of him in ‘ad-Durarul-Kaaminah’: “He became occupied with hadeeth, carefully studying its texts and narrators. He could quote a great deal from memory and was delightful in speech. His works spread widely in his lifetime, and people benefited from them after his death. He was not upon the way of those muhadditheen who merely seek briefer chains of narration, and seek to distinguish shorter from longer chains of narration and other such disciplines of theirs; rather he was from the jurists of the muhadditheen.’…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“His works included:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) ‘Tafseerul-Qur·aanil-Kareem,’ and it was one of the most beneficial books of tafseer based upon narrations. He would explain the Qur·aan with the Qur·aan, and then with the famous ahaadeeth from the dependable sources of the muhadditheen &#8211; along with their chains of narration. He discussed the chains of narration with the terms of rejection and acceptance, and made clear anything the narrations contained with regard to strangeness, being contrary to what is authentic, or confliction with the reliable reports. Then he would mention the reported sayings from the Companions and the Taabi`een.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Suyootee said: “The like of it, similar in form, has not been written.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) His history entitled ‘al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah,’ in which he mentioned the stories of the Prophets and the previous nations, based upon what occurs in the Noble Qur·aan and the authentic narrations…then he carefully detailed the Prophetic Seerah, and the history of Islaam to his time. Then he went on to mention the tribulations, signs of the Last Hour, the forthcoming battles and the conditions in the Hereafter….</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He died on Thursday, the 26th of Sha`baan in the year 774 H, at the age of 74; and al-Haafiz Ibn Hajr said: He lost his eyesight at the end of his life &#8211; rahimahullaah wa radiyallaahu `anhu.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from the introduction to ‘al-Baa`ithul-Hatheeth’; the biography was compiled by Shaikh Muhammad `Abdur-Razzaaq Hamzah.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-`Imaad said in ‘Shadharaatudh-Dhahab’ (6/231/232): “…He had many students; from them was Ibn Hajjee who said about him: ‘He was the greatest memorizer of the texts of hadeeth that we have come across, and the one best acquainted with their defects, and their narrators, and the authentic and the unauthentic from them, and his peers and his Shaikhs acknowledged that for him. I do not think, despite the frequency with which I went to him, that I ever met him except I took benefit from him.’ Others, as Qaadee Shahbah mentioned in his ‘Tabaqaat’ stated that he was a particularly close student of Ibn Taimiyyah, and used to defend him and follow many of his views; and he used to give verdict with his view regarding divorce, and he was put to trial because of it and suffered harm. He died in Sha`baan, and was buried…next to his Shaikh, Ibn Taimiyyah.” -rahimahullaah.</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">ASH-SHAWKAANEE:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad ibn `Alee ibn Muhammad ibn `Abdullaah, ash-Shawkaanee, then as-San`aanee [the capital of Yemen]. He was born on Monday the 28th of Dhul-Qa`dah in 1173 H in the town of Hijrah Shawkaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He grew up in the manner of students of legislated knowledge, memorizing the Qur·aan and becoming proficient in it, and he memorized many of the texts before he began serious study by the age of ten. Then he sat with the major Shaikhs, and he greatly occupied himself with studying history in the sciences of the language. His father did not allow him to occupy himself with other than knowledge, nor to leave San`aa. He sat to deliver verdicts at the age of twenty, and he had thirteen lessons each day: some he delivered, and others he studied with his Shaikhs. [‘al-Badrut-Taali`’: (2/215, 218-219)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He authored 278 works, including works of Tafseer, Fiqh, Usoolul-Fiqh, the `Aqeedah of the Salaf, and in refutation of blind-following (taqleed). al-`Allaamah Hasan ibn Ahmad al-Bahkalee said…: (start of quote): “In the year 1250 H, in the month of Jumaadal-Aakhirah, our Shaikh Muhammad ibn `Alee ash-Shawkaanee passed away. He was the judge of the whole community, Shaikhul-Islaam, the verifier, the `Allaamah, the imaam, sultaan of the scholars, imaam of the world….</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in summary, he did not see anyone the like of himself; nor did he see anyone who had seen the like of him in knowledge, piety and establishment of the truth with strength of spirit and eloquence of tongue…. He was born on Monday, the 28th of the sacred month of Dhul-Qa`dah in the year 1172 H….</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He studied under his father, and studied continuously under the Qaadee, imaam of the details of Fiqh in his time Ahmad ibn Muhammad alHaraazee, and he derived benefit from him in Fiqh… He learned Arabic grammar and morphology from as-Sayyid al-`Allaamah Ismaa`eel ibn Hasan, and al-`Allaamah `Abdullaah ibn Ismaa`eel an-Nahmee, and al- `Allaamah al-Qaasim ibn Muhammad al-Khawlaanee… and in many of the branches of knowledge he studied constantly with the reviver of his time as Sayyid `Abdul-Qaadir ibn Ahmad al-Kawkabaanee; and in the science of hadeeth he took from al-Haafiz `Alee ibn Ibraaheem ibn `Aamir, and from other Shaikhs besides them….</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He authored magnificent, delightful, beneficial, and useful works in most branches of knowledge; from them ‘Naylul-Awtaar’ &#8211; a commentary upon ‘Muntaqal-Akhbaar’ of [Majduddeen `Abdus-Salaam] Ibn Taimiyyah &#8211; rahimahullaah- in four volumes the like of which is not to be seen in these times with regard to its careful verification and precision. He gave each matter its due right, with justice and fairness; and did not adhere to blindfollowing. He quoted the positions of the later scholars and of the Predecessors. His noble Shaikhs and other prominent scholars related it from him, and it spread throughout the lands in his lifetime. It was read to him many times, and the scholars derived benefit from it; and it was the only one out of his works that he was personally satisfied with, because of its high level of accuracy, and its close adherence to proof in the best manner. He wrote it during the lifetime of his Shaikhs, and they were able to point out certain points, which he edited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also wrote the large Tafseer entitled ‘Fathul-Qadeer’ which combined the sciences of narration of hadeeth, and its understanding… … And I [i.e. his student Hasan ibn Ahmad al-Bahkalee] learned from him in many of the fields of knowledge, and I took from him most of his noble works, and with his death the shining lamp of Yemen was extinguished for them; and I do not think that in precision and verification they will see the like of him.” (end of quote.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Lord of creation, the One free of all imperfections-blessed this Qaadee and Imaam from the vast ocean of His Generosity with three things which I do not know to have been combined in these later times for anyone besides him: Firstly: Vast and deep knowledge of all the different branches, types and forms of knowledge; secondly: the great number of students he had who were verifiers, people of nobility and precision: people of discerning intellect, and outstanding virtues…; thirdly: the great number of his skilled and precise works, and his intricate treatises and responses which in their number outstripped great scholars, and whose precision and exactness reached every possible limit…”-rahimahullaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘at-Taajul-Mukallal’ (pp.452-461) of `Allaamah Siddeeq Hasan Khaan alQanoojee; and the introduction to ‘Fathul-Qadeer.’]</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>AS-SA`DEE:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Ash-Shaikh Aboo `Abdillaah `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Naasir ibn `Abdillaah ibn Naasir Aal-Sa`dee, from the tribe of Tameem. He was born in the town of `Unayzah in the district of al-Qaseem [Saudi Arabia], on the 12th of Muharram 1307 H and his mother died when he was four years old. Then his father died when he was seven years old, so he grew up as an orphan. However he had a fine up bringing and it was noticed that from an early age he was distinguished by intelligence and a desire to learn. He read the whole Qur·aan after the death of his father and then memorized it completely, and he was fully proficient in it at the age of eleven. Then he occupied himself with acquiring knowledge from the scholars of his land, and from those who came to his land. So he strove and exerted himself until he acquired a good portion of every branch of knowledge. Upon reaching the age of twentythree he sat to teach. So he would learn and also teach, and spend all of his time in that. This continued until the year 1350 H, when he took charge of all teaching in his town, and all students referred back to him. He took knowledge from Shaikh Ibraaheem ibn Hamd ibn Jaasir, and he was the first teacher he studied with. He described his Shaikh as a memorizer of hadeeth, and he would speak about his piety and how he used to love and take care of the poor. Often a poor person would come to him in winter and he would take off one of his two garments and give it to the poor person, even though he himself needed it and possessed very little himself &#8211; rahimahullaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from his Shaikhs was Muhammad ibn `Abdul-Kareem ash-Shibl, with whom he learned Fiqh, sciences of Arabic language and other than that. He also studied with ash-Shaikh Saalih ibn `Uthmaan al-Qaadee, the judge of `Unayzah. He learnt from him Tawheed, Tafseer, Fiqh: its Usool and its details, and the sciences of the Arabic language. He was the one whom he studied with the most, and he kept his company constantly until he passed away -rahimahullaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also studied with Shaikh `Abdullaah ibn `Aayid, and Shaikh Sa`b alQuwayjaree, and Shaikh `Alee as-Sinaanee, and Shaikh `Alee an-Naasir Aboo Waadee with whom he studied hadeeth, and took the six books and others from him with ‘ijaazah’ (permission to narrate).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also studied with Shaikh Muhammad ibn ash-Shaikh `Abdul-`Azeez Aal Muhammad al-Maani` (the director of cultural/educational affairs in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at present); he studied with him in `Unayzah. Also from his Shaikhs was Shaikh Muhammad ash-Shanqeetee (who settled in the Hijaaz…) when he came to teach in `Unayzah. He studied with him Tafseer, Hadeeth, the sciences of Hadeeth, and the sciences of the language &#8211; such as grammar, morphology and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was upon a high level of virtuous manners, showing humility with the young and the old, and the rich and the poor. He used to spend some of his time sitting in gatherings with whoever wished to attend, so the gathering would be a gathering of knowledge. He was keen that these gatherings should discuss matters of knowledge and social affairs, and the people of the gatherings would derive great benefit from the useful discussions they involved themselves in. So their recreational gatherings were turned into gatherings of worship and knowledge. He would speak to each person with whatever befitted him, and would discuss with him matters that would be beneficial to his worldly life and his Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would frequently resolve dispute in a just manner which satisfied both sides.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He had great concern for the poor, the needy, and strangers and he would personally assist them as far as he was able, and he would encourage the wealthy people &#8211; those whom he knew to love doing good &#8211; to be compassionate towards them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was upon a very high level of good manners, chastity, purity of spirit, and firmly resolved and serious in all his affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was also the best of people in his manner of teaching, and the best at causing his students to understand…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He occupied himself most of all and benefited most from the books of Shaikhul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah and his student Ibnul-Qayyim. This benefited him greatly with regard to knowledge of Usool, Tawheed, Tafseer, and Fiqh and other branches of beneficial knowledge…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was especially proficient in Tafseer, having read a number of Tafseers and excelling in it. He authored a fine Tafseer, in a number of volumes…entitled ‘Tayseerul-Kareemir-Rahmaan fee Tafseer KalaamilMannaan’.… He passed away at the age of 69 in the year 1376 in the town of `Unayzah &#8211; rahimahullaah…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Abridged from the biography written by one of his students and included as a preface to his Tafseer].</p>

<p><strong>DO NOT ABUSE MY COMPANIONS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Hurairah-<em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em> who said: Allaah‟s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Do not abuse my Companions! Do not abuse my Companions! For by the One in Whose Hand is my soul! If one of you were to spend the like of Uhud in gold in charity, it would not reach the hands-full of one of them, nor even a half of it</strong></span>. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>* al-Haafiz Abul-`Abbaas al-Qurtubee said in &#8220;al-Mufhim&#8221; (6/492):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“From that which is known, about which there is not doubt, is that Allaah-the Most High-chose the Companions of His Prophet for His Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), and to establish His Religion. So everything which we now have from knowledge, actions, virtues, conditions, possessions, property, honour, authority, Religion, <em>Eemaan</em>, and other favours-which no tongue can enumerate, and which no amount of time can provide a valuation for, then it all came about by means of them. So this being the case, then it becomes obligatory upon us to acknowledge their rights, and to be grateful to them for their tremendous efforts in order to establish what Allaah-the Most High-has obligated with regard to being thankful to one who has bestowed a favor upon you, and to avoid what He has forbidden to showing ingratitude towards him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This goes along with what we have confirmed from the praise of Allaah-the Most High-upon them, and His Saying-He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230;لَّقَدْ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِذْ يُبَايِعُونَكَ تَحْتَ الشَّجَرَةِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah was indeed pleased with the Believers when they gave the Pledge to you under the tree</strong></span>]]…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Until His Saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230;مُّحَمَّدٌ رَّسُولُ اللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah…</strong></span>]];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Sooratul-Fath (48): 18-29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and His Saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230;لِلْفُقَرَاءِ الْمُهَاجِرِينَ الَّذِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And there is also a share in the booty for the emigrants…</strong></span>]] [Sooratul Hashr (59): 8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and other than this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And such as his (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>Allaah chose my Companions over all the worlds except for the Prophets and Messengers</strong>&gt;&gt; [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Along with the rest of the ahaadeeth comprising praise upon them-may Allaah be pleased with them all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So upon this whoever abuses them, and denies their tremendous rights, then he has relinquished <em>Eemaan</em>, and has responded to favours with denial.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So sufficient in this regard is what at-Tirmidhee reported from a hadeeth of `Abdullaah ibn Mughaffal-<em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em>-who said Allaah‟s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>Be dutiful to Allaah! Be dutiful to Allaah! With regard to my Companions. Do not take them as a target for (verbal) attacks after me. So whoever loves them then it is because of their love for me that they love them; and whoever has hatred for them, then it is because of their hatred for me that they hate them. Whoever wrongs/troubles them has wronged me; and whoever wrongs me has wronged Allaah; and whoever wrongs Allaah, then He will soon seize him with punishment</strong>&gt;&gt; [2], and he said: “This is a &#8220;<em>ghareeb</em>&#8221; (singular/weak) hadeeth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this hadeeth, even though its chain of narration is weak, then it is authentic with regard to its text, since it is supported by what we have already mentioned from the Book and the authentic Sunnah, and by what is known from the Religion of the Ummah; since there is no disagreement about the obligation of having respect for them, and the forbiddance of abusing them. And there is no disagreement about the fact that whoever says that they were upon Unbelief or misguidance is an Unbeliever (<em>Kaafir</em>), and should be killed. This is because he has denied something known necessarily from Legislation: so he has declared Allaah and His Messenger to have lied in that which they informed of concerning them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same ruling applies to one who declares one of the four rightly-guided Caliphs to be an Unbeliever or to have been astray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then is he judged to be an Apostate (<em>murtadd</em>)-such that repentance is sought from him, or is he judged to be an unbelieving heretic (<em>zindeeq</em>) –such that repentance is not sought from him, and he is thus to be killed whatever? This is something about which there is disagreement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for someone who abuses/reviles them with something other than this, then if it is something which would necessitate a prescribed punishment-such as accusing of fornication, then he is given that prescribed punishment. Following this he is given another severe punishment: life-imprisonment and he is humiliated; unless he is referring to `Aa.ishah-<em>radiyallaahu `anhaa</em>, since one who accuses her of it is to be killed. This is because he is denying what occurs in the Book and the Sunnah with regard to her innocence. This was stated by Maalik and others. Then they disagree with regard to the other wives of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). So it is said: Anyone who accuses them of adultery is to be killed, since this is to cause harm to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم); and it is said: he is to be given the prescribed punishment and further severe punishment-as we have said: there being two sayings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who reviles them with something other than accusations of fornication, then he is lashed in a manner causing pain, and he is given severe punishment. Ibn Habeeb said: And he is imprisoned until he dies, and it is related from Maalik that he said: &#8220;Whoever abuses `Aa.ishah is to be killed, without restriction‟, and it is possible to understand this to mean accusation of fornication; and Allaah-the Most High knows best.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">***</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] al-Haythumee mentioned it in &#8220;<em>Majma`uz-Zawaa.id</em>&#8221; (10/16): “al-Bazzaar reported it, and its narrators are reliable, and there is disagreement about some of them”; and al-Haafiz Ibn Hajr said in &#8220;<em>al-Isaabah</em>&#8221; (1/12): “al-Bazzaar reported it in his &#8220;<em>Musnad</em>&#8220;, and its narrators are declared reliable by some.”</p>

So evil is that which they purchased</span></strong>.]] [Soorah Aali `Imraan (3): 187]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Shaikh `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Naasir as-Sa&#8217;dee- <em>rahimahullaah</em>-said in his Tafseer of the Aayah:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Covenant (<em>al-Meethaaq</em>) is the weighty, emphatic covenant; and Allaah-the Most High-took this Covenant from everyone to whom He gave the Book, and whom He taught knowledge to; that they should clarify to the people whatever they are in need of from that which Allaah taught him, and that they should not hide that, nor be miserly with them regarding it &#8211; particularly if they ask him about it, or when something occurs which necessitates that. So in such a situation it is obligatory upon everyone who possesses knowledge that he clearly explains it to the people, and clarifies the truth from falsehood. So as for those guided to correctness by Allaah, then they carry this out in the most complete manner, and they teach the people that which Allaah has taught them, seeking the Pleasure of their Lord, and out of compassion for the creation, and from fear of the sin of hiding the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who were given the Scripture, from the Jews and the Christians and their like, then they cast this agreement and this covenant behind their backs. They took no notice of it. So they hid the truth and they put forth falsehood. They boldly violated the prohibitions laid down by Allaah; and they neglected the rights of Allaah and the rights of the creation. Through concealing the truth they purchased a paltry gain- which is what they acquire, if they acquire anything, from positions of authority and trivial wealth; from their lowly ones- from those who follow their desires, and who give precedence to their desires over the truth.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> فَبِئْسَ مَا يَشْتَرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So evil is that which they bought</strong></span>]]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">since it is the most wretched exchange. They turned away from clarifying the truth, which is something which brings about eternal bliss, and religious and worldly benefits – the most tremendous and exalted goals. So they only chose that which is lowly and despicable over that which is lofty and precious because of their wretchedness and degradation, and because they are not fitting for anything other than that which they were created for.”</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَهُوَ الْقَاهِرُ فَوْقَ عِبَادِهِ</strong><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He</strong> [Allaah] is <strong><em>al-Qaahir</em></strong> </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em> </em><strong>above His slaves</strong>.</span><br />
[Qur’aan<em>, Soorat Al-An’aam </em>(6:18)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allaah is <em>al-Qaahir</em></strong>: The Most Mighty and the Magnificent, is <strong>dominant</strong> over all his slaves being Himself above creation, the Ever-living, the Mighty, and the AllPowerful. He is the One who <strong>subdued</strong> all of his creatures; everything in the upper and lower worlds is subservient to His Will, and Authority; whatever He willed to happen will certainly occur and as He wanted it to be, and whatever He willed not to occur will never take place; All creatures are in need of Him, they have no control of good or harm to themselves; nor can they control death nor life nor Resurrection. The most powerful creature is nothing before the domination and power of Allaah, the AllMighty; the creatures which people have taken as “gods” besides Allaah, cannot protect themselves let alone to dominate others. Allaah, the perfect is His domination deserves to be worshipped alone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allaah</strong> is the ‘<em>alam</em> (identifying name or title) of the majestic, sole, and true God. This noun, which is the name of Allaah, applies to none other than Him. He, Most Majestic and High, has other names all of which follow on from His name Allaah. The meaning of the name “Allaah” is the <em>ma’looh</em> (that which is worshipped out of love, magnification, deification, and longing).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[See Shaykh Muhammad Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Sharhul ‘Aqeedah Al-Waasitiyyah</em> (Dammaam, KSA: Daar Ibnul Jawzi, 2d. ed. 1415/1994], p. 38, and <em>Sharh Lum’at Al-’Itiqaad</em> (<em>Ismaa’eeliyyah</em>, Egypt: MaktabatulImaam al-Bukhaari (checked by Ashraf Maqsood), 1412/1992)], p. 29.]</span></p>
<p><b>Source</b> : From the eBook: <b><a href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Tafseer Ayatul-Kursi</a></b> – By Shaykh Muhammad bin Saalih Al-’Uthaymeen (<em>rahimahullah</em>). With Related Points of Benefit From the Shaykh’s Commentary on Imaam ibn Taymeeyah’s <em>Sharhul ’Aqeedatil-Waasitiyyah</em>, Prepared by Dr. Saleh As-Saleh (<em>rahimahullah</em>)</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the name <em>Allaah,</em> <strong>Ibn ul-Qayyim</strong> said in <em>Midaarij us-Saalikeen:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“The name <em>Allaah</em> indicates all of the perfect names and lofty attributes in all three ways of indication since it indicates His Divinity, which indicates affirmation of all the characteristics of divinity for Him along with negation of their opposites for Him. So, the attributes of divinity are the attributes of perfection being free from any likeness with the creation and free of any deficiency or imperfection.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the author of the explainer of <em>Kitaab at-Tawheed</em> in <em>Tayseer ul-`Azeez al-<u>H</u>ameed</em>, brings a quote from Ibn ul-Qayyim also with regard to the excellent qualities of the name <em>Allaah</em> that Ibn ul-Qayyim <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the particular virtues of the meaning of this name <em>Allaah</em> then in this regard the most knowledgeable of the creation <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> himself said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“I could not praise You enough as You deserve, You are as You have praised Yourself.”</span></strong></p>
<p>[Reported by Muslim from the <u>h</u>adeeth of A’ishah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anha</em>.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, so how could we enumerate the special virtues of the name of the One Who comprises every perfection unrestrictedly and every praise and commendation and every laudation and exaltation and all splendour and all perfection and all glory and all beauty and all good and all eminence and all generosity, excellence and goodness is for Him and is from Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this name <em>Allaah</em> is not mentioned upon a small amount of something except that it causes it to increase. Nor is it mentioned in a state of fear except that it removes it. Nor is it mentioned upon any misfortune except that it relieves it. Nor in any state of anxiety and distress except that it brings relief. Nor upon any state of difficulty except that it brings ease to it. None who is weak resorts to it except that it brings strength to him. Nor anyone in a state of humiliation except that it brings honour to him. Nor anyone in poverty except that he is enriched. Nor anyone who feels estranged and uneasy except that it causes him to feel at ease. Nor is it mentioned by one who has been overcome except that it brings aid and victory for him. Nor by one who is in straitened circumstances except that his difficulty is removed. Nor is it mentioned by a fugitive except that he finds refuge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is the name, meaning Allaah’s name <em>Allaah</em>, it is the name through which distress is removed through which the descent of blessings is sought and through which supplications are answered. Through it slips are corrected, sins are warded away and good deeds are brought closer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the name with which the earth and heavens were established and with which the revealed books were sent down and with which the messengers were sent. With it the legislated laws were prescribed, through it the prescribed punishments were established and with it <em>jihaad</em> was prescribed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Through this name the creation will become divided into the fortunate and the wretched. With it the true and tremendous day is established and with it, the scales of justice are set up, the bridge laid down and the Paradise and the Fire established. With it, the Lord of all creation is worshipped and praised, for its right the messengers were sent and it will be asked about in the grave and for it, there will be the resurrection. Dispute is regarding it and judgement is to it and alliance and enmity are for it. Through it those who know it and establish its rights will be the fortunate ones and through it those who are ignorant of it and leave its rights will be the wretched ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is the reason for creation and command and through it, they are established and confirmed and to it they arrive at a conclusion. So, the creation comes about through it, returns to it and exists because of it. So, there is nothing in creation and no command nor reward and no punishment except that it starts from it and ends with it. That is what brings it about and its reason. Then he quotes the <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>رَبَّنَا مَا خَلَقْتَ هَٰذَا بَاطِلًا سُبْحَانَكَ فَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O our Lord, You have not created all of this without purpose, free and far removed are You from that. So save us from the punishment of the Fire.</span> </strong> (Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah</em> 191)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then with regard to the name <strong>الله</strong>  <em>Allaah</em>, brief indication of the meaning which is – <strong>t</strong><strong>he One Who is truly venerated and worshipped, the One deserving that He be singled out with all worship because of His perfect attributes of divinity.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"> <strong>الرَّحْمَان</strong> <strong><em>Ar-Rahmaan</em></strong> (the Extremely Merciful), the Merciful One Who has as His attribute mercy, the One possessing tremendous and extensive mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <strong>الرَّحِيم</strong>  <strong><em>Ar-Raheem</em></strong> (the Bestower of mercy), the One Who has mercy upon the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As the verifier has mentioned, the difference between <em>Ar-Rahmaan </em>and <em>Ar-Raheem</em> is <em>Ar-Rahmaan</em> is with regard to the attribute of Allaah’s self, the attribute He has Himself of extreme mercy and <em>Ar-Raheem</em> is His bestowing mercy upon the creation with regard to His action.</p>
<p><strong>[Source</strong>: <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/01/28/the-ninety-nine-names-of-allaah/">The Ninety-Nine Names of Allaah </a>– Dawud Burbank [Audio|En] &amp; Transcribed PDF]</p>
<p><strong>&#8212;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><strong>ar-Rahmaan</strong></em> (The One Who is Most Merciful): This is one of Allaah’s particular names and which denotes the attribute of very great and extensive mercy that exists with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">[<span style="color:#808080;">See Ibnul Qayyim’s Badaai’ Al-Fawaa’id (Beirut, Lebanon: Daarul Khayr, 1st. ed. 1414/1994)], vol. 1, pp. 23-24, and Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s Sharhul <em>‘Aqeedah Al-Waasitiyyah</em>, ibid.</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>ar-Raheem</strong> (The One Who Bestows Mercy): This name denotes that the attribute is related to the <em>marhoom</em> (i.e. the one whom Allaah chooses to receive His <em>Rahmah</em> (Mercy).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the difference between <em>ar-Rahmaan</em> and ar-Raheem is that in the case of the former, <em>ar-Rahmah</em> is His attribute, and in the latter, <em>ar-Rahmah</em> is His act, meaning that He is the One Who bestows <em>ar-Rahmah</em> upon others. So, when both names come together [i.e. <em>ar-Rahmaan</em>, <em>ar-Raheem</em>], then the meaning in this context is that Allaah’s Mercy is very great and extensive, and that His Mercy reaches His creation. This is what is meant by those who say that <em>ar-Rahmaan</em> is the One Whose Mercy encompasses everything (general Mercy), and <em>ar-Raheem</em> is the One who has Mercy upon the believers (special Mercy). Since Allaah’s Mercy upon the <em>kaafir</em> is a special one in this life only, then it is as if they have no mercy upon them, because in the Hereafter when they will ask Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) to save them from Hell and admit being wrong, Allaah will deal with them with His Justice, not His Mercy, Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>اخْسَئُوا فِيهَا وَلَا تُكَلِّمُونِ</strong><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Remain you in it [Hell] with ignominy! And speak not to Me!”</strong></span><br />
[Qur’aan, <em>Soorat Al-Mu’minoon</em> (23:108)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The name <em>ar-Raheem</em> is applied to Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) and may be applied to others. Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) has described His Messenger Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) as <em>Raheem</em> (Soorat At-Tawbah, 9:128).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer (رحمه االله) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“Some of the names of Allaah تعالى are restricted to Him only like the names: Allaah, <em>ar-Rahmaan</em>, <em>al-Khaaliq</em>, <em>ar-Raaziq</em> and so forth. Some other names, however, may be applied to other than Him.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[See <em>Badaai’ Al-Fawaa’id</em>, p. 24, <em>Sharhul ‘Aqeedah Al-Waasitiyyah</em>, pp. 38-39, <em>Lum’atul I’tiqaad</em>, p. 29, <em>Tafseer Ibn Katheer</em> (1:21), <em>Sharh Thalaathat Al-Usool</em> within Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Majmoo’ Fataawaa</em> (Riyadh, KSA: Daar Ath-Thuraya, 1st. ed. 1414/1993)], vol. 6, p. 11.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">1. HIS LINEAGE:</span></strong> He was Aboo Muhammad, `Abdullaah ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Qudaamah ibn Miqdaam ibn Nasr ibn `Abdillaah ibn Hudhayfah ibn Muhammad ibn Ya`qoob ibn al-Qaasim ibn Ibraaheem ibn Ismaa`eel ibn Yahyaa ibn Muhammad ibn Saalim ibn `Abdillaah ibn `Umar ibn al-Khattaab-radiyallaahu `anhumaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Qurashee; al-Maqdisee; al-Jammaa`eelee; then ad-Dimashqee; as-Saalihee; al-Hanbalee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Qurashee:</strong> He was from the tribe of Quraysh, since he was descended from `Umar-radiyallaahu `anhu &#8211; who was `Adawee (i.e. from the sub-tribe of Banoo `Adiyy who were part of Quraysh).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Maqdisee:</strong> His family&#8217;s ascription to &#8216;Baytul-Maqdis&#8217; (Jerusalem) since they lived close to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Jammaa`eelee:</strong> In ascription to the village of Jammaa`eel where he was born; and it is a village on the hills of Nablus &#8211; a city about 40 miles north of Jerusalem in present day occupied Palestine.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>as-Saalihee:</strong> In ascription to the mosque of as-Saalihiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His brother Shaykh Aboo `Umar said: <em>&#8220;They ascribe us to &#8216;as-Saalihiyyah&#8217; because we settled at the mosque of Aboo Saalih, not that we were righteous people (saalihoon).&#8221;</em> [And this is from piety since they were indeed a family of righteousness and rectification].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Hanbalee:</strong> In ascription to the Hanbalee madhhab, i.e. that he learned and was an expert in the madhhab, i.e. that he learned and was an expert in the principles and details of Fiqh followed by the students of Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal. [and he was not a blind follower].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">2. HIS BIRTH:</span></strong> He was born in the month of Sha`baan in the year 541H in the town of Jammaa`eel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">3. HIS FAMILY:</span></strong> He was from a family who were noble in their lineage, their knowledge, and their piety.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>His father:</strong> Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Qudaamah was born in 491H and died in 558H. [He had his son at the age of 50]. He was one of the righteous scholars; famous for knowledge, zuhd and worship. He was the Khateeb of the mosque of Jammaa`eel. He educated his children and taught them the Qur&#8217;aan, and the hadeeth, and correct manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He died when Imaam Muwaffaqud-Deen was about 17 years old, so his elder son Muhammad ibn Ahmad &#8211; who was known as Aboo `Umar &#8211; continued his upbringing and education.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">4. HIS EARLY YEARS, AND HIS SEEKING KNOWLEDGE, AND HIS TRAVELLING TO SEEK KNOWLEDGE:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For the first ten years of his life he remained with his family in Palestine, and he began memorization of the Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then in 551H, when he was 10 years old, his father performed Hijrah (migration) with the family, fleeing from the invading Christians, and migrated to Damascus.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Damascus he completed memorization of the Qur&#8217;aan, and he memorized a large number of ahaadeeth. Then he memorized &#8216;Mukhtasar al-Khiraqee&#8217;-on the Fiqh of Imaam Ahmad. (Then later in life he wrote an explanation of it in 9 volumes, called al-Mughnee).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He remained in Damascus for 10 years, and at the age of twenty he undertook his first journey in search of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-In 561H: he travelled to the main city of knowledge and of the scholars at that time- Baghdaad. He was accompanied by his maternal cousin al-Haafidh `Abdul-Ghanee al- Maqdisee;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He inclined towards the study of Fiqh and his cousin towards hadeeth, however they accompanied each other to the lectures and acquired both;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There he studied with many of the scholars, amongst them: Shaykh `Abdul-Qaadir al-Jeelaanee (D. 561H), Ibnul-Battee, and Ibnul-Manniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He remained in Baghdaad for four years. He studied &#8216;Mukhtasar al-Khiraqee&#8217; under `Abdul-Qaadir al-Jeelaanee, and then the Shaykh died 50 nights after his arrival; then they studied under Ibnul-Jawzee; then he remained with Ibnul-Manniyy, and learned the Fiqh of the Hanbalee madhhab with him, and its principles, and the different sayings of the scholars- and he excelled in that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then returned to Damascus.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; In 567H he again travelled to Baghdaad where he remained for a year seeking knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; In 573H he travelled to Makkah to perform Hajj, and he met the people of knowledge there; amongst them al-Mubaarak ibn at-Tabbaakh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then after performing Hajj in 574: &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; Then from Makkah he travelled to Baghdaad &#8211; where he again remained for a year seeking knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; Then from Baghdaad he returned to Damascus where he started to write works on many branches of knowledge, the most famous of his works being &#8216;al-Mughnee.&#8217;</p>

8. Shaykh Badr ibn `Abdillaah al-Badr (hafidahullaah) in his introduction to his checking of Ibn Qudaamah&#8217;s book &#8216;Ithbaat Sifaat-`Uluww&#8217; gathers a list of his Shaykhs numbering 67, and then said: &#8220;and many others besides them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">6. HIS STUDENTS: </span></strong>Amongst them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. al-Bahaa.ul-Maqdisee (d. 624H) who wrote &#8216;al-`Uddah Sharh al-`Umdah.&#8217;<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">7. HIS PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION AND CHARACTERISTICS:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His student ad-Diyaa. al-Maqdisee said: &#8220;He was of full height, white, with a bright face, large distinct eyes; he was so handsome that it was as if his face was radiating light; he had a broad forehead and a long beard; a straight nose and his eyebrows joined. He had a small head, slender arms and legs; and a thin body; and full senses and faculties. He was extremely intelligent; and behaved in a fine manner&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibnul-Najjaar said: &#8220;al-Muwaffaq was the Imaam of the Hanbalees in the main congregational mosque of Damascus. He was fully reliable, an evidence (in narrating), noble. He had plentiful virtues; and he kept away from anything not befitting; he was pious, a worshipper.He was upon the way of the Salaf. Light and dignity could be seen upon him. A man would take benefit from seeing him even before hearing his speech.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer said: &#8220;He used to engage in optional prayers between the two night prayers (i.e. Maghrib and `Ishaa.) close to his place of prayer. Then when he had prayed the `Ishaa. prayer he would return to his house of the street of ad-Duwalla`ee by the bank of the river. He would take back with him those he could from the poor and needy, and they would eat with him, and his primary house was upon Qaasiyyoon&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ad-Diyaa. said: &#8220;He was fine in his manners: he would hardly ever be seen except that he was smiling. He would relate incidents and joke. I heard al-Bahaa. say; When the people read with him he would joke with us, and be cheerful and at ease. Once they complained to him about some children who studied with him, so he said; &#8220;They are children. They have to have some play, and you used to be just like them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And al-Bahaa. described him as being courageous, and said: &#8220;He used to go forward to the enemy, and he was wounded upon his hand; and he used to take part when the army and the enemy were firing at each other.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ad-Diyaa. said: &#8220;He used to pray with &#8216;Khushoo`&#8217; (humility and attentiveness). He would hardly ever pray the Sunnah prayer before Fajr and after `Ishaa. except in his house; and between the two night prayers he used to pray four rak`ahs, reciting: &#8216;as-Sajdah,&#8217; &#8216;Yaaseen,&#8217; &#8216;ad-Dukhaan,&#8217; and &#8216;Tabaarak.&#8217; He would hardly miss out on them. He used to stand in prayer in the last hours of the night reciting 1/7th of the Qur&#8217;aan. He would sometimes raise his voice and he had a beautiful voice.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">8. SCHOLARS&#8217; PRAISE OF HIM:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The very scholar of hadeeth, Aboo `Amr ibn as-Salaah said: &#8220;I have not seen the like of al-Muwaffaq.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Bakr ibn Ghaneemah &#8211; the muftee of Baghdaad &#8211; said: &#8220;I do not know anyone in our time who has reached the level of ijtihaad except for al-Muwaffaq.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sibt ibn al-Jawzee said: &#8220;He was an Imaam in many fields. After his brother Aboo `Umar and al-`Imaad, there was no one in his time who had greater &#8216;zuhd&#8217; or piety than him. He had a great deal of &#8216;hayaa.&#8217; (sense of shame), and he remained aloof from this world and its people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was easy and mild-mannered, humble, and he had love for the poor. He was fine in manners, generous and giving, whoever saw him then it was as if he had seen one of the Companions; and it was as if light came from his face. He was plentiful in worship.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah said: &#8220;After al-Awzaa`ee no one entered Shaam having more Fiqh knowledge and understanding of the religion than al-Muwaffaq.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ad-Diyaa. al-Maqdisee said: &#8220;He was an Imaam with regard to the Qur&#8217;aan and its explanation; an Imaam in the knowledge of hadeeth and its problematic matters; an Imaam in Fiqh &#8211; indeed the outstanding scholar of his time in that; an Imaam of knowledge of the disagreements of scholars; the outstanding scholar of his time in Laws of Inheritance; an Imaam in Usoolul-Fiqh; an Imaam in Arabic Grammar; an Imaam in mathematics; an Imaam in the movements and positions of stars and planets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Rajab al-Hanbalee said: &#8220;The Faqeeh, the Zaahid, the Imaam. Shaykhul-Islaam. The singular exception scholar.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Haafidh ibn Katheer said: &#8220;Shaykhul-Islaam. An Imaam. An outstanding scholar. There was not in his time, indeed even for a long time before him, anyone having greater knowledge of Fiqh than him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Rajab said: &#8220;He used to closely follow the texts in the matter of al-Usool (fundamentals and belief) and in other than it. He did not hold applying any acts of worship for which there was no narration. He used to order affirmation of the texts, and leaving them as they are &#8211; with regard to what occurs in the Book and the Sunnah from &#8216;as-Sifaat&#8217; (Allaah&#8217;s Attributes): Not altering them, not declaring how they are, not distorting the meaning; not interpreting them away with &#8216;ta&#8217;weel,&#8217; and not negating them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">9. HIS DEATH:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He died (rahimahullaah) on Saturday, the day of `Eidul-Fitr, in 620H, at the age of 79 in his home in Damascus. His funeral which had a huge attendance was held the next day and he was buried on the hill of Qaasiyyoon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">10. HIS WIFE, SLAVE-GIRLS AND CHILDREN:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He married his paternal cousin Maryam bint Abee Bakr ibn `Abdillaah ibn Sa`d al-Maqdisee. They had a number of children: (al-Majd) `Eesaa, Muhammad, Yahyaa, Safiyyah, and Faatimah. Then he took a slave girl, and then another. Then he married `Izziyyah- who died before him. All his sons died in his lifetime, and none of them had offspring except for `Eesaa- who had two righteous sons, however both of them died without any offspring. So the Shaykh had no remaining progeny.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">11. HIS WORKS:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr. `Alee ibn Sa`eed al-Ghaamidee lists his work and they come to 38 in number.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>PURIFICATION FOR THE PRAYER (AT-TAHAARAH LISSALAAT):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn `Umar &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhumaa</em>&#8211; who said: I heard the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) say: &lt;&lt;<strong>Prayer will not be accepted without purification</strong>.&gt;&gt; <sup>[<a href="#fn1" name="fnref1"><strong>01</strong></a>]</sup></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Contents:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Wudoo : It&#8217;s Description</li>
<li>The Conditions (Shuroot) of Wudoo for Its Correctness</li>
<li>Obligations (Faraa’id) of Wudoo</li>
<li>Sunnahs of Wudoo</li>
<li>The Things Which Nullify the Wudoo</li>
<li>That Which the Wudoo Is Obligatory for (What Is Forbidden for the Person Whose State of Purification Is Broken)</li>
<li>That Which the Wudoo Is Recommended For</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THE WUDOO·:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Its description:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Humraan-the mawlaa (freed-slave) of `Uthmaan: that `Uthmaan ibn `Affaan <em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em>&#8211; called for some water for wudoo and he performed the wudoo .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he washed his hands three times; then he washed his mouth and washed out his nose; then he washed his face three times; then he washed his right arm up to and including the elbow three times; then he washed his left arm likewise; then he wiped his head; then he washed his right foot up to and including the ankle three times; then he washed the left one likewise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said: “I saw Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) perform wudoo with the like of this wudoo of mine. Then Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:<span style="color:#808000;">”<strong>Whoever performs wudoo like this wudoo of mine, and he prays two rak`ahs-not conversing with himself in them, then his previous sins will be forgiven for him.</strong>””</span> Ibn Shihaab said: “Our scholars used to say: This wudoo is the most complete wudoo which anyone can make for the Prayer.” <sup>[<a href="#fn2" name="fnref2">02</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">THE CONDITIONS (SHUROOT) FOR ITS CORRECTNESS:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1- The intention (an-Niyyah):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of his (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying: <span style="color:#808000;">“<strong>Actions are but by intentions</strong>”</span>, <sup>[<a href="#fn3" name="fnref3">03</a>]</sup> and it is not legislated to utter it in words, since it is not established from the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">2- Mentioning Allaah’s name (at-Tasmiyah):</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of his (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying: <span style="color:#808000;">“<strong>There is no Prayer for the one who does not have wudoo, and there is no wudoo· for the one who does not mention Allaah’s name upon it</strong>.”</span> <sup>[<a href="#fn4" name="fnref4">04</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">3- Continuity (al-Muwaalaat):</span></strong><sup>[<a href="#fn5" name="fnref5">05</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of Khaalid ibn Ma`daan: [from one of the Companions of the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) that <strong><span style="color:#808000;">the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saw a man praying with a dry spot the size of a dirham, which water had not touched. So the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) ordered him to repeat the wudoo· and the Prayer</span>.</strong> <sup>[<a href="#fn6" name="fnref6">06</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>ITS OBLIGATIONS (FARAA&#8217;ID):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- Washing the face, and from it is washing the mouth (al-Madmadah) and washing out the nose (al-Istinshaaq).<br />
2- Washing the two arms up to the elbows.<sup>[<a href="#fn7" name="fnref7">07</a>]</sup><br />
3- Wiping the whole of the head; and the ears are from the head.<br />
4- Washing the feet up to and including the ankles: because of His Saying -He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>..and your feet up to and including the ankles</strong></span>].<br />
[Sooratul-Maa·idah (5):6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: O you who believe! When you stand to pray, wash your faces and your arms up to and including the elbows, and wipe your heads,]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the washing of the mouth (al-Madmadah) and the washing out of the nose (alIstinshaaq) being from the face, such that they are obligatory, then this is because Allaah -the Perfect- commanded the washing of the face in His Mighty Book; and it is established that the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) continually practised that in every wudoo, and it was reported by all those who reported his (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) wudoo· and explained its description. So this shows that the washing of the face which has been commanded in the Qur&#8217;aan includes washing the mouth and washing out the nose. <sup>[<a href="#fn8" name="fnref8">08</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs a command for the two of them in his (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“When one of you performs wudoo, then let him put water into his nose and then let him blow it out.”</strong></span>,<sup>[<a href="#fn9" name="fnref9">09</a>]</sup> <span style="font-size:1rem;">and his (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying: </span><span style="color:#808000;"><strong style="font-size:1rem;">“Exert in sniffing water into the nose, unless you are fasting”</strong></span><span style="font-size:1rem;">,<sup>[<a href="#fn10" name="fnref10">10</a>]</sup> and his (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying: </span><span style="color:#808000;"><strong style="font-size:1rem;">“When you perform wudoo, then wash your mouth.”</strong></span><span style="font-size:1rem;"> <sup>[<a href="#fn11" name="fnref11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the obligation of wiping over the whole of the head, then this is because the command in the Qur&#8217;aan to wipe is left unspecified (<em>mujmal</em>). So the Sunnah is referred to for its clarification, and it is established in the two Saheehs and elsewhere that <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) wiped the whole of his head</strong></span>. So this contains a proof that it is obligatory to wipe the head completely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then if it is said: It is established from a hadeeth of al-Mugheerah that the <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) wiped over his forelock and upon his turban (`<em>imaamah</em>)</strong></span>, then the response is: he only restricted himself to wiping the forelock because he completed the rest of the wiping of the head upon the turban, and we hold this as our saying; and there is no proof in it for the permissibility of limiting the wiping to the forelock, or to a part of the head, without completing it upon the turban.<sup>[<a href="#fn12" name="fnref12">12</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in summary it is obligatory to wipe the whole of the head; and the person who wipes may wipe upon the head only, or upon the turban only, or upon the head and turban. All of this is authentic and established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the two ears being from the head, such that it is obligatory to wipe them, then it is because of his (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The two ears are from the head.”</strong></span> <sup>[<a href="#fn13" name="fnref13">13</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7- Rubbing the wetted fingers through the beard:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of Anas ibn Maalik <em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em> that when Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) performed wudoo <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>he used to take a handful of water and enter it under his chin, and he would rub it through his beard, and say “This is what my Lord -the Mighty and Majestic- has commanded.”</strong></span> <sup>[<a href="#fn14" name="fnref14">14</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8- Entering the wet fingers between the fingers and toes:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of his (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Complete the wudoo·, and rub between the fingers and toes, and exert in entering water into the nose unless you are fasting.”</strong></span><sup>[<a href="#fn15" name="fnref15">15</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">ITS SUNNAHS:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1- The siwaak (tooth-stick):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Hurayrah <em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em> who said: Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“If it were not that I would make a difficulty upon my nation I would have commanded them to use the siwaak with every wudoo·.”</strong></span><sup>[<a href="#fn16" name="fnref16">16</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2- Washing the hands three times at the beginning of the wudoo·:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of what is established from `Uthmaan -radiyallaahu `anhu, that when he showed how the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) performed wudoo·, <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>he washed his hands three times</strong>.</span><sup>[<a href="#fn17" name="fnref17">17</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3- Combining the washing of the mouth and the washing of the nose</strong> three times, each with a single handful:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of what occurs in the hadeeth of `Abdullaah ibn Zayd -radiyallaahu `anhu when he taught the people how Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) performed the wudoo·: that <strong><span style="color:#808000;">he washed his mouth and washed his nose from a single handful, and he did that three times</span></strong>.<sup>[<a href="#fn18" name="fnref18">18</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4- Exerting in these two, for the one who is not fasting:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of his (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying:<span style="color:#808000;"> <strong>“Exert in sniffing water into the nose, unless you are fasting.”</strong></span><sup>[<a href="#fn19" name="fnref19">19</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>5- Giving precedence to the right side over the left side:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of `Aa·ishah &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhaa</em>-: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) used to like to begin with the right side, when putting on shoes, and when combing his hair, and in his purification, and in all his affairs.”</strong></span><sup>[<a href="#fn20" name="fnref20">20</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And because of what occurs in the hadeeth of `Uthmaan, when he showed how the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) performed wudoo·: that he washed the right side and then the left.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>6- Rubbing (water upon the body parts):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of `Abdullaah ibn Zayd: that two thirds of a handful of water was brought to the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) <strong><span style="color:#808000;">so he rubbed his forearms</span></strong>.<sup>[<a href="#fn21" name="fnref21">21</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>7- Washing three times:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of `Uthmaan: that the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) performed the wudoo, washing each part three times; and it is authentic that he (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) performed wudoo· washing each part once; and washing each part twice. <sup>[<a href="#fn22" name="fnref22">22</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is recommended to repeat the wiping of the head sometimes: because of what is authentic from `Uthmaan that he performed wudoo·, and he wiped his head three times, and he said: “I saw Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) perform wudoo· like this.”<sup>[<a href="#fn23" name="fnref23">23</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>8- (Keeping to) the order (at-Tarteeb):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since this was what Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) generally did, as is reported by those who reported his (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) wudoo·.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However it is authentic from al-Miqdaam ibn Ma`deekarib: “That he brought some water for wudoo· for Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) So he performed wudoo·, and he washed his hands three times, and he washed his face three times; then he washed his forearms three times; then he washed his mouth and washed out his nose three times; then he wiped his head and his ears…”, the hadeeth.<sup>[<a href="#fn24" name="fnref24">24</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>9- Making supplication (du`aa·) after it:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of his (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“There is not one of you who performs wudoo·, and completes the wudoo·, and then says:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلَهَ إلَّا اللهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّداً عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">(Ashhadu an laa ilaaha illallaah, wahdahu laa shareeka lahu, wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan `abduhu wa rasooluhu) </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">‘I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone, having no partner; and I testify that Muhammad is His Slave and His Messenger’, </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">except that the eight gates of Paradise are opened for him: he may enter through whichever of them he pleases.”</span></strong><sup>[<a href="#fn25" name="fnref25">25</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">at-Tirmidhee added:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>اللَّهُمَّ اجْعَلْنِي مِنَ التَّوَّابِينَ وَاجْعَلْنِي مِنَ الْمُتَطَهِّرِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>(Allaahummaj `alnee minat-Tawwaabeena waj`alnee minal- Mutatahhireen) </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘O Allaah! Make me from those who constantly repent, and make me from those who purify themselves.’</strong></span><sup>[<a href="#fn26" name="fnref26">26</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from Aboo Sa`eed that the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever performs wudoo· and says:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>سبْحانَك اللَّهُمّ وبحَمْدكَ أشْهدُ أنْ لا إله إلا أنْت أسْتغْفِركَ وَأتَوبُ إليْك</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>(Subhaanakallaahumma wa bihamdika, ashhadu an laa ilaaha illaa Anta, astaghfiruka wa atoobu ilaika)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘ I declare You free of all imperfections, and all praise is for You. I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but you. I seek Your forgiveness, and I turn in repentance to You’,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>then it is written upon a parchment, then it is sealed with a seal, and it is not broken until the Day of Resurrection.”</strong></span><sup>[<a href="#fn27" name="fnref27">27</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10- Praying the two rak`ahs after it &#8211; because of the saying of `Uthmaan, after he taught them the description of the wudoo· of Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I saw the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) perform wudoo· with the like of this wudoo·, and the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:<span style="color:#808000;"> <strong>“Whoever performs wudoo· with the like of this wudoo·; then he stands and prays two rak`ahs, not conversing with himself in them, then his previous sins are forgiven.”</strong></span><sup>[<a href="#fn28" name="fnref28">28</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from Aboo Hurayrah: that the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) said to Bilaal, at the time of the Dawn Prayer: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“O Bilaal! Tell me about the action which you have done in Islaam which gives you the most hope, for I have heard your footsteps in front of me in Paradise.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: “I have not done any action which gives me greater hope than the fact that I have never purified myself at any hour of the night or the day except that I prayer what was written for me to pray with that purification.”<sup>[<a href="#fn29" name="fnref29">29</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE THINGS WHICH NULLIFY THE WUDOO·:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. That which comes out of the two pathways (the genitals and the anus) from excrement, urine, and wind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to the Saying of Allaah- the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Or if one of you comes from the toilet</strong></span>]],<br />
[Sooratul-Maa·idah (5):6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and it is an expression which means relieving oneself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And due to the saying of the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>)<span style="color:#808000;"> <strong>“Allaah will not accept the Prayer of any one of you who breaks his purification until he performs wudoo·.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a man from Hadramawt said: “What is ‘breaking purification’ (hadath), O Aboo Hurayrah?’’ He said: “Breaking wind noiselessly or with a sound.’’<sup>[<a href="#fn30" name="fnref30">30</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is likewise nullified by discharge of pre-seminal fluid (al-Madhee) and al-Wadee.<sup>[<a href="#fn31" name="fnref31">31</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn `Abbaas -radiyallaahu `anhu)maa- who said: “<strong>al-Manee</strong>, and <strong>al-Wadee</strong> and <strong>al-Madhee</strong>. As for al-Manee (semen) then it is that which necessitates taking a bath (ghusl). As for ‘al-Wadee’ and al-Madhee (pre-seminal fluid), then he said: Wash your penis, or the parts of your penis, and perform the wudoo as you would do for the Prayer.’’ <sup>[<a href="#fn32" name="fnref32">32</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Sleep which overwhelms, such that no consciousness remains with him, whether he is sitting with his buttocks firmly on the ground or not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of Safwaan ibn `Assaal who said: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) used to command us that when we were on a journey that we should not take off our leather socks for three days along with their nights, except from janaabah. <sup>[<a href="#fn33" name="fnref33">33</a>]</sup> However from excrement, and urine, and sleep.”</strong></span> <sup>[<a href="#fn34" name="fnref34">34</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) equated sleep with urinating and voiding excrement. From `Alee <em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em> who said <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The eye is the tying string (wikaa·) for the anus (as-Sah), so whoever sleeps then let him perform wudoo·.”</strong></span><sup>[<a href="#fn35" name="fnref35">35</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the wikaa·, with a kasrah on the waaw, is the string which is used to tie a leather bag.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the sah, with a fathah on the seen -which is without dots, and with a kasrah on the haah -which is without shaddah is the anus. And the meaning is that being awake is the tying-string for the anus, i.e. guarding that which is contained within it from coming out, since as long as he is awake he will feel that which comes out from it. <sup>[<a href="#fn36" name="fnref36">36</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Loss of consciousness through intoxication or illness:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because unconsciousness through these causes is more profound than when it results from sleep.<sup>[<a href="#fn37" name="fnref37">37</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Touching the uncovered genitals, if it is done with desire:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of his (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever touches his penis, then let him perform wudoo·”</strong></span><sup>[<a href="#fn38" name="fnref38">38</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Is it not except a part of you.”</strong> </span><sup>[<a href="#fn39" name="fnref39">39</a>]</sup> So it is just a part of you if there is no desire attached to the touching, because in this condition it is possible to see the resemblance of touching that part with touching any other part of the body. Contrary to when he touches it with desire, for then touching it will not resemble touching any other part, because that will not normally be connected to desire. And this matter is clear, as you can see.<sup>[<a href="#fn40" name="fnref40">40</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Eating camel meat:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because the hadeeth of al-Baraa· ibn `Aazib -radiyallaahu `anhu(maa)- who said: Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Perform wudoo· from camel meat, and do not perform wudoo· from meat of sheep.”</strong></span><sup>[<a href="#fn41" name="fnref41">41</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from Jaabir ibn Samurah<em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em> : That a man asked the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) Should I perform wudoo· from eating the meat of sheep?” He said: “If you wish then perform wudoo·, and if you wish then don’t perform wudoo·.” He said: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Should I perform wudoo· from the meat of camels. He said: “ Yes, perform wudoo· from the meat of camels.”</strong></span> <sup>[<a href="#fn42" name="fnref42">42</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THAT WHICH THE WUDOO· IS OBLIGATORY FOR (WHAT IS FORBIDDEN FOR THE PERSON WHOSE STATE OF PURIFICATION IS BROKEN):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>1. The Prayer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of His Saying, He -the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who believe! When you stand up intending to pray, then wash your faces…</strong></span>]], the Aayah. [Sooratul Maa·idah (5):6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to the saying of the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) that <strong><span style="color:#808000;">Allaah will not accept a Prayer without Purification.”</span> </strong><sup>[<a href="#fn43" name="fnref43">43</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>2. Performing Tawaaf around the House:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to his (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Tawaaf around the House is Prayer, except that Allaah has made speech permissible in it.”</strong></span><sup>[<a href="#fn44" name="fnref44">44</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THAT WHICH THE WUDOO· IS RECOMMENDED FOR:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1. The remembrance of Allaah- the Mighty and Majestic:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of al-Muhaajir ibn Qunfudh, that he gave the greeting of Salaam to the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) whilst he was urinating, and he did not respond to him until he had performed wudoo·. Then he responded to him, and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“I was not prevented from responding to you except by the fact that I disliked to make mention of Allaah except upon purification..”</strong></span><sup>[<a href="#fn45" name="fnref45">45</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">2. Sleep:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of what al-Baraa· ibn Aazib -radiyallaahu `anhu(maa)- said: The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“When one of you go to your bed then perform wudoo as you would perform wudoo· for the prayer. Then lie down upon your right-hand side, then say: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“O Allaah I have submitted my soul to You, and I have turned my face to You, and I have entrusted my affair to You, and I have placed my dependence upon You, hoping and having fear in You. There is no shelter and no place of safety from You except towards You. O Allaah, I believe in Your Book which You sent down and in Your Prophet who You sent.” </strong></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>So if you die on that night of yours , then you will be upon the fitrah (the true Religion), and make them the last things you speak with.”</strong></span><sup>[<a href="#fn46" name="fnref46">46</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>3. The Junub (The person who is in a state of Janaabah):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he wants to eat or drink or sleep or repeat the act of intercourse: From `Aa·ishah- radiyallaahu `anhaa- that she said that <strong><span style="color:#808000;">the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) when he was junub, and he wanted to eat or sleep, would perform wudoo· in the way in which he performed wudoo· for the Prayer.</span> </strong><sup>[<a href="#fn47" name="fnref47">47</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from `Ammaar ibn Yaasir -radiyallaahu `anhu(maa)- that the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) gave concession for the junub, when he wanted to eat or drink or sleep, that he could perform wudoo· in the manner in which he performs wudoo· for the Prayer.<sup>[<a href="#fn48" name="fnref48">48</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from Aboo Sa`eed<em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em> from the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“When one of you has relations with his wife and then he wants to repeat, then let him perform wudoo·.”</span></strong><sup>[<a href="#fn49" name="fnref49">49</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">4. Before taking a ghusl (bath),</span></strong> whether it is one which is obligatory or one which is recommended:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Aa·ishah- radiyallaahu `anhaa- who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘‘When Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) used to take a bath from janaabah he would begin with washing his hands.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>5. Eating that which has been touched by fire</strong></span> (eating cooked food):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah<em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em> who said: I heard Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying: <strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Perform wudoo· from that which has been touched by fire.”</span></strong><sup>[<a href="#fn51" name="fnref51">51</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is taken to be a recommendation because of the hadeeth of `Ammaar ibn `Umayyah ad-Damree who said: <strong><span style="color:#808000;">I saw the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) cutting some meat from the shoulder of a sheep and he ate from it, then he was called to the Prayer. So he got up, and threw down the knife, and prayed and he did not perform wudoo·.</span></strong><sup>[<a href="#fn52" name="fnref52">52</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>6. For every Prayer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of Buraydah <em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em> who said: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) used to perform wudoo· for every Prayer. Then, when it was the Day of the Conquest, he performed wudoo·, and he wiped over his leather socks, and he prayed the Prayers with a single wudoo·.</strong> </span>So `Umar said to him: “O Messenger of Allaah! You have done something which you had not used to do.” So he said: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“ I did it deliberately, O `Umar.”</strong></span><sup>[<a href="#fn53" name="fnref53">53</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>7. Every time that purification is broken:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of Buraydah <em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em> who said Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) entered the morning one day, and he called for Bilaal, and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“O Bilaal on account of what have you preceded me in Paradise? Last night I entered Paradise and I heard the sound of your footsteps in front of me.” </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bilaal said: “O Messenger of Allaah! I have never given the adhaan except that I prayed two rak`ahs; and my purification was never broken except that I then performed wudoo·. So Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “Because of this.”<sup>[<a href="#fn54" name="fnref54">54</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>8. From vomiting:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of Ma`daan ibn Abee Talhah: from Abud-Dardaa·: that <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) vomited, so he broke his fast, and he performed wudoo</strong></span>·. He said: So I met Thawbaan in the mosque of Damascus, and I mentioned that to him. So he said: ‘He has spoken the truth. I poured the water out for him to make wudoo·.’<sup>[<a href="#fn55" name="fnref55">55</a>]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">9. Whoever carries a dead person:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of his (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying:<span style="color:#808000;"><strong> “Whoever washes a dead person, then let him take a bath; and whoever carries him, then let him perform wudoo·.”</strong></span><sup>[<a href="#fn56" name="fnref56">56</a>]</sup></p>

However we do not say that because of the hadeeth of Ibn `Abbaas that the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “You do not have to take the bath for washing your dead, when you have washed him; for your dead person is not impure. So it is sufficient for you to wash your hands.” It was reported by al-Haakim (1/386), and al-Bayhaqee (3/398). Slightly adapted from ‘Ahkaamul-Janaa·iz’ of al-Albaanee (p. 53)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Moosaa, the one to whom Allaah spoke directly, the strong and trustworthy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We see that his call was directed to <em>tawheed</em> and carried the lights of guidance and wisdom. Moosaa was brought up and was raised in the palaces of the greatest tyrant who claimed divinity. He knew the various types of corruption, unbelief, tyranny, injustice and despotism from what he witnessed in the palaces. He saw things which it is difficult to imagine or think possible. He also saw the enslavement of his people, the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em>, and their humiliation, and their women taken as slaves, and the killing of their children, to such an extent that it surpassed any oppression known to mankind. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Pharaoh exalted himself haughtily in the land, and divided its people into castes. He enslaved a group of them (i.e., the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em>), killing their sons and letting their women live. He was indeed one of the corrupt evil-doers.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of Pharaoh were also people of <em>shirk</em> and idol-worship without a doubt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">So how did Moosaa begin? Was his call directed to correction of the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of this idolatrous nation? Or did it begin with a demand for the restoration of the rights of the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em>, and a struggle to gain rulership and authority from the hands of the tyrant, and at the head of them Pharaoh, who claimed divinity for himself?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The call of Moosaa was just like the call of his forefathers and brothers from the earlier Prophets. His Lord instructed him and inspired him with the principle of <em>tawheed</em>, and chose him to carry his revelation, and to establish worship of Him. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Has not the story of Moosaa come to you? When he saw a fire and said to his family, ‘Remain where you are for I have seen a fire. Perhaps I can bring a fire-brand from it or find someone who can show us the way.’ So when Moosaa came to the fire his Lord called him, ‘O Moosaa, I am your Lord. Remove your shoes, indeed you are in the purified valley of <em>Tuwaa</em>. I have chosen you as My Messenger, so listen to and heed what I reveal to you. Indeed I am Allaah. None has the right to be worshipped but Me. So worship Me and do not worship anything else besides Me, and establish Prayer for My remembrance. Indeed the Final Hour is certainly coming, which I keep hidden from all except Myself, in order to reward each soul according to its good or bad deeds.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this was the beginning of his Messengership; he was inspired and ordered with the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of <em>tawheed</em>. He was ordered to establish it in himself and to represent it in his life. Then he was entrusted with the duty of calling to this sublime principle and was sent by Allaah to the Pharaoh. Allaah furthermore explained to him the correct manner of giving <em>da’wah</em> and the wise way in which he was to face the Pharaoh. Allaah, the Most High, said:<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Go to Pharaoh who has transgressed all bounds in his haughtiness, pride, unbelief, and say, ‘Will you not purify yourself from the sin of unbelief and be obedient to your Lord? And that I guide you to the worship of your Lord, so that you may submit fearfully to Him and obey Him.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also supported him with his brother Haaroon in order for the proof to be established to the utmost, and He taught them to use gentleness and mildness in <em>da’wah</em> since that is the best way to attain the guidance of those whom Allaah wishes to guide:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Go both of you to Pharaoh, indeed he has transgressed beyond all bounds, and speak mildly with him that he might accept admonition and fear and be obedient to his Lord.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they carried out the order of their Lord and called him to Allaah, hoping for him to be guided and purified, so that he should be one of those who fear Allaah and fear and beware of the evil consequences of <em>shirk</em> and oppression. But he did not respond to this wise and composed call. So Moosaa manifested the great signs and clear proofs of his Prophethood and the truthfulness of his Messengership. But the despotic tyrant Pharaoh merely increased in his transgression and rejection of the truth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“But Pharaoh denied the signs which Moosaa came with and disobeyed his order for him to fear and obey his Lord. Then he turned away from what he ordered him (i.e., obedience to his Lord) and instead worked evil and corruption, and he gathered his people and his followers and said, ‘I am your lord, the most high.’ So Allaah seized him with punishment for his latter and his earlier saying.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Escalation of the Tyranny of the Pharaoh and how Moosaa and his People Faced it with Patient Perseverance and Forbearance</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“The chiefs of Pharaoh’s people said, ‘Will you leave Moosaa and his people to cause mischief in the land when they have abandoned worship of you and worship of your gods?’ He said, ‘We will kill their sons and let their women live, and will have full power over them.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what was the sin of Moosaa and his people in the view of these criminals? No crime except that they called to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and to remain firm upon it, and to disbelieve in Pharaoh and his idols. Then what was the response of Moosaa with respect to these disgraceful and outrageous transgressions which exceeded all bounds in its barbarity and ferocity?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His response was to remain firm upon correct belief, and to have patience and forbearance, and to seek the aid of Allaah in facing these calamities. Then he awaited the good outcome, and victory as a consequence and a good fruit of this remaining firm and this patient perseverance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Moosaa said to his people, ‘Seeks Allaah’s help and be patient, the earth is Allaah’s, He gives it as a heritage to whom He pleases from His servants. The final outcome is in favour of those who fear Allaah by avoiding disobedience of Him and doing what He orders.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then when no hope that the Pharaoh and his people would believe remained, and the suffering which the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em> were subjected to increased in severity, the sole request which Moosaa made to the Pharaoh was that he should allow the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em> the freedom to leave the land of Egypt and emigrate to wherever Allaah willed that they should go, in order to save them from the torment inflicted upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“So go to the Pharaoh, saying, ‘We are the Messengers sent by your Lord, to order you to free the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em>. So release them and cease tormenting them. Indeed we bring you a clear sign from your Lord, and peace and safety from Allaah’s punishment are for those who follow the guidance.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was a sublime call to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah containing light and wisdom. It was also accompanied by an eager desire for the guidance of those who were being called, and that they should be purified. It also contained a clear example of the utmost patience and forbearance in enduring great harm, and in facing tyranny and haughty oppression. It also shows the way to face the most difficult situations with wisdom and forbearance, whilst having the strongest hope in Allaah, that He will assist and grant victory to the Believers and destroy the unbelieving oppressors. Including clear lessons for those who make their call purely seeking the Face of Allaah and desire to rectify mankind and to turn to their Lord, and for them to be guided to His Straight Path.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Importance of <em>Tawheedul-Uloohiyyah<br />
</em>(Singling out Allaah with all Worship)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will discuss <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah with regard to worship (<em>Tawheedul-Uloohiyyah) </em>and its importance because of two reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Firstly</span></strong>, that it is the most important part of the call of the Messengers presented to us in the Qur’aan, and because it was the reason for the continual struggle between them and their enemies, the proud and haughty, and the obstinate, in every nation. It has continued as the reason for conflict until this day, and perhaps it will continue as such until the Day of Resurrection, as a trial and test for the inheritors of the Messengers, and in order to raise their station.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Secondly</span></strong>, the most severe and dangerous deviation afflicting the Muslims in the east and the west is with regard to it, and this affects the majority of the ignorant amongst the Muslims and many of those who are educated and those who associate themselves with knowledge. So we will begin by presenting the calls of the Prophets in general, and then present the call of some of them in particular.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“We sent a Messenger to every nation ordering them that they should worship Allaah alone, obey Him and make their worship purely for Him, and that they should avoid everything worshipped besides Allaah. So from them there were those whom Allaah guided to His religion, and there were those who were unbelievers for whom misguidance was ordained. So travel through the land and see the destruction that befell those who denied the Messengers and disbelieved.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“We did not send any Messenger before you, O Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  , except that We revealed to him that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, so make all of your worship purely for Him.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, says after mentioning a number of stories of the Prophets, <em>alayhimus-salaatu was-salaam:</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“This religion of yours is a single religion, and I am your Lord, so worship Me alone.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“O Messengers, eat from the food which Allaah has made lawful, and do correct and righteous deeds. Indeed, I am fully aware of whatever you do. Indeed this religion of yours is a single religion, and I am your Lord so keep yourselves safe from My punishment by obeying Me.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Katheer said, “Mujaahid, Sa’eed ibn Jubayr, Qataadah and Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Zayd ibn Aslam said about the saying of Allaah, the Most High,  which means, <strong>‘Your religion is one.’</strong>”<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> Then the meaning of these two <em>Aayaat </em>occurs in the <em>Sunnah</em> in his (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   saying, <strong><em>“I am the closest of the people to &#8216;Eesaa ibn Maryam in this world and the Hereafter. The Prophets are brothers, their mothers are different, but their religion is one.”</em></strong><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also Allaah, the Most High, says about the Messengers who were firmest in determination (<em>oolul-&#8216;adham</em>), <em>alayhimus-salaatu was -salaam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Your Lord prescribed for you O people, the same religion which He prescribed for Nooh, and that which We revealed to you O Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> ), and which He prescribed for Ibraaheem, and Moosaa, and ’Eesaa, that you should establish the religion, acting upon what is prescribed, and not split into sects with regard to it. It is intolerable to the polytheists that you call them to sincerely worship Allaah alone and reject worship of all else besides Him. But Allaah chooses for His religion whomever He pleases and He guides those who turn to Him in repentance and obedience, to act in obedience to Him, and to follow the guidance with which He sent His Messenger.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the call of all the Prophets, and at the head of them the Messengers who were firmest in determination. So the Prophets who numbered <strong>one hundred and twenty four thousand</strong> <a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> followed a single methodology in their call, and began from a single starting point which is <em>tawheed</em>, the greatest issue and most important principle which they conveyed to all mankind, throughout the ages and despite their varying societies, lands and times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a proof that this is the single way which must be followed in calling the people to Allaah, and it is something laid down by Allaah to be followed by all of His Prophets and their true and sincere followers. It is not permissible to change or replace it, nor to turn away from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Examples From the Calls of Some of the Messengers</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, has informed us about some of the individuals from the greater Prophets, and how they faced their people. We see that all of them proceeded upon the universal way laid down for them by Allaah and they followed the methodology established for all of them by Allaah. Not a single one of them is at variance with it. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And We sent Nooh to his people saying, ‘I am a clear warner sent to you, that you should worship none besides Allaah. Indeed, if you do not make all your worship purely for Him I fear for you the torment of a painful Day.’ The chiefs of the disbelievers amongst his people said, ‘We see that you are but a man like ourselves and we do not see you followed except by the lowest of the people, in what is apparent to us. Nor do we see that you have any excellence over us, rather we think that you are a liar.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong style="color:#008000;">“And to ’Aad We sent Hood, saying, ‘O my people worship Allaah, making all of your worship purely for Him, since there is none besides Him having the right to be worshipped by you. Will you not fear your Lord?’ The leaders of those who disbelieved amongst his people said, ‘We see you upon error </strong><span style="color:#008000;">(due to your abandonment of our religion and worship of our gods)</span><strong style="color:#008000;"> and we think that you are a liar </strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in claiming to be a Messenger from the Lord of the Worlds).</span><strong style="color:#008000;">’ He said, ‘O my People, I am not upon error, I am indeed a Messenger sent by the Lord of the Worlds. I convey to you the Message of my Lord and am sincere in my advice and faithful to my trust. Do you wonder that Allaah should send admonition for you through a man from amongst you, warning you of Allaah’s punishment and to fear Him? And remember the blessings of Allaah upon you in that He made you successors to the people of Nooh </strong><span style="color:#008000;">(after drowning them for their unbelief and denial of their Messenger)</span><b style="color:#008000;">, and He increased you in height and size. So remember the </b><span style="color:#008000;"><b>favours</b></span><b style="color:#008000;"> bestowed upon you by Allaah, so that you may be successful.’ They said, ‘Do you come to us warning us of punishment from Allaah for that which we practise as religion, so that we should instead worship Allaah alone and forsake what our fathers used to worship? We will not do that, so bring us the punishment which you threaten us with if you are truthful.’ He said, ‘Allaah’s punishment and wrath have become unavoidable for you. Do you dispute with me about mere idols which you and your fathers have given names to, things which can neither bring harm nor benefit, and Allaah has given no proof or excuse for their worship? Then wait for Allaah’s judgement between us, I too shall wait.’ So We saved Hood and those with him through Our Mercy </b><span style="color:#008000;">(due to their eemaan and their worship of Allaah alone)</span><b style="color:#008000;">, and we annihilated those who rejected Our signs and were not Believers.”</b><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the call of the Messengers, all of them followed this methodology in their <em>da’wah</em> to Allaah: they called first to the <em>tawheed </em>of Allaah, and that He alone must be singled out with all worship. Then their people opposed them because of this, except those whom Allaah guided, facing them with mockery, charging them with being liars and seeking to ridicule them. As Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Many Prophets were sent to the earlier peoples, and no Prophet came to them except that the people met him with mockery.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing more severe and hurtful to lofty believing souls than accusations of falsehood, ridicule and mockery. These things are more hurtful to them than being struck with swords and imprisonment and punishment. This fact is mentioned by the Arab poet who said, “<strong>Being harmed by close relatives is more painful to the soul than being struck with a sharpened sword</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">’Aa’ishah, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhaa, </em>asked the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , <em>“Has there been a day more severe upon you than the Day of Uhud?” So he said, “Your tribe has troubled me greatly, and the most troublesome thing which I experienced from them was on the day of ’Aqabah when I presented myself to ’Abd Yaaleel ibn ’Abd Kulaal and he didn&#8217;t respond as I had hoped. So I returned overwhelmed with sorrow and did not recover until I reached Qarnuth-Tha’aalib.</em><a style="color:#333399;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a><em> I raised my head and saw a cloud shading me, then I looked and saw Jibreel in it, and he called me saying, ‘Allaah has heard what your people said to you and their reply, and Allaah has sent the Angel of the mountains to you, for you to order him to do whatever you wish.’ So the Angel of the mountains called me and greeted me with salaam and then said, ‘O Muhammad, Allaah has heard what your people said to you, and I am the Angel of the mountains, and my Lord has sent me to you for you to order me as you wish. So what do you wish?’ So Allaah’s Messenger (</em><em>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</em><em> )   said, “No, rather I hope that from their offspring will come those who will worship Allaah alone and not worship anything else besides Him.”</em></span><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>hadeeth</em> clearly shows the <em>da’wah</em> of Allaah’s Messenger (ﷺ) and his perseverance in that, and his mildness with his people. See how he was patient with them and asked for them to be spared from destruction which would have wiped them out. He instead hoped for good from Allaah, and hoped that from their offspring would come those who worshipped Allaah alone, not worshipping anything besides Him. Indeed what a noble and lofty goal, which is not realized except by those who taste the blessing of <em>tawheed</em> and know its station.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The books of <em>Seerah</em><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a> detail some of the answers given by those who mocked him and their scornful stance when he invited them to Islaam. They mention that he went to a number of the nobles and leaders of the tribe of Thaqeef, and they were three brothers, ’Abd Yaleel, Mas&#8217;ood and Habeeb&#8230; and he sat with them and called them to Allaah and asked them to support Islaam and stand with him against those of his people who opposed him. So one of them said, “If it is actually true that Allaah has sent you, then He is tearing down the covering of the Ka’bah.” The second said, “Could Allaah not find anyone to send but you?” The third said, “By Allaah, I will never speak with you. If you are truly a Messenger from Allaah as you claim, then you are more serious than to have me reply to your words, and if you are lying against Allaah then it is not proper that I should ever speak to you.” So Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   left having despaired of good from Thaqeef.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What we see from the <em>hadeeth</em> and the stroy is that mockery and scorn and harm caused by the foolish idolaters was more severe to the Prophets than any other trouble, even more so than the fierce battles in which lives are spent and the blood of their pure companions is shed. Indeed on the Day of Uhud more than seventy Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   were martyred.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a> Amongst them: Mus’ab ibn ’Umayr,<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a> and Hamzah ibn ’Abdil- Muttalib<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a> the paternal uncle of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , and Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   was injured in the face and his incisor was broken.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a> He also suffered along with his Companions at the hands of the hypocrites, and suffered great harm and hardship before that in Makkah, and at Badr and other battles. Yet despite all of this, the severest trouble which he faced was on the Day of Taa’if because of the mockery and contempt which he faced to such a degree that it is unbearable for pure souls. Furthermore Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   said, <em>“<strong>Those who suffered the severest trials are the Prophets, then those who are most like them, then those who are most like them after that.</strong>”</em><a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So those who are most like them, and then those who are next closest are those who proceed upon their methodology in calling to Allaah, and called to what they called to, i.e. to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and that He is to be singled out with all worship, and to rejection of all <em>shirk</em> (attribution of any form or part of worship to anyone besides Allaah). Such people will suffer similar harm and trials as suffered by the Prophets who are their example. It is because of this fact that you see many of the callers departing away from this difficult methodology, and this rugged path, since the caller who follows it will have to face opposition from his mother, his father, his brother, his friends and those whom he loves. He will be opposed by the society which will treat him as an enemy and seek to mock and harm him. So many callers divert their attention to other aspects of Islaam which do have their place, and are not denied by anyone who truly believes in Allaah, except that those aspects do not involve that difficulty and hardship and do not bring about mockery and harm particularly in Islamic societies. This is because the majority of the people of the <em>ummah</em> of Islaam are willing to gather around these type of callers, and they throw praise and honour upon them instead of mockery and harm, unless they pose a threat to the rulers and are a danger to their positions, in which case they suppress them brutally. For example political parties which oppose the rulers and threaten to dethrone them. In such a case the rulers will show no love to relatives or friends, Muslims or disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then in any case we say to those callers: no matter how much noise they make, and no matter how high they raise their voices in the name of Islaam, restrain yourselves because you have left the way prescribed by Allaah and His Straight Path, upon which the Prophets and their followers proceeded in calling to <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and to making the religion purely for Him. So no matter how much you speak and raise your voices in the name of Islaam, you are still deviating from the methodology of the Prophets which was laid down by Allaah. No matter how much effort you expend, and how much you manage to extend your <em>da’wah</em> and your own methodology, you are still preoccupying yourselves with the means to the exclusion of the goal. Then what use are the means<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a> if they merely harm the goal, and they themselves grow at its expense.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed woe to those callers who obstinately persist upon the methodologies which they themselves have innovated, those who fight against the methodology of the Prophets in calling to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah, beneath dazzling banners and slogans which captivate the simple minded and those ignorant of the methodology and way of the Prophets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)   suffered the worst forms of torture because of their adherence to the correct <em>‘aqeedah, </em>and their making all worship purely and sincerely for Allaah alone, and their rejection of <em>shirk</em> and <em>kufr</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From ’Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said, “The first people to openly proclaim their Islaam were seven: Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  , Aboo Bakr, ’Ammaar and his mother Sumayyah, Suhayb, Bilaal and al-Miqdaad. So as for Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  , Allaah gave him protection through his uncle Aboo Taalib. As for Aboo Bakr, Allaah gave him protection through his people. But as for the rest of them, the <em>Mushriks</em> would take hold of them and dress them in iron armour and place them to scorch and roast in the sun. There was not one of them except that they responded to them except Bilaal, for his soul became as nothing to him for Allaah’s sake, and his people had no respect for him. So they gave him to the children who used to drag him around the streets of Makkah and he would say repeatedly, ‘<strong>(He who has the right to worship is) One, One.</strong>’”[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the <em>Seerah</em> of Ibn Hishaam [2] there occurs: ’Umayyah ibn Khalf used to take him (Bilaal) out in the midday heat of the sun, and throw him down upon his back, on the ground of the flat valley bed of Makkah, and he would order for a large rock to be placed on his chest. Then he would say, “By Allaah, you will stay like this until you die, unless you disbelieve in Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)   and you worship <em>al-Laat</em> and <em>al-’Uzzaa</em>.” So he would say, whilst he was in that condition, “<strong>(He who alone has the right to worship is) One, One</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sumayyah was tortured until death because of the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of <em>tawheed</em> not becasue she was a political leader. So from Mujaahid who said, “<strong>The first martyr in Islaam was Sumayyah the mother of ’Ammaar. Aboo Jahl thrust a spear into her abdomen.</strong>”[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Sa&#8217;d said, “She accepted Islaam early on in Makkah and she was one of those who was tortured to force them to abandon their religion. But she bore and endured it until Aboo Jahl came to her and thrust a spear into her abdomen and she died.”[4]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Reported by al-Haakim in <em>al-Mustadrak </em>(3/284) and he declared it <em>saheeh</em> and adh-Dhahabee mentioned it in <em>Siyar A’laamin-Nubalaa</em> (1/348) and he said, “It has a <em>saheeh</em> chain of narration&#8230;”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Yoosuf (عليه السلام)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The noble one, son of the noble one, son of the noble one.[1] About whom Allaah sent down a long <em>Soorah</em> relating his noble life to us, and its stages, from his childhood to his death, and how his circumstances changed, and the difficulties that he faced, and how he faced everything with the Strength of Prophethood and his patient perseverance, wisdom and mildness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yoosuf, <em>’alayhis-salaam, </em>saw the corrupt outlook of the Pharaohs in Egypt and their oppression, and he knew the beliefs of the nation amongst whom he lived. He knew the corruption of their beliefs and their idolatry, which led them to take idols and cattle as gods to worship besides Allaah. The stroy of this noble Prophet, <em>‘alayhis-salaam, </em>is long, and from it, we will examine the story of his imprisonment and his <em>da’wah</em> at that time. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And two young men entered the prison along with him. One of them said, ‘I saw in a dream that I was pressing grapes,’ and the other one said, ‘I saw in a dream that I was carrying bread upon my head and birds were eating from it.’ ‘Inform us of the interpretation of this for indeed we see that you are one of the doers of good.’ He said, ‘No food will come to you to eat except that I will inform you about it fully before it comes to you. This is from the knowledge which my Lord has taught me as I have remained free of the religion of a people who do not believe in the oneness of Allaah and who are disbelievers in the Hereafter. Rather I follow the religion of my fathers, Ibraaheem, Ishaaq and Ya&#8217;qoob. It is not fitting that we should worship anything else along with Allaah. This is from Allaah’s favour upon us and upon the people, yet most of the people do not give thanks for Allaah’s favours. O my two companions in the prison, is it better that you worship many different lords, or that you worship only Allaah, the One, Who subdues and has full power over everything? You do not worship besides Allaah except idols which you call gods, which you and your forefathers give names to, for which Allaah has sent down no authority. Authority is for Allaah alone. He ordered that you worship none but Him, that is the Straight and true religion, yet most of the people do not know (and are people of <em>shirk)</em>.’”</strong>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This noble Prophet, <em>’alayhis-salaam, </em>lived in their palaces and was therefore well aware of the corruption of their administration and their rulers. He experienced at first hand their plots, their oppression, their unjust persecution and imprisonment by them. Furthermore he lived amongst an idolatrous nation who worshipped idols, cattle and stars. So where was correction to begin? What was the starting point?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff9900;">Did he begin calling to Allaah, whilst he was wrongfully imprisoned along with others who were oppressed like him, by inciting them and rousing them against the despotic and tyrant rulers? This would be without a doubt a political response, and was an opportunity open to him. Or did he begin his call from the starting point adopted by his noble forefathers, and at the head of them Ibraaheem, the chosen and beloved Friend of Allaah and the <em>Imaam</em> of the call to <em>tawheed</em>; which was the starting point for all the Messengers of Allaah? There is no doubt that the single way of correction and rectification in every time and place is the way of calling to correct <em>‘aqeedah</em> and <em>tawheed</em> and that all worship should be made purely and sincerely for Allaah alone.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore Yoosuf began from this starting point, following his noble fathers, proud of their <em>‘aqeedah</em>, and deriding and exposing the foolishness of the idolaters and their practice of taking idols, cattle and stars as lords to be worshipped besides Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after clearly explaining this, and openly calling to <em>tawheed</em> and to rejection of <em>shirk</em>, he emphasised his call and his argument by his saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Authority and command is for Allaah alone.”</strong>[3], [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he explained this authority and command to mean the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah, and that He alone is to be worshipped:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“&#8230;That is the Straight and true reigion, yet most of the people do not know (and are people of <em>shirk)</em>.”</strong>[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also Yoosuf, <em>’alayhis-salaam, </em>attained the highest position in this state[6] whilst calling to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and establishing the clear proofs for his call and his Prophethood. Allaah, the Most High, says, in explanation of this,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The king of Egypt said, ‘Bring him to me, I will make him my personal servant.’ So when he spoke to Yoosuf, he said, ‘Verily, this day you have with us a position of rank and full trust.’ He said, ‘Place me in charge of the storehouses and wealth of the land, indeed I will guard them faithfully and with full knowledge.’”</strong>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said, giving thanks to his Lord and Protector,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O my Lord, You have bestowed upon me something of dominion and have taught me the interpretation of dreams. O Originator and Creator of the heavens and the earth, You are my Lord and Protector in this world and the Hereafter. Cause me to die as a Muslim and join me with the righteous.”</strong>[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore Allaah says in explanation of his <em>da’wah</em>, upon the tongue of the Believer from the family of the Pharaoh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And Yoosuf came to you previously (before Moosaa) with clear signs yet you have not ceased doubting about what he came to you with. Until when he died you said, ‘Allaah will not send any Messenger after him.’ This is the state of those whom Allaah leads astray, those who are disbelievers in Him and doubt the truthfulness of the Messengers.”</strong>[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from the knowledge to be learned from the life-story of Yoosuf, <em>’alayhis-salaam, </em>which is presented to us in those noble <em>Aayaat</em> is that the call to <em>tawheed</em> is something very essential. Furthermore there is to be no leniency or relaxation in fighting against <em>shirk</em>, it is not permissible to keep silent about it, whatever the circumstances of the caller to Allaah; rather it is not permissible for any Muslim to ever accept it or be relaxed about it. So this shows the high station of <em>‘aqeedah</em>, and its importance with Allaah, and with His Prophets and His Messenger. It also shows the very great difference and the distance between it and the details of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible for the Muslim, particularly the caller, to take up any position which violates his <em>‘aqeedah</em> or is contrary to it, or that he is a fortune-teller, those who are <em>Mushriks</em>, or that he is a custodian of their idols. If he does any of this then he is one of the misguided <em>Mushriks.</em> With regard to the legislative aspect, if the Islamic state is established, it must apply the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah, otherwise:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed then they are the ones guilty of unbelief.”</strong>[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The unbelief (<em>kufr</em>) here is explained in detail by the scholars of Islaam, from the Companions and others, that it may be major <em>Kufr</em>, when the person disdains the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah and declares it lawful to judge by something else, and it may be lesser <em>Kufr</em> (i.e., that which does not take a person out of Islaam) when he does not declare it lawful to judge by other than it, but gives in to his desires and because of that judges by other than what Allaah sent down.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However when the Islamic state has not been established, then Allaah does not a burden a soul with more than it is capable of. So the Muslim may take up a position in a non-Muslim state with the condition that he establishes justice, and that he does not obey them ina matter which involves disobedience to Allaah, and does not judge by other than what Allaah sent down. This was what the Prophet of Allaah, Yoosuf, did. He took up a position as a deputy for a unbelieving king, and he did not judge according to his laws:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“He could not have taken and kept his brother according to the king’s law.”</strong>[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, he established justice between the subjects and called them to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah. So this contains a decisive reply to those who give little importance to the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of <em>Tahweed</em>. Those who gloss over and accomodate when it comes to the <em>shirk</em> which has filled the world, and they regard the callers to <em>tawheed</em> and the enemies of <em>shirk</em> with contempt and scorn. They turn up their noses and are too proud to ‘lower’ themselves to the level of the callers to <em>tawheed</em>, and they are very wily and astute concerning political affairs, but nothing is more burdensome and disagreeable to their hearing and their hearts than listening to or saying a word regarding <em>tawheed</em> or <em>shirk.</em> These types of callers have caused themselves to fall into a deep abyss, whilst they think that they have reached the highest peaks. Can a people ever prosper whose stance with regard to the call of the Prophets is like this, unless they sincerely repent to Allaah from what they are upon?</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] As indicated in the <em>hadeeth</em> of Ibn ’Umar, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhumaa, </em>from the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) that he said, “<strong>The noble one, son of the noble one, son of the noble one: Yoosuf the son of Ya’qoob, the son of Ishaaq, the son of Ibraaheem, </strong><em><strong>’alayhis-salaam.</strong>” </em>Reported by al-Bukhaaree (Eng. trans. 4/390/596), and Ahmad in <em>al-Musnad</em> (2/96), and also the <em>hadeeth</em> of Aboo Hurairah, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhu, </em>that Allaah’s Messenger (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) was asked about the noblest of the people, so he said, <em>“Those most pious and obedient to Allaah.” They said, “It is not this that we are asking about.” He said, “Then the noblest of the people is Yoosuf, the Prophet of Allaah, son of the Prophet of Allaah, son of the Prophet of Allaah, son of the chosen and beloved Friend of Allaah.” They said, “It is not this that we are asking about.” He said, “Then is it about the origins of the Arabs that you ask? Then the people are of various origins. The best of them in the times of ignorance are the best of them in Islaam when they attain knowledge and understanding in the religion.”</em> Reported by al-Bukhaaree (Eng. trans. 4/390/597).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Soorah Yoosuf (12):40.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] This <em>Aayah</em> is one of the basic principles from the principles of <em>tawheed</em>, as Allaah has explained upon the tongue of Yoosuf, <em>’alayhis-salaam. </em>What is most unfortunate is that you see that many of the political reformers have explained it in a way that is far removed from its primary meaning, that all worship is to be made purely and sincerely for Allaah alone, and have instead explained it to have a political meaning, which is establishment of the state which they claim will establish Allaah’s <em>Sharee’ah</em> upon the earth as His deputies/vicegerents. Then they go beyond bounds in this direction till they cause the people to forget the principal meaning of the <em>Aayah</em>, and they understand nothing from it except this new meaning, and there is no action and no ability except by the will of Allaah. They do the same with all or most of the <em>Aayaat</em> of <em>tawheed</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Soorah Yoosuf (12):40.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah, <em>rahimahullaah, </em>said in <em>al-Hisbah</em> (p.7), “Likewise Yoosuf the truthful and honest, was a minister for the Pharaoh of Egypt, and he and his people were <em>mushriks</em>. So Yoosuf performed whatever justice and good he was able to and called them as far as possible to correct <em>eemaan</em>.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibraaheem</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Father of the Prophets and the Leader of those who worship Allaah alone, upon the true religion, Ibraaheem, the Chosen and Beloved Friend of Allaah (<em>Khaleelullaah</em>), who was such that Allaah ordered the best of the Messengers and the final Prophet, and his <em>ummah</em>, to emulate him, to take his call as an example, and to follow his way and methodolgy.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And remember when Ibraaheem said to his father Aazar, ‘Will you take idols for worship? Indeed I see that you and those who worship idols along with you are upon clear error.’ Likewise We showed Ibraaheem the heavens and the earth (and how they are a proof that the Creator alone should be worshipped), so that he should be one of those who have Faith with certainty. So when the night covered him with darkness he saw a star and said, (as an argument to show his people the error of worshipping anything besides Allaah), ‘This is (what you claim to be) my Lord?!’ Then when it set, he said, ‘I do not love that which passes away.’ Then when he saw the moon rising up he said, ‘This is (what you claim to be) my Lord?!’ Then when it set he said, ‘If my Lord did not keep me firm upon the guidance then I would surely be one of the misguided.’ Then when he saw the sun, he said, ‘This is (what you claim to be) my Lord?! This is greater than the others.’ Then when it set he said, ‘O my people, I am free from all that you associate as partners in worship with Allaah. Indeed I have turned my face in worship to Him who has created the heavens and the earth, making all worship purely for Him, and I am not from those who worship anything besides Allaah.’”</strong>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this was a fervent, vigorous and incessant call to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah, and to make all of religion purely for Him, and to the elimination and rejection of <em>shirk</em>. It begins with the family and extends to the nations, waging war upon <em>shirk</em> and the idols and shaking the very foundations of attribution of any worship to the stars. So the chosen and beloved Friend of Allaah proceeded upon the soundest way in debating and arguing in order to establish Allaah’s Proof and to refute <em>shirk</em> and to show its fallacy and reject the doubts used to support it. So his use of the word ‘idols’ shows contempt for their phoney and supposed gods, and an exposure of their foolishness. He observed the aforementioned celestial bodies one after the other, each one succeeded the previous one which set and became absent, in order to use their condition as a clear proof of the fallacy of their having any divinty or right to worship as his people claimed. Who was it who protected and guarded them and controlled their affairs and the affairs of the creation when they passed and set?! Therefore they must reject the false divinity and right to worship which they claimed for them and disbelieve in that. It was upon them to wash their hands of them and turn instead to their true God, He Who created and brought into existence the heavens and the earth. He Who does not pass away or depart. He Who knows all about their condition and is fully aware of all their movements and periods of rest. He Who protects and preserves them and controls their affairs. They were strong proofs extracted from the situation they experienced and the visible creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And recite to your people from the Book (the Qur’aan), O Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  , about Ibraaheem. He was one who was fully truthful and one sent as a Prophet by Allaah. When he said to his father, ‘Why do you worship that which cannot hear, nor see, nor benefit you, nor remove any harm from you at all?! O my father, Allaah has given me knowledge which has not come to you, so accept the sincere advice I give you, and I will show you the Straight Way, upon which you will not go astray. O my father, do not worship Satan (by obeying him in his call for you to worship the idols) &#8211; indeed Satan is one disobedient to the Most Merciful (Allaah). O my father, I fear for you, knowing that if you die upon attribution of partners to Allaah in worship, and upon worship of Satan, that Allaah’s punishment and torment will be upon you, and that you will merely be a companion of Satan in the Hell-fire.’ He replied, ‘Do you reject my gods, O Ibraaheem? If you do not cease abusing and reviling them I will certainly revile you. Go away from me if you wish to remain safe from me.’ Ibraaheem said, ‘But you are safe from me harming you, I will rather ask my Lord to guide you and forgive your sins. He has always been most Gracious and Kind to me. I shall keep away from you and all that you worship besides Allaah, and I will worship and invoke my Lord, making all of worship purely for Him. I hope that I shall not be one unblest in my worship and supplications.’ So when he separated himself from them and all that they worshipped besides Allaah, We gave him a family who were better than them, Ishaaq and Ya&#8217;qoob, and we made all of them Prophets, and we bestowed our mercy upon them all, and granted them renown and praise upon the tongues of the people.”</strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this was a fervent call to <em>tawheed</em>, established firmly upon knowledge, reason and intellect, and upon good and sound manners. Guiding the misguided to the Straight Path. It was opposed by blind bigotry and partisanship, based upon desires, ignorance, stubborness and obsinate pride: otherwise how could anyone worship and humble themselves to those who cannot hear, nor see, nor help them in any way?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the knowledge of <em>tawheed</em>, O reader, is that knowledge which all the Prophets were honoured with, and with it they assaulted falsehood, ignorance and shirk. So ignorance of this knowledge, the knowledge carried by the Prophets, which guides to the truth and saves from misguidance and shirk, ignorance of this is fatal and is a deadly poison which kills the intellect and the ability to think.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O my Father, Allaah has given me knowledge which has not come to you, accept the sincere advice which I give to you, and I will show you the Straight Way, upon which you will not go astray.”</strong>[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then after these robust efforts in <em>da’wah</em> expended by Ibraaheem in calling to Allaah, calling the family and the nation, establishing the irrefutable proofs upon his father and his people, after this he took this great call and confronted that haughty and tyrannical ruler who claimed divinity, he faced him with the full strength and bravery. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Do you not consider the one (Namrood) who, because Allaah had granted him an extended kingdom disputed with Ibraaheem about his Lord. Ibraaheem said to him, ‘It is my Lord (Allaah) Who gives life and death.’ He said, ‘I give life and cause death.’ Ibraaheem said, ‘Allaah causes the sun to rise from the east, so if you are truthful then cause it to rise from the west.’ So the unbeliever was confounded, and Allaah does not guide the unbelievers to find proof against the people of truth.”</strong>[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Ibraaheem called this tyrant and claimant to divinity to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah, and to <em>eemaan</em> in His Lordship. But he exceeded all bounds in his arrogance and haughtily refused to accept the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and to give up on his claims to Lordship. So Ibraaheem debated with him in this brilliant manner whose proof was clear. Ibraaheem said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“It is my Lord (Allaah) Who gives life and death.”</strong>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the stupid tyrant replied that he too could give life and death &#8211; meaning that he killed whom he pleased and spared whom he pleased. This answer of his was merely a pretence and a means of fooling the ignorant, and was a way of avoiding the question, since what Ibraaheem referred to was the fact that his Lord created mankind, animals and plants and gave them life, and brought them into existence from nothing. Then He causes them to die with His Power, and that He gives the humans and animals death at the end of their appointed life-spans, due to visible causes which He shows and without visible causes. So when Ibraaheem saw that he tried to create a pretence to evade the issue, which might fool some of the ignorant and common folk, he then said, as a means of showing the futility of what his saying entailed, that if you are as you claim, then,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“‘Allaah causes the sun to rise from the east, so if you are truthful then cause it to rise from the west.’ So the unbeliever was confounded.”</strong>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the unbeliever was left confounded and at a loss for words. His argument was overthrown, he was silenced, struck dumb and falsehood was rendered futile as is always the case. So this contains a lesson for those who listen attentively and witness it, that the call to <em>tawheed</em> represents the peak of sincerity, wisdom and intelligence; it proceeds in the due and correct manner, and as Allaah has willed, not merely struggling for kingship, nor seeking to fight for leadership.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the goal of Ibraaheem had been to attain rulership and authority he would have taken a different methodology to this, and he would have found people who gathered around him and supported him. But Allaah refuses, and His Prophets and the pious callers from the true followers of the Prophets in every time and place, they all refuse except to follow the way of guidance and truth, and to clearly proclaim the truth and to establish the proof against the proud and obstinate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Ibraaheem established this great obligation in the best and most complete manner. He established the proof upon his father and his people, upon those who governed them and upon all of his nation. Then when he saw that they were persisting in their <em>shirk</em> and their unbelief and were established upon falsehood and misguidance, he resorted to censure and correction by means of the hand and use of strength. So where did his change and correction begin, and what was the correct and rightly guided means for correction of the dire situation which had beset his nation? Did he seek to overthrow the state because it was the root of all the evils and corruption and the source of <em>shirk</em> and misguidance?! How can that be denied when the ruler claimed lordship for himself and persisted in that claim? So why did Ibraaheem not consider a revolution against this unbelieving government, and at the head of it a tyrant who claimed divinity, and by so doing wipe out all the forms of corruption and <em>shirk</em>, and establish in its place the divinely-guided state headed by Ibraaheem, ’<em>alayhis-salaatu was-salaam</em>?! The answer is the Prophets were far removed from following any such way or even considering it, since this is the way of the oppressors, the ignorant and the foolish, those who seek after this world and strive for authority in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather the Prophets were callers to <em>tawheed</em> and pioneers guiding to the truth, and seeking to save the people from falsehood and <em>shirk</em>. So when they applied themselves to correction and changing the state of affairs, and they were the most knowledgeable and intelligent of the people, then they necessarily began with striking at the true sources of <em>shirk</em> and misguidance. This is what Ibraaheem, the mild, wise and rightly guided, the heroic and brave, did. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We guided Ibraaheem to the truth at a young age before the time of Moosaa and Haaroon, and We knew that he was fitting for that and was a person of true and certain <em>eemaan</em> who would worship Allaah alone and not associate any partner with Him. When he said to his father and his people, ‘What are these idols which you worship and are devoted to?!’ They said, ‘We found our fathers worshipping them and have followed them in that.’ He said, ‘Both you and they in worshipping the idols are in clear error.’ They said, ‘Are you serious in your saying that you have come with the truth, or are you merely being frivolous?’ He said, ‘Rather, I bring you the truth. Your Lord, other than Whom none has the right to be worshipped, is the sole Lord and Creator of the heavens and the earth, He Who created you all, not any of the idols to which you are devoted. I am a witness to the fact that none but Him is deserving of your worship.’ Ibraaheem said in secret (but was overheard by a single man from his people), ‘By Allaah, I intend to destroy their idols when they go off to their festival.’ So he broke them to pieces except for the largest of them (upon which he tied the axe with which he had broken the others), so that they might take heed and abandon worship of their idols after witnessing their weakness and futility. The people said, ‘Who has done this to our gods?! Whoever has done it is certainly a criminal.’ Those who had heard the saying of Ibraaheem said, ‘We heard a youth speaking, he is called Ibraaheem.’ They said, ‘Bring him before the eyes of the people, that they may testify against him.’ They said, ‘Is it you who did this to our gods, O Ibraaheem?’ He said, ‘Rather this one, the largest of them did it. Ask the idols who had it done to them, if it is that they can speak.’ So they turned to themsleves and said, ‘You know that they are unable to speak.’ He said, ‘Then will you worship besides Allaah that which cannot benefit you at all, nor harm you. Woe to you and the idols which you worship besides Allaah. Have you no sense to see the futility of your worship of the idols?’ They said, ‘Burn him and aid your gods, if you do indeed wish to aid them and continue to worship them.’ We said, ‘O fire, be cool and safe for Ibraaheem.’ They wished to cause harm to him, but it was they whom We caused to be the losers.”</strong>[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah guided Ibraaheem to the truth knowing that he was fitting for that. This wise and rightly-guided Prophet faced corruptions in beliefs (<em>’aqeedah</em>) and corruption in rule and authority. A nation whose thinking was degenerate, people whose minds were astray, so that they worshipped idols in the form of pieces of wood, rocks and stars. They were also ruled by a corrupt and evil government lead by a tyrant who claimed divinity, yet the people submitted to his leadership. So where was Ibraaheem to begin his correction? Should he have begun by attacking the ruler, since for certain he had ruled by other than the revelaed Law of Allaah and ruled by the laws of ignorance. There is no doubt about that. He also openly claimed Lordship and the right to make and lay down the law. Or should he have begun with correction of beliefs (<em>‘aqeedah</em>). Correcting the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of the nation and the <em>‘aqeedah </em>of the government of ignorance?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur’aan informs us that this rightly-guided Prophet, the <em>Imaam</em> of the Prophets, began with correction of <em>‘aqeedah</em>, that is the call to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah, and to make all worship purely and sincerely for Him alone, and fighting and wiping out <em>shirk</em>, and demolishing its causes, and tearing it out from the roots. So that is what he did: he called them to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah, and to renounce the worship of everything besides Him. He argued with them about this matter and they argued with him. But he refuted them with powerful arguments and clear proofs, and he stripped them of everything they sought to use as a proof until they admitted their wrongdoing, misguidance, and their blind-following and stubborn and fatal acceptance of the ways of their forefathers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“They said, ‘We found our fathers worshipping them and have followed them in that.’”</strong>[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when Ibraaheem saw obstinate following of desires and intellects as hard as rock, he made a wise and brave plan to destroy their idols. He carried out this plan with full vigour, bravery and courage. Then this heroic act[10] incited the government and the nation against him, and they called him for judgement in public and laid down the charge before him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Is it you who did this to our gods, O Ibraaheem?”</strong>[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he responded to them in a mocking and sarcastic manner,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Rather this one, the largest of them did it. Ask the idols who had it done to them, if it is that they can speak.”</strong>[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this mocking reply was like a thunder-bolt striking their imbecilic minds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Then they relapsed and said, ‘You know that they are unable to speak.’”</strong>[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when he had divested them of the weapon of argument, they resorted to using force, the weapon used by everyone lacking proof in every time and place,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“They said, ‘Burn him and aid your gods, if you do indeed wish to aid them and continue to worship them.’”</strong>[14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But Allaah saved His chosen and beloved friend, Ibraaheem, and He threw back the plot of the unbelievers upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We said, ‘O fire, be cool and safe for Ibraaheem.’ They wished to cause harm to him, but it was they whom we caused to be the losers.”</strong>[15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the fact that Ibraaheem was saved from harm in that huge fire, which Allaah caused to become cool and safe for Ibraaheem, was a very great sign, indeed one of the greatest of Allaah’s signs proving his Prophet hood, his truthfulness, and the correctness of what he came with, i.e., <em>tawheed</em> and the declaration of the fultility of the <em>shirk</em> and misguidance which his people were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah rewarded Ibraaheem, <em>’alayhis-salaam, </em>for this wise <em>da’wah</em>, and this outstanding <em>jihaad</em> and sacrifice,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We saved Ibraaheem and Loot from their enemies and took them to the land which We have blessed for all the worlds. And We bestowed upon him Ishaaq (his son) and Ya&#8217;qoob (his grandson) as an extra favour upon him. And We made all of them those who acted in obedience to Allaah and avoided what He forbade. And We made them leaders to be followed, guiding the people according to Our orders and calling them to worship and obey Allaah. And We inspired in them the doing of those deeds which are good, and establishment of the Prayer, and payment of the <em>Zakaat</em>. And they were worshippers of Us alone.”</strong>[16]</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] As indicated by the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Then We revealed to you, O Muhammad (*), that you should follow the religion of Ibraaheem who was a Muslim upon the true religion and was not one of those who worshipped idols and associated partners with Allaah.”</strong> [Soorah an-Nahl (16):123].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Say, O Muhammad (*): Allaah has indeed spoken the Truth, so follow the religion of Ibraaheem who was upright, upon the religion of Islaam, and he did not make any share of his worship for any created being.”</strong> [Soorah Aal-’Imraan (3):95].</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] Soorah al-Ambiyaa (21):53.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] The great heroic action and the wise call to <em>tawheed</em> and to the elimination of <em>shirk</em>, is counted by many of the callers to correction these days as being an example of preoccupying onesself with minor and insignificant matters. And there is no action nor power except by the will of Allaah. Indeed it is not the eyes that are blind, but rather the hearts. They think that <em>da’wah</em> must begin with a call to the correction and rectification of rulership and government, not correction of <em>’aqeedah</em>. In this view Ibraaheem and all the other Prophets were in error with regard to the correct methodology of <em>da’wah</em>. (al-Fawzaan).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Nooh (عليه السلام)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nooh was the second father of all mankind, and the first of the Messengers (<em>Rusul</em>) to the people of the Earth. This great Prophet lived a very long life: he called his people for nine hundred and fifty years to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and to making all worship purely for Him. He did not become weary of this, nor lose interest. He called them night and day, in private and in the open. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Indeed We sent Nooh as a Messenger to his people ordering him to warn his people before a painful punishment should come to them. He said, ‘O my People, I am a plain and clear warner to you, that you should worship Allaah alone, avoid disobedience to Him and obey me. If you do so He will forgive you your sins and grant you respite until an appointed term. Indeed when the term decreed by Allaah comes it cannot be delayed, and if you knew you would submit to and obey your Lord.’ Nooh said, ‘O my Lord, I have called my people day and night to worship You alone and warned them of Your punishment but my calling them to the truth only results in them turning away from it.</strong>[1]<strong> Whenever I call them to worship You alone and to obey You, and to disassociate themselves from the worship of everything but You, so that You may forgive them, they thrust their fingers in their ears and cover themselves up with their garments, so as not to hear. Then they persist in their disbelief and arrogantly and obstinately refuse to follow and submit to the truth. Then I called them loudly and openly, and I called them individually and privately. I said to them, ‘Ask your Lord to forgive your sins and repent to your Lord from your unbelief and association of others in worship with Him, and make your worship sincerely and purely for Him, then He will forgive you, indeed He greatly forgives those who turn to Him in repentance and seek His forgiveness. He will then send you rain in abundance, and grant you increase in wealth and children, and provide you with gardens and rivers. What is wrong with you that you do not have awe and fear of Allaah, when it is He that created you in successive stages? Do you not see how Allaah has created the seven heavens one above the other, and has placed the moon therein as a light and has made the sun a lamp? Allaah it is who created you and brought you from the earth, and He it is who will return you to it, and then resurrect you from it. Allaah &#8211; it is Who spread out the earth for you, so that you may travel about upon wide roads.’’ Nooh said, ‘O my Lord, they have rejected my call and opposed it, and have instead followed the call of those whose wealth and children only increase them in error and take them further away from their Lord. Furthermore the leaders have plotted a mighty plot, and they have said, “Do not abandon your gods. Do not abandon <em>Wadd</em>, nor <em>Suwaa</em>, nor <em>Yaghooth</em>, nor <em>Ya&#8217;ooq</em>, nor <em>Nasr</em>.” Indeed many have gone astray due to the idols. O Allaah, grant no increase to the transgressors except in error.</strong>[2]<strong> Due to their sins they were drowned in the Flood and entered into the Fire, and they could find no one to save them from Allaah’s punishment.”</strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what did the <em>da’wah</em> of this noble Messenger comprise of, and Allaah has told us the summary of his noble <em>da’wah</em> which continued for nine hundred and fifty years?! Indeed it was an earnest and painstaking call to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and to make all worship purely for Him. It was a tireless effort and he used every possible means available to him to convince them of his call. He called them privately and individually, and he called them openly. He encouraged them and warned them, informing them of the promise of good for the obedient, and evil for the disobedient. He gave them practical and intellectual proofs, from themselves and their lives, and what they saw before them with regards to the heavens and the earth, and the clear signs and lessons contained in them. All of this failed to benefit them and did not cause them to accept. Rather they persisted in their disbelief and error, and they rejected all this obstinately and arrogantly. They persisted in their adherence to the idols and false and futile objects of worship. So the result of this persistence and obstinancy was destruction and annihilation in this world, and everlasting torment in the Hell-fire in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At this point we may ask: why did this great Prophet continue for such an extremely long period of time, expending huge efforts, untiringly and without languidness, calling to the starting point of <em>tawheed</em>?! Why did Allaah praise him so highly, and cause him to be remembered, and make him one of those Messengers who were the firmest of all in their determination (<em>oolul-&#8216;adhm</em>)? Does the call to <em>tawheed</em> deserve all this esteem? Is this methodology an establishment of this procedure for this noble Prophet in opposition to logic, wisdom and intellect? Or is it pure and certain wisdom, and what is demanded by correct logic and sound and perceptive intellect? Why did Allaah approve of following this methodology in <em>da’wah</em> for 950 years, and commend him, and cause his name and his story to endure, and impose it as a duty upon the greatest of the Messengers and the one having the greatest intellect of all the people, that he should take him as an example to follow in his <em>da’wah</em> and his perseverance?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The just answer, established upon intellect and wisdom, and upon understanding the status and position of Prophet hood, and having the greatest trust in it and giving it its due respect, is that the call to <em>tawheed</em> and striving to wipe out <em>shirk</em> and to purify the earth from it, does indeed deserve all of this. It is indeed wisdom itself and is demanded by natural inclination and intellect. It is furthermore, a binding obligation upon every caller to Allaah that they understand this methodology, this great and divinely inspired <em>da’wah</em> and great goal, and that they devote all their effort and energy to its attainment and its being propagated throughout all of Allaah’s earth. Furthermore that they work together, cooperate and unite, and sincerely attest to each others’ truthfulness. Just as the Messengers, the callers to <em>tawheed</em>, were: the earlier ones telling of the coming of the later ones and the later ones attesting to the truthfulness of the previous ones and promoting their call, and following the same way. It is also binding upon us to believe that if there was any other methodology better and more correct than this methodology, that Allaah would have chosen that for His Messengers and would have favoured them with it. So is it fitting for any Believer to turn away from it and choose a different methodology for himself, and to arrogantly seek to attack this divinely laid down methodology and its callers?!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[1] At-Tabaree reports from Qataadah, “It has reached us that a man would take his son to Nooh and say to his son, ‘Beware of this man, don&#8217;t let him lead you astray, for I remember when I was your age, my father brought me to him and warned me against him just as I am warning you.’”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[2] This supplication of Nooh against them came after he was informed by Allaah that they were not going to be Believers, as explained by al-Baghawee.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THE BIOGRAPHY OF AL-HAAFIZ IBN KATHEER</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is: the Imaam, the Haafiz, the Shaikh of the Muhadditheen, the Historian, the Explainer of the Qur·aan, `Imaaduddeen Abul-Fidaa· Ismaa`eel ibn `Umar ibn Katheer ibn Daw· ibn Katheer ibn Zar`, al-Qurashee; al-Busrawee, then ad-Dimashqee, the jurist, ash-Shaafi`ee. [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was born in Mijdal, a village to the east of Busraa-which is a town in the province of Damascus, in the year 701 H, where his father was a Khateeb.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the death of his father he moved, along with his brother Kamaaluddeen `AbdulWahhaab, to Damascus, in the year 707 H. He memorized the whole of the Qur·aan at the age of ten, and he read the different recitations,<br />
and he excelled in tafseer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He married Zaynab the daughter of al-Haafiz Abul-Hajjaaj al-Mizzee, and he closely accompanied him and learned from him. He gave great attention to the science of hadeeth, and qualified under him in it. He also accompanied Shaikhul-Islaam Taqiyyuddeen Ibn Taimiyyah and was a special student of his and defended him, and he followed him upon many of his opinions. He used to deliver verdicts in accordance with his view concerning the question of the three simultaneous divorces, that they count as a single divorce, and he was put to trial on account of this and suffered harm.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He gave attention to memorising the texts; and to awareness of the chains of narration, the hidden defects in narrations, the narrators, and to history, to the extent that he excelled in all of that whilst he was still a youth. He delivered verdicts, taught and debated. He excelled in Fiqh, Tafseer, and Arabic Grammar. He closely studied the narrators and the hidden defects in narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He became the Shaikh of the Saalihiyyah School, after the death of adh-Dhahabee; and the Shaikh of Daarul-Hadeeth al-Ashrafiyyah for a short while after the death of as-Subkee. Then this was taken from him after it was seized by Kamaaluddeen al-Ma`arree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">HIS SCHOLARLY STATUS:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer had prominent status as is clear from the institutions of knowledge he headed; and the mosques in which he taught; and the works of Tafseer, History, and Hadeeth that he authored.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the schools that he took charge of, then they were: The Ashrafiyyah School of Hadeeth, the school of as-Saalihiyyah, the school of an-Najeebiyyah, the school of at-Tankaziyyah, and the school of an-Nooriyyah al-Kubraa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These were schools sought after by the students of knowledge from the east and the west, and their Shaikhs and teachers had high status. None were allowed to teach in them except those who were firmly grounded in knowledge and whose position amongst the scholars was established. Therefore, the scholars respected him and the hearts of the students of knowledge were attentive to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the mosques in which he delivered his lessons, then the most famous of them were &#8220;alJaami` al-Amawee&#8221;, the mosque of Ibn Hishaam, the Jaami` of Tankaz, the Jaami` of alFooqaanee-and he used to deliver the Khutbah in it also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This being in addition to his writings which have filled the earth with knowledge, and from which people have benefitted in his lifetime and after his death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE SCHOLARS PRAISE OF HIM:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">adh-Dhahabee said: “The jurist, the muftee, the muhaddith&#8230; he gave special attention to the narrators, to the texts, and to acquiring knowledge of Fiqh. He elucidated, wrote works, debated, authored, explained (the Qur·aan), and attained precedence&#8230;” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said: “The imaam, the jurist, the muhaddith, the singular and outstanding scholar&#8230; He was a jurist knowledgeable in various fields, a precise muhaddith, a critical and verifying explainer (of the Qur·aan). He produced beneficial works. He was well aware of Fiqh, and had good understanding of Arabic and the Fundamentals (of Fiqh). He memorized a good portion of the texts, of tafseer, and the narrators. He heard (narrations) from me, and had good memorisation.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hajjee said: “I never came to him except that I benefitted from him, and I was his constant companion for six years.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Habeeb said, as quoted from him by Imaam Ibn Hajr:[4] “He was an imaam, frequent upon tasbeeh [5] and tahleel [6], and he was at the head of the scholars of explanation (of the Qur·aan). He heard, gathered, and authored. People strove to listen to his sayings. He spoke in a manner that delighted, he narrated, and he brought benefit. The pages of his verdicts were sent to the lands, and he became famous for precision and verification. He attained leadership in knowledge in History, Hadeeth, and Tafseer.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul-Mahaasin ad-Dimashqee said: “He delivered verdicts and taught. He debated and excelled in Fiqh, Tafseer, and Grammar. He carefully studied the narrators and the hidden defects of narrations.” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Haafiz Ibn Hajr said: “He could bring a great deal to mind, and he joked in a fine manner. His works spread throughout the lands within his life-time, and the people derived benefit through him after his death.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-`Aynee said, as quoted from him by Ibn Taghreebardee: “He was the example amongst the scholars and the great memorizers, and the reference point for the people of meanings and wordings. He heard, gathered, compiled, taught, narrated, and wrote works. He had an abundance of knowledge and awareness of Hadeeth, Tafseer, and History. He became famous for precision and verification. He attained the limit in knowledge of History, Hadeeth, and Tafseer; and he wrote many beneficial works.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>HIS `AQEEDAH (CREED AND BELIEF):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He -rahimahullaahu ta`aalaa- was upon the `Aqeedah of the Salafus-Saalih (the Pious Predecessors). This is proven by his tremendous Tafseer, which is the most excellent tafseer that has made the `Aqeedah of the Salaf manifest. An example of that is his saying, in his explanation of His Saying -He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: Then He ascended over the Throne]]:<br />
[Sooratul-A`raaf (7): 54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Regarding this we follow the position of the Salafus-Saalih: Maalik, al-Awzaa`ee, athThawree, al-Layth ibn Sa`d, ash-Shaafi`ee, Ahmad, Ishaaq ibn Raahawaih, and others from the imaams of the Muslims, in the earlier and the later times: (and it is to let them pass)10 without saying how (takyeef),without declaring resemblance to the creation (tashbeeh), and without negating the attributes (ta`teel). Furthermore, what is immediately apparent to the minds of those who hold that the Creator resembles the creation is something negated for Allaah-the Most High, since nothing from the creation resembles Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing]].” [Sooratush-Shooraa (42): 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>HIS MOST PROMINENT TEACHERS:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer studied under many famous major Shaikhs, and the most important of them are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) Shaikhul-Islaam Taqiyyuddeen Ahmad ibn `Abdil-`Azeem ibn `Abdil-Haleem ibn `AbdisSalaam ibn Taimiyyah, who died in 728 H. al-`Iraaqee said within his biography of Ibn Katheer: “He was an especially close student of Shaikh Taqiyyuddeen Ibn Taimiyyah, and he defended him, and he followed him upon many of his views.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="Marker" style="color:#999999;">Author: Compiled from Several Sources<br />
Translator: Abu Talha Dawood Burbank rahimahullaah</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext"><b>His Name, Kunyah and Lineage: </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext">He is the Imaam, the Example, the Mujaahid, the Shaikh of the Hanbalee scholars and greatest of them in his time: Abu Muhammad Al-Hasan Ibn &#8216;Alee Ibn Khalf Al-Barbahaaree &#8211; an ascription to Barbahaar, which were medicines imported from India.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Birthplace and Early Life: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The references available do not mention anything about his birth or early life but it appears that he was born and brought up in Baghdad. This is apparent from his fame amongst its general public, not to mention its scholars. Furthermore, Al-Barabahaaree sat with a group of the companions of the Imaam of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah, Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, <i>rahimahullaah</i>. He studied under them and most of them came from Baghdad as will be explained. This shows that he grew up in an environment of knowledge and adherence to the Sunnah. This clearly had a great influence on his personality.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Barbahaaree was pre-eminent in seeking after knowledge and expanded great efforts to attain it. He acquired knowledge from a group of the senior students of Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, except that unfortunately, the references available to us only state two of them by name and they are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Ibn-ul-Hajjaaj Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-&#8216;Azeez Abu Bakr Al-Marwazee: The exemplary Imaam, scholar and Muhaddith, a student of Imaam Ahmad. He died on the sixth of Jumaadal-Oolaa in the year 275H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Sahl Ibn &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Yoonus At-Tustaree, Abu Muhammad: The Imaam, worshipper and one known for abstemiousness from this world. Many wise sayings are reported from him and many remarkable happenings. He died in the month of Muharram in the year 283H, at the age of about eighty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Knowledge and the Scholars&#8217; Praise for Him: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Al-Barbahaaree, <i>rahimahullaah</i>, was a formidable and imposing Imaam who spoke out with the truth and called to the Sunnah and to the following of narrations. He also had renown and the respect of the ruler. In his gatherings, various circles for the study of Hadeeth, the narrations and Fiqh were held. These were attended by many of the scholars of Hadeeth and Fiqh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholar, Abu &#8216;Abdillaah said: &#8220;If you see a person of Baghdad loving Abul-Hasan Ibn Bashshaar and Abu Muhammad Al-Barbahaaree, then know that he is a person of the Sunnah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His high status is shown by what his student, Ibn Battah, <i>rahimahullaah</i>, said: &#8220;I heard him &#8211; meaning Al-Barbahaaree &#8211; saying when the people were prevented from Hajj: <b>‘O People! If anyone needs assistance to the level of a hundred thousand Deenaars and a hundred thousand Deenaars and a hundred thousand Deenaars &#8211; five times &#8211; then I will assist him.’</b>&#8221; Ibn Battah said: &#8220;If he wanted it the people would have given it to him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards the scholars&#8217; praise for him, then a great deal has been reported:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abee Ya&#8217;laa said: &#8220;Shaikh of the Community in his time and the foremost of them in censuring the people of innovation and in opposing them with his hand and tongue. And he had renown with the rulers and prominence amongst those of knowledge. And he was one of the wise scholars, great and precise memorizers of the texts and one of the reliable believers&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Adh-Dhahabee said in <i>Al-&#8216;Ibar</i>: &#8220;&#8230;the exemplary scholar, Shaikh of the Hanbalees in &#8216;Iraaq in speech, action and sticking to what is lawful. He had great renown and total respect.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Al-Jawzee said: &#8220;&#8230;He gathered knowledge and had abstention from this world (zuhd) and was strong against the people of innovation.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer said: &#8220;The abstemious, man of knowledge, the Hanbalee scholar, the admonisher &#8211; and he was strict against the people of innovation and sin. He had great standing and was respected by the elite and by the common people.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Piety and Abstemiousness: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Al-Barbahaaree was known for both of these qualities. This can be seen by what Abul-Hasan Ibn Bashshaar mentioned: &#8220;Al-Barbahaaree shunned seventy-thousand Deenaars, which he inherited from his father.&#8221; Ibn Abee Ya&#8217;laa said: &#8220;Al-Barbahaaree strove greatly and stood firm for the Religion many times.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Position with Regard to the People of Innovation: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Al-Barbahaaree, <i>rahimahullaah</i>, was very stern against the people of innovations and deviant sects, opposing them with his tongue and his hand, all the while following the way of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah with regards to the treatment of the people of innovation and deviation. His desire was that this Religion remain pure and be kept free from all that the people of innovation and deviance sought to attach to it, whether the beliefs of the Jahmiyyah, the Mu&#8217;tazilah, the &#8216;Ash&#8217;arees, the Soofees or the Shee&#8217;ah and Raafidees.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He makes clear the methods employed by the people of deviant sects to give sanction to their innovations, and he warns us against falling into their ways and methods. He lays out for us the broad and clear outlines describing the people of deviant sects and innovations. It is as if you are looking straight at them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summery, his position with regard to the people of deviant sects and innovations was clearly one of opposition and sternness due to his concern and love for the Sunnah and due to the efforts of every deviant innovator to attack it. His position is rightfully seen as a fine example of the positions of the Imaams of Ahl-us-Sunnah with regard to the people of innovation, deviation and misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Students: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A large number of students learned from this Imaam and benefited from him, since he was an example in both word and deed. And from these students are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The exemplary Imaam and Scholar, Abu &#8216;Abdillaah Ibn &#8216;Ubaydullaah Ibn Muhammad Al-&#8216;Ukbaree, well known as Ibn Battah, who died in Muharram of the year 387H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The exemplary Imaam, well known for his wise sayings, Muhammad Ibn Ahmad Ibn Isma&#8217;eel Al-Baghdaadee, Abul-Husayn Ibn Sam&#8217;oon, the admonisher, famous for his deeds and condition. He died in the middle of Dhul-Qa&#8217;adah in the year 387H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Ahmad Ibn Kaamil Ibn Khalf Ibn Shajarah, Abu Bakr, the narrator of this book from its author</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Muhammad Ibn Muhammad Ibn &#8216;Uthmaan, Abu Bakr, about whom Al-Khateeb Al-Baghdaadee (rahimahullaah) said: &#8220;It reached me that he used to lead the life of an ascetic and was upon good except that he reported some things that were weak and without basis.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>A Glimpse of His Words and Poetry: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu &#8216;Abdillaah Ibn Battah (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: &#8220;I heard Abu Muhammad Al-Barbahaaree say: &#8216;Sitting in order to advise sincerely is to open the door of benefit and sitting in order to debate is to close the doors of benefit.'&#8221; And he said: &#8220;The people are in constant delusion.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From his poetry is:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Whoever satisfies himself with what suffices him –</em><br />
<em> Begins rich and continues in following the correct way:</em><br />
<em> How fine an attribute Allaah has made being satisfied with what suffices –</em><br />
<em> How many a humble person it has raised high</em><br />
<em> The soul of the youth feels constricted if it is poor</em><br />
<em> But if he is patiently dependent upon his Lord he would indeed be given ease and sufficiency.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Trial and Death: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Al-Barbahaaree, <i>rahimahullaah</i>, had renown and a position of great respect with the common people and the elite and also had status in the eyes of the ruler. However, his enemies from the people of the deviant sects and innovations did not cease in their efforts to incite the ruler against him and to cause anger in his heart against him. This was to the point that in the year 321H, the Khaleefah, Al-Qaahir ordered his minister Ibn Muqlah to arrest Al-Barbahaaree and his students. Al-Barbahaaree hid, however a group of his major students were captured and taken to Basrah. Allaah, the most High, punished Ibn Muqlah for this action by causing Al-Qaahir Billaah to become angry with him, so Ibn Muqlah fled and was removed from his post and his house was burned. Then Al-Qaahir Billaah was himself imprisoned on the sixth of Jumaadal-Aakhirah, 322H. He was stripped of his position and blinded in both eyes. Then Allaah, the Most High, granted that Al-Barbahaaree return to his place of honor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Abu &#8216;Abdillaah Ibn &#8216;Arafah, well known as Niftawaih died, his funeral was attended by many prominent people and scholars and the congregation was lead by Al-Barbahaaree and that occurred in Safar of the year 323H. It was in this year also that Al-Barbahaaree&#8217;s standing grew and his words carried greater weight and his students became apparent and spread out amongst the people, censuring the innovators. It reached the point that once when Al-Barbahaaree was on the western side of the city and sneezed, his students replied to him and (were so many that) the Khaleefah heard the noise they made in his apartment, so he asked about what had happened. So when he was informed he became afraid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The innovators still did not cease trying to cause the heart of the Khaleefah Ar-Raadee to turn against Al-Barbahaaree. This was to the point that Ar-Raadee gave the order to Badr Al-Harasee, his chief of police, that he should ride out in public in Baghdad with the proclamation that no two students of Al-Barbahaaree were allowed to meet together. Again he hid himself having previously settled in the west of the city, he now secretly moved to the east. He died in this state in the year 329H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abee Ya&#8217;laa said: Muhammad Ibn Al-Hasan Al-Muqri narrated to me, saying: My grandfather and also my grandmother related to me that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Abu Muhammad Al-Barbahaaree was hidden by the sister of Toozoon in the eastern side of the town in the alleyway of the public bathhouse&#8230;he was there for about a month then his blood ceased flowing. When Al-Barbahaaree died, still in hiding, the sister of Toozoon said to her servant: &#8216;Find someone to wash him.&#8217; So someone came to wash him and the door was kept locked so that no one would know. He alone stood to pray for him, but when the woman who owned the house looked, she found that it was full of men wearing white and green clothing. After he had ended the Funeral Prayer, she did not see anyone at all, so she called to her servant and said: &#8216;You have destroyed me along with my brother!&#8217; So he said: &#8216;Did you not see what I saw?&#8217; &#8216;Yes&#8217;, she replied. He said: &#8216;Here are the keys to the door and it is still locked.&#8217; So she said: &#8216;Bury him in my house and when I die bury me near him&#8230;'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah have mercy on Imaam Al-Barbahaaree and grant him a great reward. He was an Imaam in truth, an example, knowing Allaah, and a follower of the Sunnah, and an unsheathed sword against the people of innovation and deviation.</p>

<p><span style="color:#999999;">Source: Intro to the Book &#8220;The Creed of Imam Bukhaaree&#8221;</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;">Translated by: Dawud Burbank rahimahullaah</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was Abul-Qaasim Hibatullaah, Ibn al-Hasan bin Mansoor ar-Raazee, at-Tabaree, al-Laalikaa’ee. The author of the encyclopedia of the ‘aqeedah of the Salaf called <i>Sharh Usool I’tiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He lived in a time of great confusion and political strife and division. A time when innovations were widespread and were propagated by their profounder and followers, including the Mu‘tazilah, the Qadariyyah, the Khawaarij, the Murjiah, the Rawaafid and others besides them. Around his time many of the scholars of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah stood to author books in defense of the ‘aqeedah of the Companions, the Taabe’een and the Salaf after them and to warn against the widespread innovations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the book of al-Laalikaa’ee is the most comprehensive of all those books and its reader can delight in the abundance of knowledge and guidance contained therein. He reports from more than 180 people and this indicates the large number of Shaykhs he learnt from.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Amongst his students was the famous al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadee who said about him in his <i>Taareekh Baghdaad</i> (14/70): “We wrote from him and he used to understand and memorize (well).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer said about him in <i>al-Bidaayah</i> (12/24): “He used to understand and memorize and he (was always) concerned and anxious about hadeeth.” He was known for his precision and his perspicacity in hadeeth. One of his students saw Abul-Qaasim al-Laalikaa’ee after his death in a good dream.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadee mentions this and those after him narrate it from him, ‘Alee bin al-Hasan bin Jadaa al-’Akbaree said: ‘I saw Abul-Qaasim at-Tabaree in a dream and I said to him. What has Allaah done with you?’ He said: ‘He has forgiven me.’ I said: ‘For what reason?’ And it was as if he said in a word in a lowered, subdued voice: ‘The Sunnah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He died in the year 418H whilst he was middle-aged, before he became famous for his knowledge and his works, may Allaah have mercy upon him. Refer to the introduction to <i>Sharh Usoolil-Itiqaad</i> (1/65-101) by Ahmad Sa’d Hamdaan for more details.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE CHAPTER OF IMPURITIES (AN-NAJAASAAT):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><strong>Najaasaat</strong> </em>(impurities) is the plural of <em><strong>najaasah</strong></em> (impurity), and it is everything which the people of sound nature hold to be dirty, and which they guard themselves from, and which they wash their clothes from if it fall upon them, such as urine and excrement.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the basic principle for all things is permissibility (<em>ibaa<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>ah</em>) and that they are pure (at-Tahaarah). So whoever claims that a particular thing is impure must bring evidence. So if he produces it then that is the case; but if he is unable to do so, or he comes with something that does not establish proof, then what is obligatory upon us is to remain upon what is necessitated by the basic principle and the basic natural state.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because passing a judgement that something is impure is a ruling which will bring about general duty and responsibility, so it is not permissible except after proof has been established. [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So from that which has been proven to be impure are:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1 &amp; 2: Human urine and excrement:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for excrement (<em>al-ghaa.it</em>), then because of the hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>If one of you steps with his shoe upon something harmful (<em>al-Adhaa</em>), then the earth will be purification for it</strong>.&gt;&gt; [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And ‘al-Adhaa’ is everything which harms/offends, from impurities, filth, rocks, thorns, and other then that. [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what is meant by it in the hadeeth is impurity (<em>najaasah</em>), as is clear. As for urine, then because of the hadeeth of Anas: that a bedouin man urinated in the mosque, so some people stood up to restrain him. So Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said: &lt;&lt;<strong>Leave him, and do not interrupt him</strong>.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: “When he finished he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) called for a bucket of water, and poured it upon it.” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>3 &amp; 4 Pre-seminal fluid (al-madhee) and ‘al-wadee’:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for pre-seminal fluid, then it is clear, thin, slippery fluid which discharges when there is (sexual) desire. Its discharge does not itself give a feeling of delight, nor does it shoot out all at once, nor is it followed by slackness. The person may not notice its discharge, and this happens to men and women. [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is impure (<em>najas</em>), and therefore the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) ordered that the penis be washed from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Alee who said: “ I was a man who had profuse pre-seminal discharge, and I felt shy to ask the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) because of my position with respect to his daughter. So I told al-Miqdaad ibn al-Aswad, and he asked him. So he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>He should wash his penis and perform wudoo</strong>..&gt;&gt; ” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for ‘<em>al-wadee</em>’, then it is a thick white fluid which may come out after urination, [9] and it is impure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn `Abbaas who said: “Semen, and ‘<em>al-wadee</em>’, and pre-seminal fluid (<em>al madhee</em>). As for semen, then it is what necessitates a bath (<em>ghusl</em>); and as for ‘alwadee’and ‘al-madhee’, then he said: “Wash your penis, or: the parts of your penis, and perform wudoo. in the manner in which you perform wudoo· for the Prayer.” [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>5. The dung of animals whose meat may not be eaten:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Abdullaah who said: the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) wanted to go out to the toilet, so he said: &lt;&lt;<strong>Bring me three stones</strong>.&gt;&gt; So I found two stones for him and a piece of dung from a donkey. So he took hold of the two stones, and he threw the piece of dung away, and he said: &lt;&lt;<strong>It is something impure</strong>.&gt;&gt; [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>6. Menstrual blood:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Asmaa· bint Abee Bakr who said: “A woman came to the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and said: ‘If menstrual blood falls on the garment of one of us, what should she do?’ So he said: &lt;&lt;<strong>She should scrape it off, then she should rub it with water, then she should wash it (all). Then she can pray whilst wearing it</strong>.&gt;&gt; [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>7. The saliva of a dog:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Hurayrah who said, Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>The purification for the vessel of one of you if a dog licks from it is that he washes it seven times, the first of them being with earth</strong>.&gt;&gt; [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>8. Animal carcasses:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Referring to animals which die without having been slaughtered in the legislated manner, because of his (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>When an animal skin is tanned then it has become pure</strong>.&gt;&gt; [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And an ‘animal skin’ (<em>ihaab</em>) is the hide of an animal which has died.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And exceptions to that [15] are:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(i) Dead fish and locusts</span></strong>, because of the hadeeth of Ibn `Umar- radiyallaahu `anhu)maa- who said: Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>Two dead animals and forms of blood have been made lawful for us. As for the two dead animals, then they are fish and locusts; and as for the two forms of blood it is the liver and the spleen</strong>.&gt;&gt; [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) <strong><span style="color:#993300;">Dead animals which do not have blood which flows</span></strong>, such as flies, ants, bees, and their like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Hurayrah -radiyallaahu `anhu- that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>If a fly falls into the vessel of one of you then let him immerse it in it, totally. Then let him throw it out, for indeed in one of its wings there is a poison and in the other there is a remedy</strong>.&gt;&gt; [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(iii) The bones of a dead animal, and its horn, claws, hair, and feathers.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of that is pure, in keeping with the basic principle, which is that things are pure; and because of what al-Bukhaaree reported in disconnected form,[18] saying, ‘az-Zuhree said about the bones of a dead animal, such as the elephant and its like, “I met people from the Salaf of the scholars using it as combs, and as pots for oil. They did not see any harm in that.” And Hammaad said: “There is no harm in (using) the feathers of dead birds.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>HOW IMPURITY IS TO BE PURIFIED.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should know that the bringer of the legislation, who made us aware that a thing is impure, or causes other things to become impure, has also made us aware of how we are able to purify it. So what is obligatory upon us is to follow his saying and to comply with his command. So whatever it is reported about that it must be washed until no colour, smell, or taste remains from it, then that is its purification; and whatever it is reported about that water must be poured upon it, or sprinkled upon it, or that it should be scraped, or wiped upon the earth, or merely walking upon pure earth, then that is its purification. Furthermore you should know that water is the basic substance for purifying impurities, since the bringer of the Legislation described it with his saying: &lt;&lt;<strong>Allaah created water as being pure and purifying</strong>&gt;&gt; [19], so nothing else besides it is turned to, unless that is established from the bringer of the legislation; otherwise not, since it would be a case of turning aside from something known to be a purifier towards something which is not known to be a purifier, and this would be a departure from what the legislated manner of proceeding demands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when you know this, then here is what occurs in the legislation regarding the manner of purifying substances which are impure or which cause impurity:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1. Purifying the animal through tanning:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn `Abbaas -radiyallaahu `anhumaa- who said: I heard Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>Whichever animal skin is tanned, then it becomes pure</strong>.&gt;&gt; [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>2. Purifying the vessel which a dog has licked:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Hurayrah- radiyallaahu `anhu- that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said: &lt;&lt;<strong>The purification of the vessel of one of you when a dog has licked it is that he washes it seven times, the first of them being with the earth</strong>.&gt;&gt; [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>3. Purifying a garment which menstrual blood has fallen onto:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Asmaa· bint Abee Bakr -radiyallaahu `anhaa- who said: A woman came to the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and said: “If menstrual blood falls onto the garment of one of us, what should she do?” So he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>She should scrape it off, then she should rub it with water, then she should wash it (all). Then she can pray whilst wearing it</strong>.&gt;&gt; [22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a trace still remains after that, then there is no harm: From Aboo Hurayrah -radiyallaahu `anhu- that Khawlah bint Yasaar said, “O Messenger of Allaah! I have only a single garment, and I menstruate whilst wearing it.” He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>When you become clean wash the place of the blood, then pray whilst wearing it</strong>.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said: “O Messenger of Allaah! If its trace is not removed?” He said:<br />
&lt;&lt;<strong>The water will suffice you, and its trace will not harm you</strong>.&gt;&gt; [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>4. Purifying the trailing hem of the woman’s garment:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From a slave-girl who gave birth to a child of Ibraaheem ibn `Abdir-Rahmaan ibn `Awf, that she asked Umm Salamah -the wife of the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) I am a woman who makes the hem of my garment long, then what if I walk upon a filthy place?” So Umm Salamah said: “The Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said: &lt;&lt;<strong>What comes after it will purify it.</strong>&gt;&gt; [24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>5. Purifying the garment from the urine of a suckling baby:</strong></span> [25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Abus-Samh, the servant of the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) who said: “The Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>It should be washed from the urine of a girl, and sprinkled with water from the urine of a boy</strong>.&gt;&gt;[26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>6. Purifying the garment from pre-seminal fluid (madhee):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Sahl ibn Hunayf who said: I used to experience difficulty and trouble on account of pre-seminal fluid, and I used to frequently take a bath from it. So I mentioned that to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>The wudoo· would suffice you for that</strong>.”&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: “What about that which fall upon my garment from it?” He said:<br />
&lt;&lt;<strong>It will suffice you to take a handful of water, and to rub your garment with it wherever you see it has fallen upon it</strong>.&gt;&gt; [27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>7. Purifying the underneath of the shoe:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Sa`eed -radiyallaahu `anhu- that the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said: &lt;&lt;<strong>When one of you comes to the mosque, then let him turn his shoes over and examine them. So if he sees some filth, then let him wipe it upon the earth, then let him pray whilst wearing them</strong>.&gt;&gt; [28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>8. Purifying the earth:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Hurayrah -radiyallaahu `anhu- who said: “A Bedouin stood and urinated in the mosque. So the people began raising their voices against him. So the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>Leave him, and pour a bucket of water upon his urine; for you were sent as people who make things easy, and you were not sent as people who make things difficult</strong>.&gt;&gt; [29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) commanded that in order to quickly purify the earth. So if it had been left until it became dry, and then the trace of the impurity departed, then it would have become pure, because of the hadeeth of Ibn `Umar -radiyallaahu `anhumaa- who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Dogs used to urinate in the mosque, and come and go, in the time of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and they had not used to sprinkle anything upon it.” [30]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">BIOGRAPHY OF THE SHAIKH `ABDUR-RAHMAAN IBN NAASIR AS-SA`DEE -rahimahullaahu ta`aalaa</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Abridged from the book ‘ash-Shaikh `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Naasir as-Sa`dee wa juhooduhu fee tawdeehil-`Aqeedah’ of Shaikh `Abdur-Razzaaq `Abdil-Muhsin al-`Abbaad]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Firstly: His lineage.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is the great scholar, the pious person, the Zaahid (one who abstained from the unnecessary things of this world), the jurist, the scholar of the principles of Fiqh. The great scholar of al-Qaseem, and our Shaikh, Aboo `Abdillaah `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Naasir ibn `Abdillaah ibn Naasir ibn Hamd Aal Sa`dee, from the tribe of Banoo Tameem.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Secondly: His birth.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was born in `Unayzah, in al-Qaseem, on the twelfth of Muharram 1307H, and he lived as an orphan, without either of his parents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Thirdly: His upbringing.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His father gave importance to his cultivation, and before his death he instructed his eldest son to look after him, and he took on the task of caring for him in the best manner. So he was equipped with a righteous environment, and with a great desire to seek knowledge, and he exerted in it day and night, day after day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Fourthly: His characteristics.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) His physical characteristics: He was of medium height, his hair was dense; and he had a full, round face, and a dense beard. He was whitish in colour, with a reddish tinge. He had a handsome face, with light upon it, and a pure complexion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) His manners: He was good-humoured, and beloved to the people on account of his good nature.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anger would not be seen upon his face.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He had a great degree of humility and modesty, and he was amiable, to an extent that is rarely found. He was humble with the young and the old, the rich and the poor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He had a high level of manners, decency, uprightness, and firm resolve in all his affairs. He abstained from the unnecessary things of this world, and was one who witheld (from asking). He had selfrespect, despite his possessing very little. He felt compassion towards the poor, the needy, and the strangers. He would give money to the poor and needy students, so that they could free themselves from preoccupation with seeking a livelihood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He loved to bring about peace and rectification between the people. His clothing was moderate in fineness, and avoided conspicuousness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Fifthly: His life in the field of knowledge.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His overriding concern in his life was to derive the benefit of knowledge, and to utilize his time for that. So he began with memorization of the Qur·aan at an early age, and he had memorized it proficiently by the age of eleven. Then he began acquiring the rest of the branches of Islamic knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He did not restrict himself whilst seeking knowledge to a single field of knowledge; rather he studied many fields: so he studied Tafseer, Hadeeth, Creed and Belief, Fiqh, Usool, Science of Hadeeth, the sciences of the language, and other than this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh gave a great deal of attention to the books of the two Shaikhs of Islaam: Ibn Taimiyyah and Ibnul-Qayyim; he devoted himself to reading and revising them, and to memorising and understanding them, and to writing and abridging them..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He first sat to teach at the age of twenty three, and he used to divide his time between learning and teaching. He would spend some time in reading to the scholars, and some time in sitting to teach the students. He would also spend some time in referring to the books, and in researching within them. He would not allow any of his time to be lost without his utilising it, to such an extent that teaching in his city fell to him, and all of the students relied upon him with regard to their education.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Sixthly: His Shaikhs.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) Shaikh Ibraaheem ibn Hamd ibn Jaasir (1241-1338 H). He was the first Shaikh whom he read to. He learned from him Tafseer and Hadeeth, and the Principles (Usool) of both of them.<br />
(2) Shaikh Muhammad ibn `Abdil-Kareem ash-Shibl (1257-1343 H). He learned from him Fiqh, and its Principles, and the sciences of the Arabic Language.<br />
(3) Shaikh Muhammad ibn ash-Shaikh `Abdil-`Azeez al-Muhammad al-Maani` (1300-1385 H). He learned from him the sciences of the Arabic Language.<br />
(4) Shaikh Muhammad al-Ameen ash-Shanqeetee (1289-1351 H). He learned from him Tafseer, Hadeeth, Science of Hadeeth, and the sciences of the Language.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Seventhly: His students:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) Shaikh Muhammad ibn Saaalih al-`Uthaymeen. He took over from his Shaikh in the duty of Imaam of the Congregational Mosque of `Unayzah, and in teaching, admonishing, and delivering the khutbah.<br />
(2) Shaikh `Abdullaah ibn `Abdir-Rahmaan al-Bassaam. Member of the Discretionary Committee in the Western Region.<br />
(3) Shaikh `Abdul-`Azeez ibn Muhammad as-Salmaan. He studied in the Imaamud-Da`wah Institute in ar-Riyaad, and he followed the path of his shaikh in authorship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Eighthly: His writings:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Ibn Sa`dee -rahimahullaah- gave great attention to writing works. He produced many works in the different fields of Islamic knowledge. Some have been printed, while others are, as yet, unprinted. So from the printed works are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- ‘al-Adillatul-Qawaati` wal-Baraaheen fee Ibtaal Usoolil-Mulhideen’;<br />
2- ‘al-Irshaad ilaa Ma`rifatil-Ahkaam’;<br />
3- ‘Bahjatu Quloobil-Abraar wa Qurratu `Uyoonil-Akhyaar fee Sharh Jawaami`il-Akhbaar’, and it is presently being prepared and attended to;<br />
4- ‘Tawdeehul-Kaafiyatish-Shaafiyah’;<br />
5- ‘at-Tawdeeh wal-Bayaan lishajaratil-Eemaan’;<br />
6- ‘at-Tanbeehaatul-Lateefah feemahtawat `alaihil-Waasitiyyah minal-Mabaahithil-Muneefah’;<br />
7- ‘Tayseerul-Kareemir-Rahmaan fee Tafseer Kalaamil-Mannaan’;<br />
8- ‘ad-Durratul-Mukhtasarah fee Mahaasin Deenil-Islaam’;<br />
9- ‘Risaalah fil-Qawaa`idil-Fiqhiyyah’;<br />
10- ‘Risaalah Lateefah Jaami`ah fee Usoolil-Fiqhil-Muhimmah’; and it is before your eyes, along with annotations upon it;<br />
11- ‘Tareequl-Wusool ilal-`Ilmil-Ma·mool bima`rifatil-Qawaa`id wad-Dawaabit wal-Usool’;<br />
12- ‘al-Fataawas-Sa`diyyah’.They were gathered after his death -rahimahullaahu ta`aalaa.<br />
13- ‘al-Qawaa`idul-Hisaan li-Tafseeril-Qur·aan’;<br />
14- ‘al-Qawlus-Sadeed fee Maqaasidit-Tawheed’;<br />
15- ‘Manhajus-Saalikeen wa Tawdeehul-Fiqh fid-Deen’;<br />
16- ‘al-Wasaa·ilul-Mufeedah lil-Hayaatis-Sa`eedah’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ninthly: His illness and death:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He fell ill in the year 1371 H, i.e. five years before his death, with the illness of high blood pressure and arteriosclerosis, and it would strike him time after time, and he bore it patiently, until he moved on to his Lord, at the time of Fajr, on Thursday the 22nd of Jumaadal-Aakhirah 1376 H &#8211; may Allaah forgive him, and his parents, and our parents, and all of the Muslims.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THE BATH (al-Ghusl):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Those things which make it obligatory:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">1) Semen coming out whilst awake or during sleep:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of his (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Taking a bath is binding if semen comes out.”[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from Umm Salamah that Umm Sulaym said: <strong>“O Messenger of Allaah, Allaah is not shy of the truth, so is the bath binding upon the woman if she has a sexual dream.” He said: “Yes if she sees semen.”</strong> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And having desire is a condition if a person is awake but not during sleep. Because of his (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“If you ejaculate semen then take a bath from janaabah, but if you do not ejaculate it with force then do not take a bath.”</strong> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ash-Shawkaanee [4] said: ‘al-hadhf means firing out, and it does not occur in this manner except as a result of desire and it contains a point of note that that which comes out without desire, either because of illness or severe cold, does not necessitate taking a bath.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whoever has a sexual dream and does not find semen, then there is no bath due upon him. And whoever finds semen but does not remember any sexual dream then taking a bath is upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Aa·ishah-radiyallaahu `anhaa- that she said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) was asked about the man who finds liquid but does not remember any sexual dream, so he said: “He should take a bath.” And he was asked about a man who sees that he had intercourse in a dream but he does not find any liquid. So he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:”There is no bath due upon him.</strong>” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">2) Sexual intercourse, even if he does not ejaculate:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah -radiyallaahu `anhu- from the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) that he said: <strong>“If he sits between her four limbs, and he has intercourse with her, then the bath has become obligatory, even if he did not ejaculate.”</strong> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">3) An Unbeliever accepting Islaam:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Qays ibn `Aasim that he accepted Islaam, so the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) ordered him to take a bath with water and lote-tree leaves. [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>4) The cessation of the menstrual period and after-birth bleeding:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of `Aa·ishah -radiyallaahu `anhaa- that the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said to Faatimah bint Abee Hubaysh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“When the menstrual period comes then leave off the Prayer; and when it departs, then take a bath and pray.”</strong> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And after-birth bleeding is just like the menstruation period by consensus.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>5) The day of Jumu`ah:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the hadeeth of Aboo Sa`eed al-Khudree that the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said: <strong>“Taking the bath for the Jumu`ah is obligatory upon every adult.”</strong> [9]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Its Pillars:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) Intention: Because of the hadeeth:”<strong>Actions are but by intentions…</strong>” [10]<br />
2) Covering the whole body with water.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Its recommended form:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Aa·ishah -radiyallaahu `anhaa- that she said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘When Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) took a bath from janaabah he would begin and wash his hands, then he would pour water with his right hand over his left hand and wash his genitals. Then he would perform the wudoo· in the manner in which he performed the wudoo· for the Prayer. Then he would take the water and enter his fingers into the roots of his hair until he saw that he had caused the water to reach all parts of it. Then he would take three handfuls of water and put it upon his head. Then he washed his feet.’[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Point of note:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not obligatory upon the woman to undo her hair when taking a bath from janaabah, but it is obligatory upon her to do that in the bath for the menstrual period.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Umm Salamah -radiyallaahu `anhaa- that she said: ‘I said: “O Messenger of Allaah! I am a woman who ties my hair into plaits. Shall I undo it for the bath of janaabah?” He said: “No, it would suffice you to pour three handfuls of water upon your head, then make the water flow upon yourself, and you will be clean.” [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Aa·ishah -radiyallaahu `anhaa- that Asmaa· asked the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) about the bath from menstruation. So he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“One of you should take her water and her lote-tree leaves, so she should purify herself and purify herself in a good manner then she should pour it upon her head and strongly rub it in until she reaches the roots upon her hair. Then she should pour the water upon herself, then she should take a piece of cloth with musk upon it and clean herself with it.” So Asmaa· said: ‘How should she clean herself with it? so he said “Subhaanallaah! (How perfect is Allaah!) She should clean herself with it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So `Aa·ishah said to her, and it is as if she said it secretly to her: ‘You should wipe away the trace of blood with it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And she asked him about the bath of janaabah. So he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“She should take some water and purify herself, and clean herself in a good manner, or perform the purification fully. Then she should pour it upon her head, and rub it in until she reaches the roots of (the hair) upon her head. Then she should pour the water upon herself.” [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this hadeeth clearly shows a difference between the bath which a woman takes from her menses, and her bath from the state of janaabah, since he emphasised upon the menstruating woman that she should exert in rubbing strongly, and in purifying, in a way in which he did not emphasis regarding her bath from janaabah. Just as the hadeeth of Umm Salamah is a proof that it is not obligatory to undo the hair in her bath from janaabah. [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the basic rule is to undo the hair to make certain that the water reaches whatever is underneath it. Except that it has been pardoned in the bath of janaabah because of the fact that it happens repeatedly, and that it would create severe difficulty to have to undo it for that. Contrary to the bath after the menses because it happens only once a month. [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">A point of note:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible for the two spouses to take a bath together in a single place, each of them looking at the private part of the other; because of the saying of `Aa·ishah &#8211; radiyallaahu `anhaa: ‘I used to take a bath, I and Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) from a single vessel, when we were in a state of janaabah.’ [16]</p>
<h3><strong>The recommended baths:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1-Taking a bath at each act of sexual intercourse:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of Aboo Raafi` that one night the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) had relations with all of his wives in succession, taking a bath with this one, and with this one. He said: “O Messenger of Allaah! Why don’t you make it a single bath?” So he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is purer, and better, and cleaner.” [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">2- The woman who has continual bleeding</span></strong> taking a bath for every Prayer, or one bath for the Zuhr Prayer and `Asr Prayer together, and one bath for the Maghrib and the `Ishaa· Prayer together, and one bath for the Fajr Prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of `Aa·ishah -radiyallaahu `anhaa- that she said: “Umm Habeebah had continual bleeding in the time of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) so he commanded her to take a bath for every Prayer….the hadeeth.” [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in a narration from her a woman had continual bleeding in the time of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) so she was commanded that she should bring the `Asr Prayer forward and delay the Dhur Prayer, and that she should take a single bath for both of them; and that she should delay the Maghrib Prayer and bring forward the `Ishaa· Prayer, and take a bath for the two of them, and that she should take a bath for the Dawn Prayer. [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">3- Taking a bath after becoming unconscious:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of `Aa·ishah -radiyallaahu `anhaa- that she said Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) became very ill. So he said: “Have the people prayed?” So we said: ‘No, they are waiting for you O Messenger of Allaah’. So he said: “Put some water in the tub for me.” She said so we did so. So he took a bath and then he tried to stand but he fell unconscious. Then he came around and he said: “Have the people prayed?” So we said: ‘No, they are waiting for you O Messenger of Allaah’. He said put some water for me in the tub. She said so we did so. So he took a bath then he tried to stand up and he fainted. Then he came around and he said:” Have the people prayed?” So we said: ‘No, they are waiting for you O Messenger of Allaah’. And she mentioned his sending a message to Aboo Bakr, and the completion of the hadeeth. [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">4- Taking a bath after burying a Mushrik:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of `Alee ibn Abee Taalib -radiyallaahu `anhu- that he came to the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and he said: “Aboo Taalib has died.” So he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said: “Go and bury him.” So when I had buried him I came back to him, and he said to me: “Take a bath.” [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>5- Taking a bath for the two `Eeds and for the Day of `Arafah:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of what al-Bayhaqee reported, by way of ash-Shaafi`ee: from Zaadhaan, who said: “A man asked `Alee -radiyallaahu `anhu- about the bath.” So he said: “Take a bath every day if you want to.” So he said: “No, the bath which is the bath.” He said: “The Day of Jumu`ah, and the Day of `Arafah, and the Day of Sacrifice, and the Day of Fitr.” [22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">6- Taking a bath after washing the dead:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of his (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) saying: “Whoever washes a dead person then let him take a bath.” [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">7- Taking a bath for the state of Ihraam for `Umrah or Hajj:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of Zayd ibn Thaabit that he saw the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) remove his (usual) clothes for entering the state of Ihraam, and he took a bath. [24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">8- Taking a bath to enter Makkah:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of Ibn `Umar -radiyallaahu `anhu(maa)- that he had not used to come to Makkah except that he would spend the night at Dhee Tuwaa, and then enter the morning. So he would take a bath and then enter Makkah in the day time; and he mentioned from the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) that he did it. [25]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>WIPING OVER THE LEATHER SOCKS (al-Mash `alal-khuffayn)</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam an-Nawawee -rahimahullaah- said in his explanation of Muslim (3/164):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Those whose sayings are counted in consensus have agreed that it is permissible to wipe over the leather socks, when on a journey and when in residence, whether it is done for a need or otherwise, to the extent that it is permissible for the woman who stays within her house, and at times when the person is not walking about. It is only criticised by the Shee`ah and the Khawaarij, and their disagreement is not counted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Hasan al-Basree -rahimahullaah- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Seventy of the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) narrated to me that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) used to wipe upon the leather socks</strong>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the best thing that is used as evidence for the permissibility of wiping is that which Muslim reported from al-A`mash: from Ibraaheem from Hammaam, who said: Jareer urinated, and then he performed wudoo·, and he wiped over his leather socks. So it was said: “You do this.” He said, “Yes, I saw Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) urinate, and then he performed the wudoo·, and then he wiped over his leather socks.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-A`mash said: Ibraaheem said: “This hadeeth used to please them, because the Islaam of Jareer happened after Sooratul-Maa·idah came down’’. [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">an-Nawawee said [2] : ‘Meaning that Allaah- the Most High- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Then wash your faces and your arms up to and including the elbows, and wipe your heads, and wash your feet up to and including the ankle bones.&#8221;</strong> [Sooratul Maa·idah (5):6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: “So if the Islaam of Jareer had come before the descent of al-Maa·idah it would have been possible that his hadeeth about wiping over the leather socks was abrogated by the Aayah of al-Maa.idah, but since his Islaam came later on, then we know for certain that his hadeeth is to be acted upon; and it clarifies that the one who is meant by the Aayah is the person who is not wearing leather socks. So therefore the Sunnah particularises the Aayah, and Allaah knows best.’’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Its Conditions:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a condition for the permissibility of wiping that he should wear the leather socks upon the state of having made wudoo·.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From al-Mugheerah ibn Shu`bah -radiyallaahu `anhu- who said: I was with the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) one night on a journey. So I poured water out for him from the pot, and he washed his face and his two forearms, and he wiped his head. Then I reached down to remove his leather socks, so he said: <strong>“Leave them because I entered them both in a state of purification.” And he wiped over them.</strong> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The time period for wiping:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Alee ibn Abee Taalib -radiyallaahu `anhu- who said Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) laid down three days and their nights for the traveller,and one day and night for the resident. [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The place of wiping and its description:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The place which it is legislated to wipe is the upper surface of the leather sock, because of the saying of `Alee ibn Abee Taalib -radiyallaahu `anhu- : “If the Religion were in accordance with opinion, then underneath of the leather sock would have more right to be wiped then its top part, but I saw Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) wiping over the upper surface of his leather socks.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what is obligatory in wiping is whatever the term ‘wiping’ is applied to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Wiping over socks and sandals:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And just as it is permissible to wipe upon leather socks then it is permissible to wipe upon normal socks and upon sandals, because of the hadeeth of al-Mugheerah ibn Shu`bah that the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) performed the wudoo·, and he wiped over the socks and the sandals. [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from `Ubayd ibn Juraij who said: “ It was said to Ibn `Umar: We have seen you doing something which we did not see anyone else besides you doing.’ He said: ‘And what is it?’ They said: ‘We have seen you wearing these animal- hair sandals.’ He said: ‘I saw Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) wearing them and performing wudoo· in them, and he wiped over them.’ [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>That which nullifies the wiping:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wiping is annulled by one of these three:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) Completion of the time period, because wiping has a time limit, as you have known. So it is not permissible to increase upon the time period which has been established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) Janaabah: Because of the hadeeth of Safwaan: “Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) used to command us when we were upon a journey that we should not remove our leather socks for three days along with their nights except from janaabah, but rather from passing excrement, and urine and sleep.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3) Removing that which has been wiped upon from the feet, because if he removes them, and then wears them again, then he will not have entered his two feet in a state of purification.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>A point of benefit:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The completion of the time period, and removing that which he has wiped upon nullify the wiping alone. So it is not permissible to wipe until he has performed the wudoo·, and washed his feet, and then worn it. However if he was still in a state of wudoo· when he took off the thing that he wiped over, or when the time period finished, then he remains upon his state of wudoo·. He can pray with it as he wishes until he breaks his wudoo·.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>A point of benefit:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever wears two pairs of socks upon a state of purification, and then wipes over them, and then he removes the top one -after having wiped over it, then it is permissible for him to complete the time period by wiping over the underneath one, because it is correct that he entered his two feet into them in a state of being pure. But if he wore a sock, and wiped over it, and then he wore another one on top of it, then he may not wipe over that. This is because it will not be correct that he has entered the two of them when they were pure. [9]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>PURIFICATION WITH EARTH (AT-TAYAMMUM):</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Its Legislation:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He- the Most High- says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And if you are ill or upon a journey, or one of you comes from going to the toilet, or if you have had sexual intercourse with women and you do not find water, then perform tayammum with clean earth: and wipe your faces and your hands.&#8221;</strong> [Sooratul-Maa.idah (5):6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Clean earth is a purification for the Muslim even if he does not find water for ten years.”</strong> [1]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The causes which render it permissible:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible to perform tayammum when one is unable to use water, if he can not find it, or if he fears harm from using- it because of illness in the body or severe cold. From `Imraan ibn Husayn -radiyallaahu `anhu- who said: “We were along with Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) on a journey. So he led the people in the Prayer and then he saw a man who was keeping himself away. So he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“What prevented you from praying?” He said: “I was struck by janaabah and there was no water.” So he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said: “Use the earth, for it will suffice you.”</strong> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from Jaabir -radiyallaahu `anhu- who said: “We went out on a journey, so a man from us was struck by a rock and it caused him a head injury. Then he had a wet dream, so he asked his companions: ‘Do you find any concession for me to perform tayammum?’ So they said: “We do not find any concession for you and you, and you are able to use water.” So he took a bath and he died. So when we came to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) he was informed of that. So he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“They killed him, may Allaah kill them. Why didn’t they ask when they did not know? Indeed the cure for ignorance is to ask. It would have sufficed him to perform tayammum.”</strong> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from `Amr ibn al-`Aas -radiyallaahu `anhu- that when he was sent on the military expedition of Dhaatas-Salaasil he said: “I had a wet dream on a night which was severely cold, so I feared that if I took a bath I would die. So I performed tayammum, and then I led my companions in the Dawn Prayer. Then when we came to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) they mentioned that to him. So he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“O `Amr did you lead your companions in Prayer when you were junub?” So I said: “I remembered the Saying of Allaah- the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And do not kill yourselves indeed Allaah is ever Merciful to you.&#8221;</strong> [Sooratun-Nisaa· (4): 29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore I performed tayammum and then I prayed.” So Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) laughed, and he did not say anything.” [4]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">What is &#8216;earth&#8217; (as-Sa&#8217;eed)?</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said in ‘Lisaanul `Arab’ [5] : “The Sa`eed is the earth; it is said: pure earth, and it is said: it is every pure soil; and there occurs in the Revelation sent down:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;So perform tayammum with pure earth&#8221;</strong> [Sooratul Maa·idah (5): 6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Ishaaq said: ‘as-Sa`eed is the face of the earth, and it is upon the person that he should strike his two hands upon the face of the earth, and not care whether the place has soil upon it or not. Because as-Sa`eed is not soil rather it is the face of the earth, whether that be soil or something else. He said: and if there is a land which is all rock, with no soil upon it, and the person performing tayammum strikes his hand upon that rock, then that would be purification if he wipes his face with it.’</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The description of the tayammum:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Ammaar ibn Yaasir -radiyallaahu `anhu(maa)- who said: ‘I became junub and I did not find any water. Therefore I rolled around in the dust and I prayed. So I mentioned that to the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and he said: “It would have sufficed you to do like this”, and the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) struck the ground with his two palms, and blew upon them. Then he wiped his face with them and his two hands.’ [6]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>A point of benefit:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The principal with regard to tayammum is that it takes the place of the wudoo· So whatever is permissible to do in a state of wudoo·, then is permissible to do it with it (i.e. tayammum). And it is permissible to perform it before the time, just as that is permissible with the wudoo·; and the person can prayer whatever he wishes with it, just as he prays in a state of wudoo.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The things which break tayammum:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tayammum is broken by that which breaks the wudoo·. It is also broken by the presence of water -for the person who couldn’t find it, and the ability to use it- for the one who was unable to use it; and whatever came before from his Prayer is correct, it is not necessary for him to repeat it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Sa`eed al-Khudree -radiyallaahu `anhu- who said: “Two men went out on a journey and it became time for the Prayer and they did not have any water with them. So both of them performed tayammum with pure earth and they prayed. Then they found water within the time. So one of them repeated the wudoo· and the Prayer, and the other one did not repeat. Then they came to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and they mentioned that to him. So he said to the one who had not repeated: “<strong>You attained the Sunnah, and your Prayer suffices you</strong>.” And he said to the one who performed wudoo· and repeated: “<strong>You have the reward twice over</strong>.”’’ [7]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>A point of benefit:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever has a wound upon which he has wrapped a bandage, or a fracture which he has set, then having to wash that place falls away from him, and he does not have to wipe over it, nor perform tayammum for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof for that is the Saying of Allaah- the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Allaah does not place a duty on any soul except that which it can carry out.&#8221;</strong> [Sooratul-Baqarah (2): 286]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the saying of the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) <strong>“When I command you with a matter, then do what you are able to do from it.”</strong> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So everything which the person is unable to do falls away, by the text of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, and to declare something else to be a replacement for it is legislation, and legislation is not binding except by a text of the Qur&#8217;aan or Sunnah; and there is nothing in the Qur&#8217;aan or the Sunnah to show that wiping upon a splint or upon ointment is a replacement for washing that which the person is not able to wash. So that saying falls away. [9]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The permissibility of performing tayammum with a wall: [10]</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn `Abbaas-radiyallaahu `anhu(maa)-who said: “ I came along with `Abdullaah ibn Yasaar- the slave belonging to Maymoonah the wife of the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) until we entered upon Aboo Juhaym ibn al-Haarith ibn as-Simmah al-Ansaaree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Abul- Juhaym said: The Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) came from the direction of the well of Jamal [11], so he was met by a man who greeted him with Salaam, but the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) did not respond to him until he went to the wall, and wiped his face and two hands. Then he responded to his greeting of Salaam.” [12]</p>

And wash the rest of his body.’’ Shamsul-Haqq said in ‘ `Awnul-Ma`bood’ (1/535): ‘The narration about combining tayammum and washing is not reported by anyone other than Zubayr ibn Khurayq, and he- along with the fact that he is not strong in hadeeth &#8211; has also contradicted the rest of those who report it from `Ataa· ibn Abee Rabaah.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The siwaak (tooth-stick) :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The siwaak is recommended in all conditions, and its recommendation is emphasized:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">2- At every Prayer:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Hurayrah -radiyallaahu `anhu- from the Prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) who said:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">3- When reciting the Qur·aan:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Alee -radiyallaahu `anhu- who said: “<strong>He commanded us to use the siwaak</strong>, and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>When the servant stands in Prayer an Angel comes to him and stands behind him, listening to the Qur.aan and drawing closer. So he continues listening and drawing closer until he places his mouth upon his mouth. So he does not recite any Aayah except that it enters within the Angel</strong>&gt;&gt; [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>4- When entering the house:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From al-Miqdaam ibn Shurayh: from his father, who said: I asked `Aa·ishah, saying: “<strong>What had the Prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) used to begin with when he entered his house?” </strong>she said:<strong> “With the siwaak.”</strong> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>5- When getting up (to pray) during the night:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Hudhayfah –radiyallaahu `anhu- who said: “<strong>When Allaah’s Messenger ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) got up to pray the tahajjud Prayer at night, he used to rub his mouth with the siwaak</strong>.” [5]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">1 &#8211; It is recommended for the person who wants to enter the toilet to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">بِسْمِ الله ) اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوْذُ بِكَ مِنَ الْخُبُثِ وَالْخَبَائِثِ)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Bismillaah),<br />
(Allaahummaa innee a`oodhu bika minal-khubuthi wal-khabaa·ith)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(With the name of Allaah),<br />
(O Allaah! I seek Your refuge from male and female devils).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because of the hadeeth of `Alee -radiyallaahu `anhu- that the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>The screen between the jinn and the private-parts of the descendants of Aadam, when one of you enters the toilet, is that he says:‘Bismillaah’ (with the name of Allaah).</strong>&gt;&gt; [1.1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And because of the hadeeth of Anas -radiyallaahu `anhu- who said: “When Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) went to the toilet he used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوْذُ بِكَ مِنَ الْخُبُثِ وَالْخَبَائِثِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Allaahummaa innee a`oodhu bika minal-khubuthi wal-khabaa·ith’ (O Allaah! I seek Your refuge from male and female devils).”  [1.2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 &#8211; And it is recommended that when he departs he says:: (Ghufraanaka): (I seek Your forgiveness), because of the hadeeth of Aa·ishah -radiyallaahu `anhaa- who said: “When the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) came away from the toilet he would say: &lt;&lt; <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Gh</span>ufraanaka</strong>&gt;&gt; (I seek Your forgiveness).” 1.3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 &#8211; And it is recommended that he should enter with his left-foot first, and depart with the right-foot first.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because the right-side is used for noble actions, and the left-side for actions which are not noble actions; and there are reports which indicate this generally. [1.4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 &#8211; And if he is in an open place, then it is recommended for him to move far enough away so that he is not seen:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Jaabir -radiyallaahu `anhu- who said: “We went out along with Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) on a journey, and Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) would not go to the toilet until he had gone far enough so that he would not be seen.” [1.5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 &#8211; And it is recommended that he does not raise his garment until he is close to the ground:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn `Umar -radiyallaahu `anhumaa- : “That when the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) wanted to relieve himself he would not raise his garment until he was close to the ground.” [2.1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 &#8211; And it is not permissible to face or to have ones back towards the qiblah, whether in the open desert or within a building:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Ayyoob al-Ansaaree -radiyallaahu `anhu- from the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>When you go to the toilet, then do not face the qiblah and do not have your back towards it, but rather turn to the east or to the west</strong>.” [2.2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Ayyoob said: “So we came to Shaam, and we found toilets which had been built facing towards the Ka`bah. So we would turn aside from it, and we would ask for the forgiveness of Allaah -the Most High.” [2.3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 &#8211; And it is forbidden to go to the toilet upon the path-way of the people, and in the places where they take shade:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Hurayrah that the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>Beware of the two things which bring about curses</strong>.&gt;&gt; They said: “And what are the two things which bring about curses, O Messenger of Allaah?” He said: &lt;&lt;<strong>The person who goes to the toilet upon the path-way of the people, or where they take shade</strong>.&gt;&gt;2.4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8 &#8211; And it is disliked to urinate in the place where he takes a bath: From Humayd al-Himyaree who said: I met a man who had accompanied the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) just as Aboo Hurayrah accompanied him, [2.5] who said: “Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) forbade that one of us should comb his hair every day, and that he should urinate in the place where he takes a bath.”  [2.6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9 &#8211; And it is forbidden to urinate in standing water:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Jaabir: from the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) that he forbade urinating in standing water. [3.1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10 &#8211; And it is permissible to urinate standing, but sitting is better:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Hudhayfah -radiyallaahu `anhu-: that the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) came to the rubbish dump of a people, and he urinated whilst standing. So I moved away, so he said: &lt;&lt;<strong>Draw near</strong>.&gt;&gt; So I drew close to him, until I stood at his heels. So he performed wudoo·, and wiped over his leather socks. [3.2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we said that sitting is better because that was his usual practice, to such an extent that `Aa·ishah -radiyallaahu `anhaa- said: “Whoever narrates to you that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) urinated whilst standing then do not believe him. He had not used to urinate except whilst sitting.” [3.3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this saying of hers does not negate what occurs from Hudhayfah, since she informed about what she had seen, and Hudhayfah informed about what he had seen; and, as is known, the one who affirms is given precedence over the one who negates, since he has additional knowledge with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11 &#8211; And it is obligatory to keep oneself clean of urine:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from Ibn `Abbaas -radiyallaahu `anhumaa- : that the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) passed by two graves, and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>They are being punished, and they are not being punished for something serious. As for one of them, then he had not used to keep himself clean of his urine; and as for the other, then he used to go between the people with reports to cause trouble (nameemah)</strong>.” [3.4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12-And he should not hold his penis with his right hand whilst he is urinating, nor clean himself with it:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Qataadah -radiyallaahu `anhu- who said: Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>When one of you urinates, let him not hold his penis with his right hand; and let him not clean himself with his right hand</strong>.” [4.1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13 &#8211; And it is permissible to clean oneself with water, or with stones-or with whatever is like them, and water is better:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Anas -radiyallaahu `anhu- who said: “Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) used to enter the toilet, and I and a boy of similar age to me used to carry a pot of water and a spear. So he would clean himself with the water.” [4.2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from `Aa·ishah -radiyallaahu `anhaa- that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said: &lt;&lt;<strong>When one of you goes to the toilet then let him take three stones along with him, and let him clean himself with them, since they will suffice him</strong>.&gt;&gt;  [4.3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14 &#8211; And it is not permissible to suffice with less than three stones:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Salmaan al-Faarisee -radiyallaahu `anhu- that it was said to him: ‘Your Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) has taught you everything, even how to use the toilet!’ So he said: “Yes indeed! He <strong>forbade</strong> us from facing the qiblah with excrement or urine; and that we should clean ourselves with the right hand, and that we should clean ourselves with less than three stones; and that we should clean ourselves with a piece of animal dung or with a bone.” [4.4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15 &#8211; And it is not permissible to clean oneself with a bone, or with a piece of dung: From Jaabir -radiyallaahu `anhu- who said: “The Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) forbade that a person should wipe himself clean with a bone or a piece of animal dung.” [4.5]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from Appendix I of  the book : “The Methodology of the Prophets in Calling to Allaah – that is the way of wisdom and intelligence” – by Shaykh Rabee hafidhahullaah, translated by Dawud Burbank rahimahullah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Appendix I </strong>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah alone, and may He send praises and blessings of peace upon the Messenger of Allaah, and upon his family and true followers, and his Companions and those who follow his way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed, I praise Allaah, with abundant, pure and blessed praise for every blessing which He has bestowed on me, and I give thanks to Him, the Most High, and praise and extol Him, and I cannot praise and extol Him as truly befits Him, and no-one can do so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then from the blessings which Allaah has bestowed on me is that He has enabled me, despite my weakness, to speak the truth openly according to my capability, whether in writing or face to face encounters, so I thank Him and praise Him with praise such as would fill the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them. I also ask that He grants me firmness upon that until I meet Him and that He is pleased with me. I further ask that He grants me increase in guidance to what is correct, and protection, and I do not forget, and all praise is for Allaah, that when my book, ‘The Methodology of the Prophets in Calling to Allaah &#8211; That is the Way of Wisdom and Intellect,’ was published it was accepted by the true Muslim youth in every place with joy and was greatly welcomed. This was because it made the call of the Prophets clear to them, until it became as clear as the sun in the middle of the day, and it removed confusion, distortions and the deception of some writers whose hearts were like those of devils in the form of humans those whose only concern is to gather the people around them and around their fraudulent slogans. It does not worry such people that this gathering of people should include the Raafidees (extreme <em>Shee’ah</em>), the hypocrites, the heretical <em>Khawaarij</em>,[2] the extreme Sufis who are guilty of apostasy, the ignorant and their like from the worshippers of the graves, or whichever of the wretched and unfortunate groups.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It does not worry them that this type of people rally together with them and rally to their slogans, despite the evil consequences of this in this world and the Hereafter. This is because they are as they were described by Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , <em>“Callers to the gates of Hell, whoever answers their call will be thrown into it,”</em> and because they are as the sincere, truthful and trustworthy Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   described them, <em>“Devils in the bodies of humans.”</em> If this is not the case then what is it that causes them, and those who follow their lead, to flee from and separate themselves from the clear and radiant way and methodology of the Prophets, which is made clear by the Qur&#8217;aan and shown to be their way and their methodology?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah with regard to this His names and attributes, <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah in His lordship, and <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah in His worship, and to disbelieve and reject everything that is worshipped besides Him &#8211; that is the pure religion. Allaah the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We sent a Messenger to every nation, ordering them that they should worship Allaah alone, obey Him and make their worship purely for Him, and that they should avoid everything worshipped besides Allaah.”</strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We did not send any Messenger before you, O Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  , except that We revealed to Him that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah &#8211; so make all of your worship purely for Allaah.”</strong>[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Study any of the other <em>da’wah</em>s of the sects and parties &#8211; other than the <em>Salafee</em>[5] <em>da’wah </em>&#8211; do you see this methodology or any trace of it in their schooling, their persons, or their <em>jamaa&#8217;aat</em>? Then show it to me if you are truthful. As for myself I do not find in these sects and parties except that they wage a fierce war against this methodology and its people. I do not see except belittlement and mockery of this methodology and its people. I do not see except hatred and enmity for this methodology and its people, and I do not see except warm greetings and respect from them for the deviant and misguided calls and their people. Indeed you will frequently see and hear the last of these from those who disguise themselves as <em>Salafees</em> but are in reality closer in relation to their enemies, and there are ties and relationships between them which are such as they are known only to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there are some who are passionately in love with the state of superstitions, innovations and misguidance who think- and evil are their thoughts, and evil is the lie which they invent- that Imake a separation between the religion and the State, and that I dispute about the importance of the subject of authority of sovereignty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“What a serious word it is that comes out of their mouths! What they say is nothing but a lie”</strong>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this book displeased them and it made clear the falsity of their calls and their misrepresentation and distortion of Islaam and of the text concerning <em>tawheed </em>&#8211; particularly with regard to the <em>da’wah</em> of the Messengers, may Allaah’s praise and blessings of peace be upon them. The book did not join them in welcoming the state of the <em>Raafidee Shee&#8217;ahs</em>. Nor did it support them in seeking establishment of statelets founded upon the building of the tombs and upon the belief that the pious who have died know the Hidden and Unseen and have some control over the creation. Nor did it support them in seeking establishment of statelets based upon any such things as have preceded, nor in accepting the misguidance and <em>shirk</em> of secularism which seeks to disguise itself in the guise of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather the book, and all praise is for Allaah, made clear that the true and trustworthy <em>da’wah</em> is that which follows the methodology of the Prophets in calling to Allaah, and the state which is established upon this correct methodology &#8211; that is the Islamic state. Then despite the fact that the book was dealing with a particular topic &#8211; which was to explain the methodology of the Prophets in calling to Allaah &#8211; it still gave attention to mentioning the Islamic state which it mentioned repeatedly and emphasised a number of times. It even had a chapter headed: &#8220;The view of the scholars of Islaam concerning leadership (<em>al-Imaamah</em>) and their proofs of its obligation&#8221;. Then the scholars sayings about that were quoted and their proofs mentioned. However what angered the people of innovations and desires, and the callers to falsehood, is that I placed leadership and the state in the place given to them by Allaah and which was accepted by the scholars of Islaam. I did not support the people of innovation and desires in their abandonment of the methodology of the Prophets in calling to <em>tawheed</em>, and fighting <em>shirk</em>, innovations and the rest of the types of misguidance and deviation, and fighting idolatry and grave-worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nor did I support them in making leadership (<em>al-Imaamah</em>) the most important matter, and the most fundamental principle &#8211; which is something which has led people to rejection of the methodology of the Prophets and has lead them to fight against it. It has also led them to fling themselves into the arms of the <em>Raafidee Shee&#8217;ah</em>, and to having affection for them, and to allying themselves with them, defending them and to falsley adorning their ideology which is at war with Islaam, in opposition to the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> and waging war against the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   and his pure wives and the rest of the Muslims and their scholars. Indeed it goes beyond that to the point that they declare these great people to be disbelievers and make the foulest attacks against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I did not support them in this misguidance and this loathsome excess, so they disliked the book and thought evil about its author. So they said the falsehood which they said in order to turn the youth who thirst for the truth away from the irrefutable and clear truth in this book. This book which openly spoke the truth and placed both correct creed and belief (<em>‘aqeedah</em>) and the state in the place given to them by Allaah &#8211; without going beyond the bounds or falling short, and without distorting and deception. Then it is essential that I explain to the youth the distinction between the state (<em>ad-Dawlah</em>) and the dominion and sovereignty of Allaah (<em>al-Haakimiyyah</em>). As for the state, then it is a gathering of people who may be disbelievers, may be misguided deviants, or may be Believers. Then the people may be gathered under a rightly- guided <em>khilaafah</em>, or restricted kingships- which has been the case with the Islamic states after the rightly -guided <em>khilaafah</em>. So these individuals who form the Believing state are no more than the means to implement the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah- the establishment of <em>jihaad</em>, the ordering of good and forbidding of evil, establishment of the Prescribed Punishments and retribution, and the protection of the <em>ummah</em> from the plots and aggression of the enemies against the lands of the Muslims and against their souls, their wealth and their honour. So the Muslims must establish a state to accomplish these great obligations &#8211; either : by giving the pledge of allegiance to a <em>khaleefah</em> whom all of the Muslims are united upon; or by the fact that an individual from the <em>ummah</em> gains ascendancy and has power, an army and authority &#8211; which means that the benefit of the <em>ummah</em> lies in accepting him as long as he proclaims Islaam, establishes the laws and the creed (<em>‘aqeedah</em>) and protects the <em>ummah</em> from its enemies and does whatever is required, the details of which are known and mentioned in the source works of Islaam; or by the fact that some individuals gain ascendancy over some areas as happened in the lands of Islaam after the weakening of the <em>khilaafah</em>, so overall benefit necessitated submitting to this situation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for dominion and sovereignty then these are attributes of Allaah and qualities particular to Him alone, as He, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Judgement and command is for Allaah alone, He ordered that you should worship none but Him. That is the true and straight religion.”</strong>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this authority and sovereignty is not denied except by one who is a disbeliever in Allaah and is severe in his enmity to Allaah, His Messenger and His Books. Indeed one who even denies Allaah’s authority in the slightest matter, not to mention with regard to fundamental matters, then he is a disbeliever in Allaah, outside the fold of Islaam if he knowingly denies that. As for the ignorant person, then he has excuse until the proof is established against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What I have said applies to the rulers, the ruled and to indivduals and groups (<em>Jamaa&#8217;aat</em>). This has been affirmed by the trustworthy scholars of Islaam, and from them Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah, <em>rahimahullaah,</em>[8] and his student Ibnul-Qayyim.[9] So whoever accepts and abides by this rule and authority in the fundamentals of the religion and its details, and in matters of creed and belief, and matters of worship, and dealings and political affairs, and economic affairs, and manners, and social affairs &#8211; then he is a Believer. But he who does not abide by it all or some of these then he is a disbeliever, whether he is an individual or a group, a ruler or one ruled, a caller or one called. Indeed I fear, by Allaah, for many of the sects, parties and individuals that they may fall into disbelief due to their not abiding by the rule and authority of Allaah with regard to the fundamentals of the religion, indeed with regard also to its details. I fear for many of them, against whom the proof has been established and to whom the truth has been made clear, yet still they persist in opposing the call to <em>tawheed</em> and oppose waging war against shirk and innovation, aswell as opposing its people and to cutting from them. Instead these people incite others against and warn against those who call with the call of the Prophets, and those who seek truly and sincerely to amend the affairs. After establishment of the proof against such a person he would fall into the abyss of disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I call all of the <em>ummah</em> &#8211; its rulers and its ruled, its indivduals, sects, and parties, to all have true belief in the all-encompassing authority and sovereignty of Allaah which covers the fundamental matters of the religion and its details, and that they should fully abide by it with regard to the fundamental matters of the religion and its details. I also call the heads of the states, from those who abide generally by the rule and authority of Allaah, and yet are negligent in some areas of practice, I call them to abide by it totally and unrestrictedly in every field, in the matter of <em>‘aqeedah</em>, and worship, and dealings, and economics, and politics, and with regard to ordering good and forbidding evil, and that they should strive to fight against <em>shirk</em> and innovations, and against sins and against evil &#8211; particularly usury and the rest of the major sins which harm the <em>ummah</em> and its manners. Indeed Allaah prevents by means of the rulers those who are not prevented by the Qur’aan. They should be fully aware that Allaah will question them about every small and large matter which they are responsible for. <em>“Each of you is a guardian and is responsible for thoses whom he is in charge of.” </em>I also remind them of the saying of the Prophet, <em>“There is no ruler having authority over Muslim subjects who dies while he is decieving them except that Allaah has forbidden Paradise for him.”</em>[10] and his saying, <em>“There is no servant whom Allaah places in authority over some people, and he does not deal with them sincerely and honestly, except that he will not find the fragrance of Paradise.”</em>[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From sincerity to the <em>ummah</em> is that you encourage them to abide by the ruler of Allaah and His <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em>, by teaching them, directing them, encouraging and warning them, and by ordering the good and forbidding the evil, and by establishing prescribed punishment and using every means which will cause them to respect the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah in <em>‘aqeedah</em>, worship, political affairs and manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also call the heads of state in Islamic lands who do not abide by the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah that they should turn back to Allaah and respect His religion which is found in the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, and that they should cling to the creed and beliefs of this religion and its rulings, and to be proud of that &#8211; since therein lies honour and nobility. However total disgrace and humiliation comes from submission to laws laid down by the most despicable humans, the enemies of this <em>ummah</em> whether they are Jews, Christians, Magians or atheists. So I call such leaders to respect the feelings of the <em>ummah</em> of Islaam which has striven and fought and sacrificed millions of its sons for the achievement of a noble and lofty goal &#8211; which is that it should be ruled by Islaam, and Islaam alone is the religion of Allaah, the Creator of this creation, the Creator of mankind and <em>jinn</em> so that they should worship Him alone and submit to His revealed laws alone. They should abide by the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah and impose it upon the <em>ummah</em> in creed and beliefs, in manners, in teaching and in Islamic curriculae which education and training are to be based upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also enjoin the scholars of the <em>ummah</em>, and its callers, and parties and groups that they should sincerely advise all of the <em>ummah</em>, its elders and its youth, its males and its females, and unite them upon the Book of Allaah, the <em>Sunnah</em> of his Messenger, and upon the methodology and understanding of the <em>Salalafu-Saalih</em> (the Pious Predecessors), the Companions, the <em>Taabieen</em> and those who followed them upon good, the <em>imaams</em> of guidance, the scholars of <em>fiqh</em>, the scholars of <em>hadeeth</em> and of <em>tafseer</em>, in creed and beliefs, in worship, in manners, in dealings, in economic affairs, and all the other affairs of Islaam and <em>eemaan</em>. Then they should fully comprehend the Sayings of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed then they are the ones guilty of unbelief.”</strong>[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed then they are the transgressors.”</strong>[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed then they are the disobedient.”</strong>[14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They should understand that these Sayings of Allaah apply to all individuals, groups, rulers and subjects. So to restrict it to refer it to the rulers alone and not to the people of deviant sects and misguidance, those who do not judge by the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah in their creed and beliefs, nor in their worship and their behaviour, then this is from ignorance, misguidance and foolishness, since Allaah sent these <em>Aayaat</em> down concerning the Jews at a time when they had not had any state or authority for centuries. He sent these <em>Aayaat</em> down concerning them at a time when He had imposed humiliation and lowliness upon them. I have explained the authority and sovereignty of Allaah in this broad and all-embracing sense in the book itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I should also not fail to draw attention to an error made by the author of <em>‘Meezaanul-I&#8217;tidaal litaqyeem Kitaabil-Mawridiz-Zallaal fir-Tanbeeh &#8216;alaa Akhtaa’iz Zilaal,’ </em>who is ’Isaam ibn Muhammad ibn Taahir al-Barqaawee, who attributed to me something which my tongue has never uttered and which I never believed, nor have I ever written such a thing. Furthermore I seek Allaah’s refuge from what he said, and I declare myself free before Allaah from it, and I ask Allaah to save me and all the Muslims from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Barqaawee said in a footnote (p.15) to his aforementioned book: “This also reminds me of what Shaykh Rabee&#8217; ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee, <em>hafizahullaahu ta&#8217;aalaa</em>, did in his book, <em>‘Manhajul-Anbiyaa fid-Da’wah illallaah&#8230;’ </em>when he criticised the view of al-Maududi, <em>rahimahullaah ta&#8217;aalaa</em>, about the importance of leadership (<em>imaamah</em>), <em>khilaafah</em>, and judging by that which Allaah sent down, since he also sought to use as evidence the saying of Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah about the position of the <em>imaamah</em> with the Raafidee (<em>Shee&#8217;ahs</em>). So he took up six pages in quoting the discussion of Shaykhul-Islaam with those <em>Raafidee</em> (<em>Shee&#8217;ahs</em>). However the numerous and great differences between the beliefs of the <em>Raafidees</em> concerning the <em>imaamah</em> and the infallibility of the <em>Imaams</em>, and the twelve <em>imaams</em> and so on, and between what al-Maududi and others call to, i.e. the necessity and importance of striving to return to judging by the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em>, through the <em>khilaafah</em>, and to establish a single ruler for the people of Islaam; the differences between these two are well known. Even if the words of Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah contain something which is fitting in this regard, yet most of it, if a just person were to examine it, is not fitting to this discussion, rather it applies to the matter of <em>imaamah</em> with the <em>Raafidee</em> (<em>Shee&#8217;ah</em>) with its well known details&#8230; so he should not have quoted it all&#8230; for fear of deception.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Barqaawee&#8217;s scales are unbalanced and he has not judged between myself and al-Maududi with justice, and perhaps he has forgotten the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And weigh justly with the true balance.”</strong>[15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Woe to those who give short measure to others. Those who demand full measure from others, but when they give them in measure or weight then they give them less than their due. Do these people not think that they will be ressurected for reckoning on a formidable Day. The Day when all mankind will stand before the Lord of the Worlds.”</strong>[16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brother al-Barqaawee, I was debating the view of al-Maududi about the importance of the matter of leadership (<em>imaamah</em>), the <em>khilaafah</em> and judging by that which Allaah has sent down!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards the fact of their importance, then no Believer having a trace of <em>eemaan</em> would dispute that. But O brother you have failed to note the point of disagreement between myself and al-Maududi. I debated with the view of al-Maududi with regard to his going beyond the due limits about leadership to such an extent that no Muslim who has respect for Islaam could remain silent about this excess, and it was of such a level that even the misguided would not accept it, not to mention the people of <em>hadeeth</em> and the <em>Salafees</em>. Indeed very many scholars from his own land, from the <em>Salafees</em> and others have replied to him. Then this excess of his has travelled and has reached many Arab and Islamic lands, and it has fooled an overwhelming majority of authors and youth, which has led to great neglect of the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of <em>tawheed</em>, and even comtempt of it and of its people. It has also led people to treat <em>shirk</em> and innovation lightly and has caused al-Maududi and his like to ally themsleves with and to befriend the devotees of the graves and even the <em>Raafidees</em> (<em>Shee&#8217;ah</em>), and to gather these people under their banner, to treat them as brothers, to love and defend them and their beliefs and creed, and this is something which is a reality and is clear to everyone possessing intellect and religion. So since the matter has reached this frightful state, I replied to al-Maududi with regard to some of his excess in order to make the people in general aware, and also the people of the Arabian Peninsula, to which the followers of al-Maududi and their helpers direct their attention. So they seek to wipe away the <em>’aqeedah</em> of <em>tawheed</em>, and the <em>’aqeedah</em> of true and correct alliance and enmity (<em>al-Walaa wal-Baraa</em>). Do you think that my reply to al-Maududi was so unreasonable that you seek to defend his view with falsehood, and by forgetting to judge justly, to the point that you take my words to mean something which I did not say, and which they did not mean?! Listen to what al-Maududi says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The question of leadership is the most important matter in human life and its most fundamental principle.” Then try to defend this saying with clear and unequivocal texts from the Book of Allaah and the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger, and the words of the Companions and the scholars of Islaam. If you have not seen this, then you must adjust your scales in order to establish justice, equity and fairness, and to abandon the excess which has led al-Maududi and his followers to scorn the call of the Prophets and the goal of their <em>da’wah</em>, and to turn the affairs upside down. Listen to his saying: “The true goal of the religion is to establish the system of the rightly guided and righteous leadership (<em>imaamah</em>).” So to him this is the true goal of the religion. So <em>tawheed</em>, and the Prayer, and<em> Zakaat</em>, and <em>jihaad</em> and other matters from the religion become only means to reach this goal in the view of al-Maududi. So produce the clear proofs from the Book of Allaah and the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , in place of al-Maududi, to support this and if you are unable then do not be too embarrassed to say, ‘This poor weak servant, Rabee’ ibn Haadee, has spoken the truth and has been sincere towards Islaam and the Muslims, and has put matters in their due place.’ Then listen to the saying of al-Maududi: “This is the purpose for which the Prayer, Fasting, the <em>Zakaat</em> and the <em>Hajj</em> have been made obligatory in Islaam. Then the fact that they are called acts of worship does not mean that they are themselves worship, rather its meaning is that they prepare mankind for the true and fundamental worship, and these are a training course which are essential for that.&#8217; He also says, &#8216;You think that standing facing the <em>Qiblah</em>, placing the right hand upon the justify, and <em>rukoo&#8217;</em> with your hands upon your knees, and prostration upon the ground, and reciting particular words, and these actions and movements are themselves worship; and you think that fasting from the start of <em>Ramadaan</em> until the start of <em>Shawwaal</em>, and going hungry and thirsty from morning until evening, you think that this is worship; and you think that reciting a number of <em>Aayaat</em> from the Qur&#8217;aan is worship; and you think that performing <em>Tawaaf</em> around the <em>Ka&#8217;bah</em> is worship. In summary you have called the manifestation of certain actions worship, and when a person performs these actions with their form and manners you think that he has worshipped Allaah&#8230; but the truth is that the worship which Allaah created you for, and which he ordered you to perform is something else.”[17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Are you pleased by this derisive manner about speaking about the great pillars of Islaam and those who worship in this way? These are not, in the view of al-Maududi, forms of worship for which man was created, rather the worship for which man was created and which they were ordered to fulfil is something else. O Barqaawee, do you take this as your religion before Allaah? That the forms of worship are only a training course which if applied will&#8230; etc. Is this something stated textually in the Qur’aan and the <em>Sunnah</em>, and which the Prophets came with and which was accepted by the best of the people of this <em>ummah</em>? If you agree with al-Maududi then bring the proofs to support his saying. Otherwise bite upon your knuckles in regret and grief for having deserted the truth and offended its people and helped falsehood. This, O my brother, was the subject of my debate with al-Maududi, and about which I quoted the words of Shaykhul-Islaam concerning the exceeding of the bounds by the <em>Raafidees</em> about leadership (imaamate). What I quoted from him was all relevant, not just a part of it as al-Barqaawee claimed. Then if you were correct, O Barqaawee, then why did you not explain what was relevant from the words of Shaykhul-Islaam and what was not? As for the claim of &#8216;infallibility&#8217; for the &#8216;twelve imaams,&#8217; then I did not attribute it to al-Maududi, nor did I debate about it with him, nor did I quote Shaykhul-Islaam’s words about it. So your words are totaly opposed to justice! As for your equity and justice which you set up for yourself in judging between Sayyid Qutb and ad-Duwaysh, then I do not know what you have done. Indeed you have totally failed to be just between myself and al-Maududi, and how would it have harmed you to speak the truth? Then as for the <em>khilaafah</em>, I do not know if you read what I wrote and quoted from the scholars of Islaam, or if you merely took the subject with the tips of your fingers with your eyes closed, thinking that justice and equity would be achieved that easily. So read this and that anew and speak the truth, supporting it with proof, not alarmism and agitation!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for judging by that which Allaah sent down, then how can you imagine that I would dispute about it with al-Maududi or anyone else, when it is something known necessarily in the religion, and not even the deviant and deviated sects dispute about it?! So I seek Allaah’s refuge from what the author of <em>‘al-Meezaan,’</em> attributed to me. Rather read again what I wrote concerning the authority and sovereignty of Allaah, and that it comprehends every part of the religion, and you will see the extent of the mistake of al-Barqaawee, may Allah guide him. Then finally the points of criticism of al-Maududi and his like are so many that this introduction is not the place for them. But in summary, he is one of those furthest from abiding by the authority and sovereignty of Allaah with regard to his <em>’aqeedah</em> and his <em>Fiqh</em>, and with regard to his stance on the <em>Sunnah</em> of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , and his stance with regard to the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , and with regard to their enemies the <em>Raafidee Shee&#8217;ah</em>. Indeed he and his followers have alliance and friendship with those <em>Raafidees</em>, they support them and they praise their <em>Taaghoot</em>, al-Khomeini and his students, the <em>Aayatur-Raafidiyyah</em>. So noble reader be aware of this, and judge the people according to the truth, and do not judge the truth according to its people, and beware of falling into the abyss of over-exaggerated respect for personalities so that it leads you to reject the truth, and to argue against its people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah guide and grant the <em>ummah</em> to loving the truth and its people. Indeed my Lord hears and responds to supplications.</p>

<p>[The following is the continuation of the article @ <em><a title="Permanent Link to The Call to Allah : Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/01/27/the-call-to-allah/">The Pillars which support the correct Da’wah</a></em> – Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">.. So whichever call is not <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/01/27/the-call-to-allah/"><strong>built upon these foundations</strong></a>, and whatever methodology is not from the methodology of the Messengers &#8211; then it will be frustrated and fail, and it will be toil without any benefit. The clearest proofs of this are those present day groups (<em>jamaa&#8217;aat</em>) which set out a methodology and programme for themselves and their <em>da’wah</em> which is different to the methodology of the Messengers. These groups have neglected the importance of <em>‘aqeedah</em> (correct belief and creed) &#8211; except for a very few of them &#8211; and instead call for the correction of side-issues. So one group calls for the correction of rule and politics, and demands establishment of the prescribed punishments, and that Islamic Law be applied in judging amongst the people, and this is indeed something very important, but it is not what is most important &#8211; <strong>since how can one seek to establish and apply Allaah’s Judgement upon the thief and the fornicator before seeking to establish and apply Allaah’s Judgement upon the <em>mushrik</em>, the one who attributes worship to others besides Allaah?! How can we demand that Allaah’s Judgement be applied to two men disputing about a sheep or a camel before demanding that Allaah’s Judgement be applied to those who worship idols and graves, and those who deny or hold heretical beliefs with regard to Allaah’s Names and Attributes, divesting them of their true meanings, or distorting them?! </strong>Are these people not greater criminals than those who fornicate, drink wine and steal?! Those are crimes against mankind, whereas <em>shirk</em> and denial of Allaah’s Names and Attributes are crimes against the Creator, the One free of all imperfections, and the right of the Creator has precedence over the rights of the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah says in his book, <em>al-Istiqaamah</em> (1/466): “<span style="color:#ff0000;">So these sins along with correct <em>tawheed </em>are better than corrupted <em>tawheed</em> in the absence of these sins</span>.”[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then another <em>jamaa&#8217;ah</em> affiliates itself with <em>da’wah</em>, except that its methodology is also at variance with the methodology of the Messengers. They give no importance to correct <em>‘aqeedah</em>, rather they give importance to worshipping and practising some <em>dhikr </em>(remembrance of Allaah) in the way of the <em>Sufis</em>.[2]They concentrate upon going out (<em>khurooj</em>) and touring the lands, and what is important to them is that they manage to attract the people to join them, without caring about their beliefs and creed (<em>‘aqeedah</em>). All of these are innovated ways, taking as their starting point matters which were justify until last in the call of the Messengers. This is just like the case of one who seeks to cure a body whose head has been cut off, since the place of <em>‘aqeedah</em> in the religion is like the head with regard to the body. So it is necessary for these groups to correct their concepts and understanding by referring back to the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> in order to know the methodology of the Messengers in calling to Allaah. For indeed Allaah, the One free of all imperfections, informed that correct rule and sovereignty, which is the central part of the call of the former <em>Jamaa&#8217;ah</em> whom we mentioned, cannot be achieved except after correcting <em>‘aqeedah</em> such that all worship is for Allaah alone, and worship of everything else is abandoned. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah has promised those who truly believe (have true <em>eemaan</em>) amongst you, and act in obedience to Allaah and His Messenger, that He will grant them rulership upon the earth just as He granted it to those before them, and that He will establish their religion for them, grant them authority to practise the religion which He chose for them and ordered. And He will certainly change their situation to one of security, after their fear, providing that they worship and obey Me, not associating anything else in worship with Me. Then whoever rejects this favour by disobedience to their Lord, then they are the rebellious transgressors.”</strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these people wish to establish the Islamic State before purifying the lands of idolatrous beliefs which take shape in the worship of the dead, and devotion to tombs, such as is no different to the worship of al-Laat, al-’Uzzaa and the third of them <em>Manaat</em>,[4] rather it is worse. So they are attempting that which is impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed establishment and application of the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> and the prescribed punishments; establishment of the Islamic State; avoidance of whatever is prohibited; and achievement of whatever is obligatory &#8211; all of these things are from the rights of <em>tawheed</em>, and matters which perfect it and follow on from it. So how can we give attention to that which is subsidiary whilst neglecting that which is of primary importance?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is my view that the fact that these groups are at variance with the methodology of the Messengers in calling to Allaah is a result of their ignorance of this methodology, and the ignorant person is not suitable to be a caller, since one of the most important conditions for <em>da’wah</em> is knowledge, as Allaah, the Most High, says about His Prophet,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Say, Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  , this is my way, I call to Allaah (i.e. to the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone, with no partner) upon certain knowledge &#8211; I, and those who follow me. I declare Allaah free and far removed from all that they associate as partners with Him, and I am free of those who worship anything else along with Him.”</strong>[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So one of the most important qualifications for a caller (<em>daa&#8217;ee</em>) is knowledge.[6] Then we see that these groups (<em>Jamaa&#8217;aat</em>) which attribute themselves to <em>da’wah</em> are at variance with each other. Each group lays down a programme different to the programme of the others and follows a different methodology to it. This is the inevitable consequence of contradicting the methodology of the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , since the way and methodology of the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   is a single way, containing no division, nor divergence, as Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Say, Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  , this is my way, I call to Allaah (i.e. to the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone, with no partner) upon certain knowledge &#8211; I, and those who follow me.”</strong>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the followers of the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   are upon this single way and are not divided and split. Rather those who contradict this way are the ones who divide amongst themselves, as Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“This is my Straight Path, so follow it, and do not follow any of the other paths, for they will split you and take you away from that way which He prescribed for you.”</strong>[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So because these groups (<em>Jamaa&#8217;aat</em>) are a threat to Islaam which may obstruct it, or prevent people from entering into it, then this is something which must be properly explained, and it must be made clear that this is something which is not from Islaam at all. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Those who divide up the true religion and break up into sects and parties, you, O Muhammad, have nothing to do with them.”</strong>[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So since explanation of this is obligatory and it is binding to make it clear, a group of scholars having sincere concern for Islaam and the required level of knowledge and research took on the task of indicating the mistakes of these groups and explaining where they are at variance in <em>da’wah</em> with the methodology of the Prophets, so that they may return to what is correct. Indeed the truth is that which the Muslim always seeks, and so that those who do not realise their errors may not be beguiled by them. So from these scholars who took on this great duty of acting upon the saying of the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , <em>“The religion is sincerity/sincere advice, the religion is sincerity/sincere advice, the religion is sincerity/sincere advice.” We said, “To whom, O Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “To Allaah, and to His Book, and to His Messenger, and to the rulers of the Muslims and their common folk,”</em> &#8211; from those who explained this matter and gave sincere advice about it is the noble Shaykh, Dr. Rabee’ ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee in his book entitled, &#8216;The Methodology of the Prophets in Calling to Allaah, That is the Way of Wisdom and Intelligence.&#8217; For he explains, may Allaah grant him success and reward him with good, the Methodology of the Messengers in calling to Allaah, as it is shown in the Book of Allaah and the <em>Sunnah </em>of His Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  . He presents the methodologies of the variant groups in the light of this in order to clearly show the difference between the methodology of the Messengers and these differing and contrasting methodologies which are at variance with it. He discusses these methodologies in the scholarly way and in a just way, whilst quoting examples and witnesses to what he says. So his book, and all praise and thanks are for Allaah, accomplishes the goal, and is fully sufficient for those who desire the truth, and is a proof upon those who are stubborn and obstinate in opposing what is correct.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we ask Allaah to reward him for his work, and to cause it to be of benefit, and may Allaah send praise and blessings of peace upon Muhammad, his family and true followers, and His Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>.. So I am amazed at the situation of many callers today who see the manifestation of <em>shirk </em>in front of their eyes, yet it does not cause them any concern whatsoever and they do not give any attention to it. Indeed what is even worse is that they complain about those who criticise it and who feel pained by this evil state of affairs which remains from the days of ignorance.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">.. intellect, wisdom and the natural way therefore necessitates that the starting point is to wage war against the danger of <em>shirk</em>, and that the call of the Prophets and their followers should continue fighting it for as long as anything of it remains, or any form or manifestation of it continues. So if a nation is afflicted by matters damaging to its <em>‘aqeedah</em>, and <em>shirk</em> which destroys its <em>‘aqeedah</em>, and also is beset by economic and political problems, then where is wise treatment of the problems to begin?! As for the Prophets, then they did not begin except with applying their full efforts to treating problems facing <em>‘aqeedah</em>. Then beginning by seeking to treat the most dangerous problem is a matter about which all humans with intellect agree upon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So, for example, if a person with intellect saw a snake and an ant moving towards a person, then his intellect would lead him to hasten to repel or kill the snake due to the greater danger which it poses to a person. It is not possible that he would divert his attention to the ant, nor even to a thousand such ants. Also if a number of people possessing intellect saw that a fierce lion and a number of rats attacked them all at once, then they would all strive together to prevent the attack of the lion and they would forget all the rats, even if a group of frogs came with them. And if a group of travellers came to a point where they had no choice but to take one of two roads: the first passed by volcanoes which were emitting flames and fire, and flinging out rocks and boulders. Then the second road passed through areas of thorny bushes, and sun-baked ground and was subject to the heat of the sun. Then anyone with intellect would not choose except to take the second road.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So now let us think about the most severe problems and ills. I mean the problems in political affairs, social affairs and economic affairs, and the worst of these is corruption in matters relating to rulership and judgement. Then let us weigh this against corruption in matters of <em>‘aqeedah</em>. So are these two things equal in weight with Allaah and with the Prophets, or is it the case that one is more severe, dangerous and worse in its consequences?!! So in the scale of Allaah and the scale of the Prophets the most dangerous of these two, and the one which has the greater demand for attention throughout the ages, and with all the Messengers, is <em>shirk</em> and its manifestations, whose evil and corruption cannot be matched by any other evil no matter how great. So upon this we repeat and say, “<span style="color:#ff0000;">All of the Prophets began with correction of matters of <em>‘aqeedah</em>, and by waging war upon <em>shirk</em> and its manifestations</span>,” and this is what is demanded by wisdom and intellect and that is due to the following reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">Firstly</span>,</strong> that corruption relating to matters of the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of the people: <em>shirk</em>, false superstitions and beliefs, and the various types of misguidance, is thousands of times more dangerous than the corruption resulting from the corruption in rulership and other affairs. Indeed if we do not say and firmly believe this then we have without knowing it discredited and belittled the Messengers, and we seek Allaah’s refuge from misguidance. Indeed this corruption encompasses the ruler and the ruled. So the rulers themselves in every time and place, except for the Believers from them, humble themselves to the idols, false-gods and tombs. They construct them, protect them, worship them and present offerings to them. They firmly believe that they have some supernatural power over and above their own authority. So they hold that these things cause harm and benefit for them due to the unseen power and authority which they think they possess, or at the very least they think they can intercede with Allaah in order for their problems to be reduced. The clearest example of the submission of the rulers to the idols is the example of the despot who claimed divinity, the Pharaoh, who said, boasting:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“I am your Lord, the Most High.”</strong>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“I know of no other god for you besides me.”</strong>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since the leaders of his people said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Will you leave Moosaa and his people to cause mischief in the land when they have abandoned worship of you and worship of your gods?”</strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also Namrood, the king of the Chaldeans who claimed lordship for himself. When Ibraaheem, <em>‘alayhis-salaam, </em>broke the idols, Namrood sought to burn Ibraaheem to take revenge for these idols, because they were the gods which he worshipped. Likewise the kings of India and Persia worship idols and worship fire. The kings of Rome in the past and the present-day rulers of Europe and America worship the cross and worship images. And how many of the past and present-day rulers of the Muslims are afflicted by the trial caused by the dead, so that they build tombs over them, and their hearts are attached to them in love, hope and fear. They fall into that which Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) feared for his <em>ummah</em> and which he warned against. So the seriousness and the soundness of the methodology will therefore be clear to you, and also the importance of the firm stance taken by the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) with regard to idols and tombs. Furthermore the wisdom of Ibraaheem will become clear to you, and the depth of his thinking and its extent when he made the enduring call which resounds in all corners and in every generation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And keep me and my sons far removed from worshipping the idols. O my Lord, they have caused the misguidance of many of the people. So whoever follows me in what I am upon (<em>eemaan</em> in Allaah, making worship purely for Allaah and disassociation from the worship of idols) then he is from my people (upon my way and religion), and whoever disobeys me, then indeed You are the Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.”</strong>[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So you see Ibraaheem, who was fully upon the truth and the right way, seeking Allaah’s refuge from the evils and danger of the idols, and not seeking His refuge from the evils and danger of the rulers, despite the level of their corruption and their danger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">Secondly</span>,</strong> the people were upon a single religion (Islaam), upon guidance, but then they diverged from it, so Allaah sent the Prophets as bringers of good tidings of reward for the obedient Believers, and warners of Allaah’s punishment for the disobedient unbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We do not send Our Mesengers except with good news for the obedient that Paradise and success on the Day of Resurrection is the reward for obedience to Me, and with a warning for those who disobey and reject My commands that We will punish them, so that they may die aware of that. So whoever believes the Messengers and acts righteously in this world by following what they are upon then there will be no fear upon them when they meet their Lord, nor will they grieve about what they justify behind in the world.”</strong>[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Messengers who were sent with the good news of Allaah’s reward for those who obey Allaah, do as He commands and believe in His Messengers, and warners of Allaah’s punishment for those who disobey Allaah, contravene His commands and disbelieve in His Messengers, so that those who disbelieve in Allaah and worship others besides Him may have no excuse to avoid punishment after the sending of the Messengers.”</strong>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Mesenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said, <em>“There is no one to whom granting excuse is more beloved than Allaah, therefore He sent the bringers of good-tidings and the warners.”</em>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So are the Messengers charged with anything but to clearly convey the Message?”</strong>[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The Messenger’s duty is but to clearly convey the Message.”</strong>[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So if you deny Our Messenger, O people, and reject his command for you to worship your Lord and to free yourselves from the worship of idols, then nations before you denied their Messengers who called them to the truth, so Allaah sent His punishment upon them and will do the same with you. The Messenger&#8217;s duty is but to clearly convey the Message.”</strong>[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this duty of warning and bringing good tidings and conveying the Message is a very exalted, sublime and lofty duty. It is enough in this regard that it was the duty of the Prophets and fully concorded with their lofty station, since it the hardest and the greatest task taken up by mankind. It was then taken up by their inheritors from the true and sincere callers who follow their methodolgy, therefore Allaah’s Mesenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said, <em>“The people who are most severely tried are the Prophets, then those most like them, then those most like them.”</em> We have also already mentioned the extent of the difficulties faced by the caller to <em>tawheed</em> and that others are unable to persevere in this sphere.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">Thirldy</span>,</strong> Allaah, the One free of all imperfections, and the Most High, did not start by commanding and making it a duty upon them, as is seen from the stories of their lives, that they should establish states and cause the downfall of others, and this is perfect wisdom since the call to establish a state attracts the seekers of this world, and those who seek after self-elevation and positions of power, and those who have personal goals and grudges, and aspirations and ambitions.[11] So these types of people quickly respond to the call to establish a state which they think will enable them to attain their goals, their desires and their ambitions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to the like of these considerations, and Allaah knows best, and due to other reasons known by Allaah, the Creator, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, the calls of the Prophets and their methodologies were far removed from using these flashy and attractive slogans or those which clearly appeal to short-term ambitions and desires. Rather they followed a methodology which is wise, unblemished and noble. It involves being tried and tested. So they are followed upon this way and believed in by every true and sincere person free of selfish ambitions and personal goals. Such a person does not desire through his <em>eemaan</em>, his <em>tawheed</em> and his obedience to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) except Paradise and the Pleasure of his Lord. He does not fear except from His Anger and His severe punishment. Therefore they are only followed generally by the poor, the needy and the weak. Allaah, the Most High, says, quoting what the people of Nooh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“They said, ‘Are we to believe in you, O Nooh, and affirm what you call us to, when it is only the lowly people who follow you?’”</strong>[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said concerning the people of Saalih:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The heads of the people who haughtily rejected Faith said to those who they held to be lowly, to those who believed in and followed Saalih and what he came with, ‘Do you really know that Saalih is one sent by Allaah?’ They said, ‘We indeed attest and believe in the truth and guidance which Allaah has sent him with.’ The haughty ones said, ‘We deny and disbelieve that which you believe in.’”</strong>[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also amongst the questions which Heraclius asked Aboo Sufyaan was, “Is it the noble of the people who follow him or the weak amongst them?” Aboo Sufyaan replied, “Rather it is the weak amongst them.” So Heraclius said, “I asked you ‘Is it the noble of the people who follow him or the weak amongst them,’ and you mentioned that it is the weak amongst them, and it is they who are the followers of the Mesengers.” So the call to establish a state is far far easier, and people respond more quickly to it since most people are seekers after this world and followers of desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also because of the reasons, the consequences and the difficulties in the way of the calls of the Messengers we find that they are not followed except by a small number of people. So Nooh remained, for nine hundred and fifty years,[14] calling to Allaah, yet despite this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“None but a few believed along with him.”</strong>[15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn &#8216;Abbaas, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhumaa, </em>who said, <em>“Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said, ‘The nations were presented before me, and I saw a Prophet and with him was a small group of people, and I saw a Prophet along with one man or two men, and a Prophet accompanied by nobody. Then I saw a huge crowd of people and I thought that they were my ummah. So it was said to me, “This is Moosaa and his people. But rather look to the horizon.” So I looked and saw a huge crowd, so it was said to me, “This is your ummah, and from them are seventy thousand who will enter Paradise without any reckoning.”’”</em>[16]<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Ibraaheem, the chosen and beloved Friend of Allaah, who refuted and silenced the <em>mushriks </em>with irrefutable and clear proofs. Allaah says regarding him and those who believed along with him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So Loot belived in him and attested to the truth of what he came with, and Ibraaheem said, ‘Indeed I will emigrate (to the land of <em>Shaam</em>) for the sake of my Lord. Indeed He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.’”</strong>[17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to Loot and those who were saved from the punishment along with him, and perhaps they were his daughters alone:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So We brought out those who were Believers from the town, and We did not find there except a single household of Muslims.”</strong>[18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But none of this diminishes the rank of the Prophets by the slightest degree, rather they are upon the highest rank and are the noblest and most distinguished of the people and the most honourable. They stand above all the people in manhood, bravery, excellence of language and eloquence, and in their clarity of explanation, their sincerity and sacrifice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They also established their duty of calling to <em>tawheed</em>, propagating the Message, giving the good tidings and the warnings, and they fulfilled this in the most complete manner. So the fact that they had few followers or some of them had no followers, is purely the fault of the nations which refused to accept the call since, in their view, they did not satisfy their lowly goals. Then it may be that they respond to his call, or a large number of them do so, and so they gain a state, as a goodly fruit due to their <em>eemaan</em>, their affirmation of what the Prophet came with, and their righteous actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They thus establish the obligation upon them of fighting <em>Jihaad</em> to raise up the Word of Allaah, and of following and applying the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> and the prescribed punishments and other matters prescrbed for them by Allaah. This is what happened with our Prophet Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and his noble Companions. Allaah crowned their <em>eemaan</em>, their righteous actions, and their exemplary perseverance when facing the harm and oppression of the <em>mushriks</em>, by aiding them and making their <em>Deen</em> uppermost, and by establishing them upon the earth as Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah has promised those who truly believe (have true <em>eemaan</em>) amongst you, and act in obedience to Allaah and His Messenger, that He will grant them rulership upon the earth just as He granted it to those before them, and that He will establish their religion for them grant them authority to practice the religion which He chose for them and ordered. And He will certainly change their situation to one of security, after their fear, providing that they worship and obey Me, not associating anything else in worship with Me.”</strong>[19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then sovereignty was offered to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) in Makkah but he refused and he continued calling to <em>tawheed</em> and waging war against <em>shirk</em> and the idols. So when Quraysh became troubled by the call of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) they sent ’Utbah ibn Rabee’ah and he came to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and said, “O son of my brother, you know the excellence you hold amongst us with regard to your position in the tribe and your lineage, but you have brought a matter which is very serious for your people. Because of it you have split their united body, caused their youth to behave foolishly and you have abused their idols with it, and their religion. You have also declared their fore-fathers to be infidels because of it. So listen to me and I will offer you some things which you may consider, and hopefully some of them will be acceptable to you.” So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said, “Speak, O Abul-Waleed, I will listen.” He said, “O son of my brother, if what you desire by this matter that you have come with is wealth, then we will gather wealth for you from our wealth until you are one of the richest of us. <strong>And if you wish by it for high position, then we will give you such authority that we will not do anything without your approval, and if you wish by it for sovereignty, then we will make you sovereign over us.</strong> But if it is the case that what comes to you is a demon which you see and cannot get rid of, then we will seek after a medical cure for you and will expend our money until we can get you cured of it. Since a demon may take hold of a person until he is cured and relieved of it,” or as he said. Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) was listening to him, then he said, “Have you finished, O Abul-Waleed?” He said, “Yes.” He said, “Then listen to me.” He said, “I will do so.” He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“In the name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy. <em>Haa Meem</em>. This Qur&#8217;aan is the Revelation sent down by the Most Merciful, the Bestwoer of Mercy. A Book whose <em>Aayaat</em> are made clear, a recital in pure Arabic for those who know (the pure Arabic language), bringing them good tidings of Paradise if they believe in it and act upon it, and as a warning to those who disbelieve in it and do not act in obedience to Allaah, that they will receive punishment and dwell forever in Hell in the Hereafter. But most of them turn away haughtily and refuse to listen to it.”</strong>[20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) continued reciting it to him. When ’Utbah heard it he remained silent and sat with his hands behind his back, resting upon them and listening. So when Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) came to the <em>Aayah</em> of prostration in it he prostrated and then said, “You have heard what you have heard O Abul-Waleed, so now it is up to you&#8230;” So ’Utbah went back to Quraysh and when he sat with them they said, “What has happened with you, O Abul-Waleed?” He said, “What happened is that I heard the like of which, by Allaah, I have never heard. By Allaah, it is not sorcery, nor poetry, nor divining. O Quraysh, obey me and let the decision be mine. Leave the man and let him continue in what he is upon. Keep away from him since, by Allaah, his saying which I heard will come to have great importance. So if the (other) Arabs kill him, then you will be rid of him due to the action of others, and if he conquers the Arabs, then his sovereignty is your sovereignty, his power is your power and you will be the ones fortunate with regard to him.” They said, “By Allaah, he has performed magic upon you with his tongue, O Abul-Waleed.” He said, “This is my opinion with regard to him, you may do whatever you see fit.”[21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Ishaaq reports with his chain of narration to Ibn ’Abbaas that a group of Quraysh gathered and made an offer close to the offer made by ’Utbah and his saying to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) . So he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) answered them by saying, “I am not afflicted by what you say. I have not come with that which I have come with seeking your wealth, nor seeking status above you, nor sovereignty over you, but rather Allaah has sent me as a Messenger to you, and has sent down a Book to me, and has ordered me to be a bringer of good tidings and a warner to you. So I have conveyed to you the revealed Messages from my Lord, and I have sincerely advised you. So if you accept what I have brought to you then you will have your share in this world and the Hereafter. But if you refuse to accept it from me then I will patiently await Allaah’s Order, until Allaah judges between me and you&#8230;”[22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) rejected the request of one of the tribes that they should be in charge of the affairs after his death, if the report is authentic. Ibn Ishaaq said that az-Zuhree narrated to me that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) came to Banoo ’Aamir ibn Sa’sa’ah and called them to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and presented himself to them. So a man from them called Bayharah ibn Firaas said, “By Allaah, if I were to take hold of this young man from Quraysh I would devour the Arabs with him,” then he said, “If we give you our pledge of allegiance upon your affair, then Allaah gives you victory over those who oppose you, then will we be in authority after you?” He said, “The affair is for Allaah, He places authority wherever He wills.” So he said to him, “Are we to risk our necks before the Arabs for you, then when Allaah grants you victory, authority will be for other than us?! We have no need of your affair.” So they rejected him.[23]</p>

Aboo Haatim ar-Raazee (d.277 H) &amp; Aboo Zur`ah ar-Raazee (d.264 H) (rahimahumallaah)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Notes by Saalih ibn `Uthmaan ibn` Abdil-Hameed al-Lahhaam<br />
Translated by Aboo Talhah Daawood ibn Ronald Burbank</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>To proceed,</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">Then this is the Creed of outstanding Imaams from the imaams of the Muslims. I present it to the Muslims so that they should be aware of their creed, and the creed of their predecessors; and recognise its easiness, and how the Predecessors (as-Salaf) adhered to it and defended it: so that they should also be like them in defending it, and in adhering to it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">I present it in this form [1] so that it can be kept close to you, so that it can be read repeatedly and referred to, and so memorised, and so that understanding of it and application of it settles in the heart, with Aid from Allaah alone.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">The book has previously been printed in the Journal of al-Jaami`atus-Salafiyyah, in the year 1413 H; and it was likewise printed within the book &#8220;Sharh Usool I`tiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah&#8221; of al-Laalikaa·ee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">There are two photocopies of it in the library of the Islamic University of al-Madeenatun-Nabawiyyah, which are copies of two manuscripts found in the Zaahiriyyah Library -may Allaah protect it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">I have not mentioned the variations between the manuscripts, since there is no need for that, and I have sufficed with adding brief notes. I hope that Allaah causes them to be upon correctness, and that He grants me acceptance in a fine manner, and likewise my parents, my family, my wife, and my son `Ukkaashah &#8211; Aameen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">Written by Aboo `Ukkaashah in `Ammaan, in the forenoon of Sunday the 19th of Jumaadal-Aakhirah in the year 1413 H.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Foundation Of The Sunnah And The Creed Of The Religion</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (i.e. `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Abee Haatim)[2] said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked my father and Aboo Zur`ah -radiyallaahu `anhumaa- about the positions of the Ahlus-Sunnah (the People of the Sunnah) regarding the fundamentals of the Religion, and what they found the scholars upon in all of the cities, and what they held as their creed in that regard, so they both said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We found the scholars in all of the cities: in the Hijaaz, in `Iraaq, in Egypt, in Shaam, in Yemen, so it was from their position that [3]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Eemaan (true Faith) is speech and action, it increases and decreases</strong> </span>[4];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the Qur&#8217;aan is the Speech of Allaah, it is not created, in all its aspects</strong></span> [5];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And Predecree, its good and its bad, is from Allaah (the Mighty and Majestic) </strong></span>[6];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the best one of this nation, after its Prophet -`alaihis-Salaam- is Aboo Bakr as-Siddeeq, then `Umar ibn al-Khattaab, then `Uthmaan ibn `Affaan, then `Alee ibn Abee Taalib -radiyallaahu `anhum</strong></span> [7]; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>and they are the rightly-guided, orthodox Caliphs</strong></span> [8];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that the ten whom Allaah&#8221;s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم mentioned by name, and for whom he bore witness that they will be in Paradise, are just as Allaah&#8221;s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم bore witness to, and his saying is the truth [9];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And to supplicate for mercy upon all of the companions of Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم , and upon his true followers, and to withhold from whatever occurred between them [10];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And that Allaah is (upon His Throne),</strong></span>[11] <strong><span style="color:#000000;">separate from His creation, just as He described Himself in His Book and upon the tongue of His Messenger, without describing how. He encompassed everything with Knowledge:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ ۖ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ</strong>   [12</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[ Meaning: There is nothing like Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.]] [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And Allaah -the Exalted and Most High- will be seen in the Hereafter; (and) the inhabitants of Paradise will see Him with their eyes, and they will hear His Speech, however He wishes, and just as He wishes</strong> </span>[14];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And Paradise is true, and the Fire is true, and they are both already created: they will never come to an end. So Paradise is a reward for His beloved and obedient servants; and the Fire is a punishment for those who are disobedient to Him, except for those whom Allaah -the Mighty and Majestic- has mercy upon</strong></span> [15];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the Siraat is true</strong></span> [16];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the Balance (al-Meezaan) -which has two balance-plates, upon which the deeds of the servants will be weighed: the good and the bad- is true</strong></span> [17];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">And the Vast Reservoir (al-Hawd) which our Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم has been honoured with is true;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">And the Intercession (ash-Shafaa`ah) is true</span> </strong>[18];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And that some people, from the people of Tawheed, will come out from the Fire through intercession, is true;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the punishment of the grave (`Adhaabul-Qabr) is true; and Munkar and Nakeer are true; and the noble Angels who write down deeds (al-Kiraamul-Kaatiboon) are true</strong></span> [19];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the Resurrection (al-Ba`th) after death is true;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And those guilty of major sins (Ahlul-Kabaa&#8217;ir) are under the Will of Allaah -the Mighty and Majestic; and we do not declare the people of the Qiblah to be Disbelievers on account of their sins, and we entrust their secrets to Allaah -the Mighty and Majestic</strong></span> [20];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">And we establish the obligation of the Jihaad and the Hajj along with the rulers of the Muslims in every age and time; and we do not hold rebelling against the rulers (nor fighting in time of discord)</span></strong>[21];<strong><span style="color:#000000;"> and we hear and obey whomever Allaah -the Mighty and Majestic- places in charge of our affair, and we do not remove our hand from obedience; and we follow the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah, and we avoid isolation, differing, and splitting;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And that Jihaad continues, from the time when Allaah -the Mighty and Majestic- sent His Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم until the establishment of the Hour, along with those in authority over affairs from the rulers of the Muslims, nothing abolishes it</strong></span> [22];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the same is the case with the Hajj; and the charity due upon cattle is to be handed over to those in authority from the rulers of the Muslims ;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the people are treated as Believers with regard to their rulings and their inheritance, but it is not known what their actual condition with Allaah -the Mighty and Majestic- is</strong> </span>[23];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever says that he is a true Believer, then he is an innovator;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whoever says that he is a Believer according to Allaah, then he is one of the liars;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whoever says: I am indeed a Believer in Allaah, then he is correct;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the Murji·ah are innovators, astray</strong></span> [24];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the Qadariyyah are innovators, astray; so whoever from them denies that Allaah -the Mighty and Majestic- knows whatever will occur, before it exists, then he is a Disbeliever</strong></span> [25];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the Jahmiyyah are Disbelievers</strong></span> [26];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the Raafidah have rejected Islaam</strong> </span>[27];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the Khawaarij are renegades</strong></span> [28];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And whoever claims that the Qur&#8217;aan is a created thing, then he is a Disbeliever in Allaah -the Tremendous, guilty of Disbelief which takes him out of the Religion; and whoever doubts about his being a Disbeliever, from those who have understanding, then he is a Disbeliever</strong> </span>[29];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And whoever doubts regarding the Speech of Allaah -the Mighty and Majestic, and so withholds concerning it, doubting, and saying: &#8221; I do not know whether it is created or not created&#8221;, then he is a Jahmee</strong> </span>[30];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And whoever withholds regarding the Qur&#8217;aan out of ignorance, then he is to be taught, and he is declared to be guilty of innovation, but he is not declared to be a Disbeliever;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And whoever says: &#8220;My recital of the Qur&#8217;aan is created&#8221;, then he is a Jahmee; or: &#8220;The Qur&#8217;aan with my recitation is created&#8221;, then he is a Jahmee;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Muhammad said: And I heard my father say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the sign of the People of Innovations (Ahlul-Bida` ) is that they speak ill of the People of the Narrations (Ahlul-Athar)</strong></span>[31];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the sign of the outright heretics (az-Zanaadiqah) is that they call the People of the Narrations (the Sunnah): &#8220;Rabble who fill their works with worthless speech&#8221; (hashawiyyah) : desiring by that to abolish the narrations</strong> </span>[32];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the sign of the Jahmiyyah is that they call the People of the Sunnah: &#8220;Anthropomorphists&#8221; (mushabbihah), (and &#8220;New shoots that have recently arisen&#8221;);</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the sign of the Qadariyyah is that they call the People of the Narrations: &#8220;Deniers of Free-Will&#8221; (&#8220;mujbirah&#8221;);</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the sign of the Murji&#8217;ah is that they call the People of the Sunnah: &#8220;Opposers&#8221; and &#8220;Reductionists&#8221;;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the sign of the Raafidah is that they call the People of the Sunnah: &#8220;Naasibah&#8221;</strong> </span>[33];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And all [34] of this is [said] (on account of their being fanatical groups)[35], but no name can apply to the People of the Sunnah except for a single name, and it is impossible for all of these names to unite upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Muhammad narrated to us, saying: And I heard my father and Aboo Zur`ah both commanding boycotting of the people of deviation and innovations [36]; and they were both extremely stern (in what they held)[37] regarding that;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they both criticized the writing of books of opinions, without narrations;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they both forbade sitting with the people of theological rhetoric (Ahlul-Kalaam), and looking into the books of the people of theological rhetoric; and they both used to say: a person of theological rhetoric will never prosper.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Muhammad said: And it is the saying that I hold;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Aboo `Alee ibn Habash al-Muqri· said: And it is the saying that I hold;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Shaikh Ibn al-Muzaffar said: And it is the saying that I hold;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And our Shaikh -meaning the author (i.e. al-Laalikaa·ee) said: And it is the saying that I hold;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And our Shaikh as-Silafee said: And it is the saying that I hold.[38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[The end of the Creed of the Religion]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] The Arabic version was printed as a small, pocket sized booklet (transl.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] He is Aboo Muhammad `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Abee Haatim ar-Raazee (d.327 H) -rahimahullaah. (transl.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] This shows that the issues which follow are the `Aqeedah (Creed and Belief) of the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah, and that whoever opposes anything from them has deviated away from the Ahlus-Sunnah -in accordance with the extent of his opposition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Eemaan (true Faith) is affirmation and compliance; and it is affirmation of the heart, and speech of the tongue, and action of the heart and the tongue and the limbs -in compliance with the regulations of Islaam; and Eemaan can increase; and everything which is open to increase is even more open to decrease.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Meaning that which is found in the written copy of the Qur·aan (mus-haf), and that which the reciters recite; that which Jibreel brought down, having heard it from the Speech of the Lord -the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] And this does not contradict having correct manners with respect to Allaah when calamities occur, as was practised by Ibraaheem -`alaihis-Salaam- with our Lord:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَإِذَا مَرِضْتُ فَهُوَ يَشْفِينِ</strong><br />
[Sooratush-Shu`araa· (26):80] [[ Meaning: And when I become ill He cures me.]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] So we love and ally ourselves to those who love and ally themselves to them, and we free and disassociate ourselves from those who disassociate themselves from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] And joined with them is al-Hasan ibn `Alee ibn Abee Taalib; and this was the saying of Ibn Jareer [at-Tabaree].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] And the same is the case with all of the Companions, and with all of those for whom Allaah‟s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم bore witness that they will be in Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] And to seek forgiveness for them and for the Believers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> رَبَّنَا اغْفِرْ لَنَا وَلِإِخْوَانِنَا الَّذِينَ سَبَقُونَا بِالْإِيمَانِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Sooratul-Hashr (59):10] [[ Meaning: O our Lord! Forgive us, and forgive our brothers who preceded us upon Eemaan]] . And disassociating oneself from them is a denial of the witness given by the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم that they will be in Paradise; and Aboo Zur`ah said: “If you see a man speaking ill of the Companions of Allaah‟s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم then know that he is an outright heretic (zindeeq). That is because the Messenger is, with us, true; and the Qur·aan is true; and this Qur·aan and these sunnahs were only conveyed to us by the Companions of Allaah‟s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم ; so all that those people intend is to destroy the credibility of our witnesses, so that they can abolish the Book and the Sunnah; whereas destruction of credibility is more appropriate for them, and they are outright heretics.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] An addition from the text in „Sharh Usool I`tiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah‟ (1/177) of al-Laalikaa·ee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] Sooratush-Shooraa (42):11.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] Apart, separate from His creation. So He -the Perfect- is not in every place, and the Salaf affirmed the word „baa·in‟ (separate).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] So whoever denies it in this world will be deprived of it in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] Meaning these two are already created now; and it contains an affirmation that one guilty of major sins does not become a Disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16] i.e. the Bridge [finer than a hair, and sharper than a sword, passing over the Hell-Fire].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17] Refer to „Sharhut-Tahaawiyyah‟ (1/417).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18] It is of different types, and the most important of them is the intercession for those guilty of major sins (Ahlul-Kabaa·ir), since this is the main point of disagreement with the Mu`tazilah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19] Punishment of the grave is mutawaatir [something reported by such a large number of narrators at every level of its transmission that it is impossible for them to have made it up] with regard to its meaning; and concerning Munkar and Nakeer, he صلى الله عليه وسلم said: &lt;&lt; When one of you -or (he said): a person- is placed in his grave, two black, blue Angels come to him. One is called al-Munkar, and the other is called an-Nakeer.&gt;&gt; Reported by at-Tirmidhee [„Hasan‟: at-Tirmidhee, no.1071]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20] And this matter is connected to the Intercession, since denial of the Intercession is based upon declaring one who is guilty of major sin, and who does not repent, to be aDisbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[21] An addition occurring in „Sharh Usoolil-I`tiqaad’ (1/177) of al-Laalikaa·ee , and in the manuscript (transl.).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[22] The scholars have continued giving verdicts that Jihaad is to be performed along with those in authority from the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[23] This is the principle of Islaam. So having suspicion regarding ones own self is more likely to incite it to perform deeds; but having suspicion about the rest of the people is to hold a saying without knowledge, and it does not produce any fruit, nor does it result in good deeds, and the rest of the people are then looked down upon by him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[24] The Murji·ah are those who say that Eemaan is just speech and belief, and that action does not enter into it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[25] And this is the argument that is to be used against them, and that Allaah is the Creator of the good and the evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[26] And they and the Mu`tazilah are equal, because of their saying that the Qur·aan is a created thing, and other innovations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[27] They are the ones who are now known as the „Shee`ah‟, and they are Baatiniyyah [those who claim that Islaam has an apparent aspect, which is for the common folk, and a hidden reality known only to the chosen elite: (transl.)]: their intent is to undermine and demolish Islaam from within.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[28] And they are upon performing more worship, and establishment of the duties of the Religion, however this is founded upon ignorance and hastiness; and upon on only giving importance to their own opinions, and looking down upon others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[29] That is because it is the Speech of Allaah, and His Speech -He the Most High- is from His Knowledge; and His Speech and His Knowledge are not created things; and it consists of Letters (Harf), and a Voice (Sawt) that is heard, which He speaks with, in accordance with the Will of Allaah alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[30] The saying of those who doubt (ash-Shaakkah), and those who withhold (al-Waaqifah), and those who declare that what they recite is created (al-Lafziyyah), is a pathway leading to the saying that it is created; and means to an end have the same ruling as the end results.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[31] Just as Satan now incites the Muslims to speak ill of the People of the Sunnah, in order to distance the people from them; such as their reviling the honour of the Imaams of Hadeeth, and its eminent persons of the present times, and of past times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[32] Refer to &#8220;Fadl `Ilmis-Salaf&#8221;(&#8220;The Excellence of the Knowledge of the Salaf&#8221; [: by al-Haafiz Ibn Rajab]) (pp.43,67), and reflect upon the underlying reason why they speak ill of the People of the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[33] Those who have enmity towards `Alee -radiyallaahu `anhu, and the family of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم (transl.).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[34] This is what occurs the manuscript, and see &#8220;`Aqeedatus-Salaf As-haabil-Hadeeth&#8221; (p.119) of Imaam Aboo `Uthmaan as-Saaboonee (transl.).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[35] An addition from the manuscript (transl.).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[36] And this is a crucial fundamental principle, &#8230; .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[37] An addition from the manuscript (transl.).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[38] And it is the saying that I hold. [And it is the saying that I hold (:transl.).]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>وَلَيَالٍ عَشْرٍ</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>AND BY THE TEN NIGHTS</strong><br />
[[Meaning: And by the ten nights.]] Sooratul-Fajr (89):2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>AS-SA’DEE:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He swore an oath after it by the ten nights; and they are, upon the correct saying, the [last] ten nights of Ramadaan, or the [first] ten of Dhul-Hijjah, since they are nights which comprise virtuous days; and such acts of worship and devotion occur in them as do not occur in other than them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in the [last] ten nights of Ramadaan Laylatul-Qadr (the Night of Decree) occurs, which is better than a thousand months; and in their days the fasting at the end of Ramadaan occurs, which is one of the pillars of Islam. And in the [first] ten days of Dhul-Hijjah there occurs the standing in ‘Arafah, wherein Allah forgives His servants with forgiveness that causes Satan to grieve.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Satan is never seen to be more humiliated and rejected then he is on the day ‘Arafah, because of what he sees from the descending of the Angels and mercy from Allah upon His servants; and many of the actions of the Hajj, and the ‘Umrah occur in them, and these are matters greatly honoured, and are deserving that Allah should swear an oath by them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">*</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>AT-TABAREE:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The people of explanation disagree about which ten nights these are. So some of them said: They are the ten nights of Dhul-Hijjah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">… Ibn ‘Abbas said: “The ten nights which Allah swore an oath by are the first ten nights of Dhul-Hijjah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">… ‘Ikrimah said: “The ten of Dhul-Hijjah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">… Mujaahid said regarding the saying of Allah-the Mighty and Majestic: وَلَيَالٍ عَشْرٍ : “The ten of Dhul-Hijjah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">… Qataadah said: “It used to be narrated to us that they are the ten of al-Adhaa.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">… Ibn Zayd said: “The first ones of Dhul-Hijjah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas others said: They are the ten (nights) at the beginning of Ramadaan. However what is the correct saying in that regard in our view is that they are the ten of al-Adhaa, because of the consensus of the evidence from the people of explanation upon it…”</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">*</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>‘ABDUR-RAZZAAQ</strong> </span>said in his ‘Tafseer’: “From Ma’mar: from Qataadah, regarding His Saying: <strong>وَلَيَالٍ عَشْرٍ : </strong>&#8220;The first ten of Dhul-Hijjah: (Allah made them the completion for Moosaa)’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">… Masrooq said: “They are the best of the days of the year.”</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">*</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>IBN KATHEER:</strong></span> “What is meant by the ten nights is the ten of Dhul-Hijjah, as was said by Ibn ‘Abbaas, Ibn az-Zubayr, Mujaahid, and a number of the Salaf and the later people; and it is established in the ‘Saheeh’ of al-Bukharee [no.969] traced back to the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم: &lt;&lt;There are no days wherein righteous action is more beloved to Allaah than these days&gt;&gt; &#8211; meaning the ten of Dhul-Hijjah. They said: “Not even Jihaad in Allah’s cause?” He said: &lt;&lt;Not even Jihaad in Allah’s cause, except for a man who goes out with his person and his wealth, and then he did not return with anything from that.&gt;&gt; And it is said: what is meant by that is the first ten of Muharram. Aboo Ja’far ibn Jareer quoted it, but he did not ascribe it to anyone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Aboo Kudaymah narrated from Qaaboos ibn Abee Zabyaan: from his father: from Ibn ‘Abbaas that he said concerning <strong>وَلَيَالٍ عَشْرٍ</strong> : It is the first ten of Ramadaan”, but what is correct is the first saying…”</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">*</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>ASH-SHAWKAANEE:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“They are the ten of Dhul-Hijjah upon the saying of the majority of the people of Tafseer…”</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">*</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Shaikh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen</strong></span> said in his ‘Tafseer Juz· ‘Amma’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is said that what is meant by <strong>وَلَيَالٍ عَشْرٍ</strong> is the ten of Dhul-Hijjah; and the days are referred to as ‘nights’ since the Arabic language is vast. So ‘nights’ may be mentioned when what is actually meant is the days; and ‘days’ can mean ‘nights’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is otherwise said that <strong>وَلَيَالٍ عَشْرٍ</strong> means the last ten nights of Ramadaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for upon the first (saying): those who say that what is meant by the ten nights is the ten of Dhul-Hijjah, then this is because the ten days of Dhul-Hijjah are virtuous days concerning which the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم said: &lt;&lt;There are no days wherein righteous action is more beloved to Allah than these ten days&gt;&gt; They said: “Not even Jihaad in Allah’s cause?” He said: &lt;&lt;Not even Jihaad in Allah’s cause, except for a man who went out with his person and his wealth, and then he did not return from that with anything.&gt;&gt; [Reported by al-Bukhaaree (no.969).]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who said that what is meant by the ten nights is the last ten nights of Ramadaan, then they said: the basic principle regarding ‘<em>layaalee</em>’ (nights) is that it refers to nights, and not to days; and they said: the last ten nights of Ramadaan contain the Night of Decree (Laylatul-Qadr), concerning which Allaah said :</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> <strong>خَيْرٌ مِّنْ أَلْفِ شَهْرٍ<br />
</strong>[Sooratul-Qadr (97):3]</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[[Meaning: It is better than a thousand months]]; and He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَاهُ فِي لَيْلَةٍ مُّبَارَكَةٍ ۚ إِنَّا كُنَّا مُنذِرِينَ</strong><br />
<strong>فِيهَا يُفْرَقُ كُلُّ أَمْرٍ حَكِيمٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[Sooratud-Dukhaan (44): 3-4]<br />
[[Meaning: Indeed We sent the Qur·aan down on a blessed night. Indeed We are warning Our creation. Within it every ordained affair is decreed]];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and this saying is stronger than the first saying, even though the first saying is the saying of the majority.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the wording does not support the saying of the majority; rather it strengthens the second saying, that it is the last ten nights of Ramadaan; and Allah swore an oath by them because of their eminence, and because they contain the Night of Decree; and because with them the Muslims conclude the month of Ramadaan, which is the time of one of the obligatory duties of Islaam, and one of the pillars of Islaam. So therefore Allah swore an oath by these nights.&gt;&gt;</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">All praise is for Allaah. We praise Him, we seek His aid, and we ask for His forgiveness. We seek Allaah&#8217;s refuge from the evils of ourselves and from our evil actions. Whomsoever Allaah guides then none can misguide him, and whomsoever Allaah misguides then none can guide him. I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone, having no partner, and I testify that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger. To proceed:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">Then it was suggested to me that I should undertake an abridgement of my book, <em><strong>Sifat Salaatin-Nabiyy صلى الله عليه وسلم minat-Takbeer ilat-Tasleem Ka&#8217;annaka Taraahaa</strong></em>, “<em><strong>A Description of the Prophet&#8217;s صلى الله عليه وسلم Prayer from the Takbeer to the Tasleem as if You Were Seeing It</strong></em>,” and that I should shorten it and rephrase it for it to be more accessible to the common people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">So I saw this to be a favorable suggestion, and it agreed with what I myself had felt for a long time. I had also frequently heard such advice from brothers and friends. So this encouraged me to allocate to it a small part of my time which is crowded with knowledge related work and research. So I hastened, as far as my ability and efforts allowed, to carry out the suggestion, whilst asking the Guardian Lord, the One free of all imperfections and the Most High, that He should make it an action done purely and sincerely for His Face, and that He should cause it to be of benefit to my brother Muslims.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">In it I have quoted some extra points of benefit additional to what is to be found in Sifatus-Salaat. These were matters that came to my attention and I saw that it would be appropriate to mention them in the abridgement.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">I also gave particular attention to explaining some phrases occurring in some of the ahaadeeth and the adhkaar (words of remembrance of Allaah). I also provided major headings for each section, and also sub-headings for further clarification. Under these I quoted the points under discussion, numbered consecutively. Alongside each issue I quoted the ruling: whether it is a pillar (rukn) or an obligation (waajib). As for those matters about which I remained silent and did not mention a ruling, then they are from the Sunan1, and some of them carry the possibility of being declared obligatory &#8211; however stating one or the other with certainty would conflict with what is befitting from scholarly research.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">So the pillar (rukn) is that which is essential for completion of the affair that it falls within, being such that its absence necessitates that the action depending upon it is nullified. An example is the bowing (rukoo&#8217;) in the Prayer &#8211; it is a pillar of it, and if it is absent then the Prayer is nullified.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">The condition (shart) is like the pillar (rukn) except that it is something outside the action that is dependant upon it. An example is the ablution (wudoo) for the Prayer. Prayer is not correct without it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">The obligation (waajib) is that which has an established command in the Book or the Sunnah, but there is no proof that it is a pillar (rukn) or a condition (shart). One who carries it out is rewarded, and one who leaves it without valid excuse is punished. Just like it is the fard (obligation) and making a difference between the fard and the waajib is a newly invented use of terminology for which there is no proof.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">The sunnah is an action of worship that the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم continually performed, either always doing it or usually doing it, but which he did not command in a manner causing it to be an obligation. It is such that one who carries it out is rewarded, but one who leaves it out is not punished or blameworthy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">As for the hadeeth that some blind-followers mention and attribute to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, “Whoever leaves my sunnah will not receive my intercession,” then there is no basis for it from Allaah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم and whatever is not established as his صلى الله عليه وسلم saying, then it is not allowed to attribute it to him صلى الله عليه وسلم, for fear of falsely attributing something to him. As he صلى الله عليه وسلم said, “Whoever falsely quotes me as saying that which I have not said-then let him take his sitting place in the Hell-Fire.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">Then it goes without saying that in it, just as in the original work, I do not restrict myself to any particular madhhab from the four followed madhhabs. Rather in it I followed the way of the people of the hadeeth: those who adhere to acceptance of every hadeeth that is established from the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم. Because of this fact their position is stronger than the madhhabs of those besides them, and this is something witnessed to by the fair-minded people of every madhhab. Amongst those witnessing to this was Abul-Hasanaat al- Luknawee al-Hanafee who said, “How could that not be the case when they are the true inheritors of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, and are the true representatives of his Religion. May Allaah raise us up amongst them, and cause us to die whilst having love for them and whilst following their way.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">And may Allaah have mercy upon Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal who said, ‘The Religion of Muhammad is the narrations (akhbaar)’ &#8211; what a fine means for the youth are the reports (aathaar). Do not turn away desiring other then the hadeeth and its people. For opinion (ra&#8217;y) is night and the hadeeth is day. And perhaps a youth may be ignorant of where guidance lies whilst the sun has arisen and is shining brightly.&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad Naasirud-deen al-Albaanee Damascus, 26th Safar 1392AH</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>FACING THE KA&#8217;BAH (Istiqbaalul-Ka&#8217;bah)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) If you stand, O Muslim, to pray &#8211; then face the direction of the Ka&#8217;bah, wherever you are, in obligatory Prayers and optional Prayers. This is one of the pillars of the Prayer, such that the Prayer is not valid without it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) The obligation to face the direction of the Ka&#8217;bah is removed from a warrior having to pray the Fear Prayer and during severe fighting. It is also removed from one who is rendered incapable of it, such as one who is (very) ill, or one who is upon a ship, car or airplane and who fears that the Prayer time will reach its end. It is also removed from one who prays optional Prayer or the Witr Prayer upon a riding beast or vehicle. It is, however, preferable for him, if he is able, to turn it towards the Qiblah for the initial takbeer. After that it does not matter in which direction it turns.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) It is obligatory upon everyone who can actually see the Ka&#8217;bah to face it directly. As for those who cannot actually see it then they should face its direction.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE RULING CONCERNING PRAYING TOWARDS A DIRECTION OTHER THAN THAT OF THE KA&#8217;BAH BY MISTAKE</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4) If a person prays towards other than the Qiblah due to the sky being cloudy or for any reason other than that, after having tried to the best of his knowledge and ability to face the correct direction, then his Prayer will be correct and he will not have to repeat it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5) However if a person whom he holds to be reliable comes to him whilst he is praying and informs him of the correct direction, then he must immediately turn to the correct direction, and his Prayer will be correct.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>STANDING (Qiyaam)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(6) It is obligatory that the person prays standing. This is a pillar (rukn) except for:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) The one who is praying the Fear Prayer or during severe fighting. In these circumstances it is permissible for him to pray whilst riding.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) Also the one who is ill and the one who is unable to stand, he should pray sitting if he is able, or if not then whilst lying down. (iii) Also the person praying Optional (Nafl) Prayer, he may pray whilst riding or whilst sitting if he wishes, and in this case he should perform rukoo&#8217; (bowing) and sujood (prostration) by lowering his head and likewise the sick. He should lower his head further for the prostration than for the bowing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(7) It is not permissible for the person praying sitting to place something raised upon the ground to prostrate upon. Rather he should only make the movement for his prostration lower than that for his bowing, as we have already mentioned, this is what he does if he is unable to directly place his head upon the ground.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">PRAYER ON A SHIP OR AIRPLANE</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(8) It is permissible to pray the Obligatory Prayer upon a ship, and likewise in an airplane.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(9) A person may pray sitting in either of them if he fears that he will fall over.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(10) In the case of old age or bodily weakness, it is allowed for him during the standing to support himself against a pillar or with a stick.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(11) It is permissible to pray the voluntary Prayer during the night standing or even sitting without an excuse, and he can combine both of these. So he may pray and recite whilst sitting, and then shortly before the rukoo&#8217; he may stand and recite the few aayahs that remain for him whilst standing. Then he bows and prostrates, and then he does the same in the second rak&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(12) If he prays sitting, he sits with his legs crossed, or in any manner of sitting that is comfortable for him.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">PRAYER WHILST WEARING SHOES</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(13) It is allowed for him to stand in Prayer barefooted, just as it is allowed for him to pray whilst wearing shoes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(14) What is better is that he sometimes prays barefooted and sometimes prays wearing shoes, doing what is easy for him. So he should not force himself to wear them for the Prayer nor force himself to remove them. Rather if he happens to be barefooted he should pray barefooted, and if he is wearing shoes he should pray whilst wearing the shoes, unless a situation requires otherwise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(15) If he does remove his shoes then he should not place them on his right-hand side, rather he should place them to his left as long as there is nobody praying to his left. Otherwise he should place them between his feet [2]. This order is authentically reported from the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>PRAYING WHILST STANDING UPON THE PULPIT (MINBAR)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(16) It is allowed for the Imaam to pray upon an elevated place, such as the minbar &#8211; for the purpose of teaching the people. He stands upon it and says the takbeer [3] and recites and bows upon it. Then he steps backwards in order to perform the prostrations on the ground at the foot of the pulpit. Then he can return to it and do in the second rak&#8217;ah the same as that which he did in the first.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE OBLIGATION OF PRAYING TOWARDS A SUTRA (BARRIER) AND OF BEING CLOSE TO IT</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(17) It is obligatory that he prays towards a barrier (sutrah). It makes no difference whether he is praying in a mosque or elsewhere, nor whether the mosque is large or small. This is because of the all-embracing statement of the Prophet , “Do not pray except towards a sutrah, and do not let anyone walk in front o f you. So if a person insists (on trying to pass) then fight him, because he has an evil companion along with him,” meaning a devil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(18) It is obligatory that he is close to it, since the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم commanded that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(19) Between his صلى الله عليه وسلم place of prostration and the wall towards which he prayed there would be a space approximately wide enough for a sheep to pass through. So if one does likewise then he has carried out the closeness that is obligatory upon him.[4]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE REQUIRED HEIGHT OF THE SUTRAH (BARRIER)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(20) It is obligatory that the height of the sutrah above the ground be at least a span or two spans, due to his saying, “If one of you places in front of him the like of the back-part of a camel-saddle5, then let him pray and not care about what passes beyond that.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(21) The person praying faces the sutrah directly. This is what is apparent from the command to pray towards the sutrah. As for the matter of moving slightly to the right or the left, so that he does not stand directly in line with it, then this is not authentically established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(22) It is permissible to pray towards a staff stuck into the ground or its like, or towards a tree, or a pillar, or towards his wife who is lying upon the bed beneath the blanket, or towards his riding beast, even if it is a camel.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE FORBIDDANCE OF PRAYING TOWARDS GRAVES</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(23) It is not allowed to pray towards graves whatever the case, whether it be the graves of Prophets or anyone else besides them.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE FORBIDDANCE OF PASSING IN FRONT OF A PERSON WHO IS PRAYING EVEN IN THE SACRED MOSQUE IN MAKKAH (AL. MASJIDUL-HARAAM)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(24) It is not allowed to pass directly in front of a person who is praying if he has a sutrah in front of him. There is no difference in this between al-Masjidul-Haraam and other mosques. The forbiddance applies equally to all of them, due to the generality of his صلى الله عليه وسلم saying, “If the one who passes directly in front of a person knew the (sin) that was upon him, then he would rather stand and wait for forty than pass in front of him.&#8221; Meaning, passing in between him and the place of his sutrah. [6]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE OBLIGATION OF PREVENTING ANYONE TRYING TO PASS IN FRONT OF YOU, EVEN IN THE SACRED MOSQUE IN MAKAAH</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(25) It is not allowed for a person praying towards a sutrah to allow anyone to pass in front of him, due to the previous hadeeth, “&#8230; and do not let anyone walk in front of him &#8230;” and his صلى الله عليه وسلم saying, “If one of you prays towards something that screens him from the people, and someone wants to pass in front of him, then let him repel him by pushing him on the chest, and let him repel him as much as he can &#8230; [and in a narration &#8230; then let him fight him, for he is a devil].”</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">MOVING FORWARD TO PREVENT SOMEONE PASSING</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(26) And it is allowed for him to take a step or more forwards in order to prevent an animal or a child from passing in front of him, so that they pass behind him.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THAT WHICH BREAKS / DISRUPTS THE PRAYER</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(27) From the importance of the sutrah in Prayer is that it prevents the person&#8217;s Prayer being nullified by the passing of that which will disrupt it. Contrary to the one who prays without a sutrah, since his Prayer will be nullified if an adult woman, or likewise a donkey, or a black dog passes in front of him.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE INTENTION (an-Niyyah)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(28) The person who is going to pray must have in his heart the intention to pray that particular Prayer, be it the Obligatory Zuhr or &#8216;Asr Prayer, or the sunnah Prayer&#8217;s for them, for example. This is a condition (shart) or a pillar (rukn). As for expressing that upon the tongue, then it is an innovation (bid&#8217;ah), contrary to the sunnah. This was not upheld by any of the Imaams followed by the blindfollowers. THE TAKBEER (Saying: `Allaahu Akbar&#8217;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(29) He begins the Prayer by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaahu Akbar Allaah is Greater.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a pillar (rukn), due to his saying, “The key to the Prayer is Purification. That which makes outside actions forbidden is the takbeer, and that which causes outside actions to become permissible is the tasleem [7].”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(30) He should not raise his voice in saying the takbeer in any of the Prayers, unless he is an Imaam (leading others in prayer).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(31) It is allowed for the mu&#8217;adhdhin to repeat the takbeer of the Imaam in a louder voice in order for the people to hear it, as long as there is a need for that, such as the Imaam&#8217;s being ill, having a weak voice, or there being a very large number of people praying behind him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(32) The person following an Imaam in Prayer should not say the takbeer until the Imaam has finished saying it.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>RAISING THE HANDS AND HOW IT IS TO BE DONE</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(33) He should raise his hands whilst saying the takbeer or before it, or after it. All of these are established in the sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(34) He should raise his hands with the fingers extended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(35) He should raise his palms up to the level of his shoulders, and sometimes he should raise them even further, up to the level of his car lobes. [8]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>PLACING THE HANDS AND HOW IT IS TO BE DONE</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(36) Then after the takbeer he should place his right hand upon his left hand, and this is from the practice (sunnah) of the Prophets, &#8216;alaihimus-salaatu was-salaam, and Allaah&#8217;s Messenger commanded his Companions with it. It is therefore not permissible to leave the hands hanging by one&#8217;s sides.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(37) He should place his right hand upon his left hand, wrist and forearm.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(38) Sometimes he should grasp the left hand with the right hand. [9]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">WHERE THE HANDS ARE TO BE PLACED</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(39) He should only place his hands upon his chest. This applies equally to men and women. [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(40) It is not allowed to place the right-hand on the waist.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">HUMILITY AND ATTENTIVENESS (al-Khushoo’) AND LOOKING AT THE PLACE OF PROSTRATION</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(41) He must have humility and attentiveness in his Prayer, and should avoid everything that may divert his attention, whether it be designs or decoration. Nor should he pray when food that he desires has been served, nor whilst he is having to withhold urine or faeces.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(42) Whilst standing he should look towards the place of his prostration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(43) He should not turn to the right or the left, since his turning aside will be something that Satan snatches away and steals from the person&#8217;s Prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(44) It is not allowed for him to raise his sight to the sky.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">THE OPENING SUPPLICATION (Du&#8217;aa al-Istiftaah)</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(45) Then he should begin by reciting one of the supplications established from the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, and they are many. The most wellknown is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Subhaanak-Allaahumma, wa biham-dika, wa tabaarakasmuka, wa ta&#8217;aalaa jadduka, wa laa ilaaha ghayruka</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I declare You free and far removed from all imperfections, O Allaah, and all praise is for You. Blessed is Your Name. Great and Exalted is Your Kingdom. None has the right to be worshipped besides You.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The command for this is established, so one should be careful to do it. [11]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">THE RECITATION (al-Qiraa&#8217;ah)</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(46) Then he must seek refuge with Allaah, the Most High, and it is an obligation, he will be sinful if he leaves it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(47) The Sunnah is that he should sometimes say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A&#8217;oodhu billaahi min ash-Shaytaan-ir-Rajeem [min hamzihi, wa nafkhihi, wa nafthihi]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I seek refuge with Allaah from Satan, the Rejected One [from the insanity he brings about, from his arrogance and from his evil poetry].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(48) Or that he says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A&#8217;oodhu billaah-is-Samee&#8217;-il-&#8216;Aleem min ash-Shaytaan-ir-Rajeem min hamzihi, wa nafkhihi, wa nafthihi</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I seek refuge with Allaah, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing, from Satan, the Rejected One, from the insanity he brings about, from his arrogance and from his evil poetry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(49) Then he should say quietly, in both loud and silent Prayers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillaahir-Rahmaanir-Raheem</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower o f Mercy.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>RECITING SOORAH AL-FAATIHAH</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(50) Then he recites the whole of Soorah al-Faatihah, and (Bismillaah …) is an aayah from it. This is a pillar (rukn), and the Prayer will not be correct without it. So it is obligatory upon even those who do not know Arabic that they memorize it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(51) But one who is still unable to recite it, then it is sufficient for him to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Subhaan-Allaah, wal-hamdulillaah, wa laa ilaaha illallaah, wallaahu Akbar, wa laa hawla wa laa quwwata illaa billaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I declare Allaah free and far removed from all imperfections, and all praise is for Allaah, and Allaah is greater and no power except by the Will of Allah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(52) The Sunnah, when reciting it, is to read it aayah by aayah. One should pause after each aayah. So he says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillaahir-Rahmaanir-Raheem<br />
In the Name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he pauses &#8230; then he says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hamdu lillaahi Rabbil-&#8216;Aalameen<br />
All praise is for Allaah, the Lord of all the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he pauses &#8230; then he says:<br />
Ar-Rahmaan-ir-Raheem<br />
The Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he pauses &#8230; then he says:<br />
Maaliki Yawmid-Deen<br />
Owner o f the Day of Recompense.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he pauses, he does likewise until he completes it. [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The whole of the Prophet&#8217;s صلى الله عليه وسلم recitation would be like this. He would stop at the end of each aayah, and not join it together with the aayah after it, even if they were connected in meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(53) It is permissible to recite either “Maaliki” &#8230; Owner of the Day of Recompense, or “Maliki” &#8230; King of the Day of Recompense.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE RECITATION OF SOORAH AL-FAATIHAH BY ONE WHO IS PRAYING ALONG WITH AN IMAAM</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(54) It is obligatory that the one praying behind an imaam also recites it in quiet Prayers. He should also recite it in loud Prayers if he cannot hear an imaam reciting, or if it happens that the imaam remains silent after his own recitation in order to enable the follower to recite it. However, it is our view that this period of silence is not established from the Sunnah. [13]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE RECITATION AFTER SOORAH AL-FAATIHAH</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(55) It is from the Sunnah that after reciting al-Faatihah, he recites another Soorah &#8211; even in the Funeral Prayer, or that he recites some aayahs, in the first two rak&#8217;ahs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(56) He may sometimes lengthen the recitation after it and shorten it at other times, due to the needs of travel, having a cough and cold, being ill or due to the crying of a child.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(57) The length of recitation will vary according to the different Prayers. So generally, the recitation in the Dawn (Fajr) Prayer is longer than the recitation in any of the other Prayers. Next comes the Zuhr, then the &#8216;Asr and the Maghrib, then the &#8216;Ishaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(58) The recitation in the (optional) Night Prayer (Salaatul-Layl) is longer than any of those.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(59) The Sunnah is also to make the recitation in the first rak&#8217;ah longer than the recitation in the second rak&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(60) Also that he makes the recitation in the last two rak&#8217;ahs shorter than that in the first two, by about a half. [14]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>RECITING SOORAH AL-FAATIHAH IN EVERY RAK&#8217;AH</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(61) It is obligatory that he recites al-Faatihah in every rak&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(62) It is from the Sunnah that he sometimes recites something in addition to it in the last two rak&#8217;ahs also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(63) It is not allowed for the imaam to prolong the recitation more than what occurs in the Sunnah. By doing so he would cause difficulty to some of those who may be praying behind him, such as old people, sick people, nursing mothers and those who have needs to attend to.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>LOUD AND QUIET RECITATION</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(64) He should recite aloud in the Dawm (Fujr) Prayer, the Jumu&#8217;ah Prayer, the two &#8216;Eid Prayers, the Prayer for seeking rain, the Eclipse Prayer and in the first two rak&#8217;ahs of the Maghrib and &#8216;Ishaa Prayers. He should recite quietly in the Zuhr and &#8216;Asr Prayers, in the third rak&#8217;ah of the Maghrib Prayer and the last two rak&#8217;ahs of the &#8216;Ishaa Prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(65) It is permissible for the Imaam sometimes to recite an aayah loud enough to be heard by the people in the quiet Prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(66) As for the Witr Prayer and the Prayer during the night (Salaatul-Layl), then he should sometimes recite quietly in it, and recite loudly at other times. However, his voice should only be raised moderately.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>RECITING THE QUR&#8217;AAN SLOWLY (AND BEAUTFIULLY)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(67) The Sunnah is that he recites the Qur&#8217;aan slowly. He should not recite it quickly or hurriedly. Rather, his recitation should be clear and each letter distinguishable. He should also beatify the Qur&#8217;aan with his voice, and recite it in a beautiful and good manner, whilst abiding by the rulings that are well-known to scholars of recitation. He may not recite it in newly innovated tones, nor in the manner of singing.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">CORRECTING THE IMAAM</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(68) It is prescribed for the one praying behind an imaam that he corrects him if he becomes mixed up in his recitation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE BOWING (RUKOO&#8217;)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(69) When he has finished reciting he remains silent for a moment, long enough to return his breathing to normal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(70) Then he raises his hands, in the manner described previously with regard to the initial takbeer (point nos. 33, 34 and 35).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(71) He also says the takbeer (i.e., Allaahu Akbar), and this is obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(72) Then he performs the rukoo&#8217; (i.e., bows) in such a manner that all his joints are settled, and each part of the body is at rest. This is a pillar (rukn).</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">HOW THE BOWING (RUKOO&#8217;) IS PERFORMED</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(73) He should place his hands firmly upon his knees. He should spread his fingers, as if he were grasping his knees. All of this is obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(74) He should stretch out his back and make it level, such that if water were to be poured upon it, then it would settle upon it. This is an obligation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(75) He should neither cause his head to droop lower than his back, nor should he raise it above it. Rather he should make it level with his back.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(76) He should keep his elbows (straight and) apart from his sides.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(77) He should say in his rukoo&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Subhaana Rabbee al-&#8216;Azeem<br />
I declare my Lord, the Supreme, free and far removed from all imperfections. [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saying it three times, or more.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(78) From the Sunnah is that he makes the pillars of equal length. So he should make his rukoo&#8217;, his sujood (prostration), and his sitting between the two prostrations of similar length.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(79) It is not allowed for him to recite the Qur&#8217;aan in the rukoo&#8217; (bowing), nor in the sujood (prostration).</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>STRAIGHTENING UP FROM THE RUKOO&#8217;</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(80) Then he must raise up and straighten his back from the rukoo&#8217;. This is a pillar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(81) He must say, while raising his back:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Sami&#8217; Allaahu liman hamidah</span><br />
Allaah listens and responds to the one who praises Him. This is an obligation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(82) He should raise his hands when he rises up, in the manner that has preceded (point nos. 33, 34 and 35).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(83) Then he should stand straight up and remain still, such that every bone returns to its place. This is a pillar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(84) He should say while standing:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Rabbanaa wa lakal-hamd</span><br />
O our Lord! And all praise is for You.[16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is obligatory upon everyone praying, even if he is praying behind an imaam [17], since it is the saying prescribed for this standing position. As for the saying, then it is the saying prescribed to be said whilst rising.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(85) He should make this standing about as long as the rukoo&#8217; (bowing), as has preceded.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">THE SUJOOD (PROSTRATION)</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(86) Then he says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaahu Akbar<br />
Allaah is Greater.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and this is an obligation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(87) And he should raise his hands, sometimes.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">PLACING THE HANDS FIRST WHEN PROSTRATING</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(88) Then he prostrates, placing his hands upon the ground before his knees. This is what Allaah&#8217;s Messenger commanded, and it is what is established from his practice. He also forbade the people from kneeling down in the manner that the camel kneels, and the camel places its knees -which are its fore-legs &#8211; first.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(89) So when he prostrates, and it is a pillar, he should rest upon his palms, and extend together.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(90) He should keep his fingers them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(91) And point them towards the qiblah (direction of Prayer).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(92) And he should place his palms level with his shoulders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(93) And sometimes he places them level with his ears.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(94) And he must lift his elbows away from the ground. This is obligatory. He is not allowed to spread them on the ground in the manner of the dog.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(95) He must place his nose and his forehead firmly upon the ground, this is a pillar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(96) He must also place his knees firmly on the ground.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(97) And likewise his toes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(98) His feet should be placed upright on the ground. All of these are obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(99) The tips of his toes should be pointed towards the qiblah (direction of Prayer).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(100) And his heels should be joined together.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>BEING SETTLED IN THE PROSTRATION</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(101) It is obligatory that he is settled in his prostration. This comes about by his resting equally on each of the parts of the body that touch the ground when prostrating. These are: the forehead and the nose &#8211; together, the two palms, the two knees and the toes of each foot.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(102) So whoever settles in his prostration in this manner, then he has certainly attained the stillness necessary. This stillness (itmi&#8217;naan) in the prostration is a pillar also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(103) He should say in it:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Subhaana Rabbee al-A&#8217; laa</span><br />
I declare my Lord, the Most High, free and far removed from all imperfections.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">three times or more.[18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(104) It is recommended to supplicate to Allaah as much as possible while in prostration, since it is a time most suitable for the acceptance of supplications.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(105) He should make his prostration about as long as his bowing, as has preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(106) It is allowed to prostrate upon the earth, or upon something placed upon the ground such as a garment, a carpet, a mat and the like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(107) It is not allowed to recite the Qur&#8217;aan in prostration.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">SITTING UPON THE LEFT FOOT LAID FLAT (AL-IFTIRAASH) AND SITTING UPON THE RAISED HEELS (AL-IQ&#8217;AA`) IN BETWEEN THE TWO PROSTRATIONS</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(108) Then he raises up his head, saying the takbeer (i.e., Allaahu Akbar). This is an obligation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(109) He raises his hands at this point, sometimes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(110) Then he sits with calmness, such that every bone settles in its place. This is a pillar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(111) He should lay his left foot flat beneath him and sit upon it. This is an obligation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(112) He sets his right foot upright upon the ground.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(113) He should make the toes of his right foot point towards the qiblah (direction of Prayer).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(114) It is also permissible to sit upon the heels (al-Iq&#8217;aa`) sometimes. He does this by sitting upon his heels with both feet upright.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(115) He says in his sitting:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaahumma-ghfirlee, warhamnee, wajburnee, warfa&#8217;nee, wa&#8217;aafinee, warzuqnee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah forgive me, and have mercy upon me, and suffice me, and raise my rank, and grant me safety and well-being, and grant me provision.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(116) And if he wishes he may (instead) say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rabbi-ghfirlee, Rabbi-ghfirlee<br />
O my Lord, forgive me! O my Lord, forgive me!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(117) And he should prolong this sitting until it becomes of similar length to his prostration.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">THE SECOND PROSTRATION</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(118) Then he says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaahu Akbar<br />
Allaah is Greater.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and this is an obligation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(119) And he raises his hands with this takbeer, sometimes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(120) And he performs the second prostration, and this is a pillar also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(121) He does in the second prostration that which he did in the first.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">SITTING AT REST (JILSATUL-ISTIRAAHAH)</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(122) So when he raises his head up from the second prostration, and he intends to get up to perform the second rak&#8217;ah, then he says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaahu Akbar<br />
Allaah is Greater.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and this is an obligation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(123) And he raises his hands, sometimes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(124) And he (briefly) sits upright, sitting upon his left foot, such that every bone returns to its place, before standing.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">THE SECOND UNIT OF PRAYER (RAK&#8217;AH)</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(125) Then he gets up, supporting himself upon the ground with his fists clenched, like one who clenches his fists when kneading dough. So he stands up for the second rak&#8217;ah, and this is a pillar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(126) He does in the second rak&#8217;ah the same as he did in the first.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(127) Except that he does not recite, “The Opening Supplication,” (i.e., Du&#8217;aa al-Istiftaah) in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(128) He should make the second rak&#8217;ah shorter than the first rak&#8217;ah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>SITTING FOR THE DECLARATION OF FAITH (TASHAHHUD)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(129) So when he finishes the second rak&#8217;ah he sits to perform the tashahhud. This is obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(130) And he sits upon the left foot laid flat, as preceded with regard to the sitting between the two prostrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(131) However it is not allowed to sit upon the two heels for this sitting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(134) It it is not allowed for him to sit whilst resting upon his hand, especially the left hand.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>AGITATING THE FOREFINGER AND FIXING ONES SIGHT UPON IT</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(135) He should clench all the fingers of his right hand, placing his thumb onto his middle finger sometimes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(136) At other times he may make a circle with his thumb and middle finger together.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(137) He should point his forefinger towards the qiblah (Direction of Prayer).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(138) He should fix his gaze upon his forefinger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(139) And he should agitate it, making supplication with it, from the start to the end of the tashahhud.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(140) He should not point with his left forefinger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(141) He does all of this in every tashahhud.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE WORDING FOR THE TASHAHHUD AND THE SUPPLICATION AFTER IT</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(142) The tashahhud is obligatory. If he forgets it, then he should perform two extra prostrations for forgetfulness (Sajdatus-Sahw) at the end of the Prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(143) Its wording is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">At-Tahiyyaatu lillaahi, was-Salwaatu, wat-Tayyibaatu. As-Salaamu &#8216;alan-Nabee&#8217;, wa rahmatullaahi wa barakaatuh. As-Salaamu &#8216;alaynaa wa &#8216;alaa &#8216;ibaad-illaah-is-Saaliheen. Ashhadu an laa ilaaha illAllaah, wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan &#8216; abduhu wa rasooluh</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Words of Praise and glorification are for Allaah alone, and Prayers and acts of worship, and pure words and attributes. May Allaah send peace and security upon the Prophet19, and may Allaah&#8217;s Mercy and Blessings be upon him. May Allaah send peace and security upon us, and upon all of Allaah&#8217;s righteous servants. I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His Slave and Messenger.[20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(144) After this he should supplicate for blessings upon the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammad, wa &#8216;alaa Aali Muhammad, kamaa sallayta &#8216;alaa Ibraaheem, wa &#8216;alaa Aali Ibraaheem, innaka Hameedun Majeed. Allaahumma baarik &#8216;alaa Muhammad, wa &#8216;alaa Aali Muhammad, kamaa baarakta &#8216;alaa Ibraaheem, wa &#8216;alaa Aali Ibraaheem, innaka Hameedun Majeed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah! Extol and honor Muhammad and the true followers of Muhammad, just as You extolled and honored Ibraaheem and the righteous offspring of Ibraaheem. Indeed, You are deserving of all praise, Perfect in Glory and Honor. 0 Allaah! Send continual blessings upon Muhammad and upon the true followers of Muhammad, just as You sent blessings upon Ibraaheem and upon the righteous offspring of Ibraaheem. Indeed, You are deserving of all praise, Perfect in Glory and Honor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(145) And if you wish to say it in shorter form, then say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammad, wa ‘alaa Aali Muhammed, wa baarik &#8216;alaa Muhammad, wa &#8216;alaa Aal Muhammad, kamaa sallayta wa baarakta &#8216; alaa Ibraaheem wa &#8216;alaa Aali lbraaheem, innaka Hameedun Majeed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah! Extol and honor Muhammad and the true followers of Muhammad, and send continual blessings upon Muhammad and upon the true followers of Muhammad, just as You extolled and honored and sent blessings upon Ibraaheem and upon the righteous offspring of Ibraaheem. Indeed, You are deserving of all praise, Perfect in Glory and Honor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(146) Then he may choose, in this tashahhud, any of the reported supplications that please him, sand supplicate to Allaah with that.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE THIRD AND FOURTH RAK’AHS</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(147) Then he says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Allaahu Akbar</span><br />
Allaah is Greater.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and this is an obligation. The Sunnah is that he says it whilst he is sitting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(148) And he raises his hands, sometimes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(149) Then he gets up to pray the third rak&#8217;ah, and it, like the rak’ah coming after it, is a pillar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(150) He does the same when he wants to get up for the fourth rak&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(151) However before getting up, he should sit up straight, sitting upon his left foot, such that every bone returns to its place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(152) Then he stands by supporting himself upon his hands, just as he did in getting up for the second rak&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(153) In each of the third and fourth rak&#8217;ahs he recites Soorah al- Faatihah, and this is obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(154) Sometimes he may also recite an aayah or more in addition to it.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>AL-QUNOOT (SPECIAL INVOCATION) FOR A CALAMITY AND WHEN IT IS TO BE SAID</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(155) It is from the Sunnah that he performs a special invocation, and supplicates for the Muslims when some calamity strikes them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(156) It is to be said after the bowing (rukoo&#8217;), after he has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Rabbanaa wa lakal-hamd</span></strong><br />
O our Lord! And all praise is for You.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(157) There is no set supplication for this; rather he makes whatever supplication is suited to the specific calamity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(158) He should raise his hands whilst making this supplication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(159) If he is an imaam leading the people in Prayer, he should raise his voice with his supplication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(160) Those who are praying behind him should say `Aameen,&#8217; meaning, `O Allaah, respond to it!&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(161) So when he finishes it he should say the takbeer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaahu Akbar</strong></span><br />
Allaah is Greater.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and perform the prostration.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE QUNOOT (INVOCATION) IN THE WITR PRAYER21 ITS PLACE AND WORDING</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(162) As for the invocation (qunoot) for the Witr Prayer, then it is prescribed to say it occasionally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(163) It should be said before the rukoo&#8217;, contrary to the invocation at the time of a calamity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(164) He should make the following supplication:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Allaahum-mahdinee feeman hadayta, wa &#8216; aafinee feeman &#8216; aafayta, wa tawallanee feeman tawallayta, wa baarik lee feemaa a&#8217;tayta, wa qinee sharra maa qadayta, fa innaka taqdee wa laa yuqdaa &#8216;alayka. Wa innahu laa yadhillu man waalayta, wa laa ya&#8217;izzu man &#8216; aadayta. Tabaaraakta rabbanaa wa ta&#8217;aalayta. Laa manjaa minka illaa ilayka</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah! Continually guide me and make me amongst those whom You have guided, and make me one of those whom You save and secure from all evils. And make me one of those whom You love, and whose affairs You take care of. And grant me blessing in all that You have given me, and save me from the evil of what You have decreed, for You alone decree, and none can contradict Your Decree. None can humiliate those whom You have befriended, nor will those who are enemies of You ever have dignity and honor. Blessed are You, O our Lord, and Exalted. There is no way to flee for safety from You except by fleeing towards You.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(165) Then he should perform the bowing (rukoo&#8217;) and the two prostrations (sujood), as has proceeded.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE FINAL TASHAHHUD AND SITTING WITH ONE&#8217;S LEFT HIP RESTING UPON THE GROUND (AT-TAWARRUK)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(166) Then he should sit for the final tashahhud, and both are obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(167) He should do in it what he did in the first tashahhud.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(168) Except that in it he sits with his left hip resting upon the ground, and with both his feet on his right-side. He places his left foot beneath his right shin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(169) His right foot should be placed upright upon the ground.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(170) And it is allowed to lay it down flat, sometimes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(171) He should lean heavily upon his left knee with his palm,<br />
supporting himself in that manner.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE OBLIGATION OF SUPPLICATING FOR BLESSINGS UPON THE PROPHET (AS-SALAATU &#8216;ALAN-NABEE AND OF SEEKING ALLAAH&#8217;S REFUGE FROM FOUR THINGS</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(172) It is obligatory that he supplicates for blessings upon the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم in this tashahhud, and we have mentioned some wordings for this in the section on the first tashahhud (point nos. 145 and 146).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(173) He must seek Allaah&#8217;s refuge from four things, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Allaahumma innee a&#8217;oodhu bika min &#8216; adhaabi jahannam, wa min &#8216; adhaabil-qabr, wa min fitnatil-mahyaa wal-mamaat, wa min sharri fitnatil-maseehid-Dajjaal</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah! I seek refuge with You from the punishment of Hell-Fire, and from the Punishment of the Grave, and from the Trials of Living and Dying, and from the Evil Trials of the False Messiah (Dajjaal). [22]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>SUPPLICATING (DU&#8217;AA) BEFORE THE SALUTATION (SALAAM)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(174) Then he may supplicate for himself with whatever supplication he wishes from the supplications established in the Book and the Sunnah. There are very many, so if he has not memorised anything from them, then he may supplicate with whatever du&#8217;aa is easy for him, from that which will benefit him in his Religion or his worldly life.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE SALUTATION (AT-TASLEEM) AND ITS TYPES</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(175) Then he should give salutations to his right side, and this is a pillar, turning his face such that the whiteness of his right cheek can be seen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(176) He then gives salutations to his left side, turning his face such that the whiteness of his left cheek can be seen, even if it is the Funeral Prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(177) The imaam leading others in Prayer, should raise his voice with the salutation except when performing the Funeral Prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(178) There are a number of ways of giving the salutations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) To say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">As-Salaamu &#8216;alaykum wa rahmatullaahi wa barakaatuh</span><br />
May Allaah grant you peace and security, and may His Mercy and<br />
Blessings be upon You.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">to his right, and:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">As-Salaamu &#8216;alaykum wa rahmatullaah</span><br />
May Allaah grant you peace and security, and may His Mercy be upon you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">to his left.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) To say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">As-Salaamu &#8216;alaykum wa rahmatullaah</span><br />
May Allaah grant you peace and security, and may His Mercy be upon you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">to his right and left.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(c) To say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">As-Salaamu &#8216;alaykum wa rahmatullaah</span><br />
May Allaah grant you peace and security, and may His Mercy be upon you.<br />
to his right and:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">As-Salaamu &#8216;alaykum</span><br />
May Allaah grant you peace and security.<br />
to his left.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(d) To give a single salutation facing forwards, and turning slightly to the right, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">As-Salaamu &#8216;alaykum</span><br />
May Allaah grant you peace and security.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brother Muslim! This is what I have been able to do with regard to “The Abridgement of the Prophet&#8217;s صلى الله عليه وسلم Prayer Described.” I have striven to make it easily understandable, so that it should be clear to you and so that you may picture it as if you were seeing it with your (own) eyes. So if you perform the Prayer in the manner that I have described to you, from the Prayer of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, then I hope that Allaah, the Most High, will accept it from you, because in that case you will be putting into practice the saying of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, “<strong>Pray as you have seen me praying</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then along with this it is upon you that you do not forget the importance to be given to praying with an attentive heart, and to praying with humility and submissiveness (khushoo&#8217;), since this is the major goal of the servant&#8217;s standing before Allaah, the Most High, in Prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in accordance with the level of your fulfillment of what I have described to you, concerning humility, attentiveness and adherence to the manner in which the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم prayed, will be your attainment of the desired fruit indicated by our Lord, the Blessed and Most High, in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Indeed, the Prayer prevents immorality and sin”</strong></span> [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in conclusion I ask Allaah, the Most High, that He accepts our prayers, and the rest of our actions, and that He saves the reward of them for us on that Day when we shall meet Him &#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Day when neither wealth nor sons will avail &#8211; except one who meets Allaah with a heart free of associating anything in worship with Him.” [24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And all praise is for Allaah, the Lord and Sustainer of all creation.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Footnotes:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Sunan: pl. of sunnah, referring here to recommended actions established from the practice of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم [Trans. Note]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] I say: This contains a subtle indication that he should not place them in front of him. This is an etiquette that is disregarded by the majority of those who pray, since you see them praying towards their shoes!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] i.e., `Allaahu Akbar,&#8217; meaning, `Allaah is greater.&#8217; [Trans. Note]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] I say: We know from this that what the Muslims do in all mosques that I have seen in Syria and elsewhere with regard to praying in the middle of the mosque, far away from any wall or pillar, is nothing but negligence of the command and the practice of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Mu&#8217;khiratur-Rahl: It is the piece of wood placed at the back of the saddle, so the hadeeth contains an indication that it is not sufficient to use a line upon the ground. The hadeeth allowing that is not authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] As for the hadeeth that he صلى الله عليه وسلم prayed at the outer edge of the area for tawaaf without any sutrah and the people were passing in front of him, then this is not authentic. Furthermore, it does not mention that they were passing between him and his place of prostration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] i.e., the saying of, `As-salaamu &#8216;alaikum wa rahmatullaah &#8230;&#8217; to complete the Prayer</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] I say: As for actually touching the earlobes with the thumb then there is no basis for this in the Sunnah. Rather in my view it is something that incites misgivings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] As for the practice of combining both placing and grasping at one and the same time, as some late-comers hold to he good, then there is no basis for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] I say: The placing of the hands anywhere else but the chesr is either inauthentic (da’eef). Or has no basis</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] Whoever wishes to see the rest of the opening supplications then let him refer to Sifatus-Salaat, pp. 14-19 of the translation</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] The whole of Soorah al-Faatihah can be seen in Appendix One</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] I say: I have mentioned the evidence used by those who support it, along with its rebuttal in Silsilatul-Ahaadeethid-Da&#8217;eefah, nos. 546 and 547</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] For the details of this chapter, refer, if you wish, to Sifatus-Salaat, (pp. 25-39 of the translation).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] There are other sayings that can be said with this pillar (rukn). Some are long, some are medium length and some are short. Refer to Sifatus-Salaat, Eng. transl. pp. 44-46</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16] There are other sayings that can be said here. Refer to Sifatus-Salaat, (Eng. transl. pp. 47-50).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17] It is not prescribed to place one hand upon the other during this standing, since that is not reported. If you wish you may see further discussion of this in Sifatus-Salaat (Eng. transl. pp. 50-51).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18] There are other sayings that can be said in it, and you can refer to them in, Sifatus- Salaat, Eng. Transl., pp. 55-57</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19] This is what it is prescribed to say after the death of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and this wording is established in the tashahhud of Ibn Mas&#8217;ood, &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah, Ibn az-Zubayr and Ibn &#8216;Abbaas. So whoever wishes may refer to my book Sifatus-Salaat, (Eng. transl. p. 68).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20] I have mentioned other wordings of the tashahhud in my book (Eng. transl. pp. 67-70), and that which I have mentioned here is the most authentic</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[21] Witr: the odd-numbered rak&#8217;ah(s) said at the end of the (optional) Night Prayer</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[22] The ‘Trials of Living …’ are that which a person encounters in life with regard to being enticed by the worldly life and the desires to which it gives rise. The ‘Trials of dying &#8230;’ are the trials of the grave, and the questioning by the two Angels. And the ‘Trials of the False Messiah (Dajjaal) &#8230;’ are the supernatural occurrences that will happen at his hands; things that will lead many people to go astray, to follow him and accept his claim to divinity</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[23] Soorah al-Ankaboot (29):45</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[24] Soorah ash-Shu&#8217;araa (26):88-81)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Uthman ibn ‘Affaan, al- Hasan ibn ‘Alee, Anas ibn Maalik, al-Hasan al-Basree, Ibn Seereen, ‘Alqamah, al-Aswad, Masrooq, ad-Dahhaak, ‘Abdullaah ibn al Haarith, Abu Ya’laa, Abul Ahwas, Ash-Sha’bee, Ath-Thawree, Ishaaq, Ibn ‘Umar in a narration, and Abu Hanifah, Maalik, Ahmad, and the Shafi’ee Madhhab in one saying, all say that &#8211;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is permissible after both wudoo and ghusl to dry the body-parts</strong></span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And their evidence is what ‘Aa’ishah (radhiAllaahu ‘anhaa) reports – she said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Rasoolullah (sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) had a cloth which he used to dry himself with after making wudoo . </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by at-Tirmidhee who declared it to be da’eef]. Then al Ainee states that an-Nasaa’ee records it in ‘al-Kunaa’ with saheeh isnaad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: And it has other narrations which support and strengthen it. (See Fiqh al-Imam Sa’eed, 1/70). Al-Albaanee declares the hadeeth to be hasan. (Saheeh ul Jaami’, 4706).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">65. Salmaan al-Faarsee narrates that the &#8211;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) made wudoo , then turned up a woollen cloak he had and wiped his face with it. </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Ibn Maajah (no.468)]. In az-Zawaa’id it is said: Its isnaad is saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: In its isnaad is al-Wadeen ibn ‘Ataa who is sadooq but has a bad memory as al-Haafiz Ibn Hajr says in ‘Taqreeb ut-Tahdheeb’, so its isnaad is da’eef!! – but it is strengthened by the previous hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah to the level of hasan – and Allaah Knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Some others hold it to be makrooh to dry the body-parts after Purification and their proof is:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">66. What is established from Maimoonah (radhiAllaahu’anhaa) who described the Prophet’s (sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) ghusl from Janaabah and said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Then I brought him a cloth but he refused it.</strong> </span>[Al-Bukhaaree, and Muslim – and the word is his].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Final word: Is that &#8211;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Drying the body-parts is one of the desirable actions as shown by the hadeeth of Aa’ishah (radhiAllaahu ‘anhaa) – as for the saying that it is makrooh then that is not acceptable as the saying of Maimoonah (radhiAllaahu ‘anhaa) “but he refused it” does not amount to the fact that it is makrooh – and Allaah Knows best.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Maajah -rahimahullaah- reported in his &#8220;Sunan&#8221; [The Book of the Rites of Hajj: chapter (5): The Virtue of the Supplication of the person performing Hajj: (no.2893)]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Muhammad ibn Tareef narrated to us, saying: `Imraan ibn `Uyainah narrated to us: from `Ataa· ibn as-Saa·ib: from Mujaahid: from Ibn `Umar: from the Prophet sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam, that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The fighter in Allaah’s cause, and the person performing Hajj, and the person performing `Umrah are Allaah’s deputation: He called them, and they responded to Him; and they ask of Him, and He gives to them</strong></span>&gt;&gt;.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaanee -rahimahullaah- said: &#8220;Hasan&#8221;; and he said in &#8220;as-Saheehah&#8221; (no.1820), having quoted a supporting narration reported by al-Bazzaar (no.1153) as a hadeeth of Jaabir: &#8220;The hadeeth, when the two chains of narration are gathered is &#8220;Hasan&#8221;.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Imaam Ibn Maajah -rahimahullaah- reported (no.2895): &#8220;Aboo Bakr ibn Abee Shaybah narrated to us, saying: Yazeed ibn Haaroon narrated to us: from `Abdul-Malik ibn Abee Sulaymaan: from Abuz-Zubayr: from Safwaan ibn `Abdillaah ibn Safwaan, who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I was married to a daughter of Abud-Dardaa·, so he came to her and he found Ummud-Dardaa·, but he did not find Abud-Dardaa·. So she said to him: &#8220;Do you intend to perform Hajj this year?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Yes.&#8221; She said: &#8220;Then supplicate to Allaah for good for us, since the Prophet sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The supplication which a person makes for his brother in his absence is responded to. There will be an Angel by his head saying: ‘Aameen’ [O Allaah! Grant it], to his supplication, ‘and may you receive the like of it’.</strong> </span>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>He said: Then I went out to the market place, and I met Abud-Dardaa·, and he narrated the like of that to me from the Prophet sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaanee -rahimahullaah- said: &#8220;Saheeh.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ إِذ ظَّلَمُوا أَنفُسَهُمْ جَاءُوكَ فَاسْتَغْفَرُوا اللَّهَ وَاسْتَغْفَرَ لَهُمُ الرَّسُولُ لَوَجَدُوا اللَّهَ تَوَّابًا رَّحِيمًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If, when they had wronged themselves, they had come to you &#8211; O Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) – and had sought Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness, and the Messenger had asked for Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness for them, then they would have found that Allaah would have accepted their repentance and had mercy upon them. </strong></span><span style="text-align:center;">[Sooratun-Nisaa (4): 64]</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Ibnul-Qayyim (<em>rahimahullaah</em>)</strong> said:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Since Allaah – the One free of all imperfections – knew that those to whom the Messenger was sent would certainly wrong themselves and follow their desires, He guided them to that which would repel the evil of that wrong and remove its causes. This lay in two things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>, there was something that they themselves were to do, which was to seek forgiveness of their Lord – the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>, there was something for someone else to do, and this was that the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) should ask forgiveness for them when they came to him, submitted obediently to him and acknowledged their wrong-doing. So, if they were to do these two things, they would find that Allaah would accept their repentance and forgive them. He would accept their repentance, thus wiping away the effect of their sins and protecting them from their evils. In addition to this, He would grant them His Mercy, His favourable and fine treatment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, what share of this Aayah is there for a person who wrongs himself after the death of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ? Does the use of the Aayah support those people who claim that the person should go to his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) grave; ask for forgiveness there, and for his intercession?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reply is that, as for the share of the person who wrongs himself after the death of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) with regard to this Aayah, he should ask for Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness, with sincere repentance and this applies in every time and place. It is not a condition for the correctness of his repentance that he should go to his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) grave, and ask for forgiveness there. (By consensus- Ijmaa&#8221;).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">As for going to his grave and seeking forgiveness there and seeking his intercession, using this Aayah as an evidence, then the Aayah does not indicate this in any sense at all. It only refers to going to him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ; not going to his grave; nor does it state that he will seek forgiveness for them if they seek intercession from him after his death.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is thus shown to be a false and futile argument which is further clarified by the fact that the Companions, those who of all people knew best about the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) , did not understand the Aayah in this way. So it is known that this is an innovation. That which is most frequently used as evidence by those who permit it, is the narration of al-`Utabee from an unknown Bedouin, even though we do not know any chain of narration for it. If this disconnected report, or it&#8217;s like, were a hadeeth or a report from a Companion, then it would not be permissible to use it as a proof, and its ruling would not be binding upon us because of its lack of authenticity. How then can it be permissible to use as proof for this a story that is not authentic, concerning a Bedouin who is unknown!? [1]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaikh ‘Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Naasir as-Sa`dee</strong> (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Meaning: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If, when they had wronged themselves, they had come to you &#8211; O Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">i.e. acknowledging their sins, and fully confessing them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>…and had sought Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness, and the Messenger had asked for Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness for them, then they would have found that Allaah would have accepted their repentance and had mercy upon them</strong></span>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">i.e. He would have turned to them, forgiven their wrongdoing, and been Merciful to them; by accepting their repentance, guiding them to it and granting it to them, and rewarding them for it. This coming to the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was something specific to his lifetime.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>This is what the context indicates, because seeking forgiveness from the Messenger cannot occur except in his lifetime. As for after his death, then nothing can be sought from him; rather that would be shirk.&#8221;</strong></span> [2]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">* as-Saheehah (no.2926) of Shaikh al-Albaanee-rahimahullaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;From Jaabir ibn `Abdillaah who said: “Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&lt;&lt;Narrate from the Banoo Israa·eel. and there is no harm, because amazing things happened amongst them.&gt;&gt;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he began narrating, and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&lt;&lt; A group from the Banoo Israa.eel went out until they came to one of their grave- yards, and they said: &#8220;If only we were to pray two rak`ahs, and make supplication to Allaah- the Mighty and Majestic -that He should bring out for us a man from those who have died, so that we could ask him about death.&#8221; He said: So they did so. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So, whilst they were in that condition, a man put his head out from a grave from those graves. He was a brownish person, with the mark of prostration between his eyes. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said “O people what do you want with me? <span style="color:#993300;">I died a hundred years ago, and the heat of death has not subsided from me until just now</span>. So supplicate to Allaah- the Mighty and Majesticfor me so that He should return me to being just as I was”.&gt;&gt;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Reported by Ahmad in &#8220;az-Zuhd&#8221;(16-17), Ibn Abee Shaybah in &#8220;alMusannaf&#8221;(9/62)-without the story, and likewise by al-Bazzaar in his &#8220;Musnad&#8221;(1/108/192: &#8220;Kashful-Astaar&#8221;): from ar-Rabee` ibn Sa`d al-Ju`fee :he heard it from `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Saabit: from Jaabir ibn `Abdillaah who said: Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &#8230;, and he mentioned it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: The narrators in this chain are reliable, however there is a disagreement about whether Ibn Saabit heard from Jaabir. So Ibn Ma`een was asked: &#8220;Did `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Saabit hear from Jaabir?&#8221; So he said: &#8220;No.&#8221; However Ibn Abee Haatim confirmed his having heard from him, so he said in &#8220;al-Jarh watTa`deel&#8221; (2/2/240): “He narrated from `Umar, but this is mursal; and from Jaabir, and it is connected.” And this is contrary to what he quoted in &#8220;alMaraaseel&#8221; (p.84), and this is more correct, because of what follows.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the hadeeth was reported by `Abd Ibn Humayd in &#8220;al-Muntakhab minalMusnad&#8221; (q.152/1), with its full wording, and likewise by Wakee` in &#8220;azZuhd&#8221;(1/280/56), and by Ibn Abee Daawood in &#8220;al-Ba`th&#8221;(30/5), and in it Ibn Saabit clearly states that he had it narrated to him directly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <strong>the hadeeth is &#8220;Saheeh&#8221;</strong>, and the chain is fully connected, and all praise is for Allaah&#8230;”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">* al-`Allaamah Ibn Battaal al-Maalikee -rahimahullaah- said in his explanation of &#8220;Saheehul-Bukhaaree&#8221; (4/154-157), in explanation of the Chapter: Seeking the Night of Decree in the odd nights of the last ten [Book of the virtue of the Night of Decree: Chapter 3]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“at-Tabaree said: The Companions and those who followed them upon good differed concerning pinpointing the actual night of Laylatul-Qadr; and they differed in what they narrated from the Prophet -`alaihis-Salaam- to pinpoint it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas`ood said: <strong>&#8220;It is the seventeenth night of Ramadaan&#8221;</strong>; and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Alee, Ibn Mas`ood, and Zayd ibn Thaabit said: <strong>&#8220;It is the nineteenth night&#8221;</strong>; and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">some of them said: <strong>&#8220;It is the twenty (first night)&#8221;</strong>, based upon the hadeeth of Aboo Sa`eed: that is also related from `Alee and Ibn Mas`ood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Others said: <strong>&#8220;It is the twenty third night&#8221;</strong>, based upon the hadeeth of Ibn `Umar and Ibn `Abbaas; that is related from Ibn `Abbaas, `Aa·ishah, and Bilaal; and it was said by Makhool; and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Abbaas and Bilaal said: <strong>&#8220;It is the twenty fourth night&#8221;</strong>; and this was the saying of al-Hasan [i.e. al-Basree] and Qataadah; and I think that those who said that were basing it upon his -`alaihis-Salaam- saying: <strong>&lt;&lt; Seek it when seven remain &gt;&gt;</strong>, understanding that the seventh is the first of the seven remaining nights; and that is the twenty fourth night if the month is full [<strong>1</strong>] And `Alee, Ibn `Abbaas, Ubayy ibn Ka`b, and Mu`aawiyah said: &#8220;It is the twenty seventh night&#8221;;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[1] i.e. consisting of thirty days; as opposed to &#8220;short&#8221;,when composed of twenty nine days.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and it is related from Ibn `Umar that he said: <strong>&#8220;It occurs within the whole of Ramadaan&#8221;</strong>;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and `Abdullaahibn Buraydah related: from Mu`aawiyah: from the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) that he said:<br />
<strong>&lt;&lt; It is the last night. &gt;&gt;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ayyoob said: from Aboo Qilaabah that <strong>it moves around throughout all the nights of the last ten</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">at-Tabaree said: And the narrations reported about that from the Prophet &#8211; `alaihis-Salaam- are authentic, and they are in harmony, they do not contradict each other. this is because they all relate from him -`alaihis-Salaam- that it is within the last ten; and its moving around each year, to one of the last ten nights, is not to be denied. And it is known that he -`alaihis-Salaam- only said, with regard to each of the nights that he commanded his Companions to seek it in, that it was in that night in that (particular) year. So what is correct is that it is in the month of Ramadaan, to the exclusion of the other months of the year, because of the consensus of all those who inherited from the Prophet -`alaihisSalaam- that he said: &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(It) is in the last ten; in the odd ones from them</strong></span>. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there is nothing specific to limit it to a particular night, such that it cannot move to a different night. So if it were restricted to a specific night, then the one having the most right to know that would be the Prophet -`alaihis-Salaam: along with how eager he was to know it, so that he could make his nation aware of it. So he did not make them aware of it, except by its signs: that it is a pleasant night: not hot, and not cold; and that the sun rises on its morning white (dull), with no rays. And the fact that he directed his nation towards it by means of signs, and not by stating a particular night, is a clear proof of the falsity of the saying of those who say that certain things appear that night which do not appear in the rest of the year: such as trees falling to the ground, and then returning to their places. So if that were true, then it would not be hidden from the eyes of one who stood throughout all the nights of the year; so what about the nights of Ramadaan?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for what this night has been singled out with, to the exclusion of the rest of the nights, then it is better than a thousand months: meaning that an action done in it : from those things which please Allaah, and which He loves: Prayer, Supplication, and the like, is better than an action done in a thousand months which do not contain the Night of Decree; and that supplication in it is responded to, as long as he does not supplicate for something sinful, nor for the cutting of ties of kinship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Maalik said regarding his -`alaihis-Salaam-: &lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Seek it on the ninth remaining</span></strong> &gt;&gt;: it is the night of the twenty first; and that &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Seven remaining</strong></span> &gt;&gt; is the night of the twenty third night; and &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Five remaining</strong></span> &gt;&gt; is the twenty fifth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author said: The meaning of this, and the Night of Decree occuring on an odd night will only be correct if the month is &#8220;short&#8221;[i.e. of twenty nine days]. If it is full [i.e. of thirty days], then it will not be except on an even night. So &#8220;nine remaining&#8221; will be the night of the twenty second; &#8220;five remaining&#8221; will be the night of the twenty sixth; &#8220;seven remaining&#8221; will be the night of the twenty fourth: based upon what al-Bukhaaree mentioned from Ibn `Abbaas: so none of them will conform to an odd night. So this proves that the Night of Decree moves around every year within the last ten: from being an odd night to being an even one, and from being an even one to being an odd one. This is because the Prophet -`alaihis-Salaam- did not command his nation to seek it in a full month, but not in a short one. Rather he left seeking it unrestricted, applying to all the months of Ramadaan: those which Allaah causes to be full sometimes, and short on other occasions. So it is established that it moves within all of the last ten nights, as Aboo Qilaabah said&#8230;”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Muslim -rahimahullaah- reported in his &#8220;Saheeh&#8221; (The Book of Fasting: no. 762):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And Muhammad ibn Haatim and Ibn Abee `Umar narrated to us, both of them: from Ibn `Uyainah. Ibn Haatim said: Sufyaan ibn `Uyainah narrated to us: from `Abdah and `Aasim ibn Abin-Nujood, who both heard Zirr ibn Hubaish say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I asked Ubayy ibn Ka`b, saying: Your brother Ibn Mas`ood says: Whoever stands in (Night) Prayer throughout the whole year will attain Laylatul-Qadr (The Night of Decree). So he said: &#8220;May Allaah have mercy upon him! He intended that the people should not just rely (upon a single night). Indeed he knew that it was in Ramadaan; and that it is in the last ten; and that it was the twenty seventh night.&#8221; Then he swore an oath, without exception that it was the twenty seventh night.&#8221; So I said: &#8221; O Abul-Mundhir! Upon what basis do you say that?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Based upon the sign which Allaah&#8221;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) informed us of: <strong>that it [i.e. the sun] will rise on that day having no rays</strong>&#8220;.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam an-Nawawee -rahimahullaah- said in his explanation of &#8220;Saheeh Muslim&#8221;: “&#8230;al-Qaadee `Iyaad said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>It is said that the meaning of its having no rays is that this was just a distinctive sign which Allaah -the Most High- made for it [that year]. He said: Or it is otherwise said: Rather it is on account of the great number of Angels coming and going on its night; and their descending to the earth, and their ascending, with that which they descended with. So their wings and their subtle/ethereal bodies screen the light of the sun and its rays, and Allaah knows best.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Aboo Daawood -rahimahullaah- reported the hadeeth (The Book of the Prayer: Chapter 319: What occurs regarding the Night of Decree), (no. 1378), with the wording:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“&#8230;On the morning following that night the sun enters the morning like a brass dish, having no rays, until it has risen higher.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Declared &#8220;hasan saheeh&#8221; by Shaikh al-Albaanee -rahimahullaah.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Khuzaymah -rahimahullaah- reported in his &#8220;Saheeh&#8221; (no. 2192): “ Bundaar narrated to us: Aboo `Aamir narrated to me: Zam`ah narrated to us: from Salamah -he is Ibn Wahraam-: from `Ikrimah: from Ibn `Abbaas: from the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) that he said regarding the Night of Decree:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;It is a pleasant night, being neither hot nor cold. The sun enters the morning of its day being red and weak.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Shaikh al-Albaanee said: “A hadeeth which is &#8220;Saheeh&#8221; because of its witnesses&#8230;”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam an-Nawawee -rahimahullaah- said in his explanation of &#8220;Saheeh Muslim&#8221; (The Book of Fasting: Chapter 40: The virtue of the Night of Decree):“al-Qaadee [`Iyaad] said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They disagreed about its place. So a group said: It moves about, so in one year it will be one night, and in another year it will be a different night, and so on; and this harmonizes the ahaadeeth ; and it is said: Each hadeeth refers to one of its times, and there is no contradiction between them. He said: And the like of this was stated by Maalik, ath-Thawree, Ahmad, Ishaaq, Aboo Thawr, and others. They said: It moves about within the last ten nights of Ramadaan&#8230;”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Haafiz Ibn Hajr -rahimahullaah- said in &#8220;Fathul-Baaree&#8221; (4/260) in explanation of the chapter heading: &#8220;Seeking the Night of Decree in the odd nights of the last ten&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“This title contains an indication of the preference of the saying that the Night of Decree is restricted to Ramadaan, then to the last ten nights of it, then to the odd nights from them, and that it is not one particular, fixed night. This is what is indicated by the collected narrations concerning it.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-And he said (4/267):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“So the most correct saying out of all of them is that it is one of the odd nights from the last ten, and that it moves around – as can be understood from the ahaadeeth of this chapter.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So the most likely nights are the odd nights of the last ten; and the most likely night from the odd nights of the last ten in the view of the Shaafi`ees is the twenty-first night or the twenty-third night, in accordance with what occurs in the hadeeth of Aboo Sa`eed and `Abdullaah ibn Unays; whereas in the view of the majority the most likely (night) is the twenty-seventh night, and the evidences for that have preceded.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The scholars said: The wisdom behind Laylatul-Qadr being concealed is so that the people strive to seek it contrary to what would be the case if it were a certain known night – for then they would restrict themselves to that, as has been mentioned concerning the hour on the day of Jumu`ah….”</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align:center;"><strong>بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Muslim -rahimahullaah- reported in his &#8216;Saheeh&#8217; [The Book of Purification]: (no.234): “Muhammad ibn Haatim ibn Maymoon narrated to me: `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Mahdee narrated to us: Mu`aawiyah ibn Saalih narrated to us: from Rabee`ah -meaning Ibn Yazeed: from Aboo Idrees alKhawlaanee: from `Uqbah ibn `Aamir; And Aboo `Uthmaan narrated to me: from Jubayr ibn Nufayr: from `Uqbah ibn `Aamir, who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;We were tending camels, and my turn came, so I brought them back in the evening. So then I found Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) standing, speaking to the people, and I caught from what he was saying:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;My Ummah will continue to be upon good for as long as they hasten to break the fast and delay the pre-dawn meal.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other matter which I want to remind you of is what occurs in the previous hadeeth, <strong>&#8220;And they delay the pre-dawn meal&#8221;</strong> meaning: what is required here is the opposite to the case of the Iftaar. So he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬ commanded us to hasten to perform the Iftaar<span style="color:#808080;"><a style="color:#808080;" href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-9FW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">.</a></span> But as for the Suhoor, then it should be delayed. But what happens today is totally contrary to this, since many people eat their Suhoor before the appearance of Fajr by perhaps an hour. This is not befitting. This is contrary to the Sunnah shown by the saying of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬and by his practice. So the Companions of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬used to leave the Suhoor so late, that one of them would almost hear the Adhaan and he would still be eating because he had delayed the Suhoor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed there is an authentic hadeeth reported from the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬which shows the ease afforded by Islaam, to be counted as one of the principles of Islaam, which the Muslims are proud of, especially with regard to the matter of Fasting, since Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, concluded the Aayahs concerning Fasting with His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8216;Allaah desires ease for you, and He does not desire to make things difficult for you&#8217;</strong>. So from this ease is his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬saying, <strong>&#8220;If one of you hears the call to Prayer and the vessel is in the hand of one of you, then let him not put it down until he fulfils his need from it.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; If one of you hears the call to Prayer and the vessel&#8221; the vessel containing food, whether it be milk, some drink, water, anything which a person may take as Suhoor, and he hears the Adhaan, then he should not say, Now the food is forbidden due to the Adhaan being heard. The person who has had enough, it is not allowed for him to then have any more, whether it be a drink, or some fruit, when he has had his fill of whatever he was eating.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for the one who hears the Adhaan and he has not yet taken what he needs from the food and the drink, then the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬made that lawful for him. So he clearly said, in the clear and eloquent Arabic language, <strong>&#8220;If one of you hears the call to Prayer, and the vessel is in his hand, then let him not put it down until he fulfils his need from it.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what is meant here by the call is the second call, the <strong>second Adhaan</strong>. It is not the first Adhaan, which they wrongly call the Adhaan of Imsaak (i.e. withholding). We must know that there is no basis for calling the first Adhaan the Adhaan for withholding (imsaak).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second Adhaan is when we are to withhold, and this is clearly stated in the Quraan, since Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8216;And eat and drink until the white thread of dawn becomes clear to you from the black thread of the night.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So eating becomes forbidden at the start of the time of the Fajr Prayer. There is no separation between these two things. There is no withholding from food and drink for a quarter of an hour, or less than that, or more than that, before the start of the time for the Fajr Prayer. Not at all.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Because the Prayer becomes due when the true dawn appears, and food becomes forbidden for the fasting person when the true dawn appears. So there is no separation between these two matters at all.</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore there occurs in the hadeeth agreed upon by al-Bukharee and Muslim, from the hadeeth of Abdullaah Ibn ¹Umar Ibn al-Khattaab -radiyallaahu `anhu, that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬said, <strong>&#8220;Let not the Adhaan of Bilaal deceive you&#8230;&#8221;</strong> meaning, the first Adhaan, <strong>&#8220;&#8230;because he gives the Adhaan in order to awaken the person who is sleeping, and so that the person who wishes to eat the pre-dawn meal can do so. So eat and drink until Ibn Umm Maktoon gives the Adhaan.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Umm Maktoom, whose name was &#8216;Amr, was a blind man, and he was the one about whom the Saying of Allaah, the Exalted and Most High, came down:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;He frowned and turned away, that a blind man had come to him&#8217; to the end of the Aayaat. So he used to give the second Adhaan, the Adhaan which means that eating becomes prohibited and that it is now time for the Fajr Prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How did he used to give the Adhaan when he was blind? This is a question, which naturally occurs to some people. &#8216;Amr Ibn Umm Maktoom used to climb on the roof of the mosque, but he could not see the dawn, so he would wait until someone passing by saw the dawn. So when someone saw that the dawn had appeared and spread across the horizon, they would say to him, It is morning. It is morning. Then he would give the Adhaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So you will notice here that the Adhaan of &#8216;Amr ibn Umm Maktoom was after the Fajr had appeared, and had been seen by the people whilst they were walking in the streets. So when it was said to him, &#8220;It is morning. It is morning,&#8221; he would give the Adhaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore there is latitude in the affair, since the muadhdhin would be delayed in giving the Adhaan until he heard the people telling him, &#8220;It is morning, it is morning.&#8221; And then Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬said:<strong> &#8220;If one of you hears the call to Prayer and the vessel is in his hand, then let him not put it down until he has fulfilled his need from it.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, spoke truly when He said at the end of those Aayahs related to Fasting: <strong>&#8216;Allaah desires to make things easy for you, and He does not desire to make things difficult for you.&#8217;</strong> and <strong>&#8216;&#8230;that you should complete the number of days, and that you should glorify Allaah by mentioning takbeer for His having guided you, and that you should be thankful. &#8216;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore from the Fiqh that is to be criticized, and which runs contrary to this Sunnah, is that a person says, &#8220;If someone hears the Adhaan and has some food in his mouth, then he must spit it out.&#8221; So this is over strictness, and (ghuluww) exceeding the limits in the Religion, and the Lord of all of the creation admonished us, and reminded us, in His Book and in the Sunnah of His Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬that we should not exceed the due limits in our Religion. So He said, in the Noble Qur·aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8216;O People of the Book! Do not exceed the limits in your religion, and do not say anything about Allaah except the truth.&#8217;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And our Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬said to us, or he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬said, <strong>&#8220;Beware of (ghuluww) exceeding the limits in the Religion. Because those who came before you were destroyed by their exceeding the limits in their Religion.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah¹s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬has made it clear to us that there is latitude and a margin of ease in the matter of a person&#8217;s taking suhoor, to the extent that he said: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;If one of you hears the call to Prayer whilst the vessel is in his hand, then let him not put it down until he has completed his need from it.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is opposition to Allaah and to the Messenger that a person says that one who hears the Adhaan whilst he has food in his mouth must spit it out onto the ground. This is not from the Sunnah. Rather this is contrary to the Sunnah, and is contrary to the clear command of the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I have been asked many times, so I will not leave open the need for such a question, but rather I will precede you in (answering) it, by stating that this hadeeth is to be found in some of the most famous books of the Sunnah. From them being the Sunan of Aboo Daawood, and it is the third book from the well-known six books. The first of which is Saheehul-Bukhaaree, the second being Saheeh Muslim, and the third being the Sunan of Aboo Daawood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth is to be found in it, and it is likewise reported by Aboo &#8216;Abdillaah al-Haakim in his Mustadrak, and it is likewise reported by the Imaam of the Sunnah, Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, rahimahullaah, in his tremendous book known as the Musnad of Imaam Ahmad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the hadeth is not a strange hadeeth, rather it is a well-known hadeeth, and was reported by the Imaams of the Sunnah in the early times, and with an authentic chain of narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So here I say, to conclude this talk, since perhaps some of you have questions, which we will answer if Allaah wills, so I will conclude it with his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬saying &#8220;Allaah loves that His allowances be acted upon just as He loves that His prescribed duties be carried out,&#8221; and in one narration, &#8220;Just as He hates that disobedience to Him be committed.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there are two narrations,<strong> &#8220;Allaah loves that His allowances be acted upon just as He loves that His prescribed duties be carried out&#8221;</strong>, and the second narration is, <strong>&#8221; as He hates that disobedience to Him be committed.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore the Muslim should not practice <strong>false piety</strong>, and (as a result) refrain from obeying the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in that which he encouraged us upon and clarified to us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align:center;"><b><span lang="AR-SA">بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</span></b></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaanee, may Allaah have mercy upon him, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah, the Exalted and Most High, says in the Noble Quraan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8216;O you who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, so that you may become people having Taqwaa.&#8217;</strong></span> [Sooratul-Baqarah (2): 183]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in this Aayah, as will not be hidden to all those who are present, Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, informs the Ummah of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) , through this Aayah, that He has made Fasting obligatory upon them just as He had made its like obligatory upon the nations before us<span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-9FI">.</a></span> This is a matter that is well-known to all of the Muslims who read this Aayah, and clearly understand its meaning. But what I wish to speak about is something else, a matter which very few of the general people notice &#8211; and this is the saying of Allaah, the Exalted and Most High, at the end of this Aayah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> &#8216;&#8230;So that you may become people having Taqwaa.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, when He commands His believing servants, or obligates them with some Legislation, (then He) usually just mentions the command, without explaining the wisdom behind it. This is because the general wisdom behind Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, placing duties upon His servants is that He should test them by it, so that it should become apparent (as to) those who will obey Him and those who will disobey Him, the Exalted and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However in this Aayah, He mentioned something that is not found frequently in the Noble Quraan, which is that He mentioned the reason for the order to Fast, by His Saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8216;&#8230;So that you may become people having Taqwaa.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the wisdom behind the Believers&#8217; fasting is not just that they should prevent themselves from enjoyable and permissible good things, even though this is an obligation upon the fasting person &#8211; but this is not the only thing that is required and intended by this Fasting. Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, concluded His command to fast by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8216;&#8230;So that you may become people having Taqwaa.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: that the wisdom behind the prescription of Fasting is that the Muslim <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>should increase in obedience to Allaah</strong></span>, the Exalted and Most High, in the month of Fasting, and become more obedient than he was before it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬clearly stated and completely clarified this point of divine wisdom, by his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬saying, as is reported in the Saheeh of al-Bukhaaree (no. 1903), that he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Whoever does not abandon falsehood in speech and action, then Allaah has no need that he should leave his food and drink.&#8221; </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: that Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, did not intend and desire, by the obligation of Fasting &#8211; which is to withhold for a stated time, well known to you all &#8211; that they should only withhold from eating and drinking. <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Rather they should also withhold from that which Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, has forbidden with regard to sins and acts of disobedience to Him; and from that is falsehood in speech and action.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬is emphasizing the Aayah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8216;&#8230;So that you may become people having Taqwaa.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">i.e. that you should, as an act of worship <strong>to draw you closer to Allaah</strong>, the Mighty and Majestic, in addition to withholding from food and drink, also <strong><span style="color:#000000;">withhold from forbidden actions such as backbiting, carrying tales to cause harm to people, false witness, lying and so on</span></strong>, with regard to those forbidden manners that we are all aware of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore it is obligatory that all the Muslims should be aware that actions, which disrupt the Fast, are not just the physical acts, which are generally known, which are eating, drinking and sexual intercourse. The Fast is not just that you withhold from this. Therefore some of the scholars differentiate, and divide those things which disrupt the Fast into two categories, and this is what I intend by this talk of mine at this time that is blessed, if Allaah wills.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is especially important since those who deliver Khutbahs and admonish the people during Ramadaan, when they speak about those things which disrupt the Fast, then they only speak about the material things, those things that we have just mentioned &#8211; eating, drinking and sexual intercourse. But what they should do, as sincere advisers and people who give reminder to the Muslims in general, is to concentrate a great deal upon the second category of things which disrupt the Fast. This is because the people have become used to thinking that Fasting is just to refrain from the first category, to withhold from the material things. But there is another category of things, which disrupt the Fast, which we are able to call the non-material things that disrupt the Fast. So you have just heard his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬saying, <strong>&#8220;Whoever does not abandon falsehood in speech and action, then Allaah has no need that he should leave his food and drink.&#8221;</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Therefore every fasting person should examine himself and see: is he just withholding from the material things, or is he also withholding from those non-material things? Meaning: has he made his manners and behavior good when the blessed month of Ramadaan comes? If that is the case, then he has fulfilled the Saying of Allaah, the Exalted and Most High, at the end of the Aayah:</strong></span><span style="color:#008000;"> <strong>&#8216;&#8230;So that you may become people having Taqwaa.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for the one who restricts himself in his fasting to just withholding from food and drink, but who continues and persists upon the evil manners which he was upon previously, before Ramadaan, then this is not the Fasting that is desired and required from the wisdom behind the legislation of this noble month, which our Lord, the Mighty and Majestic indicates in His Saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8216;&#8230;So that you may become people having Taqwaa.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore we advise and remind our brother Muslims that they should remember this other category of things, those that are non-material, which disrupt the Fast, and it is something which the admonishers and those who seek to direct the people to the correct way rarely speak about, not to mention the general people, who are not aware of this category of things which disrupt the fast, i.e., the non-material things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what I wanted to remind our brothers who are present in this fine gathering about, if Allaah wills, so that it may be a cause for their increasing in acts of worship, seeking to draw closer to Allaah, the Exalted and Most High, in this blessed month, the month of Fasting, which is such that we hope that Allaah, the Exalted and Most High, will guide and grant us all the success of fulfilling the due right of this blessed month, which is that we withhold from both the material and the non-material things that disrupt the Fast.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">So here two matters were mentioned, and they are neglected by most of the people, and they are: hastening to break the fast, and delaying the pre-dawn meal (Suhoor).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for neglect of the first matter, which is hastening to break the Fast, then in the view of some people it contradicts another hadeeth, which is his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬saying, <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;My Ummah will continue to be upon good for as long as they hasten to pray the Maghrib Prayer.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So here we have two commands, to hasten with two matters. So it appears to some people that we cannot hasten to perform both of them together.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But reconciling between the command to hasten with breaking the Fast and the command to hasten to pray the Maghrib Prayer is a very easy matter. So it is something that our Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬made clear to us by his action and practice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬used to break the Fast with three dates. He would eat three dates. Then he would pray the Maghrib Prayer, then he would eat again if he found that he needed to eat the evening meal. </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But today we fall into two offences:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(i) Firstly we delay the Adhaan from its legislated time</strong>.<br />
<strong>(ii) Then after this delay comes another delay, which is that we sit down for a meal</strong> &#8211; except for a few people who are eager and pray the Maghrib Prayer in the mosque. But the majority of the people wait until they hear the Adhaan, and then they sit down to eat as if they are having a dinner, or their evening meal, and not just breaking their fast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Adhaan these days &#8211; in most of the lands of Islaam, is, unfortunately, I have to say, and not just in Jordan, and I have known this from investigation, in most of the lands of Islaam &#8211; the Adhaan for Maghrib is given after the time it becomes due. And the reason for this is that we have abandoned adhering to and applying the Islamic rulings, and instead <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>we have come to depend upon astronomical calculations. We depend upon the timetable.</strong></span> But these time-tables are based upon astronomical calculations which count the land as being a single flat plane. So they give a time for this flat plane, whereas the reality is that the land, particularly in this land of ours varies, varying between the depression of valleys and the elevation of mountains. So it is not correct that a single time be given which covers the shore, the planes and the mountains. No, each part of the land has its own time. So therefore whoever is able in his place of residence, in his city or his village, to see the sun set with his own eye, then whatever time it sets at, that is the hastening that we have been commanded with in his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬ saying, which we just mentioned: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;My Ummah will continue to be upon good as long as they hasten to break the fast.&#8217;</span></strong> So the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬was careful to implement this Sunnah by teaching it, and by putting it into practice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his teaching, then he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬said, in the hadeeth reported by al-Bukharee in his ‘Saheeh’ (no. 1954), <strong>&#8220;If the night appears from this side,&#8221;</strong> and he pointed towards the east, <strong>&#8220;and the day has departed from here,&#8221;</strong> and he pointed towards the west, <strong>&#8220;and the sun has set, then the fasting person&#8217;s fast is broken&#8221;</strong> What does &#8216;the fasting person&#8217;s fast is broken&#8217; mean? It means he has entered under the ruling that he should break his fast<span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2013/05/10/beautiful-talk-sunnahs-neglected-in-ramadaan-imaam-muhammad-naasir-ud-deen-al-albaanee-videoar-en-subtitles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">.</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then comes the previous ruling where the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬encouraged hastening to break the Fast, and the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬used to implement this, even when he was riding on a journey. So it is reported in the ‘Saheeh’ of al-Bukharee (no.1955) that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬ordered one of his Companions to prepare the Iftaar for him. So he replied, &#8216;O Messenger of Allaah it is still daytime before us.&#8217; Meaning: the light of the sun, so even though it had set, yet its light was still clear in the west. So the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬did not respond to what he had said, rather he re-emphasized the command to him to prepare the Iftaar. So the narrator of the hadeeth who said, We could see daylight in front of us, meaning: the light of day, the light of the sun, When we broke our fast, said, &#8220;If one of us had climbed onto his camel he would have seen the sun.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sun had set from here, and the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬ordered one of the Companions to prepare the Iftaar &#8211; Why? To hasten upon good <strong>&#8220;My Ummah will continue upon good for as long as they hasten to break the Fast.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is important is that we notice that the Iftaar, which is legislated to be hastened must be done with a few dates. Then we must hasten to perform the Prayer. Then after this the people can sit and eat as they need. This is the first matter, which I wanted to remind you of, and it is how to reconcile the two things that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬commanded we should hasten to perform.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The first being the command to hasten the breaking of the Fast, and the second being the command to hasten the Maghrib Prayer. So the Iftaar should be done with some dates, as occurs in the Sunnah, and if dates are not available, then with some gulps of water. Then the Prayer should be prayed in congregation in the mosque.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align:center;"><strong>بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>IMAAM AN-NASAA·EE</strong> reported in his &#8220;`Amalul-Yawm wal Laylah&#8221; (no. 250):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>Aboo Bakr ibn Naafi` related to us, saying: Bahz narrated to us, saying: Hammaad ibn Salamah narrated to us, saying: Thaabit narrated to us: from Anas: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">that some people said to Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم): &#8220;O best one of us, and the son of the best of us! O our chief and the son of our chief!&#8221; So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &lt;&lt; O people! Say what you have to say, and do not let Satan mislead you into following desires. I do not want you to raise me above the position which Allaah -the Most High &#8211; gave to me. I am Muhammad the son of &#8216;Abdullaah. His Slave and His Messenger</span>.</strong> &gt;&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also reported by Ahmad, Ibn Humayd in &#8220;al-Muntakhab&#8221;, Ibn Mandah in &#8220;atTawheed&#8221;, and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaikh al-Albaanee</strong> said: &#8220;Its chain of narration is &#8220;Saheeh&#8221; to the standard of Muslim.” [&#8220;Ghaayatul-Maraam&#8221; (no. 127); &#8220;as-Saheehah&#8221; (nos. 1097 &amp; 1572).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>***</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Shaikh Saalih al-Fawzaan</strong></span> -hafizahullaah- said in &#8220;I`aanatul-mustafeed bisharh Kitaabit-Tawheed&#8221; (2/435- ):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8230;Their saying: &#8220;O our chief and the son of our chief!&#8221; was something the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) rebuked; and likewise their saying: &#8220;O best one of us and the son of the best of us! &#8220;The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) also criticised this, because the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not desire praise. Rather he wanted to be described with that which Allaah-the Most High &#8211; described him with: with Messengership and Prophethood, and that is sufficient honour for him (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying: &lt;&lt; And do not let Satan mislead you into following desires ( laa yastahwiyannakumush-Shaytaan). &gt;&gt; : (yastahwiyannakum) means: that he leads you into following desires which lead away from the path of Allaah -the Mighty and Majestic; or it is from &#8220;al-Hawiyy&#8221;, which means falling into destruction; meaning: let not Satan cause you to fall into misguidance, or let him not cause you to fall into desires which lead you astray from the path of Allaah -the Mighty and Majestic; for Satan misleads people in gradual stages, until he brings about their destruction. So the Muslim should be aware of Satan, and his misleading in gradual stages, and his leading into following desires. He should not relax with regard to Satan about anything, even if it is something slight, since it will become greater and larger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &lt;&lt; I am Muhammad, Allaah’s Slave and His Messenger. &gt;&gt;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the correct way to mention him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) with praise: servitude and Messengership.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&lt;&lt; I do not love that you raise me above the position which Allaah -the Mighty and Majestic-gave to me. &gt;&gt;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the wisdom behind his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) forbiddance: that he feared for them, in their praising of him, that they would raise him above the position which Allaah gave to him; and that is Servitude (`Uboodiyyah) and Messengership (Risaalah). So he feared that they would start to believe that he had some aspects of Lordship ( Ruboobiyyah), just as happened to the Christians with regard to `Eesaa -`alaihis-Salaatu was-Salaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the saying &#8220;His Slave&#8221; (`Abduhu ) prevents excessive praise (ghuluww); and the saying &#8220;His Messenger&#8221; (Rasooluhu) prevents belittlement of him (صلى الله عليه و سلم). So you should not just say that he is only a man and a human, and think that he has no distinction over the rest of mankind, as is said by the Unbelievers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;You are nothing but a man like us&#8221;</span></em> [Sooratush-Shu`araa·. (26): 154]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>SO THESE TWO HADEETH [1] GIVE US SOME TREMENDOUS POINTS OF BENEFIT:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] i.e. This hadeeth along with a similar hadeeth of `Abdullaah ibn ash-Shikhkheerradiyallaahu `anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THE FIRST POINT OF BENEFIT:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is a warning against going beyond the limits (al-ghuluww) with regard to him (صلى الله عليه و سلم), by way of excessive praise; and that he should only be described with those attributes given to him by Allaah: Servitude ( al-`Uboodiyyah) and Messengership (ar-Risaalah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for going beyond the limits regarding him, and describing him as removing troubles and forgiving sins, and that rescue and relief can be sought from him- `alaihis-Salaatu was-Salaam-after his death: as actually occurs with many of those who have deviated today, in what they call &#8220;poems of praise of the Prophet&#8221;- such as &#8220;al-Burdah&#8221; of al-Boosayree; and its like from what has been said by the deviants; then this is excessiveness ( ghuluww) which has led to shirk; such as the saying of al-Boosayree:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>‘O noblest one of the creation! I have none to seek protection</em><br />
<em> and shelter with besides </em><em>you, when disasters strike;</em><br />
<em> And if you do not take hold of my hand in the Hereafter,</em><br />
<em> as a favour from you, then O how I shall fall!</em><br />
<em> Since from your generosity comes the whole world and its treasures;</em><br />
<em> and from your knowledge is the knowledge of the Preserved Tablet and the </em><em>Pen.’</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is going beyond the due limits (ghuluww), and Allaah&#8217;s refuge is sought, which led to Unbelief and Shirk, to such an extent the he did not leave anything for Allaah at all! He ascribed everything to the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم): This world and the Hereafter ascribed to the Messenger. The Preserved Tablet and the Pen ascribed to the Messenger. That none can save from the Torment on the Day of Resurrection except the Messenger. So what then remains for Allaah- the Mighty and Majestic?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a poem which they circulate, memorise, and recite during the &#8220;mawlid&#8221; (Innovated birthday celebrations). Likewise other poems of Kufr and Shirk, particularly that which they recite during the innovated mawlid (birthday celebrations) from poems of Shirk. The cause of all of this is exceeding the bounds (ghuluww) with regard to the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for praising him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) with that which Allaah described him with, that he is a Slave [of Allaah] (`Abd) and Messenger (Rasool), and that he is the best of the creation, then there is no harm in this ; just as occurs in the poetry of the Companions who praised him, like the poetry of Hassaan ibn Thaabit, and Ka`b ibn Zuhayr, and likewise Ka`b ibn Maalik, and `Abdullaah ibn Rawaahah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are pure and good poems. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) heard them and approved of them because they did not contain any excessive praise (ghuluww); rather they contained a mention of his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) characteristics…. &gt;&gt;. ”</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>***</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Shaikh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-`Uthaymeen</strong></span> &#8211; rahimahullaah- said in &#8220;alQawlul-Mufeed `alaa Kitaabit-Tawheed&#8221;. ( 2/519-521):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;His saying: &#8220;I am Muhammad, the Slave of Allaah and His Messenger&#8221;: Muhammad is his personal name and &#8220;`Abdullaah’ (Allaah&#8217;s Slave) and &#8220;Rasooluhu&#8221; (His Messenger) are two attributes of his; and these two characteristics are the finest and most profound of the characteristics of the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم). So therefore Allaah -the Most High &#8211; described him with Servitude with regard to the greatest of positions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">in the position of His sending the Qur·aan down to him. He-the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Exalted is He who sent down the Criterion to His Slave&#8221;</span></em> [Sooratul-Furqaan (25):1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and He described him with it in the situation of the Night-Journey. He-the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Perfect is He who took His Slave on a journey by night&#8221;</span></em> [Sooratul-Israa· (17):1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and He described him with it in the situation of his ascent through the heavens. He -the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;So He revealed to His Slave whatever He revealed&#8221;</span></em> [Sooratun-Najm (53): 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and He described him with it in the situation of defending him and challenging his opponents. He-the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And if you are in doubt concerning that which We sent down to Our Slave&#8221;</span></em> [Sooratul-Baqarah (2):23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and the same was the case with the (rest of the) Prophets, such as in His Saying &#8211; He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;O descendants of those whom We carried in the ship along with Nooh. Indeed he was a thankful slave&#8221;</em></span> [Sooratul-Israa· (17): 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a special and specific Servitude, and it is the highest of the types of servitude. Then servitude to Allaah is the greatest of the attributes of mankind, since man will either worship Allaah or Satan. He-the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Did I not command you, O descendants of Aadam, that you should not worship Satan. Indeed he is a clear enemy to you. And that you should worship Me alone. That is the Straight Path&#8221;</em></span> [Soorah YaaSeen: (36):60-61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibnul-Qayyim</strong> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;They fled away from the Servitude for which they were created, and were afflicted instead with servitude to the self and to Satan… (And His Messenger): Meaning: The One sent by Him to the whole of mankind. He- the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Say: O Muhammad! I am indeed the Messenger of Allaah to you all&#8221;</em></span> [Sooratul-A`raaf (7):158]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is at the pinnacle of the levels of righteousness. He the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And whoever obeys Allaah and the Messenger, then they will be along with those whom Allaah has bestowed favour upon; from the Prophets, their true and sincere followers, the martyrs, and the righteous; and what a fine company they are&#8221;</span></em> [Sooratun-Nisaa· (4):69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So amongst the Prophets was the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), indeed he was the most excellent of them…</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And two groups went to extreme with regard to the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A group who went to such an extreme that they worshipped him, and they took him for times of ease and hardship, and they worshipped him and called upon him besides Allaah;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A group denied him; and claimed that he was a liar, a sorcerer, a poet, a madman, a soothsayer, and the like;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying &#8220;Allaah’s Slave and His Messenger’ is a refutation of both of the groups…”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">[From &#8220;<em>Saheehus-Seeratin-Nabawiyyah</em>&#8216; (pp.80-81), Shaikh al-Albaanee &#8211; <em>rahimahullaah&#8217;s</em>&#8211; verified edition of al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer &#8211;<em>rahimahullaah&#8217;s</em>&#8211; &#8220;<em>as-Seeratun-Nabawiyyah</em>&#8216;.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Awf ibn Maalik al-Ashja`ee, who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) went off one day, and I was with him, until we entered a synagogue of the Jews (in al-Madeenah, on a festival day of theirs, and they disliked our entering upon them), and he said (to them):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">O assembly of Jews! Show me twelve men who will bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and Allaah will remove from every Jew beneath the sky the Anger which He has upon them</span></strong>.&gt;&gt; He said: So they remained silent; no one responded to him. Then he repeated it, but no one responded to him. So he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>You have refused, but, by Allaah ! I am indeed ‘al-Haashir’</strong> (the Prophet after whom the people will be gathered), and I am <strong>‘al-`Aaqib’</strong> (the final Prophet), and I am<strong> ‘an-Nabiyyul-Mustafaa’</strong> (the chosen Prophet): whether you believe or reject the truth</span>.</span>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he departed, and I was with him, until (when) we had almost left, a man behind us said: &#8220;Stay as you are, O Muhammad!&#8217; Then that man said: &#8221; What sort of man do you people know me to be amongst you, O company of Jews?&#8217; They said: &#8220;By Allaah! We do not know there to be any man amongst us who knows Allaah&#8217;s Scripture better than you; nor who has better understanding of the religion than you; nor than your father before you; nor than your grandfather before your father.&#8217; He said: &#8220;Then I testify for him, by Allaah, that he is indeed the Prophet of Allaah, whom you find in the Tawraat [Torah].” They said: &#8220;You have lied!&#8217; Then they rebutted his saying, and they said evil things about him, so Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>You people have lied. Your saying will never be accepted. Just now you were praising him with the good that you were praising him with; but when he believed you called him a liar, and said what you have said. Your saying will never be accepted</strong></span>.</span> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: So we departed, and we were three: Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), myself, and `Abdullaah ibn Salaam; and Allaah -the Most High- sent down regarding him:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِن كَانَ مِنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ وَكَفَرْتُم بِهِ وَشَهِدَ شَاهِدٌ مِّن بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ عَلَىٰ مِثْلِهِ فَآمَنَ وَاسْتَكْبَرْتُمْ ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الظَّالِمِينَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Say: Do you see: if this Qur·aan is from Allaah, and you reject it, and a witness from the children of Israa&#8217;eel testifies to its like, and believes in it; and you haughtily reject it; then Allaah does not guide the wrongdoing Disbelievers&#8221;</span></strong>  [ Sooratul-Ahqaaf (46): 10] [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[1] Shaikh al-Albaanee said: &#8220;Reported by Ahmad (6/25), and the additions are his; and by al-Haakim (3/415-416), and he said: &#8220;Saheeh to the standard of the two Shaikhs&#8217;! And adhDhahabee agreed with him! But it is only to the standard of Muslim, since al-Bukhaaree did not report the narrations of Safwaan ibn `Amr except in his &#8220;al-Adabul-Mufrad&#8217;.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>IMAAM AL-BUKHAAREE’S -rahimahullaah- NARRATION:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Bukhaaree narrated (no.3329): from Anas &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Abdullaah ibn Salaam heard of the arrival of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) at AlMadeenah, so he came to him and said: &#8220;I am going to ask you about three things which nobody but a Prophet will know.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8220;What is the first of the signs of the Hour? And what will be the first food, which the people of Paradise will eat? And on account of what does a child resemble its father; and on account of what does a child resemble its maternal uncles?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: «Jibreel has just informed me of them.» He said: `Abdullaah said: &#8220;He is the enemy to the Jews from amongst the Angels.&#8217; Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>«As for the first of the signs of the Hour, then it will be a fire, which gathers the people from the east to the west. As for the first food which the people of Paradise will eat, then it will be the extra lobe of the liver of the fish. As for the resemblance of the child, then when the man has intercourse with the woman and his semen outstrips the fluid of the woman, then the child will resemble him; and if her fluid outstrips, then the resemblance will be towards her.» </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8220;I testify that you are the Messenger of Allaah.&#8217; Then he said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah! The Jews are a people who are great liars: if they know about my Islaam before you ask them, then they will lie about me to you.&#8217; So the Jews came, and `Abdullaah ibn Salaam entered the house.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: «What sort of a man is `Abdullaah ibn Salaam amongst you?» They said: &#8220;He is the most knowledgeable one of us, and the son of the most knowledgeable one from amongst us; and he is the best one of us, and the son of the best one of us.&#8217; So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: «What would you think if `Abdullaah were to accept Islaam?» They said: &#8220;May Allaah preserve him from that.&#8217; So `Abdullaah came out to them and said: &#8220;I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah.&#8217; So they said: &#8220;He is the most evil one of us, and the son of the most evil one of us&#8217;, and they spoke against him&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>A BRIEF BIOGRAPHY OF `ABDULLAAH IBN SALAAM -radiyallaahu `anhu:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdullaah ibn Salaam ibn al-Haarith, al-Israa·eelee, Aboo Yoosuf. He was previously a confederate of Banoo `Awf ibn al-Khazraj. He accepted Islaam when Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) came to al-Madeenah. He was present at the battle of the Trench (al-Khandaq), and the battles after it.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Sending Salaat* Upon The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم)</strong><br />
[* i.e. saying &#8220;Allaahumma salli &#8216;alaa Muhammad&#8230;&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam an-Nasaa·ee</strong> –rahimahullaah- reported in his &#8220;Sunan&#8221; (no.1297):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Ishaaq ibn Mansoor related to us, saying: Muhammad ibn Yoosuf narrated to us, saying: Yoonus ibn Abee Ishaaq narrated to us: from Burayd ibn Abee Maryam who said: Anas ibn Maalik narrated to us, saying: Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Whoever sends a single salaat upon me, then Allaah will send ten salawaaat upon Him, and ten sins will be removed from him, and he will be raised by ten ranks</span></strong> &gt;&gt;.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaanee-rahimahullaah- declared it &#8220;Saheeh&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaikh al-Albaanee</strong> said in &#8220;Sifatus-Salaat&#8221; (p.165): ‘‘The most correct saying about the meaning of salaat upon the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the saying of Abul-&#8216;Aaliyah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Allaah&#8217;s salaat upon His Prophet is His extolling him [[to the Angels]] and exalting him; and the salaat of the Angels and others upon him is to request this from Allaah -the Most High&#8221;; and what is meant is seeking increase, not the initiation of salaat al-Haafiz [Ibn Hajr] mentioned it in &#8220;al-Fath&#8221;.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim</strong> -rahimahullaah, in his book &#8220;Jalaa·ul-Afhaam fee Fadlis-Salaati was-Salaam &#8216;alaa khayril anaam (صلى الله عليه و سلم)&#8221;, mentions <strong>forty benefits arising from sending salaat upon Allaah&#8217;s Messenger</strong> (صلى الله عليه و سلم):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Compliance with the Command of Allaah-the Perfect and Most High. [i.e. in Aayah 65 of Sooratul-Ahzaab].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Conformity with Him- He the Perfect- in sending salaat upon him, even though the two forms of salaat are different. So our salaat upon him is a supplication and a request, whereas the salaat of Allaah-the Most High-upon him is extolling and ennobling&#8230;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Conformity with the Angels in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Attaining ten salawaat [[plural of salaat]] from Allaah by the person who sends salaat upon him once.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. That he is raised by ten levels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. That he has ten good deeds written for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. That ten sins are erased from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. That it is to be hoped that his supplication will be responded to if he precedes it with that. So it causes the supplication to ascend to the Lord of creation, when prior to this it was suspended between the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. It is a means to attain his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) Intercession, if it is accompanied by a request for alwaseelah (a singular station in Paradise) for him, or even if it is on its own&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. It is a means for forgiveness of sins …</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. It is a cause for Allaah to suffice the servant with regard to whatever concerns him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. It is a means for the person to gain nearness to him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) on the Day of Resurrection…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">13.( It has the position of being like an act of charity upon a needy person.)**</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. It is a cause for the fulfillment of your needs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15. It is a cause for Allaah to send salaat upon the person, and for the salaat of His Angels upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16. It is a cleansing (zakaat) and purification for the person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">17. (It is a cause for the servant to receive glad tidings of Paradise before his death…) **</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">18. (It is a means for salvation from the terrors of the Day of Resurrection…) **</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19. It is a cause for the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to respond to the one who sends salaat and salaam upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">20. (It is a cause for the servant to remember that which he has forgotten.) **</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21. It is a cause of good for the gathering, and for its not becoming a source of regret for its people on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">22. (It is a means to repel poverty&#8230;) **</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">23. It repels from the person the description of being a miser, if he sends salaat upon him whenever he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">24. He becomes saved from being supplicated against that his nose should be cleaved in dust, for abandoning it when he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">25. It puts its companion upon the path to Paradise, and it causes the one who abandons it to err with regard to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">26. It saves from the stench of a gathering wherein Allaah and His Messenger are not mentioned, and where Allaah-the Most High- is not praised and extolled, and where salaat is not sent upon His Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">27. It is a means for the completion of the speech which was begun with praise of Allaah and salaat upon His Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">28. (It is a cause for the servant&#8221;s light to be increased upon the Bridge (as-Siraat).) **</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29. It takes the servant away from coarseness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">30. It is a cause for Allaah –the Perfect- to bestow favourable praise upon the one who sends salaat upon him, praising him to the inhabitants of the Heavens and the earth. This is because the one who sends salaat upon him is asking Allaah to extol His Messenger, and to honour, and ennoble him. So recompense conforms to the type of deed, so the one who sends salaat must in turn receive some form of this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">31. It is a cause of blessing for the one who sends salaat, in his self, his deeds, and his life, and the means of his welfare. This is because the one who sends salaat is supplicating to his Lord that He should bless him and his true followers; and this supplication will be answered; and recompense conforms to the deed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">32. It is a means for his attaining the Mercy of Allaah, since mercy is either the meaning of the salaat –upon the saying of some; or it is otherwise something necessitated by it, and required from it-upon the correct saying. So the one who sends salaat upon him must certainly receive Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">33. It is a means to perpetuate his love of the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم),and to increase it, and to multiply it; and that is one of the essential fundamentals of Eemaan, which it will not be complete without; since the more a servant mentions the one he loves, and remembers him in his heart, and remembers his fine qualities, and those things which instill love of him, then his love of him will increase, and yearning for him will grow, and this will overcome his whole heart. But if he turns away from mentioning him and from thinking of him and of his fine qualities in his heart, then love of him will be reduced in his heart. So there is nothing more pleasing to the one who loves than seeing the one whom he loves, and nothing gives greater pleasure to his heart than mentioning him, and thinking of him and of his fine qualities. So when this becomes strong in his heart, then his tongue will praise and extol him…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">34. That salaat upon him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is a cause of his loving that person. So because it is a cause for the one who sends salaat upon him to increase in love of him, likewise it is a cause for him to love the one who sends salaat upon him (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">35. It is a means for the guidance of the person and for his heart to have life…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">36. (It is a cause for the one who sends salaat upon him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to have his name presented to him, and for his being mentioned to him&#8230;) **</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">37. (It is a cause for the feet to be planted firmly upon the Siraat, and for the person&#8221;s passing over it&#8230;) **</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">38. That sending salaat upon him fulfils the slightest part of his right…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">39. That it comprises remembrance of Allaah and thankfulness to Him, and recognition of His Favour upon His servants in sending him. So the one who sends salaat upon him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) includes in his salaat upon him remembrance of Allaah and remembrance of His Messenger…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">40. That salaat upon him from the person is supplication (du&#8217;aa), and the persons du&#8217;aa. to his Lord and his requests to his Lord are of two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) His requesting his own needs and concerns, and whatever he requires throughout the night and the day. So this is supplication and request, and is to give precedence to that which the servant loves and seeks;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) His requesting that He should extol His chosen and beloved servant, and increase him in nobility and honour, and make mention of him, and elevate him. So there is no doubt that Allaah-the Most High-loves that, and his Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) loves it. So the one who sends salaat upon him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) has turned his requests, that which he desires, and that which he seeks towards that which is loved by Allaah-the Most High- and His Messenger; and he has given preference to that over his own needs and requirements. Indeed this that he seeks has become the most beloved of things to him, and that which he most prefers. So he has given preference to that which Allaah and His Messenger love over that which he himself loves. So he has given preference to Allaah and to what He loves over everything else, and recompense conforms to the action. So whoever gives preference to Allaah over everything else, then Allaah will give preference to him over others…&#8221;&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">So the proof for the <em>shahaadah</em> (testification) is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allah bears witness that Laa ilaaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), and the angels, and those having knowledge (also give this witness); (He is always) maintaining His creation in Justice. Laa ilaah illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the All-Mighty, the All-Wise. [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 3:18] </strong><sup>33</sup><strong> </strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[33]:<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, he the most high, &#8220;<strong>He testified</strong>&#8220;: meaning He judged and He decreed and He informed and He made clear and He made it binding. So bearing witness from Allaah revolves around these five meanings: <strong>judging</strong>, <strong>decreeing</strong> , <strong>informing</strong> ,<strong>clarifying</strong> and <strong>making binding</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the meaning of, &#8220;He testified&#8221;, is He the Perfect and Most High decreed it upon His servants and He calls them to know of it and He informed them and He made it binding upon them that none has the right to be worshipped except Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<em>laa ilaaha</em>”, (none had the right to be worshipped): this is a negating ‘<em>laa’</em> which negates everything which is worshipped besides Allaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<em>illaahu</em>”, (except for Him): this affirms worship for Allaah alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the meaning of, &#8220;<em>annahu laailaaha illaahu</em>”, (none has the right to be worshipped but him): it means there is nothing that is worshipped rightfully except for Allaah the Perfect and Most High. As for those who are worshipped besides Allaah, then worship of it is false because of His saying He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>That is because Allaah, He is the true God deserving all worship and those whom they call upon besides Him are futile and false and Allaah He is the Most High the Most Great [22:62]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Perfect and Most High testifies to His unity and the right to all worship and He is the most truthful One Who speaks and His bearing witness He the Perfect and Most High is the truest testification there can be because it comes from One Who is All-Wise, All-Aware, All-Knowing, he knows everything so therefore it is a testification which is true.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And the Angels&#8221;:</strong></span> they testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Him and they are a species of beings whom Allaah created to worship Him. They are honourable Angels, honoured servants, Allaah created them to worship Him. They declare His perfection night and day, and they never slacken. And also Allaah created them to carry out His commands in the creation, He entrusted them with implementing whatever He commanded, He the Perfect and Most High, from the affairs of the creation. So every Angel from them is entrusted with a duty. And their testification is a true testification, because they are people of knowledge, and of ‘<em>ibaadah</em> (worship) and of <em>ma‘rifah</em> (awareness) of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. And they are from the most excellent of the creation, along with the point of disagreement which is are the righteous humans more excellent than the Angels, or are the Angels more excellent than the righteous humans there being disagreement about that point.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And the people of knowledge”:</strong></span> they are of two categories: the Angels, and the second category are the Possessors of Knowledge from mankind. And the Possessors of Knowledge do not testify except with something that is true, contrary to the case with those who are ignorant people, for their testification is not counted. And every species from the creation of Allaah bears witness for Allaah of His Unity and that none has the right to be worshipped but Him. And this is a case of showing the honour and nobility of the people of knowledge since Allaah joined their testification along with His testification, He the Perfect and Most High, and with the testification of His Angels. He counted the testification of the people of knowledge from the creation, and this shows their excellence and their nobility and their status, and they are testifying to the greatest matter that can be testified to, and it is <em>at-Taw<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>eed</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what is meant by the Possessors of Knowledge – are the people of knowledge of the Legislation (i.e. Islaamic knowledge), not as is said by some people that people of knowledge means the people of industry and agriculture, so those people, it is not said about them that they are People of Knowledge unrestrictedly, because their knowledge is limited in scope and is restricted, rather it is to be said, “this person is knowledgeable about arithmetic, this person is knowledgeable about engineering, this person is knowledgeable about medicine”, but it is not said about them that they are the People of Knowledge unrestrictedly. Because this term is not used unrestrictedly except for the people who have Islaamic knowledge. And also most of those people are people who have only wordly knowledge, and amongst them are atheists whose knowledge mostly only increases them in ignorance concerning Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and in self delusion and in atheism as you can see today in the disbelieving nations, that they are advanced with regards to industries and with regards to agriculture, however they are disbelievers. So how could it be said that they are the People of Knowledge, those whom Allaah has mentioned in His saying, “and the Possessors of Knowledge”. This is not at all feasible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It is only those who have Knowledge amongst His slaves that fear Allaah [35:28]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant is the scholars of Islaamic knowledge, those who truly know Allaah and who truly worship Him and who fear Him. As for those people, then most of them do not fear Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. Rather they disbelieve in Allaah and deny Him, and they claim that the world has no Lord and that rather nature brought it about and controls it, as is the case with the communists – they reject the Lord, the Perfect and Most High, even though they have worldly knowledge. So how then could we say – those people, they are the People of Knowledge?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an error. So the term ‘Knowledge’ is not applied unrestrictedly except to its true people, and it is a noble title which cannot be applied to atheists and disbelievers, such that it is said, “they are the people of Knowledge”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Angels and the possessors of Knowledge, they bear witness to Allaah’s Unity and sole right to worship. Therefore the saying of others besides them from the atheists and the people of <em>shirk</em> and the Sabeans, those who disbelieve in Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, is not counted. Those people, they are not counted, neither they nor their saying, because it is something contrary to the testification of Allaah and the testification of His Angels and the testification of those possessing knowledge from His Creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, “<em>Qaa’imambil-Qis<span style="text-decoration:underline;">t</span></em>”, (maintaining justice): this phrase is in the accusative case indicating a state along with, ‘He bore witness’ – meaning whilst establishing justice, He the Perfect and Most High. And the word, “<em>al-Qis<span style="text-decoration:underline;">t</span></em>”, means <em>al-‘adl</em> (justice) – meaning Allaah the Perfect and Most High establishes justice in everything, and <em>al-‘adl</em> (justice), is the opposite of <em>al-jawr</em> (injustice), and He the Perfect and Most High is a just judge, nothing but justice comes from Him in everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<em>Laa ilaaha illahu</em>”, (none has the right to be worshipped but Him): this emphasizes the first sentence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<em>Al-‘Azeez-ul-<span style="text-decoration:underline;">H</span>akeem</em>”, (the Almighty the All-Wise): these are two Names of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, comprising two Attributes from His Attributes, and they are <em>al-‘Izzah</em> (Might) and <em>al-<span style="text-decoration:underline;">H</span>ikmah</em> (Wisdom).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Haafiz `Abdul-`Azeem <strong>al-Mundhiree</strong> -rahimahullaah- (d. 656 H) said in &#8220;<strong>at-Targheeb wat-Tarheeb</strong>&#8221; [1] (The Book of Repentance and Abstention: Chapter (6): An encouragement upon Abstention (<strong>Zuhd</strong>) with regard to this world, and sufficing with a small amount from it):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And from Ibraaheem -meaning al-Ashtar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That death approached Aboo Dharr, whilst he was at ar-Rabadhah [2], so his wife wept. He said: “What causes you to weep?” She said: “I weep because I cannot do anything for you, and I have<strong> no cloth large enough to shroud you in</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: “Do not weep, for I heard Allaah&#8221;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) say one day, [and I was with him, in a group of people]: &lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#008000;">A man from amongst you will certainly die in a desert area: a group of the Believers will be present at his funeral.</span></strong> &gt;&gt; He said: “ So everyone who was along with me in that gathering has died within a group of people or separately [3] , and none from them remain except for me; and I am in a part of the desert, dying. So go out and watch the road, for you shall soon see what I say, for, by Allaah! I have not lied, nor have I been lied to.” She said: “ How can that occur, when the people travelling for Hajj have ceased?” He said: “ Watch the road.” He said: So whilst she was doing so, a group of people could be seen moving along quickly upon their riding camels, (looking) as if they were vultures [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the people came, until they stood over her, and said: “What is wrong with you?” She said:“ There is a man of the Muslims for you to shroud, and thus be rewarded for it.” They said: “Who is he?” She said: “Aboo Dharr.” So they declared that may their fathers and mothers be a ransom for him, and they hung their whips upon the necks of their camels, and they hastened to him. So he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> “Receive glad tidings, for you are the group about whom Allaah&#8221;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said what he said. So today I have entered the morning as you see me; and if I had a garment of mine that were sufficient to shroud me in, then I would not be shrouded in anything else besides it. So I implore you, by Allaah, let not a man from amongst you shroud me who has been a chief, a governor, or an official messenger.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So all of the people had attained something from that, except for a youth from the Ansaar who was with the people. He said: “ I am your companion: there are two garments in my travelling bag that were woven by my mother, and the newest of my garments are these two that I am wearing.” He said: “ You are my companion, [so you shroud me].”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Reported by Ahmad, and the wording is his, and its narrators are the narrators of the &#8220;Saheeh&#8221;; and by al-Bazzaar -with its like, in abridged form&#8230;”. Shaikh al-Albaanee said: &#8220;Hasan&#8221;.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] &#8220;Saheehut-Targheeb wat-Tarheeb&#8221; (3/295-296/no.3314) of Shaikh al-Albaanee &#8211; rahimahullaah, and the additions in square brackets were included by the Shaikh from the original hadeeth in the &#8220;Musnad&#8221; of Imaam Ahmad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] A village at a distance of three days journey from al-Madeenah, Aboo Dharr -radiyallaahu `anhu- took up residence here until his death in 32 H (&#8220;Mu`jamul-Buldaan&#8221;:1/24).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Shaikh al-Albaanee&#8221;s checked edition has the word &#8220;furqah&#8221;(separately), as occurs in some of the editions of the &#8220;Musnad&#8221;. In other editions of Musnad Ahmad, and in the &#8220;Daar ulHadeeth, Cairo edition of &#8220;at-Targheeb&#8221; there occurs here &#8220;qaryah&#8221; (a village); and in &#8220;alFathur-Rabbaanee&#8221; (no. 11, 916) there occurs &#8220;rifqah&#8221;(amongst companions).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Shaikh al-Albaanee said: “ Perhaps the angle of their resemblance to vultures was on account of their having the dirt of travelling upon them.”</p>

And whose Ability is such and these are the things which He has created, He the Exalted and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And, “<strong><em>Tabaarak</em></strong>”: is a verb which is used specifically for Him, He the Perfect, so it cannot be applied to anyone besides Him. And <strong><em>al-Barakah</em></strong> (blessing) it means abundance of good and its increase, and the blessings which come from Allaah the Majestic and Most High do not end. As for a created being, it cannot be said about him, “<strong><em>tabaarak</em></strong>”. Rather it can be said to him, “<strong><em>mubaarak</em></strong>” meaning, “May you receive blessing”, meaning may Allaah put blessing into him and make him blessed. And all blessing is from Allaah the Perfect and Most High.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><em><strong>The Forbiddence Of Adhering Blindly To The Saying Of A Scholar In Opposition To An Authentic Text, And The Severe Rebuke Due Upon One Who Is Guilty Of This (Part I)</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn `Abdil-Wahhaab – rahimahullaah – said in &#8220;Fathul-Majeed‟ (2/527-530), in explanation of the saying of Ibn `Abbaas – radiyallaahu `anhumaa &#8211; :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Stones will soon fall upon you from the sky. I say: Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said…, and you say: Aboo Bakr and `Umar said!”</span> :-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“…This saying from Ibn `Abbaas – radiyallaahu `anhumaa – was a response to those who said to him: &#8220;Aboo Bakr and `Umar &#8211; radiyallaahu `anhumaa – did not hold joining the `Umrah along with the Hajj (at-tamattu`), and they held that performing Hajj on its own (al-Ifraad) is better‟, or the like of that…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in summary, it was because of this that Ibn `Abbaas said, when they countered the Hadeeth with the opinion of Aboo Bakr and `Umar -: “Stones are about to fall upon you from the sky…” – the hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <strong>Imaam ash-Shaafi`ee</strong> – rahimahullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The scholars are agreed, by consensus, that whoever is such that the Sunnah of Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) becomes clear to him, then it is not for him to leave it for the saying of anyone.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <strong>Imaam Maalik</strong> – rahimahullaahu ta`aalaa – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There is none of us except that he rebuts and is rebutted, except for the occupant of this grave (صلى الله عليه وسلم)”,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and the speech of the imaams with this meaning is abundant…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…So the speech of Ibn `Abbaas – radiyallaahu `anhumaa – shows that whoever receives a textual proof, and he does not accept it, because of taqleed (blind-following) of his imaam, then it is obligatory to criticize him severely, because of his opposing the proof.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Imaam Ahmad said: “Ahmad ibn `Umar al-Bazzaar narrated to us: Ziyaad ibn Ayyoob narrated to us: Aboo `Ubaydah al-Haddaad narrated to us: from Maalik ibn Deenaar: from `Ikrimah: from Ibn `Abbaas, who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There is not one of us except that some of his sayings are taken, and some are left; except for the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore it is obligatory to criticise whoever leaves the proof in favour of anyone from the scholars, no matter who that is. The recorded sayings of the imaams clearly state this; and state that <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘taqleed’ (blind-following) is not allowable except in matters of ijtihaad (personal deduction) for which no proof is found in the Book or the Sunnah</strong></span>. So this is what some of the scholars meant by their saying: <em>‘There is to be no criticism in the matters of ijtihaad (personal deduction).’</em> As for the one who acts contrary to the Book and the Sunnah, then it is obligatory to refute him; just as was said by Ibn `Abbaas, ash-Shaafi`ee, Maalik, and Ahmad – and this is something agreed upon, as has preceded in the speech of Imaam ash-Shaafi`ee &#8211; rahimahullaahu ta`aalaa…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><em><strong>The Forbiddence Of Adhering Blindly To The Saying Of A Scholar In Opposition To An Authentic Text, And The Severe Rebuke Due Upon One Who Is Guilty Of This (Part II)</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn `Abdil-Wahhaab – rahimahullaah – said in &#8220;Fathul-Majeed‟ (2/532), in explanation of the saying of Imaam Ahmad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I am amazed at a people who are aware of the chain of narration and its authenticity, and yet they hold on to the opinion of Sufyaan, whereas Allaah – the Most High – says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So let those who oppose the Messenger‟s command beware, lest a fitnah (affliction) befalls him, or a painful torment be inflicted upon him</span>.[Sooratun-Noor (24):63]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do you know what the affliction is? The affliction is <strong>Shirk</strong>. Perhaps if he rejects something from his saying, some deviation will fall into his heart and he is destroyed.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So the saying of Imaam Ahmad – rahimahullaah – “I am amazed at a people who are aware of the chain of narration and its authenticity…” is a criticism from him of that; and shows that it leads to deviation of the hearts, which causes a person to become a Disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">So this evil has become extremely widespread, particularly amongst those who claim attachment to knowledge. They do whatever they can to prevent people from acting upon the Book and the Sunnah; and they block people from following the Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), and from honouring and respecting his commands and prohibitions. So from that is their saying: &#8220;No one except a &#8220;mujtahid‟ can use the Book and the Sunnah as proof, and &#8220;ijtihaad‟ has ended‟, and the saying: &#8220;This person who I am blindly following knows better than you do about hadeeth, and about the abrogating and abrogated narrations‟, and the like of these sayings, whose goal is just the abandonment of following of the Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم): he who does not speak from his own desires, in favour of dependence upon sayings of those who can err, and who is contradicted by other imaams and whose saying can be nullified by a textual proof. So there is not an imaam except that he only possessed a portion of knowledge; he did not possess all of it. So what is obligatory upon every legally responsible person, when a proof from the Book of Allaah or the Sunnah of His Messenger reaches him, and he understands its meaning, is that he accepts it and acts upon it, no matter who contradicts it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is just as He – the Most High – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Follow what has been sent down to you from your Lord; and do not take others besides Him: obeying them in disobedience to Him. Little do you remember!</span> [Sooratul-A`raaf (7):3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He – the Most High – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Is it not sufficient for them that We sent down to you this Book which is recited to them?! In it there is mercy and a reminder for those who believe in it</span> [Sooratul-`Ankaboot (29):51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A statement of the consensus (ijmaa`) upon that has already preceded [1] , and an explanation that the blind-follower (muqallid) is not from the people of knowledge; and Aboo `Umar ibn `Abdil-Barr and others also report ijmaa` (consensus) upon that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[1] Transl. Note: [i.e. from Imaam ash-Shaafi`ee.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: And no one disagrees with this except for the ignorant ones from the blind-followers, because of their ignorance of the Book and the Sunnah, and because of their turning away from these two. So those people, even if they think that they are following the imaams, then in reality they have only contradicted them and followed other than their way. So we have already quoted the saying of Maalik, ash-Shaafi`ee, and Ahmad. <strong>However in the speech of Ahmad – rahimahullaah – there is an indication that &#8220;taqleed‟ (blind-following) before the proof reaches is not blameworthy; rather it is only criticised for one whom the proof has reached, and he opposes it in favour of the saying of one of the imaams.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this only comes about as a result of their turning away from seeking to understand the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger; and turning instead to the books of the later people, and sufficing with them to the exclusion of the two parts of Revelation. So this resembles what occurred with the People of the Book: those about whom Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">They took their scholars and monks as lords besides Allaah</span> [Sooratut-Tawbah (9):31],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">an explanation of which will follow in the hadeeth of `Adiyy ibn Haatim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is binding upon the one who is sincere is that when he reads the books of the scholars, and examines them, and becomes aware of their sayings, that he submits them to what is found in the Book, and the Sunnah; for every mujtahid from the scholars, and those who follow him and ascribe themselves to his madhhab, must mention his evidence; and the truth in any matter is one; and the imaams are rewarded for their ijtihaad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore the justly balanced person makes examination of their speech, and consideration of it a path to acquiring awareness of the different issues, and a means to bring them to mind, and a way to distinguish what is correct from what is incorrect – by means of the evidences which those who use the evidences mention; so that in this way he will become aware of which scholar was most fortunate in having the proof.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the proofs for this fundamental principle are more than can be enumerated, in the Book of Allaah and in the Sunnah likewise….</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the imaams – rahimahumullaah – did not fall short in clarifying this matter. Rather they forbade that they be followed blindly when the Sunnah becomes clear, because they knew that there were matters of knowledge unknown to them, and that this knowledge could reach others, and this occurs a great deal; and this will not be hidden from one who examines the sayings of the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Haneefah – rahimahullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“When a hadeeth comes from Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) then it is upon the head and the eyes; and if something comes from the Companions – radiyallaahu `anhum – then upon the head and the eyes; and if something comes from the Taabi`een, then we are men and they were men.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“If I say a saying, and the Book of Allaah contradicts it, then abandon my saying in favour of the Book of Allaah.” It was said: &#8220;If the saying of Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) contradicts it?‟ He said: “Abandon my saying for the narration of the Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم). It was said: &#8220;If the saying of the Companions contradicts it?‟ He said: “Abandon my saying for the saying of the Companions.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And ar-Rabee` said: I heard ash-Shaafi`ee – rahimahullaah – say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“If you find in my book something contrary to the Sunnah of Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), then take hold of the Sunnah of Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and leave whatever I said.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“When a hadeeth is authentic with something contrary to my saying, then throw my saying against the wall.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Maalik said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Everyone is such that some of his sayings are taken and some are left, except for Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the like of this has already been mentioned from him, so there is no excuse for a blind-follower (muqallid) after this… .”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><em><strong>Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Saalih Al-`Uthaymeen On ‘Taqleed’ (Blindfollowing)</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-`Uthaymeen – rahimahullaah – said in &#8220;al-Qawlul-Mufeed `alaa Kitaabit-Tawheed‟ (2/152):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Some people commit a grievous mistake when it is said to them: &#8220;Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said‟, he says: &#8220;But in the book of so and so there occurs such and such.‟ So it is upon him to fear Allaah, Who said to him in His Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And the Day when Allaah will call to them, and say, &#8220;What response did you give to the Messengers?</span> [Sooratul-Qasas (28):65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He did not say: &#8220;What response did you give to so and so?‟ As for the author of the book, then if it is known that he loves good, and intends good, then supplication for forgiveness and mercy is made for him if he errs. It is not to be said that he is infallible, and his saying used to contradict the saying of the Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم).”</p>

<p>This short clip was extracted by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/">AbdurRahman.Org</a> from # 01 of the Audio Series: <strong><a title="Permanent Link to Explanation of Aqeedah at-Tahaawiyyah – Dawud Burbank [Audio|En]" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/25/explanation-of-aqeedah-at-tahaawiyyah-dawud-burbank/" rel="bookmark">Explanation of Aqeedah at-Tahaawiyyah</a> </strong>– Dawud Burbank [Audio|En]</p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Transcription of the above audio clip:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aqeedah (creed and belief) is the <strong>foundation</strong> of the religion and it (&#8216;aqeedah) is what is contained in the <strong>testification</strong> (shahaadah) that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah. And it is the first pillar from the pillars of Islaam.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, it is an <strong>obligation to give importance</strong> to it (`aqeedah) and to give care and attention to it and to acquire knowledge of it and knowledge of whatever will damage it so that the person can be upon clear insight and can be upon a correct creed and belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since if the person&#8217;s religion is established upon a sound, correct foundation then it will be a straight and true religion that he is upon &#8211; one that is acceptable to Allaah and if it (his religion) is based upon a shaky or disturbed `aqeedah (creed) or if his religion is based upon an &#8216;aqeedah (creed) which is corrupt then his religion will not be correct and it will be without a foundation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this is why the <strong>scholars</strong> rahimahumullaah used to give importance to the affair of &#8216;aqeedah and they were not laxed about explaining it in their lessons and whenever they had an opportunity. The later person used to transmit it from the one who came before him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <strong>Companions</strong> radiyAllaahu `anhum did not have any doubts about what came in the Qur&#8217;aan and what came in the Sunnah of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu`alayhi wa sallam. So their `aqeedah (creed and belief) was based upon the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu`alayhi wa sallam and they were not afflicted by any doubt in that regard nor any hesitation. So, whatever Allaah said and whatever His Messenger sallAllaahu`alayhi wa sallam said, they took it as their creed and belief and they took it as their religion. And they did not need any further book to be written for them after that since this was something fully accepted by them and something that was certain with them; their creed (&#8216;aqeedah) was the Book and the Sunnah. And then their students proceeded upon that from the <strong>Taabi`een</strong> (the next generation after the Companions) &#8211; those who took from them. So, there was no disputing in `aqeedah (creed and belief); it was an affair which was fully accepted (undisputed); and their source was the Book and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But when the <strong>sects and the differences</strong> arose and appeared, and when people entered into the religion who were such that the creed and `aqeedah was not firmly grounded in his heart or those who entered into Islaam whilst still carrying some deviated ideas with them, and when there arose in Islaam people who did not refer back to the Book nor to the Sunnah in `aqeedah, rather, they referred back to principles and methodologies which had been established by people of misguidance by themselves. When all of this happened then the a&#8217;immah (the imaams) of Islaam at this time needed to clarify (make explanation and clarification of) the correct `aqeedah (belief and creed) and they needed to carefully record it and write it down and narrate it from the scholars of the Ummah. So therefore, they wrote down the <strong>books of creed and belief</strong> and they gave attention to that; and this became a reference for those who came after them from the Ummah and it will be so until the establishment of the last Hour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is an example of the Protection of Allaah, the Most High for this religion and Allaah&#8217;s taking care of this religion &#8211; that He provided for it trustworthy carriers to convey it just as it came from Allaah and His Messenger and to repel the false interpretations of the negators and the false declarations of the Creator&#8217;s being like the creation<span style="color:#000000;"><a style="color:#000000;" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/belief/aqeedah/">.</a> </span>So these scholars came and passed on as inheritance this creed (`aqeedah), the later ones taking it from the earlier ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from as-Salaf as-Saalih (the pious predecessors) who used to be upon the sound and firm belief and creed (i`tiqaad) taken from Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu`alayhi wa sallam and from his Companions and from the Taabi`een were the <strong>four imaams</strong>: Imaam Aboo Haneefah, Imaam Maalik, Imaam ash-Shaafi`ee and Imaam Ahmad and others from the imaams, those who stood and defended the correct `aqeedah (belief and creed) and who confirmed it, explained it and taught it to the students.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <strong>followers of the four imaams</strong> (their students who came after them) used to give attention to this creed and belief; they used to study it and caused their students to learn it. And many books were written about it upon the methodology of the Book and the Sunnah and upon what the chosen Messenger, al-Mustafaa sallAllaahu`alayhi wa sallam was upon and his companions radiyAllaahu `anhum and the Taabi`een. So, they refuted the false beliefs and the deviated beliefs, and they clearly explained how they were counterfeit and baseless. And the same was done by the <strong>imaams of hadeeth</strong> such as: Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh and al-Bukhaaree and Muslim and Imaam Ibn Khuzaymah and Imaam Ibn Qutaybah; and from the imaams of tafseer (explanation) of the Qur&#8217;aan such as Imaam at-Tabaree and Imaam Ibn Katheer and Imaam al-Baghwee and others from the imaams of tafseer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They (all) wrote works in this regard (explaining the correct belief) and they called them <strong>Kutub As-Sunnah</strong> &#8211; books of the Sunnah; for example, Kitaab as-Sunnah of Ibn Abee `Aasim and the book as- Sunnah of `Abdullaah ibn Ahmad ibn Hanbal and the book as-Sunnah of Al-Khallaal and the book ash-Sharee`ah of Al-Aajurree and other than that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] As is shown by the hadeeth of Ibn `Umar radiyAllaahu anhumaa who said, &#8220;Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu`alayhi wa sallam said, &#8216;Islaam is built upon five: the shahaadah (testification) that none had the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and correct establishment of the prayer, and giving the zakaat, and the hajj, and fasting in Ramadaan&#8217;.&#8221; The hadeeth is reported by Bukhaaree as no.8 and reported by Muslim.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Sharh-ul-Usool-ith-Thalaathah by Shaikh Saalih al-Fawzaan<br />
Translated by Dawud Burbank rahimahullaah<br />
</strong>Below in the Transcription of the Audio Explanation of Dawud Burbank</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And that the places of prayer are to be for Allaah alone, so do not invoke or worship anyone along with Allaah. [72:18]</strong><sup>9</sup><strong> </strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is not pleased that anyone should be associated with Him, no matter who it is, and this is stated clearly in the Book and in the Sunnah, however, to one who uses the intellect and who thinks carefully, and who discards blind following and the use of false and futile excuses, and who is alert to his own benefit. And the proof that Allaah is not pleased that anyone else besides Him should be associated with Him no matter who it is, is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And that the places of prayer are to be for Allaah alone, so do not invoke or worship anyone along with Allaah. [72:18]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Masaajid, </em>(the mosques), are the houses of Allaah and they are the places which are prepared for the <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">S</span>alaah </em>(prayer) and they are the most beloved of places to Allaah, and they are houses which Allaah has commanded should be raised and in which His Name should be mentioned. Then these mosques must be made a place for the worship of Allaah alone, nothing for other than Allaah must occur within them, so graves are not to be built in them, nor tombs because the Prophet <span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam cursed those who did that, and he informed that this is the practice of the Jews and the Christians and he forbade us from that at the end of his life, whilst he was in the throes of death <em>‘alaihi<span style="text-decoration:underline;">ss</span>alaatuwassalaam</em> with his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Indeed those who came before you used to take the graves as places of prayer…” </strong> (he said this whilst he was dying), <strong>“…Indeed do not take the graves as places of prayer, for I certainly forbid you from that.”</strong><strong>[1]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah’s curse is upon the Jews and the Christians, they took the graves of their Prophets as places of prayer.”</strong><strong>[2]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the mosques, it is obligatory that they be purified from traces of <em>shirk</em> and idolatory and that they not be built upon the graves, nor should the dead be buried in them after they have been built, rather they should be places for the worship of Allaah alone, the prayer should be established in them, and the Name of Allaah should be mentioned in them, and the Qur’aan should be recited in them, and beneficial lessons should be established in them, and people should remain in them for worship. This is the role of the mosques.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for having in them idols which are worshipped besides Allaah, then these are not mosques, these are shrines of <em>shirk</em>, even if their people call them mosques, because Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And that the mosques, the places of prayer, are for Allaah [72:18]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: not for anyone else besides Him. And because the mosques, they are the place where the people gather and meet, so it is obligatory that they should be pure and free of <em>shirk</em> and <em>bid‘ah </em>(innovations) and false superstitions, because the people acquire knowledge in them and worship, so if anything from shirk and false superstitions are found in the mosques, then they will be influenced by that and they will propagate it upon earth, so it is obligatory that mosques should be purified from <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the greatest of them is <em>al-Masjid-ul-<span style="text-decoration:underline;">H</span>araam </em>(the Sacred Mosque, in Makkaah), just as Allaah, the Majestic and Most High commanded that it should be purified, He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And remember when We showed the site for the House to Ibraaheem and commanded him, that you should not associate anything with Me, and purify My house, for those people who are performing <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">T</span>awaaf</em> and for those who are standing in prayer and performing the bowing and prostration. [22:26]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Purify it from what? Purify it from <em>shirk</em>, and from innovations and false superstitions, just as it is also to be purified from impurities and filthy things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Do not call upon or invoke [72:18]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The, “<em>laa”</em>, is the, ‘no of prohibition’. And the, “<em>tad‘oo</em>”, is a present tense verb which is in the jussive form because of the prohibiting, <em>“laa”</em>, and the sign that it is the jussive form is the removal of the, <em>‘noon’</em>. So the factor which makes it jussive is the, ‘no of prohibition’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So do not invoke, O people, anyone along with Allaah, do not supplicate for help from anyone along with Allaah, such as saying, “O Allaah, O Mu<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>ammad”, “O Allaah, O Abd-ul-Qaadir”, or saying, “O Abd-ul-Qaadir, O Mu<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>ammad”, or the like of that, because Allaah is not pleased with that and will not accept it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying He the Most High, “<em>a<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>adan</em>”, (anyone): is in indefinite form in the context of a prohibition, so therefore it is general to everyone, no-one is excepted, neither any angel drawn close nor any prophet sent, nor any idol, nor any object of worship, nor any grave, nor any Shaikh, nor any beloved servant of Allaah, nor any living person, nor any dead person, no matter who it is.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is general covering everyone who is called upon besides Allaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So do not call upon, do not invoke anyone along with Allaah. [72:18]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this <em>aayah</em> shows that worship will not benefit except with <em>taw<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>eed, </em>and that if <em>shirk</em> is mixed with it, then it becomes null and void and it will be an affliction for the person. Then He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the places of prayer are for Allaah [72:18]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory that they be built purely and sincerely, that the intention of the one building them should not be to show off or to be heard of or to be remembered as they say, or to be just Islaamic antiquities, all of this is futile.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mosques should be built for worship and with the intention of worship, and the intention in them should be purely and sincerely for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and also they should be built from good and pure earnings, they should not be built from forbidden earnings because they are for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allah does not accept except what is good and pure”</strong><strong>[3]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the mosques are to be built from lawful spending and the intention of their builders is that it is to be done purely and sincerely seeking the Face of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, he should not intend by building it to obtain praise from the people, or to be remembered, or for show, or to be heard of, because building the mosques is worship and worship, it is obligatory that it should be done purely and sincerely for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">(From &#8216;As-Saheehah&#8217; (no. 2604) of Shaikh al-Albaanee -rahimahullaah):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Khuraym ibn Faatik al-Asadee -radiyallaahu `anhu- that the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;The people are four, and the deeds are six.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the people are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[i] one granted plenty in this world and in the Hereafter, and</strong><br />
<strong> [ii] one granted plenty in this world, poor in the Hereafter and,</strong><br />
<strong> [iii] one poor in this world, granted plenty in the Hereafter and,</strong><br />
<strong> [iv] one wretched in this world and in the Hereafter;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and the deeds are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[i &amp; ii] The two which are binding, and</strong><br />
<strong> [iii &amp; iv] like for like, and</strong><br />
<strong> [v] ten times more, and</strong><br />
<strong> [vi] seven hundred times more:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[i &amp; ii] So the two which are binding are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever dies as a Muslim, a Believer, not associating anything with Allaah &#8211; then Paradise is binding for him; and whoever dies as a Disbeliever &#8211; then the Fire is binding for him; and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[iii &amp; iv] Whoever intends an evil deed but does not do it, and Allaah knows that his heart felt it and he desired it, then it is written as a good deed for him; and whoever intended an evil deed then it is not written against him; and whoever did it then it is written as one, and it is not multiplied for him, and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[v] whoever did a good deed &#8211; then ten times its like is written for him, and [vi] whoever spends something in Allaah&#8217;s cause, then it is multiplied for him seven hundred times over. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">Reported by Ahmad (4/345), Ibn Hibbaan (no.31), and Ibn Abee Shaybah in his &#8216;Musnad&#8217; (2/38/2).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaanee declared its chain of narration to be &#8216;Saheeh&#8217;.<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">[78]<span style="color:#008000;"> And the Mi`raaj (the ascent through the Heavens) is true; and the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa `alaa aalihi wa sallam, was taken on a Night-Journey</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[80] <span style="color:#008000;">Then, to whatever higher places Allaah wished. And Allaah bestowed honour upon him with whatever He wished.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[81] <span style="color:#008000;">And He revealed to him what He revealed to him, {And the heart did not lie about what it saw.}</span> (Sooratun-Najm (53) aayah 11)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Shar<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>-ul-U<span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>ool-ith-Thalaathah by Shaikh Saalih al-Fawzaan<br />
Explained by Dawud Burbank rahimahullaah<br />
Below are the Excerpts from Transcribed Audio</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah completed the religion through him and the proof is His saying, He the Most High: <span style="color:#008000;">«<strong>This day, I have completed your religion for you, perfected My blessings upon you, and am pleased with <em>Islaam</em> as your Religion</strong>.»</span> <strong>[5:3]</strong><sup>[68]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[68] He <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span></em><em>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> did not pass away until after Allaah had completed the religion and the favour through him and had sent down to him His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">«<strong>This day, I have completed your religion for you, perfected My blessings upon you, and am pleased with <em>Islaam</em> as your Religion</strong>.»</span> <strong>[5:3]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>aayah</em> came down to the Prophet <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> whilst he was performing the standing in <em>`Arafah</em> during the Farewell Hajj on the Day of <em>Jumu`ah</em>. And he <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> lived after it for a short time and then moved on to the highest company (of angels).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he left his nation upon <strong><em>al-ma<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>ajjah al-baydaa</em> (the clear white path)</strong> whose night is the same as its day; no one deviates from it except that he is destroyed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>aayah</em> contains a testimony from Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, that this religion is complete and that it covers everything of benefit to the servants and that it contains a solution for all of their issues and problems until the Establishment of the Hour. And that is suitable for every time and place; they do not need any other legislation after it or any other book to come down or any other messenger to be sent after the Messenger <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>.<strong>           </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, there is no matter to be found and there is no event that will occur until the Day of Resurrection except that in the Legislation revealed to Muhammad <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> there is a solution for it and the ruling concerning it. However, the matter relates back to who is competent to extract evidence and to derive proof, rulings and issues. If there are to be found <em>ahlul-`ilm</em> (people of knowledge) and people qualified to make <em>ijtihaad</em> (personal deductions in rulings) who fulfill the conditions of <em>ijtihaad</em>, then indeed, this legislation is complete and contains a solution for all problems. Deficiency only comes about from us from the aspect of deficiency in (our) knowledge and inability to fully understand what Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, has sent down &#8211; or from the aspect of desires, that there occurs a case of following of desires which diverts a person away from the Truth. Otherwise this religion is fully suitable and comprehensive and complete. Allaah has sufficed the <em>Islaamic</em> nation with it until the establishment of the hour if it acts upon it (the religion) correctly and refers back to it in its affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">«<strong>So if you disagree about anything then refer it back to Allaah and the Messenger</strong>.»</span> <strong>[4:59]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Referring back to Allaah is to refer back to the Book of Allaah, and referring back to the Messenger after his passing away is to refer back to his <em>Sunnah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">« <strong>And whatever you disagree about then its judgment is to be referred to Allaah</strong>.»</span><strong> [42:10]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>aayah</em> (from <em>Soorah al-Maa.idah</em>) contains a refutation of those who make accusations against the <em>Islaamic</em> Legislation of its having shortcomings or of its being deficient, (these accusations coming) from the atheists and the evil heretics, or from the “semi students” whose understanding falls short in being able to understand the hidden wisdoms of the <em>Islaamic</em> Legislation. Therefore, these (foolish people) ascribe deficiency to the <em>Islaamic</em> Legislation and they do not know that the deficiency is with themselves alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it (this <em>aayah</em>) contains a refutation against those who accuse the <em>Islaamic</em> Legislation of deficiency and that it does not cover all needs of the servants and all matters of welfare of the servants until the Establishment of the Hour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or those who say: &#8220;It was specific to a certain olden times,&#8221; &#8211; because there are many ignorant people who, when it is said to them, &#8220;This is the <em>Islaamic</em> ruling,&#8221; they say, &#8220;That was in the time of the Messenger and the initial time. As for now, conditions have changed and the matters have altered; and the legislated rulings were for people who have now passed away and for problems that have come to an end.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say this, and this is disbelief in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and it is a denial of His Saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">«<strong>This day, I have completed your religion for you</strong>.»</span> <strong>[5:3]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah completed the religion for this nation until the Hour is established for every time and place and for every generation of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also contains a refutation of the innovators, those who introduce worship from themselves and ascribe it to the religion, when it has no proof from the Book of Allaah and the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. Rather they just introduce it in accordance with what they deem to be good or based upon blindly following others whom they have good thoughts about from the people of false ideas and people with their own goals and desires. So therefore, they introduce worship into the religion, which Allaah has sent down no proof for. He <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">«<strong>Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it, then it is rejected</strong>.»</span>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>`alaihi<span style="text-decoration:underline;">ss</span>alaatuwasallaam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">«<strong>And beware of newly introduced matters, for every newly introduced matter is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance</strong>.»</span>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever introduces acts of worship which have no proof from the Book of Allaah nor from the <em>Sunnah</em> of the Messenger of Allaah, then he is accusing this religion of not being complete and he wishes to complete the religion himself. He is not actually acknowledging the fact that Allaah has completed it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whatever was not religion in the time of the Prophet <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> will never be religion after him. So this contains a refutation of these groups: The group who say that <em>Islaam</em> is not suitable for every time, or those who innovate newly invented innovations which have no proof from the Book of Allaah nor the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger, and who ascribe them to the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>aayah</em> (from <em>Soorah al-Maa.idah</em>) contains a refutation of them because the religion was completed by Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. So there is no scope for addition in it nor for reduction from it. And there is no scope for raising doubts nor seeking to obscure the issue by saying that it is not suitable for the people in these later times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">«<strong>This day, I have completed your religion for you</strong>.»</span> <strong>[5:3]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Speech of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. He is the Most Truthful One of those who speak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">«<strong>And I perfected My blessings upon you, and am pleased with <em>Islaam</em> as your Religion</strong>.»</span> <strong>[5:3]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the last of that which came down to the Prophet <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> and it is a testimony from the Lord of the whole of the Creation for this religion that it is complete, comprehensive, and fully suitable for every time and place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying (in this <em>aayah</em>) is an address to this nation, from the first of it to the last of it, and it is not just an address to the first generation alone. Rather it is an address to the whole of the nation until the Hour is established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <em>ijmaa`</em> (consensus), the whole nation are agreed in consensus that he <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> passed away. No one disagrees about this except the people of false beliefs, those say that the Messenger did not die. They negate death from the Messenger <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>. This is baseless speech and speech which is clearly rejected. It is refuted by what has been experienced and what is clearly the case, for the Messenger <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> indeed passed away amongst his Companions. He was bathed, shrouded, had the funeral prayer prayed over him and he was buried. Can these actions be carried out on a person who is still alive?  He <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> was treated as one who had died. He was washed and shrouded and prayed over and then he <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> was buried in his grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the way of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, with regards to His Creation. And then where are the Messengers who came before him? What occurred to him occurred to the Messengers before him. They died. And he is one of them, so he died. This is by consensus of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah</em>. No one disagrees about this except the people of false beliefs, those who seek to attach themselves to the Messenger <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> and seek deliverance through him besides Allaah, and say: &#8220;He is still alive.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> Shar<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>-ul-U<span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>ool-ith-Thalaathah by Shaikh Saalih al-Fawzaan<br />
Translated by Dawud Burbank rahimahullaah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">الثَّالِثَةُ: أَنَّ مَنْ أَطَاعَ الرَّسُوْلَ وَوَحَّدَ اللهَ لاَ يَجُوزُ لَهُ مُوَالاَةُ مَنْ حَادَّ اللهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَلَوْ كَانَ أَقْرَبَ قَرِيبٍ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third:</strong> <span style="color:#008000;">that whoever obeys the Messenger and singles out Allaah, then it is not permissible for him to love and ally himself with those who oppose Allaah and His Messenger, even if they be those most closely related to him</span>.<sup>10</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible for those who do that to have love and alliance to those who oppose Allaah and his Messenger, even if they be those most closely related to him. This is the matter of <em>Al-Walaa’ wal-Baraa’ </em>(Alliance and Dissociation), and it follows on from <em>taw<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>eed</em>, from the rights of <em>taw<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>eed</em> is to have love and alliance for the beloved servants of Allaah and to have dissociation from the enemies of Allaah. And the words, “<em>Al-Muwaalaat</em>”, and, “<em>Al-Walaa’</em>”, have one and the same meaning, and, “<em>Al-Walaa’</em>”, means having love in the heart, and it means aiding and assisting, and it means, in the matter of inheriting and payment of blood-monies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslim he loves and has alliance for the beloved servants of Allaah, meaning that he restricts his love to those who are beloved and obedient servants of Allaah, and he aids them, so the Muslim is with the Muslims, they are allies to each other. Just as He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And blood-relations are more entitled to inheritance from each other as decreed by Allaah. [8:75]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So payment of blood-monies for accidental killing occurs between the Muslims, and it is what is called mutual responsibility. All of this enters into alliance, so there is no alliance between a Muslim and an unbeliever, and love and aiding and inheriting and payment of blood-money and guardianship in marriage and guardianship in legal matters and so on, this does not occur between a Muslim and a disbeliver, rather this is between the Muslims, because of his saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And Allaah will never give a way to the unbelievers over the believers. [4:141]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory that the believers are distinguished from the disbelievers, so it is not permissible for one who singles out Allaah and obeys the Messenger <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span></em><em>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam</em> to have love and alliance with those who oppose Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And, “<em>Al-Mu<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>aaddah</em>”, (opposing), means that the person is upon one side, and Allaah and His Messenger and the believers are on the other side, and those who oppose are upon the side of the unbelievers in this opposition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “Even if that person is the most closely related to him”: meaning in lineage. So if your close relative is one who opposes Allaah and His Messenger, then it is obligatory upon you to oppose him and to cut off from him, and whoever is an obedient servant of Allaah and an ally to His Messenger, then it is obligatory upon you that you should love him and have alliance with him, even if he be far removed from you in lineage, even if he be a non-arab, or a black person, or a white person, or a red person, it is obligatory upon you to have love and alliance for him and that you love him, whether he is from your land, or whether he is from the farthest place in the East, or the farthest place in the West. He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the believing men and the believing women are friends and allies to each other. [9:71]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: between them there is love and mutual help and mutual aid, and between them there is to be affection, this is between the believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You will not find a people who truly believe in Allaah and the Last Day loving those who oppose Allaah and His Messenger even if they are their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kinsfolk. Rather Allaah has ordained true faith for their hearts and has strengthened them with strength from Him and He will enter them into gardens which have rivers flowing beneath their trees they shall remain forever therein. Allaah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. They are the party of Allaah. Indeed the party of Allaah are the ones who will be successful. [58:22]</strong></span><sup>11</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High, “You will not find”: this is an address to the Prophet <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam </em>meaning: this will not happen and will never exist, that one who is a true believer in Allaah and His Messenger will love the disbelievers, so if a person does love them, then he is not a true believer, even if he claims to be.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn-ul-Qayyim <em>ra<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>imahullaah</em> said in <em>Al-Kaafiyat-ush-Shaafiyah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Do you love the enemies of the beloved One and still claim,<br />
</em><em> That you love Him? That is not possible</em><em><br />
</em><em>And likewise you strive hard to oppose those He loves,<br />
</em><em>Where is the love O brother of Satan?</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is not possible ever, that he loves the disbelievers, whilst he says, “I love Allaah and His Messenger”, because of His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>O you who believe do not take My enemies and your enemies as friends and allies, for whom you have affection [60:1]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Up until His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>There is for you a fine example in Ibraaheem and those with him, when they said to their people, “We are free of you and whatever you worship besides Allaah, we have rejected you, and there has appeared between us and you enmity and hatred forever until you truly believe in Allaah and single Him out with all worship. [60:4]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And Ibraaheem’s seeking forgiveness for his father was only because of a promise which he had made to him. So when it became clear to him that he was an enemy to Allaah, then he dissociated himself from him. Indeed Ibraaheem is one who frequently supplicated to His Lord and who was forbearing. [9:114]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the religious way of Ibraaheem. He dissociated himself from his father, the closest of the people to him, when it became clear to him that he was an enemy to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>aayah</em> shows that having love for an unbeliever negates true faith in Allaah and in the Last Day, either in its very origin, or with regards to its completion. However, if love of them has with it supporting what they are upon and their unbelief, then this is to exit from the fold of Islaam, but if it is just having love without aiding them, then this is counted as something which casues a person’s <em>eemaan</em> (belief) to be deficient and is <em>fisq</em> (open sin) and something which weakens <em>eemaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said that this aayah came down with regard to Aboo ‘Ubaidah ibn al-Jarraa<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span> <em>ra<span style="text-decoration:underline;">d</span>iyallaahu‘anhu, </em>when he killed his father on the day of Badr, because his father was upon unbelief, and he wanted to kill his son Aboo ‘Ubaidah, but Aboo ‘Ubaidah <em>ra<span style="text-decoration:underline;">d</span>iyallaahu‘anhu </em>killed him, because he was an enemy to Allaah and he was not prevented by that fact that it was his father, that did not prevent him from killing him out of anger for the sake of Allaah the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “Those ones”: meaning those who keep away from loving and having affection for those oppose Allaah and His Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>He (Allaah) ordained <em>eemaan</em> for their hearts [58:22]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning Allaah confirmed and firmly planted <em>eemaan</em> in their hearts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And He strengthened them with a <em>Roo<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span></em> from Him, and He willl enter them into gardens beneath which rivers flow.[58:22]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>At-Ta’yeed </em>means strengthening, He strengthened them with a <em>Roo<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span></em> from Him. And the word <em>Ar-Roo<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span></em> has a number of different usages in the Qur’aan, from them is <em>Ar-Roo<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span></em> which is the spirit through which there is life, and from them is revelation as occurs in His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And likewise We sent down by revelation to you a <em>Roo<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span></em> (revelation) by Our command. [42:52]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them is Jibreel <em>‘alaihissalaam</em>, that he is <em>Roo<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>-ul-Qudus</em> (the Pure Spirit), and <em>Ar-Roo<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>-ul-’Ameen </em>(the Trustworthy Spirit).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Say: the Pure Spirit (Jibreel <em>‘alaihissalaam</em>) brought it (the Qur’aan) down from your Lord in truth, to make those who believe firm and as guidance and as good news for the Muslims (those who submit to Allaah’s commands) [16:102]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Trustworthy Spirit (Jibreel <em>‘alaihissalaam</em>) descended with it (the Qur’aan). [26:193]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them is what occurs in this <em>aayah </em>and it is strength.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, “<em>Ayyadahum</em> <em>bi roo<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>imminh</em>”, meaning with strength from Him, He the Perfect and Most High, strength of true faith in the world, and in the hereafter:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And He will enter them into gardens [58:22]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The plural of <em>jannaah, </em>and the <em>jannah</em> in the language, it means a garden. It is called a <em>jannaah </em>because it is <em>mujtannun bil-ashjaar</em> (hidden or concealed by trees), meaning hidden and covered by intertwined trees, because paradise contains shade and trees and rivers and palaces, and its highest part and its ceiling is the Throne of the Most Merciful, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>With rivers flowing beneath it they will remain therein forever [58:22]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, they will remain in it and will not move away from it. He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>They will not want to move away from it [18:108]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will not fear death and they will not have to fear anyone forcing them out or evicting them, as occurs in this world. A person in this world may live in palaces, however he is not secure from death so that he has to depart from them, nor is he secure from enemies overcoming him and expelling him. A person in this world is always fearful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allaah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him [58:22]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since they angered their close relatives who were unbelievers and had enmity towards them, so they will receive in replacement the pleasure of Allaah the Perfect and Most  High, Allaah will be pleased with them and they are pleased with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>They are the party of Allaah [58:22]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: the group of people for Allaah, and as for the disbelievers, then they are the party of Satan, just as Allaah the Most High said about them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>They are the party of Satan [58:19]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the group of people for Satan and the helpers of Satan. As for those people (i.e. the believers) then they are the supporters of the Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this matter relates to having enmity towards the disbelievers and not having love and alliance for them. And it does not necessitate that we cut off from the disbelievers in social matters and matters of wordly benefit. Rather a number of affairs are an exception to that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The first one is:</span> </strong>that along with our hatred of them and our enmity to them, then it is obligatory that we call them to Allaah the Perfect and Most High. It is obligatory that we call them to Allaah and we do not leave them and just say, “They are enemies of Allaah and our enemies.” It is obligatory upon us that we call them to Allaah so perhaps Allaah may guide them. And if they do not respond, then we fight them along with the ability.[1] So either then they will enter into Islaam, or they will pay the <em>jizyah</em> (an amount of money that is given over to the Muslims), if they are from the Jews and Christians or the Magians, whilst they are humbled and submitting to the rule of Islaam, and they are then left upon what they are upon. However, with the condition that they <em>jizyah</em> is handed over and that they submit to the rule of Islaam. However, if they are not people of the Two Books and they are not Magians, then there is disagreement between the scholars about taking <em>jizyah</em> from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Secondly</span>: </strong>there is nothing to prevent having a truce with the unbelievers when there is a need, if the Muslims have need of it, because of the fact that the Muslims are not able to fight against them, and there is fear for the Muslims from their evil, then there is no harm in having a truce until the Muslms become strong enough to fight them, or if they request a truce:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And if they incline towards peace, then you incline to it [8:61]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then a truce is made with them. However it will not be a perpetual truce, rather a temporary peace with a time-limit in accordance with the view of the ruler of the Muslims regarding what is beneficial.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Thirdly</span>: </strong>there is nothing to prevent returning their fine treatment, if they treat the Muslims well, there is nothing to prevent returning their fine treatment. Allaah the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allaah does not forbid you from those who do not fight against you with regard to the religion and who do not expel you from your homes from treating them well and treating them with justice. Allaah loves those who treat the people justly. [60:8]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Fourthly</span>: </strong>the father who is a disbeliever, it is obligatory upon his son who is Muslim to treat him well. However he should not obey him with regard to unbelief, because of His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And We commanded man to treat his parents well, his mother bore him upon a state of weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning was in two years. We enjoin him to give thanks to Me and to your parents, to Me is your return. And if they strive to make you associate something along with Me, that which you have no knowledge of, then do not obey them, but live along with them in this world in a good manner and follow the path of those who turn to Me. [31:14-15]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The parent has a right, even if he is an unbeliever. However, you should not love him with love of the heart, rather you recompense him for having brought you up and for the fact that he is a father and he has a right,so you recompense him for that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Fifthly</span>: </strong>having mutual business dealings with them, and buying needs from them, and importing goods and weapons from them by paying their price, there is no harm in that. And the Prophet <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam </em>used to have dealings with the disbelievers. Likewise he <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam</em> dealt with the people of Khaibar and they were Jews upon the basis that they would farm the land in exchange for a part of its produce. This is not from alliance and love, rather it is affairs of mutual benefit. It is obligatory that we are aware of these matters, and that they do not enter into love and alliance and are not something prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise taking a loan from them, the Prophet <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam </em>took some food from a Jew as a debt and he left his coat of armour as a surety with him and he <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam </em>died and his coat of armour was left as a surety with the Jew, for some food which he bought for his family. There is nothing to prevent this because these are wordly matters and matters of welfare and it does not indicate love and affection in the hearts. So we must differentiate between this and this, because there are some people, who when he hears the texts of enmity towards the unbelievers and not loving them, then he may understand that he cannot have any dealings with them and cannot have any connection with them whatsoever, and that there is to be a total cut-off from them. No, this is something limited by rulings and limits and conditions which are well known with the people of knowledge, which are taken from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Sixthly</span>: </strong>Allaah has permitted marriage to the women of the people of the Book with the condition that they are chaste with regard to their honour and dignity. And Allaah has made permissible for us to eat the meat slaughtered by them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Seventhly</span>:</strong> that there is no harm in responding to their invitations and eating their food which is permissible, just as the Prophet <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam </em>did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Eighthly</span>: </strong>is treating neighbours who are disbelievers well, because they have the right of being neighbours.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Ninthly</span>:</strong> it is not permissible to wrong or oppress them. He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And let not hatred of a people prevent you from treating them justly. Do justice, it is closer to <em>taqwaa</em> (dutifulness to Allaah). [5:8]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] [Meaning the Muslims united under a Muslim ruler, i.e. the army of Muslims, with the ability to do so.]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:small;"><b>1207.</b>  Talhah bin `Ubaidullah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A person with dishevelled hair, one of the people of Najd, came to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam). We heard the humming of his voice but could not fully understand what he was saying, till he approached close to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam). Then I came to know that he was asking about Islam.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:small;"><b>1210.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:</span><span style="color:#008000;font-size:small;"> When the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) passed away, Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) was appointed as his successor (caliph). Amongst the Arabs some men apostatised. Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) resolved to fight them. `Umar bin Al-Khattab (May Allah be pleased with him) said to Abu Bakr: &#8220;How can you fight them when the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) has declared: `I have been commanded to fight people till they testify La ilaha illallah (there is no true god except Allah); and if they do it, their blood (life) and property are secured except when justified by law, and it is for Allah to call them to account.&#8221; Upon this Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;By Allah, I would definitely fight him who makes distinction between Salat and the Zakat, because it is an obligation upon the rich to pay Zakat. By Allah I will fight them even to secure the piece of rope which they used to give to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam).&#8221; `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;I realized that Allah opened the heart of Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) for fighting those who refused to pay Zakat, and I fully recognized that Abu Bakr ¨(May Allah be pleased with him) was right.</span><span style="font-size:small;">&#8221; [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</span></p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:small;"><b>1214.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-size:small;">Any person who possesses gold or silver and does not pay what is due on it (i.e., the Zakat); on the Day of Resurrection, sheets of silver and gold would be heated for him in the fire of Hell and with them his flank, forehead and back will be branded. When they cool down, they will be heated again and the same process will be repeated during the day the measure whereof will be fifty thousand years. (This would go on) until Judgement is pronounced among (Allah&#8217;s) slaves, and he will be shown his final abode, either to Jannah or to Hell</span><span style="font-size:small;">.&#8221; It was asked, &#8220;How about someone who owns camels and does not pay what is due on him (i.e., their Zakat)?&#8221; He (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-size:small;">In the same way the owner of camels who does not discharge what is due in respect of them (their due includes their milking on the day when they are taken to water) will be thrown on his face or on his back in a vast desert plain on the Day of Resurrection and they will trample upon him with their hoofs and bite him with their teeth. As often as the first of them passes him, the last of them will be made to return during a day the measure whereof will be fifty thousand years, until Judgement is pronounced among (Allah&#8217;s) slaves, he will be shown his final abode either to Jannah or to Hell</span><span style="font-size:small;">.&#8221; It was (again) asked: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, what about cows (cattle) and sheep?&#8221; He (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-size:small;">If anyone who possesses cattle and sheep and does not pay what is due on them (i.e., their Zakat); on the Day of Resurrection, he will be thrown on his face in a vast plain desert. He will find none of the animals missing with twisted horns, without horns or with a broken horn, and they will gore him with their horns and trample upon him with their hoofs. As often as the first of them passes him, the last of them will be made to return to him during a day the measure whereof will be fifty thousand years, until Judgement is pronounced among (Allah&#8217;s) slaves; and he will be shown his final abode either to Jannah or to Hell.</span><span style="font-size:small;">&#8221; It was asked: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, what about the horses?&#8221; Upon this he (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-size:small;">The horses are of three types. One, which is a burden for the owner; another which is a shield, and another one which makes its owner entitled to reward. The one for whom these are a burden is the person who rears them for show or for pride or for causing injury to the sentiments of the Muslims. They will be a cause of torment for their owners. The one for whom these are a shield is the person who rears them for the sake of Allah but does not forget the Right of Allah concerning their backs and their necks (i.e., he lets a needy ride on them), and so they are a shield for him. Those which bring reward to the one who rears them in pastures and gardens are the ones that are used in the Cause of Allah (Jihad) by the Muslims. Whatever they eat from the meadows and the gardens will be recorded on his behalf as good deeds so much so that their droppings and urine will be counted for an equal number of good deeds for him. Even when they break their tying rope and every height from which they climb and every hoofprint which they leave will be counted as a good deed on behalf of the owner. When their owner leads them through a stream from which they drink, though he does not intend to quench their thirst, yet Allah would record for him the quantity (of water) of what they would drink on his behalf as good deeds</span><span style="font-size:small;">.&#8221; It was asked: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, what about the donkeys?&#8221; Upon this he (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-size:small;">Nothing has been revealed to me in regard to the donkeys in particular except this one Verse of a comprehensive nature:</span><span style="font-size:small;"> &#8220;</span><span style="color:#ff0000;font-size:small;">So whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it. And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it</span><span style="font-size:small;">.&#8221;&#8217; (99: 8,9). [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Third Level is <em>al-I<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Definition of <em>I<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">المرتبة الثالثة : الإحسان ، ركن واحد ، وهو &#8221; أن تعبد الله كأنك تراه ، فإن لم تكن تراه فإنه يراك&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third level is <em>al-i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em>. It is a single pillar and it is: «<strong>That you worship Allaah as if you were seeing Him, and even though you do not see Him, He certainly sees you</strong>.»<sup>46</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[46] <em>Al-I<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> in the language means to perfect something and complete it. It is derived from <em>al-<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>usun</em> which means <em>al-jamaal</em> (beauty), the opposite of ugliness. It is divided into categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: Perfection of what lies between the servant and his Lord. This is what is meant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: Perfection of what is between the servant and the rest of the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>: Doing well and perfecting what you do. When a person makes something or does an action, then it is obligatory upon him that he perfects it and does it completely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first type</strong> is <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> (perfection) of what lies between the servant his Lord. The Messenger <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> explained it when Jibreel asked him in the presence of the companions as will follow. He said: «<strong><em>I<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan </em>is that you worship Allaah as if you were seeing Him, and even though you do not see Him, He certainly sees you</strong>.»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> between the servant and his Lord is his perfecting the action which Allaah has made a duty upon him, that he does it correctly, purely and sincerely for the Face of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. So, an action in which there is <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> between the servant and his Lord is that which is done sincerely for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and done with the following of the Messenger <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>. The Prophet <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> made clear that <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> is of two levels, one of them being higher than the other:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first level</strong> is that you worship Allaah as if you were seeing Him such that your certainty and <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah reaches such a level that it is as if you are actually seeing Allaah with your eyes. You have no hesitancy or doubt, rather it is as if Allaah is in front of you, He the Perfect and Most High, and you are seeing Him openly. Whoever reaches this level has reached the limit of <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em>. You worship Allaah as if you are seeing Him on account of the completeness of certainty and sincerity, which is as if you are seeing Allaah with your eyes. Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, will not be seen in this world, rather He will only be seen in the Hereafter. However, you see Him with your heart to the extent that it is as if you are seeing Him with your eyes. Therefore, He will reward the people of <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> in the Hereafter that they will see Him, He the Perfect and Most High. This is since they used to worship Him as if they were seeing Him in this world. So, Allaah rewards them by giving them the opportunity to see Him with their eyes in the abode of bliss. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>For the people of <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> there will be the best reward of Paradise and something extra</strong>.» <strong>[10:26]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Something extra is looking upon the Face of Allaah. The reason is that they perfected their deeds in this world, so Allaah gave them the best reward which is Paradise. And He will give them an increase which is seeing Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. So therefore, you worship Allaah as if you are actually witnessing Him, upon love and longing to meet Him, He the Perfect and Most High. You feel delight in obedience to Him and you feel calm and obedience to Him, He the Perfect and Most High. You eagerly desire obedience to Him. This is the path of the people of <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second level</strong>: If you do not reach this tremendous level, then you worship Him upon the path of <em>al-muraqabah</em> (watchfulness) such that you know that Allaah sees you, knows your condition, and knows what lies within yourself. Therefore, it is not befitting that you should disobey Him and contradict His command when He sees and observes you. This is a good state, however, it is less than the first one. So, as long as you know that He sees you, then you therefore perfect your worship of Him and you do it well, because you know that Allaah is seeing you. And for Allaah is the Highest example. If you were in front of a created being who had status and he commanded you with a command, and you were carrying this matter out in front of him and he was looking at you, would it be befitting that you be negligent in the performance of this action?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So in summary, <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> is of two levels</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The level of witnessing with the heart</strong>: It is that you worship Allaah as if you are seeing Him from the strength of certainty and <em>eemaan</em>. It is as you are seeing Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, with your eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second level</strong>: It is that you worship Allaah knowing that He sees you and observes you, therefore, you do not disobey Him and contradict His command, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the level of <em>al-i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> and it is highest of the levels of the religion. Whoever reaches it has reached the highest of the levels of the religion. Before it is the level of <em>eemaan</em>, and before that is the level of <em>al-Islaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The <em>deen</em> has a number of domains</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first domain</strong>: <em>al-Islaam</em>. It is wide to such an extent that the hypocrite enters within it and is called a Muslim and is treated like the Muslims, because he has submitted to <em>Islaam</em> outwardly. So therefore, he enters within the domain of <em>Islaam</em>. And the person who is weak in <em>eemaan</em> [enters the domain of <em>Islaam</em>], but he has nothing from <em>eemaan</em> except a mustard seed of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second domain</strong>: It is more restricted and more specific &#8211; the domain of <em>al-eemaan</em>. The hypocrite in belief does not enter into it whatsoever. Rather, only the people of <em>eemaan</em> enter into it, and they are two categories: those who are complete in <em>eemaan</em> and those who are deficient in <em>eemaan</em>. So, the sinful believer and dutiful believer both enter into it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third domain</strong>: It is more restricted than the second one &#8211; the domain of <em>al-i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em>. It just as the Prophet <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> made clear. No one will enter into it except the people of complete <em>eemaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Evidence for <em>al-I<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">والدليل قوله تعالى:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Allaah is with those who fear Him and are dutiful to Him; and He is with those who are people of <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em></strong>.» <strong>[16:128]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وقوله تعالى:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>And place your reliance upon the All-Mighty, the Bestower of Mercy. He who sees you when you stand to pray. And who sees your movements along with those who pray along with you. Indeed! He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing</strong>.» <strong>[26:217-220]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وقوله تعالى:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>And you are not (O Mu<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>ammad <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>) engaged in any matter nor do you recite the Book of Allaah, &#8211; nor do you do any action (O people), except that We are witness in your deeds when you do them. And not even that which is of the weight of the tiniest ant is hidden from your Lord on the earth or in the heavens. Nor is there anything smaller than that or greater than it except that it is written in a Clear Book</strong>.» <strong>[10:61]</strong><sup>[47]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[47] This is the proof for the first level of <em>al-i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Allaah is with those who fear Him and are dutiful to Him, and He is with those who are people of <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em></strong>.» <strong>[16:128]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>aayah</em> proves that Allaah is with the people of <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em>. They are those who worship Allaah as if they were seeing Him, so Allaah is with them in a specific sense of <em>Ma`iyyah</em> &#8211; the <em>Ma`iyyah</em> with regard to aiding, helping, and <em>tawfeeq</em> (guiding them to and granting them attainment of correctness).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>And place your reliance upon the All-Mighty, the Bestower of Mercy. He who sees you when you stand to pray. And who sees your movements along with those who pray along with you</strong>.» <strong>[26:217-219]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a proof for the second level. This is a proof for his saying [<em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>]: «<strong>Then, He certainly sees you</strong>.»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>And place your reliance</strong>» Meaning: trust your affairs «<strong>to the All-Mighty, the Bestower of Mercy</strong>» He is Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>When you stand to pray</strong>» You stand for worship and the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>And who sees your movements along with those who pray along with you</strong>» He sees you whilst you are performing your <em>rukoo`</em> (bowing) and whilst you are performing your <em>sajdah</em> (prostration). He sees you in all the states of worship; standing, bowing, and prostrating. He, the Perfect and Most High, sees you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Indeed! He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing</strong>» The One who hears your sayings. The One who knows your sayings, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>And you are not (O Mu<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>ammad <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>) engaged in any matter nor do you recite the Book of Allaah, &#8211; nor do you do any action (O people), except that We are witness in your deeds when you do them</strong>.» <strong>[10:61]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a proof for the second level.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>And you are not (O Mu<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>ammad <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>) engaged in any matter</strong>» This is an address to the Messenger <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>. In any affair from your affairs, from the affairs of worship or other than it &#8211; all of your actions and your movements &#8211; you will not be engaged in any affair at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Nor do you recite from it (i.e. Book of Allaah)</strong>» Meaning: from Allaah, because the Qur`aan is from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. Or the pronoun could refer back to the affair, so the meaning would be: From the affairs which you are engaged in is recitation of the Qur`aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Nor do you do (O people)</strong>» This is [an address] for all of the nation, for the Messenger <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> and other than him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Any action</strong>» Meaning: Any action from the actions, whether good or bad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Except that We are witness [in your deeds]</strong>» We are seeing you, observing you, and witnessing you. This is a proof for his saying <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>: «<strong>Then indeed, He sees you</strong>.»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>When you do them</strong>» You are carrying it out and you are doing it. So, this gives a proof for the second level from the levels of <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em>, in that He, the Majestic and Most High, witnesses the action of every doer of an action. He, the Perfect and Most High, sees him, knows him, and observes him. Nothing is hidden from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Nothing whatsoever in the earth or in the heavens is hidden from Allaah</strong>.» <strong>[3:5]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> between the servant and in the creation, then its meaning is: doing good to them and withholding from harming them. Such that you feed the hungry person, cloth the person without clothing, assist the needy person with your position, and that you intercede for the one who needs to be interceded for. You do that which is good with all the different aspects of good. You are hospitable to the guest and you are generous towards the neighbor. Nothing but good emanates from you towards the neighbor, and you withhold harming him. So, no harm comes from you towards him or towards anyone else. For from the people, there are who are such that nothing but harm comes from them, and from the people, there are those whom harm and good comes. And from the people, there are those whom nothing but good comes from them. This is the highest of the levels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Doing good towards the people and withholding harm from them is <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> (good and fine treatment) towards the people:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Do good. Allaah loves <em>al-Mu<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>sineen</em> (the doers of good)</strong>.» <strong>[2:195]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even towards the animals, it is obligatory that you treat them well and make available for them whatever they need and that you withhold harming them and that you are gentle with them. This is from <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> towards the animals. Even a person who is going to be rightfully executed, you should not torture him, rather, you should execute him in a fine and tranquil manner. A person who is obligatory to execute, and someone it is obligatory to carry a <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>add</em> (prescribed punishment) upon, then it is carried out upon him with gentleness. There is to be no mutilation, no torture, and no beating to death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">»إن الله كتب الإحسان على كل شيء ، فإذا قتلتم فأحسنوا القتلة ، وإذا ذبحتم فأحسنوا الذبح«</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Allaah has obligated <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> with regard to everything. So, when you kill, then kill in a fine manner. And when you slaughter an animal, then slaughter in a good manner</strong>.»[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, [the principle of <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> applies] to execution or other than it from that which necessitates prescribed punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>When you slaughter</strong>» Meaning: when you slaughter animals which are to be eaten, then slaughter in a fine manner:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">»وليحد  أحدكم شفرته ، وليرح ذبيحته«</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Let one of you sharpen his knife and give relief to the animal which he is slaughtering</strong>.»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, you are to treat with <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> even the animals. Allaah forgave the prostitute woman from the People of Israaeel on account that she gave a drink of water to a dog which had its tongue hanging out from thirst. So, she gave it water to drink and Allaah thanked her for that and forgave her, her sin.[2] This is a tremendous sin and it is prostitution, meaning: <em>zinaa</em> (fornication). But Allaah forgave her on account of that &#8211; because she treated the thirsty animal in a fine manner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how about something other than a dog? If you were to treat a hungry person from the Muslims with <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em>, or from the descendents of Aadam, even if he is a disbeliever &#8211; if you were to treat him well, then Allaah, the Majestic and Most High will thank you for that fine treatment. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Do good. Allaah loves <em>al-Mu<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>sineen</em> (the doers of good)</strong>.» <strong>[2:195]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third type</strong>: It is perfection of the action. Whatever action you do, it is obligatory that you perfect it and not so that it should be said: &#8220;So-and-so has done such-and-such very well.&#8221; There occurs in the <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>adee<span style="text-decoration:underline;">th</span></em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">»إن الله يحب إذا عمل أحدكم عملا أن يتقنه«</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Allaah loves that one when one of you does an action that he perfects it</strong>.»[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Reported by Muslim no. 1955 as a <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>adee<span style="text-decoration:underline;">th</span></em> of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Sh</span>addaad bin Aws, <em>ra<span style="text-decoration:underline;">d</span>iyallaahu `anhu</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Nu`aym-rahimahullaah said: “And I counsel you (all) with it.” I say: This hadeeth is from the famous hadeeth reported with a serial chain, mentioning love, and I was given ijaazah to narrate it by the virtuous Shaikh Raaghib at-Tabbaakhrahimahullaah, and he narrated it to me&#8230; and he reported its isnaad in this manner mentioning love at each stage of the chain.]</p>

<p>(9) AN-NASAA.EE reported (no. 1347): `Amr ibn `Alee related to us, saying: Yahyaa narrated to us: from `Uthmaan ash-Shahhaam: from Muslim ibn Abee Bakrah who said: My father used to say at the end of the Prayer:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#339966;">[O Allaah! I seek Your refuge from Unbelief, and poverty, and the punishment of the grave].</span></p>
<p>So I used to say it, so my father said: “Who did you take this from?” So I said: “From you!” He said: “Allaah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم ) used to say it at the end of the Prayer.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">A person’s craving after status is even more destructive than his craving after wealth. Seeking after worldly status, position, leadership and domination causes more harm to a person that his seeking after wealth – it is more damaging and harder to avoid since even wealth is expended in seeking after leadership and status. Craving after status is of two types.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Type of Craving for Status</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first is seeking status through authority, leadership, and wealth and this is very dangerous – since it will usually prevent a person from the good of the Hereafter and nobility and honour in the next life, Allaah, the Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“That home of the Hereafter We shall assign to those who seek neither haughtiness nor any corruption on earth. The good end is for the pious.”</span></em> [Al-Qasas (28):83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is rare that a person seeks after position in this world by seeking authority and is guided to and granted what is good for him. Rather he is entrusted to his own self, just as the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said to `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Samurah, radiyallaahu `anhu, “O `Abdur-Rahmaan! Do not ask for authority since if you are given it due to requesting it then you are abandoned to it, but if you are given it without requesting it then you will be aided in it.” [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the Salaf said, “ No one seeks after authority and then behaves justly in it.” Yazeed ibn `Abdillaah ibn Mawhib was a just judge and one of the righteous people and he used to say, “Whoever loves wealth and status and fears adversity will not behave with justice.” There occurs in Saheeh al-Bukharee from Aboo Hurairah, radiyAllaahu`anhu, from the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) that he said, “You will be keen to attain authority and it will be a source of regret on the Day of Resurrection. So what an excellent wet-nurse it is and what an evil weaner.” [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Al-Bukhaaree) also reports from Aboo Moosa al-Ash`aree, radiyAllaahu `anhu, that two men said to the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), ‘O Messenger of Allaah! Appoint us to some position of authority.’ So he said, ‘We do not appoint to authority in this affair of ours one who requests it, nor one who is keen to have it.” [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that craving after status and position inevitably causes great harm before its attainment due to the striving necessary to attain it, and also afterwards due to the person’s strong desire to hold onto it which produces injustice, haughtiness and other evils.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Aboo Bakr al-Aajurree</strong>, who was one of the wise scholars and teachers at the start of the fourth century, wrote at treatise about the manners and the sentiments of the scholars and it is one of the best works on this topic. One who studies it will know from it the way of the scholars of the Salaf, and will know the innovated ways contrary to their way. So he describes the evil scholar at length, from this description is that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>‘He has become infatuated with love of this world, and with praise, honour and position with the people of this world. He uses knowledge as an adornment just as a beautiful woman adorns herself with jewellery for this world, but he does not adorn his knowledge with action upon it.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="more-29224"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then mentions a lengthy speech and then says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“So these characteristics and their like predominate in the heart of one who does not benefit from knowledge, so whilst he carries these attributes his soul will come to have love of status and position – so that he loves to sit with kings and the sons of this world. The he loves to share in their opulent lifestyle, sharing their lavish attire, their comfortable transport, servants, fine clothing, delicate bedding and delicious food. He will love that people throng to his door, that his saying is listened to, and that he is obeyed – and he can only attain the latter by becoming a judge (qaadee) – so he seeks to become one. Then he is unable to attain it except at the expense of his Religion, so he debases himself to the rulers and their helpers, serving them himself and giving them his wealth as a tribute. He remains silent when he sees their evil actions after entering their palaces and homes. Then on top of this he may praise their evil actions and declare them good due to some false interpretation in order to raise his position with them. So when he has accustomed himself to doing this over a long period of time and falsehood has taken root in him – then they appoint him to the position of judge (qaadee) and in so doing slaughter him without a knife.”</em> [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they have bestowed such a favour upon him that he is obliged and has to show his gratitude to them – so he takes great pains to make sure that he does not anger them and cause them to remove him from his position. But he has no concern about whether he angers his Lord, the Most High, so he misappropriates the wealth of orphans, widows, the poor and the needy, and wealth bequested as waaf (religious endowment) for those fighting Jihaad and the nobles of Makkah and al-Madeenah, and wealth which is supposed to be of benefit to all the Muslims – but instead he uses it to satisfy his clerk, chamberlain and servant. So he eats that which is haraam and feeds with that which is haraam and increases that which is a proof against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So woe to the one whose knowledge which the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) sought refuge from and ordered us to seek refuge from. This is the knowledge which the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) mentioned, saying, <span style="color:#008000;">“Those amongst the people receiving the severest punishment on the Day of Resurrection is the scholar who is not given benefit through his knowledge by Allaah.”</span> [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) used to say, <span style="color:#008000;">(Allaahumma innee a’oodhubika minal arba’i, min `ilmin laa yanfa`u, wa min qalbin laa yakhsha`u, wa min nafsin laa tashba`u, wa min du`aa in laa yusma`u) “O Allaah I seek Your refuge from knowledge which does not benefit; from a heart which does not fear; from a soul which is never satisfied; and from a supplication which is not heard.”</span> [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Allaahumma inne as`aluka `ilman naafi`an, wa a`oodhubika min `ilman laa yanfa`u)</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;">“O Allaah I ask You for beneficial knowledge, and I seek Your refuge from knowledge which does not benefit.”</span> [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was said by Imaam Aboo Bakr al-Aajuree, rahimahullaahu ta`aala who lived at the end of the fourth century [17] and corruption increased and multiplied greatly since his time – and there is no might and no strength except by Allaah’s will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the subtle afflictions caused by love of status is seeking after and aspiring positions of authority – this is something whose reality is hidden and obscure. It is not understood except by those who have knowledge of Allaah, those who love Him and who are at enmity with those ignorant one’s from His creation who desire to compete with Him with regard to His Lordship and Divinity and right to worship, despite their despicability and the contemptible position they have before Allaah and in the eyes of His chosen servants who have knowledge of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is just as <strong>al-Hasan (al-Basree)</strong>, rahimahullaah, said about them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“Even if the hooves of mules clatter for them and riding beasts strut for them, yet still the humiliation of sin rests upon their necks. Allaah has refused except that He will humiliate those who are disobedient to Him.” </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that love of status attained by having one’s orders and prohibitions obeyed and enacted, and by merely the attainment of a position above the people and to have importance over them, and that it be seen that the people are in need of him and seek their needs from him – then the soul of this person is seeking to compete with Allaah in His Lordship and His Divinity and right to worship. Some such people may even seek to put the people into such a condition of need that they are compelled to request their needs from them, and to display their poverty before them and their need of them. Then he is inflated with pride and self-importance because of that, whereas this befits none except Allaah alone. He who has no partner. Allaah, the Most High, Says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily, We sent (Messengers) to many nations before you (O Muhammad (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)). And We seized them with extreme poverty (or loss in wealth) and loss in health with calamities so that they might believe with humility.”</span></em> [Al-An`aam (6):42]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also occurs in some narrations that Allaah, the Most High, sends adversity upon His servant in order to hear him call upon him with full humility. There also occurs in the narrations that when the servant whom Allaah loves supplicates to Allaah, the Most High, then He, the Most High, says, <em><span style="color:#008000;">“O Jibreel! Do not hasten to carry out his need, for I love that I should hear him calling with full humility.”</span></em>[18] So these matters are worse and more dangerous than mere injustice and are more sinister, and they are a part of shirk – and shirk is the greatest injustice and transgression with Allaah. It is reported in the Saheeh from the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) that he said, <em><span style="color:#008000;">“Allaah, the Most High, says, ‘Pride is my cloak and majesty is my lower-garment so whoever vies with Me regarding them I will punish him.’”</span></em> [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also happened that one of the people of the past was a judge and he saw in a dream that someone was saying to him, “You are a judge and Allaah is a Judge.” So he awoke in a distressed state and removed himself from the position of a judge and abandoned it. Some of the pious judges used to prevent the people from calling them ‘Judge of judges’ (Qaadiyyul-Qudaat) since this name resembles the name ‘King of kings’ which the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) censured that one should use as a title, and ‘Judge of judges’ is like that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also related to this is the one having status and authority loves that he is praised and commended for his actions and seeks that from the people. Those who do not comply with this suffer as a result. It may even be that his actions are actually more deserving of blame than of praise, or he manifests something that is apparently good – and loves to be praised for it, yet in reality he is intending something evil and is happy that he is able to deceive the people and fool them about it. This falls under the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Think not that those who rejoice in what they have done (or brought about), and love to be praised for what they have not done, think not that they are rescued from the torment, and for them is a painful torment.”</span></em> [Aal-‘Imraan (3):188]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since this Aayah was sent down regarding those who have these attributes, and this attribute (i.e. seeking praise from the creation and loving it and punishing those who do not give it) is not fitting except for Allaah, alone, having no partner. This is why the rightly guided leaders used to forbid people to praise them for their actions and any good which if they did, and they would order that rather praise be given to Allaah alone, having no partner – since all blessings are from Him.<!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>`Umar ibn Abdul &#8211; `Azeez</strong>, rahimahullaah, was very particular about this and he once wrote a letter to be read out to the people performing Hajj. It contained an order that they should be treated well and that oppression of them should stop, and in it there occurred, “And do not praise anyone for this except Allaah, since if He abandoned me to my own desiresI would be just like the others.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a also a well-known narration about what occurred with him concerning the woman who requested from him that he should provide an allowance for her orphaned daughters. She had four daughters and he gave an allowance to two of them and she praised Allaah. Then he gave an allowance to the third so she thanked him, so he said, “We were giving an allowance to them as long as you were giving praise to the One to whom it is due, but now order this third one to share her allowance with the fourth,” or as he said, radiyAllaahu `anhu. He wanted to make it known that the position of leadership is only established so that Allaah’s commands are carried out, and so that the servants can be commanded to obey Allaah, the Most High, and forbidden from those things which Allaah has prohibited, and so that the leader acts with sincerity towards Allaah’s servants by calling them to Allaah. His intention is that the Deen should in its entirety be for Allaah, and that honour be for Allaah. Along with this he is fearful that he is himself falling short with regard to the rights of Allaah, the Most High. So as for those who love Allaah, then the limit of their desire with regard to the creation is that they should also love Allaah, obey Him and single Him out with all worship and recognise His Divinity alone. (Then how about one who seeks to vie with Him in this?!) Rather this type of person does not desire any reward or any thanks from the creation, but hopes for reward for his actions from Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“It is not (possible) for any human being to whom Allaah has given al-Hukma (knowledge and understanding of the laws of Religion etc.) and Prophethood to say to the people: “Be my worshippers rather than Allaah’s.’ On the contrary (he would say): ‘Be you rabbaaniyyoon (learned men of Religion, who practice what they know and also preach to others) because you teach the Book, and you study it.’ Nor would he order you to take angels and Prophets for lords (gods). Would he order you to disbelieve after you have submitted to Allaah’s Will?”</span></em> [Aal-`Imraan (3):79-80]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said, “<em><span style="color:#008000;">Do not exaggerate in praising me as the Christians praised the Messiah, the son of Maryam. Indeed I am only a slave. So say the slave of Allaah and His Messenger.</span></em>” [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) also used to criticise anyone who did not keep to this manner of address with regard to him, just as he (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said, <em><span style="color:#008000;">“Do not say, ‘Whatever Allaah has willed and Muhammad has willed, ` but rather say, ‘Whatever Allaah has willed, then what Muhammad has willed.’”</span> </em>[21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also replied to a person who said, “Whatever Allah and yourself have willed,” by saying, <em><span style="color:#008000;">“Have you made me a rival for Allaah! Rather say, ‘Whatever Allaah alone has willed.’”</span></em> [22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this khulafaa who have succeeded the Prophets, and their followers – the just rulers and their successors, and their judges, never used to call to glorification of themselves but rather to the glorification of Allaah alone and that He is to be singled out with worship and divinity. From them were those who did not wish for leadership at all except as an aid to calling to Allaah alone. Some of the righteous people who accepted the position of judge said, “Indeed I accepted this in order to use it to help me in ordering the good and forbidding the evil.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the Messengers and their followers would persevere in the face of injury and harm which they suffered whilst calling to Allaah, and in carrying out Allaah’s commands they were put into the severest hardship by the people and yet they bore it with patience. Indeed being pleased with that, since one who has love may find pleasure in any harm he meets whilst seeking to please the one whom he loves. Just as `Abdul-Maalik ibn `Umar ibn `Abdul-Azeez used to say to his father when he was the khaleefah and he had keen desire that the truth and justice be established, “O father I would have loved that we had been forced into boiling cooking pots for the sake of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another righteous person said, “I would have loved that my flesh were cut away with scissors if it meant that all the creation would obey Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.” This saying of his was related to a certain wise person, so he said, “If what he was speaking of was sincere concern for the creation, otherwise I do not know.” Then he fainted. The meaning of this is that the one who said this had true and sincere concern  for the creation and pity for them, fearing Allaah’s punishment for them, so he would have loved that they could have been saved from Allaah’s punishment at the expense of his ownself. It could also be that he was considering the Majesty and Greatness of Allaah and the glorification, honour, obedience and love due to Him, so he wished that the creation would fulfil that even if it meant the most severe harm to himself. This is the state of mind of the distinguished ones who love Allaah and have knowledge of Him and keep Him in mind. This is what caused the man to faint.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, also described in His Book those who love Him as being those who fight Jihaad in His cause and do not fear the blame of those who seek to blame.[23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning this someone said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I find that being blamed whilst pursuing what you desire is delightful, For having love for your remembrance let those who wish  to blame me do so.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Reported by Ahmad and al-Bukhaaree (transl.9/194/no.260)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] Reported by al-Bukhaaree (transl.9/196/no.262) and others. Note: His saying, “It will be a source of regret.” Means one who does not behave correctly having attained it – and the proof of this is what Muslim reports from Aboo Dharr who said, ‘I said, “O Messenger of Allaah! Will you not appoint me to some position?” He said, “You are weak and it is a trust and on the Day of Resurrection it will be a source of humiliation and regret, except for one who fulfils its obligations and carries out the duties required from him.” (Saheeh Muslim, transl.3/1015/4491). An-Nawawee said, “This is a great reason to avoid positions of authority especially those who are weak – and this refers to those who are not suitable and those who do not act justly in the position – then he will regret his negligence when he is humiliated on the Day of Resurrection. However one who is suitable for the position and behaves justly in it – then there is a great reward as shown in a number of reports. However entering into it carries a great danger therefore the great scholars avoided it. His saying, “What a good wet-nurse” (i.e. the one who feeds the baby at breast) meaning in this world, and “What an evil weaner” meaning after death – since he will be taken to account for it. So he is like one who is weaned away from breast milk before he can manage without it – so this causes his destruction. And it is said, “What a good wet nurse” due to the status, wealth, authority, attainment of physical and imagined enjoyment which it produces whilst one has it, but “What an evil weaner”, meaning when one is removed from it by death or other causes – due to the even consequences one faces in the Hereafter.” (Abridged and edited from Fathul-Baaree of Ibn Hajar (13/125-126)).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] Reported by al-Bukhaaree (transl.9/196/no.263) and Muslim (transl. 3/1014/no.4489)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] Alluding to the saying of the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), “He who is appointed as a judge has been killed without a knife.” Reported by Ahmad, Aboo Daawood (transl.3/1013/no.3564) and at- Tirmidhee who declared it hasan. I say: its isnaad is saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] Reported by Ibn `Abdul-Barr in Jaami` Bayaanil-`Ilm (1/162) and al-Aajuree (pp.93-94) and at- Tabaraanee in as-Sagheer (1/1831) and others and its chain of narration is very weak since it contains `Uthmaan ibn Miqsam al-Burree who was accused of lying and fabrication. It is however reported as being the saying of Abud-Dardaa only, with an authentic chain of narration. It is reported by ad- Daarimee (1/82) and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] Reported by Ahmad, Aboo Daawood (transl. vol.1/p.401/no.1543) and others, all with the wording, “O Allaah I seek Your refuge from four: from knowledge which does not benefit…” The hadeeth was declared to be saheeh by al-Haakim and adh-Dhahabee agreed, and it has supports from a number of the Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16] Reported with this wording by al-Aajuree (p.134) and Ibn Hibbaan (no.2426). It also reported by Ibn Maajah (no.3843) and Ibn `Abdul-Barr (1/162) with the wording, “Ask Allaah for beneficial knowledge and seek Allaah’s refuge from knowledge which does not benefit.” Its chain of narration is hasan (good) and there is similar narration from Umm Salamah reported by Ibn Majah and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17] Al-Aajurree, rahimahullaah, died in the year 360H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18] The meaning of this is reported in the hadeeth qudsee which is mentioned by Shaikh Muhammad al- Madanee in his book al-Ittihaafaatus-Sunniyyah fil-Ahaadeethil-Qudsiyyah (no.438) – and he mentioned that Ibn `Asaakir reported it with a chain of narration containing Ishaaq ibn `Abdillaah ibn Abee Farwa who is abandoned as a narrator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19] Reported by Ahmad, Aboo Daawood (transl.3/1141/no.4079) and Ibn Maajah from the hadeeth of Ibn Maajah, except that their wording ends, “…So whoever vies with Me regarding any of them…” and in a wording, “…. Anything from them, I will fling him into Hell-Fire.” And in a wording, “…the Fire.” Its chain of narration is saheeh. Muslim (transl. 4/1381/no.6349) also reports one version of the hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20] Reported by al-Bukhaaree (transl.vol.4, p.435, no.654) and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[21] Reported by ad-Daarimee (2/295) with this wording and its chain of narration is saheeh. It is also reported with the wording, “Do not say, ‘Whatever Allaah and so and so have willed.’ but rather say, ‘Whatever Allaah has willed and then what so and so has willed.’” It is reported by Ahmad, Aboo Daawood (transl. vol.3, p.1386, no.4962) and others and its chain of narration is saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[22] Reported by Ahmad, Al-Bukhaaree in al-Aadabul-Mufrad (no.783) and others, and its chain of narration is hasan.</p>

By Fahd ibn &#8216;Abdir Rahman ash-Shuwaib<br />
Translated by Dawood Burbank al-Britanee.</div>

<h1 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC1"></a>Introduction</h1>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC2"></a>Preface</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily all praise is for Allaah, we praise Him and seek His aid and ask for His forgiveness, and we seek refuge with Allaah from the evils of ourselves and our evil actions. Whomever Allaah guides there is none who can misguide him, and whomever Allaah misguides there is none who can guide him, and I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah Alone, having no partner, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>O mankind! Be dutiful to your Rabb (Creator, Master, Owner of All-Things), Who created you from a single person (Adam), and from him (Adam) He created his wife (Eve), and from them both, He created many men and women and, and fear Allah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights). and (do not cut the relations of) the wombs (kinship). Surely, Allah is Ever an All-Watcher over you. </strong>[Sooratun-Nisaa&#8217;: Ayat 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>O You who Believe! Fear Allah (by doing all that He has ordered and by abstaining from all that he has forbidden) as He should be feared. [Obey Him, be thankful to Him. and remember Him always] And do not die except in a state of Islam (as Muslims) with complete submission to Allah.</b> [Sooratul-&#8216;Imraan ayah: Ayat 102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>O You who Believe! Keep your duty to Allah and fear Him, and speak (always) the truth. He will direct you to do righteous good deeds and will forgive you of your sins. And whosoever obeys Allah and His Messenger (saws) he has indeed a great achievement (i.e. he will be saved from the Hell-Fire and made to enter Paradise). [Soorat</b><b>ul-Ahzaab: Ayat 70-71]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for what follows: Verily the most truthful speech is the Word of Allaah and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam), and the worst of affairs are the novelties and every novelty is an innovation and every innovation is a going astray and every going astray is in the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I desired to write this as a completion for the treatises which are in circulation amongst the people today &#8211; about the different fields &#8211; especially of worship such as Prayer and Fasting, etc. &#8211; which have made easier that which is difficult as regards religious rulings and being guided thereby, as it maybe difficult these days for some to read, research and extract these rulings from their places within the source books &#8211; either because of the ignorance of the Muslims or laziness or other worldly problems. I sincerely advise all the Muslims to read and research until they come to know and understand their true Deen &#8211; and I wished to write this in order to complete the series of the types of worship, especially since no one has particularized this topic in a treatise &#8211; except what occurs within the books of reference as we have explained &#8211; but I have not found this in the form of a treatise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My method for this treatise has been not to quote except what is authentic from the hadeeth of Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam)<tt> - </tt>if Allaah wishes &#8211; ordering it according to the order of the Wudoo of Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam),<tt> </tt>and I have commented on some of the points about which there is difference of opinion &#8211; stating that which is correct therefrom in our view after replying to the other opinions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah to guide us to that which is proper &#8211; verily He is the One having authority over that and having the Power to do so.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC3"></a>The Definition of Wudoo</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b>Wudoo in the Arabic Language:</b></dt>
<dd>Wudoo is the action, and wadoo the water used therefor &#8211; and it is also a verbal noun; or they are two forms of the same word, both meaning the verbal-noun and maybe both referring also to the water used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><b>Wudoo in the Sharee&#8217;ah:</b></dt>
<dd>Wudoo is using clean and cleansing (Tuhoor) water upon certain body parts as Allaah ta&#8217;ala has prescribed and explained.</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<h1 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC4"></a>The Prescription of Wudoo in The Kitaab And Sunnah:</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah ta&#8217;ala says: <tt>O Ye who believe! When ye prepare for prayer, wash your faces, and your hands (and arms) to the elbows; rub your heads (with water); and (wash) your feet to the ankles</tt> [soorat-ul-Maa&#8217;idah, 5:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Abu Hurairah (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said: <b>The Prayer of anyone of you breaching purification is not accepted unless he makes wudoo.</b> [Al-Bukhaaree, (Fath ul-Baaree, 1/206), Muslim (no.225) and others].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Ibn &#8216;Umar (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhumaa)<tt> </tt>said: Indeed I heard Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) say: <b>Allaah does not accept Prayer without purification, nor Sadaqah from illegally attained wealth.</b> [Muslim (1/160) and others].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhumaa) said: Rasolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said: <b>Verily I have been ordered to make wudoo when I stand for Prayer</b>. [Saheeh. Reported by Abu Dawood (no.3760); at-Tirmidhee (no.1848), and he declared it to be &#8216;hasan-saheeh&#8217;: an-Nasaa.ee (1/73). And Shaikh al-Albaanee declares it to be &#8216;saheeh&#8217; (&#8216;Saheeh ul-Jaami&#8217;, no.2333)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Abu Sa&#8217;eed (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu)<tt> </tt>said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said: <b>The key to Prayer is purification, its &#8216;tahreem&#8217;</b><a href="http://www.qss.org/articles/wudoo.html#fn0">[1]</a><b> is the takbeer and its &#8216;tahleel&#8217;</b><a href="http://www.qss.org/articles/wudoo.html#fn1">[2]</a><b> is the giving salaam.</b> [Reported by Abu Dawood (no.60); at-Tirmidhee (no.3); Ibn Maajah (no.275) and others. Declared as &#8216;saheeh&#8217; by Shaikh al-Albaanee: (&#8216;Saheeh ul-Jaami&#8217;, no.5761)].</p>
<hr />
<h1 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC5"></a>The Excellence of Wudoo</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Abu Hurairah (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu&#8217;alaihi wa sallam) said: <b>Shall I not guide you to that by which Allaah wipes away the sins and raises the ranks?</b> They said: Certainly O Messenger of Allaah! He said <b>Completing the wudoo when it is a hardship, and many steps to the mosques and waiting for the [next] Prayer after the Prayer, that is &#8216;ar-Ribaat&#8217; (defending the frontiers), that is &#8216;ar-Ribaat&#8217; that is &#8216;ar-Ribaat&#8217;).</b> [Reported by Muslim (1/151) and others].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. Abu Hurairah (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) reports that Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam)<tt> </tt>said <b>When the Muslim (or &#8216;Believing&#8217;) servant makes wudoo and washes his face then the sin of everything he looked at with his eye comes away with the water, or with the last drop of the water, and when he washes his hands then the sin of everything he stretched out his hands to comes away with the water, or with the last drop of the water. And when he washes his feet every sin which his feet walked towards comes away with the water or with the last drop of the water &#8211; so that he leaves clean (clear/pure) from sins.</b> [Reported by Muslim (1/148) and others].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. Abu Hurairah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) reports that Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) came to the graveyard and said <b>Peace be upon you, dwelling of Believing People and we will (all) if Allaah wills join you soon. I would have liked to have seen our brothers!</b> They said: Are we not your brothers, O Messenger of Allaah? He said <b>You are my Companions and our brothers are those who have not yet come!</b> They said: How will you know those who have not yet come from your Ummah, O Messenger of Allaah? He said <b>Have you not seen that if a man had a horse with a white blaze and hoof along with a totally jet-black horse, then would he not know his horse?</b> They said: Certainly, O Messnger of Allaah. He said <b>So they will come with white blazes and marks from the wudoo and I am present before them at the Hand (&#8216;water-tank&#8217;) Indeed men will be driven away from my &#8216;water-tank&#8217; as the lost camel is driven away from their gathering place. &#8216;Come on&#8217;. So it will be said: &#8216;Indeed they have made changes after you,&#8217; so I will say: Be off, be off.</b> [Muslim 249].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. Abu Umaamah (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>When a Muslim makes wudoo the sins he has committed come away from his hearing and from his sight and from his hand and from his feet, so when he sits he sits down having been forgiven.</b> [Reported by Ahmad (5/252) and is hasan].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. Abu Maalik al-Ash&#8217;aree (radhiAllaahu anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wasallam) said <b>Purification is half of Imaan. And &#8216;al-hamdu lillaah&#8217; fills the Scales. And &#8216;subhaanAllaah&#8217; and &#8216;al-hamdu lillaah&#8217; fill whatever is between the heaven and the earth. And Prayer is a light. And Sadaqah is a clear proof. And Sabr (patience) is a shining light. And the Qur&#8217;aan is a proof for or against you. Every person starts the day dealing for his own soul so he either sets it free or destroys it.</b> [Reported by Muslim (1/140) and others].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. &#8216;Uthmaan (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>Whoever makes wudoo and makes it well, his sins come out from his body, even coming out from under his nails.</b> [Reported by Muslim (3/133) and others].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. &#8216;Uthmaan (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>Whoever makes wudoo like this &#8211; then all of his previous sins are forgiven &#8211; and his Prayer and his walking to the mosque are above and beyond that.</b> [Reported by Muslim, 3/113].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. Ibn &#8216;Umar (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhumaa) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu&#8217;alaihi wasallam) said <b>When one of you makes wudoo and makes it well, then goes out to the mosque &#8211; having no purpose except Prayer &#8211; then his left foot continues to wipe away his evil deeds and his right foot continually writes for him good deeds until he enters the mosque. And if the people knew what there was in the night prayer and Subh prayers &#8211; then they would come to them even if they had to crawl.</b> [Reported by at-Tabraanee in &#8216;al-Mu&#8217;jam ul-Kabeer&#8217;. And Ash-Shaikh al-Albaanee declares it to be saheeh (As-Saheehah, no.454). And its meaning is reported by al-Bukhaaree and Muslim from the narration of Abu Hurairah].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. Abu Hurairah (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>Whoever makes wudoo and makes it well then goes out &#8211; and then finds that the people have finished the Prayer &#8211; then Allaah gives him the same reward as one who had prayed it along with the people without diminishing any of their reward.</b>[Reported by Abu Dawood (no.564) and an-Nasaa&#8217;ee (no.856) and others. Al-Albaanee declares it to be &#8216;saheeh&#8217; (As-Saheehah, no.6039)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. Zaid ibn Khaalid al Juhanee (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) relates that the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>Whoever makes wudoo and makes it well, then prays two rak&#8217;ahs not letting his mind wander in them &#8211; then Allaah forgives him all of his previous sins.</b> [Reported by Abu Dawood (no.905) and others. Al-Albaanee declares it to be &#8216;hasan&#8217; (As-Saheehah, no.6041)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15. &#8216;Uqbah ibn &#8216;Aamir (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>Whoever makes wudoo and makes it well, then prays two rak&#8217;ahs concentrating therein with his heart and his face &#8211; then Paradise is obligatory for him.</b> [Reported by an-Nasaa&#8217;ee. Al-Albaanee declares it to be &#8216;saheeh&#8217; (As-Saheehah, no.6062)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16. &#8216;Uthmaan (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) said: I heard Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) say <b>Whoever makes wudoo for Prayer and completes the wudoo &#8211; then walks to the obligatory Prayer and prays it with the people &#8211; or with the congregation &#8211; or in the mosque &#8211; then Allaah forgives his sins.</b> [Reported by Muslim (1/144) and others].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17. &#8216;Alee (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) relates that Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>Completing the wudoo when it is a hardship, and walking to the mosque, and waiting for the next prayer after the previous one (greatly) washes away the sins.</b> [Reported by al-Haakim (1/132) who declared it to be saheeh to the standard of Muslim. And al-Haithumee said in &#8216;Az-Zawaa-id&#8217;: It is narrated by Abu Ya&#8217;laa and al-Bazzaar. And its narrators are up to the standard of Al-Bukharee],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18. Humraan ibn Abaan relates that &#8216;Uthmaan asked for water to make wudoo &#8211; then he mentioned how the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) made wudoo . Then he said: The Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said at the end of the hadeeth <b>Whoever makes wudoo in the same way that I have just made wudoo then stands up and prays two rak&#8217;ahs, not thinking of other things, then his previous sins are forgiven.</b> [Related by al-Bukhaaree (Fath ul-Baaree, 11/213) and Muslim (no.226) and an-Nasaa&#8217;ee ( 1/63)] .</p>
<hr />
<h1 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC6"></a>The Components of Wudoo</h1>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC7"></a>An Niyyah (Intention)</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the firm resolve of the heart to perform wudoo in obedience to the order of Allaah ta&#8217;ala and His Messenger (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam). Ibn Taimiyyah (rahimahullaah) said (Majmoo&#8217;at-ur-Rasaa-il il-Kubraa 1/243): &#8220;The place of the niyyah is the heart and not the tongue in all forms of &#8216;ibaadah &#8211; and that is agreed upon by all the Muslim scholars &#8211; Purification, Prayer, Zakaat, Sawm, Hajj, &#8216;Itq (freeing of slaves), Jihaad, etc. If he were to express with his tongue other than that which he intended in his heart &#8211; then what he intended is counted, not what he said. If he voiced the intention with his tongue and the intention was not in his heart, that will not count &#8211; by total agreement of all the scholars of Islaam &#8211; so the niyyah is the firm intention and resolve itself.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19. As Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) himself explained in the hadeeth narrated by &#8216;Umar (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) in the Sahihain Verily the actions are by intention and there is for everyone only what he intended&#8230; [Fath-ul-Baaree, 1/9, and Muslim, 6/48].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC8"></a>At-Tasmiyyah (Mentioning Allaah&#8217;s Name)</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20. Abu Hurairah (radhiAllaahu&#8217; anhu) said that Rasoolullah (sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wasallam) said <b>There is no wudoo for him who does not mention Allaah&#8217;s name upon it.</b>[Reported by Ibn Maajah (no.399), At-Tirmidhee (no.26), Abu Dawood (no.101) and others. Ash-Shaikh al-Albaani says: hadeeth Saheeh (Saheeh ul-Jaarni&#8217;, no.7444)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad in one of his two sayings is of the opinion that it is obligatory in wudoo, ghusl, and Tayammum. He was followed in this opinion by Abu Bakr, and it is the saying of al-Hasan (al-Basaree) and Imam Ishaaq &#8211; as reported by Ibn Qudaamah in &#8216;al-Mughnee&#8217; (1/84) and their proof is this hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qudaamah adds: If we take the saying that it is obligatory, then the wudoo of one who deliberately leaves it is not correct as he has left an obligatory duty in Purification &#8211; just as if he had left the intention; and if he left it forgetfully then his purification is correct. (Al-Mughnee). And this is the saying that we regard as being correct.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Ibn Taimiyyah (rahimahullah) he held it to be obligatory if the related hadeeth was authentic &#8211; as occurs in his Kitaab-ul-Imaan &#8211; and the hadeeth is authentic, so therefore his opinion (rahimahullah) is that it is obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21. Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim report from Anas (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) that some of the Companions of the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) sought water for wudoo , so Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>Does any of you have water?</b> So he put his hand into the water and said <b>Make wudoo in the name of Allaah.</b> And I saw the water coming out from between his fingers until they all made wudoo . Thaabit said: &#8220;I said to Anas (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu): How many were there? He said: About seventy. [Al-Bukhaaree, 1/236, Muslim, 8/411, An-Nasaa&#8217;ee, V8].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the proof for that which we have stated &#8211; it is his (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) saying <b>Make wudoo in the name of Allaah.</b> As for those who say that it is only sunnah mu&#8217;akkadah then they base that upon the relative hadeeth being da&#8217;eef ( There is no wudoo &#8230; ). However since the hadeeth is saheeh as we have explained, then there remains no proof for them and the proof is with us, and Allaah Knows Best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is therefore obligatory as we have shown, however the one who forgets should mention Allaah&#8217;s name when he remembers.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC9"></a>Washing the Hands</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">22. Humraan (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) narrates that &#8216;Uthmaan called for water to make wudoo and washed his hands three times&#8230; then said: I saw Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam)make wudoo just as I have made wudoo . [Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim, and as preceded].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">23. Abu Hurairah (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>When one of you awakes from sleep then let him not enter his hand into the bowl/vessel until he washes it three times as he does not know where his hand has spent the night.</b> [Al-Bukhaaree (Fath ul-Baaree, 1/229), Muslim and it is his wording, as al-Bukhaaree doesn&#8217;t report &#8220;three times&#8221;].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">24. And in the hadeeth of&#8217;Abdullaah ibn Zaid (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) he was asked about the wudoo of the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam), so he called for a bowl of water and made wudoo from it as the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) made wudoo, and he poured out water from the bowl upon his hand and washed it three times. [Al-Bukhaaree (al Fath, l/255), Muslim, 3/121].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">25. Aus ibn Abi Aus reports from his grandfather (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) who said: I saw Rasoolullah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) make wudoo washing his hands three times. [Ahmad (4/9), An-Nasaa&#8217;ee (1/55) &#8211; with saheeh isnaad].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC10"></a>Al-Madmadah and Al-Istinshaaq</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AL-MADMADAH: Is washing the mouth and moving the water around within it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AL-ISTINSHAAQ: Is taking water into the nose and breathing it into its backmost part.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AL-ISTINTHAAR: Is expelling the water from the nose after istinshaaq.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC11"></a>Washing the Mouth and Nose Together with One Handful (of Water)</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">26. &#8216;Abdullaah ibn Zaid al-Ansaaree said that it was said to him: Perform for us the wudoo of Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam), so he called for a pot of water..until he said: So he washed his mouth and nose with a single handful and did that three times. [Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC12"></a>Washing the Mouth</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">27. In the hadeeth of &#8216;Amr ibn Yahyaa (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) he said: And he washed his mouth and nose using three handfuls of water. [Muslim, 3/123].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Imam an-Nawawi says: And in this hadeeth is a clear proof for the correct opinion that the sunnah in washing the mouth and nose is that it should be with three handfuls of water &#8211; washing the mouth and nose [together] with each of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">28. In the hadeeth of&#8217;Aa&#8217;ishah (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhaa) in which she describes the wudoo of the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) that he said <b>When you make wudoo then wash your mouth.</b> [Al-Baihaqi says: &#8216;Its isnaad is saheeh.&#8217; And it contains an addition to the previous hadeeth of &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah in Abu Dawood, no.l43].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC13"></a>Washing the Nose and Expelling the Water</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29. Abu Hurairah (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) narrates that the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>When one of you makes wudoo then let him enter water into his nose, then expel it.</b> [Al-Bukhaaree (al-Fath, 1/229), Muslim (no.237), Abu Dawood (no. 140)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">30. Exerting in sniffing in the water as long as you are not fasting is reported in the hadeeth of Laqeet (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) who said: O Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam), inform me of the wudoo . He said <b>Complete the wudoo and rub between the fingers and excert in breathing in the water into the nose unless you are fasting.</b> [Abu Dawood, no.l42; At-Tirmidhee, no.38; An-nasaa&#8217;ee, no.ll4; IbMaajah, no.407; and others]. (Declared as saheeh by Ibn Hibbaan and al-Haalcim, and adh-Dhahabee agreed to that. Also declared as saheeh by Ibn al Qaataan, An-Nawawi and Ibn Hajr. Refer to the footnote in al-Baghawi&#8217;s Sharh us-Sunnah: 1/417].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is clear from these two ahaadith that washing the mouth and nose are both obligatory (waajib). Ibn Qudaamah says in &#8216;al-Mughnee&#8217;: Washing the nose and washing the mouth are both obligatory in both forms of purification &#8211; Ghusl and wudoo &#8211; as washing the face is obligatory in both of them in the established view of the madhhab; and it is the saying of Ibn al-Mubaarak, Ibn Abi Lailaa and Ishaaq, and it is reported from &#8216;Ataa.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC14"></a>Taking Water into the Nose with the Right Hand and Expelling it with the Left</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abd Khair said: We were sitting looking towards &#8216;Alee &#8211; as he made wudoo &#8211; and he entered into his mouth a handful of water with his right hand and washed his mouth and nose, then expelled it from his nose with his left hand &#8211; he did that three times, then said: Whoever would like to see the way of purification of Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) &#8211; then this is his purification. [Reported by ad-Daarimee. Ash-shaikh al-Albaanee says in his notes on al-Mishkaat: Its isnaad is saheeh].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC15"></a>Washing the Face</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The face (wajh) is determined as being everything between the beginnings of the hair down to the cheeks and the chin, and up to the start of the ears including that which is between the beard and ear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah ta&#8217;ala says: <tt>O Ye who believe! When ye prepare for prayer, wash your faces, and your hands (and arms) to the elbows; rub your heads (with water); and (wash) your feet to the ankles.</tt><b> </b>[soorat-ul-Maa&#8217;idah,5:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Humraan ibn Abaan narrates that &#8216;Uthmaan (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) called for water to make wudoo and so mentioned the way in which the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) made wudoo . Humraan said: Then he washed his face three times. [Al-Bukhaaree (al-Fath, 1/312), Muslim (no.226)].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC16"></a>Running Water Through the Beard with the Fingers</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">31. &#8216;Uthmaan (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) narrates that the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) used to run his (wet fingers) through his beard. [At-Tirmidhee (no.31), Ibn Maajah (no.430), Ibn Jaarood (p.43) and al-Haakim (1/14~) who declared its isnaad as saheeh as did Ibn Khuzaimah and Ibn Hibbaan. See the note in al-Baghagawi&#8217;s Sharh us-Sunnah, 1/421].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">32. Anas (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) narrates that the Prophet (sallallaahu&#8217;alaihi wa sallam), when he made wudoo , used to take a handful of water and enter it below his chin and rub it through his beard and said <b>This is what my Lord &#8211; the Great and Exalted &#8211; has ordered me to do. </b>[Abo Dawood (no.145), al-Baihaqee (1/54), al-Haakim (1/149). Ash-Shaikh al-Albaani declares it to be saheeh (Saheeh ul-Jaami&#8217;, no.4572)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the scholars have declared that entering water through the beard is obligatory and say: If he deliberately leaves it &#8211; then he must repeat the ( wudoo and) prayer. And this is the saying of Imam Ishaaq and Abu Thaur.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most of the scholars however are of the opinion that the order is an order of desirability (istihbaab) and it is not obligatory &#8211; and that it is clearer that that which is obligatory is moving water through that part of the beard..so that it reaches the skin underneath. [Al-Khattaabee, 1/56].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad and Laith and most of the scholars hold that moving water through the beard is obligatory when taking ghusl from Janaabah &#8211; and not obligatory in wudoo . [&#8216;Aun al Ma&#8217;bood, 1/247].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC17"></a>Washing the Arms Including the Elbows</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Note: The arms here which we are ordered to wash begin with the fingertips and hands &#8211; which are to be included in this washing &#8211; they being part of the arm (yad) which we are ordered to Wash in the aayah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah ta&#8217;ala says: <tt>O Ye who believe! When ye prepare for prayer, wash your faces, and your hands (and arms) to the elbows; rub your heads (with water); and (wash) your feet to the ankles.</tt><b> </b>[soorat-ul-Maa&#8217;idah,5:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Humraan ibn Abaan reports that &#8216;Uthmaan (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) called for water for wudoo and mentioned the Prophet&#8217;s (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) way of making wudoo &#8211; and Humraan said: Then he washed his right arm including the elbow three times, then the left in the same way. [Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim as has preceded].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding inclusion of the elbows in the washing of the arms &#8211; scholars have differed: Some of them saying that they must be included in this washing, and others saying that this is not so. And this difference of opinion is due to their disagreement over the meaning of the word &#8220;ilaa&#8221; (to) in the aayah &#8211; does it mean &#8216;up to/until&#8217; or &#8216;up to and including&#8217; ?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He who says that it means &#8216;up to&#8217; does not include the elbows in the washing &#8211; just as Allaah ta&#8217;ala says: <tt>... thumma 'atimmus-siyaama ilaa -llail</tt>:<b> </b>Then complete your fast till the night appears; [soorat-ul-Baqara, 2:187]. And this is the opinion of some of the companions of Imam Maalik.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most scholars, however, hold the view that the meaning is &#8216;up to and including/along with&#8217; &#8211; and thus include the elbows in the washing and use as their evidence Allaah ta&#8217;ala&#8217;s saying: <b>.</b><tt>..wa yayazidkum quwwatan ilaa quwwatikum...:</tt><b> .</b>..and add strength to your strength; [Soorat-ul-Hud 11:52]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">33. The proof in this matter is the hadeeth of Nu&#8217;aim ibn Mijmar who said: I saw Abu Hurairah make wudoo &#8211; he washed his face and completed the wudoo , then washed his right hand until he reached the upper arm, then his left hand till he reached the upper arm&#8221; &#8211; then in the end of the hadeeth he said: &#8220;This is how I saw Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) make wudoo . [Muslim, 1/246]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, dear reader, it is clear from this hadeeth that the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) used to wash the elbows further, he used to increase upon that and wash part of the upper arm.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">34. Jaabir (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) said that when the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallarn) made wudoo , he would pass the water over his elbows. [Reported by ad-Daaraqutnee (1/15), al-Baihaqee (1/56) and others &#8211; Ibn Hajr declared it to be hasan. And Ash-Shaikh al-Albaanee declared it to be saheeh (Saheeh ul-Jaami&#8217;, 4547)].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC18"></a>Wiping the Head and Ears and &#8216;Imaamah</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Wiping over all of the head as Allaah ta&#8217;ala says: <tt>...wamsahoo bi ru'oosikum...</tt><b>:</b> &#8230;rub your heads (with water) [Soorat-ul-Maa&#8217;idah 5:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qudaamah says in &#8216;al-Mughnee&#8217;: Some of the people who claim that that which is ordered to be wiped is part of the head only &#8211; claim that the (Baa) [in the verse] means &#8220;part of&#8221; as if He had said: &#8220;Wipe part of your heads&#8221;.&#8217; However, we say that in His saying <tt>wamsahoo bi ru'oosikum</tt> the (Baa) is as if He said regarding Tayammum <tt>wamsahoo bi wujoohikum</tt><b> </b>[Allaah ta&#8217;ala orders us to wipe the faces].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore their saying that the (Baa) means &#8220;part of&#8221; is incorrect and unknown to the scholars of the language. Ibn Burhaan says: &#8216;He who claims that the &#8220;baa&#8221; means &#8220;part of&#8221; has declared before the scholars of the language that of which they have no knowledge. [al-Mughnee, 1/112].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shaukaanee (rahimahullah) says in Nail-ul-Autaar: It is not established that it means &#8220;part of&#8221; and Seebawaih (one of the foremost scholars of the Arabic language) has denied that in fifteen places in his book. (Nail-ul-Autaar, 1/193).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">35. In the hadeeth of&#8217;Abdullaah ibn Zaid (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) is a further proof of the incorrectness of the saying that it means &#8220;a part of&#8221; &#8211; in that the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) wiped his head with his two hands, moving them forwards and backwards &#8211; beginning with the front of the head and (wiping) with them up to his nape then he (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) returned them to the place from which he began. [Al-Bukhaaree (al-Fath, 1/251), Muslim (no.235), at-Tirmidhee (no.28) and others].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Wiping the ears: The ruling for the ears is the same as that for the head.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">36. And it is authentically reported that Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>The two ears are a part of the head.</b> [Reported by at-Tirmidhee, no.37; Abu Dawood, no.l34 and Ibn Maajah, no.444]. (Declared by ash-Shaikh al-Albaanee to be saheeh &#8211; as-Saheehah, 1/36 &#8211; and Imam Ahmad was of the view that wiping the ears has the same ruling as that for wiping the head.)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who hold the view that it is a sunnah they do not have any evidence except their regarding this hadeeth as being da&#8217;eef &#8211; it is however authentic due to a chain of narration which they did not come across and so the proof is with our saying &#8211; and Allaah Knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And of the scholars who hold that they are part of the head are Ibn al-Musayyib, &#8216;Ataa, al-Hasan, Ibn Seereen, Sa&#8217;eed ibn Jubair and an-Nakha&#8217;ee and it is the saying of ath-Thauree and Ahl ur-Ra&#8217;y and Imams Malik and Ahmad ibn Hanbal.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC19"></a>Taking Fresh Water for the Head and Ears</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">37. Ash-Shaikh al-Albaanee says in &#8216;ad-Da&#8217;eefah&#8217;, no.995: There is not to be found in the Sunnah anything which obligates taking fresh water for the ears &#8211; therefore he should wipe them along with the water for the head &#8211; just as it is also permissible to wipe the head with the water remaining from that of the arms after washing them according to the hadeeth of Ar-Rabee&#8217; bint Mu&#8217;awwidh that the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) &#8220;wiped his head with water remaining in his hand&#8221;. [Reported by Abu Dawood and others with hasan isnaad].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC20"></a>The Way of Wiping</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">38. From &#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8216;Amr &#8211; about the way of performing wudoo &#8211; he said: Then he (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam)<b> </b>wiped his head and entered his two forefingers into his ears and wiped the backs of his ears with his thumbs. [Reported by Abu Dawood (no.135), an-Nasaa&#8217;ee (no.140), Ibn Maajah (no.422) and authenticated by Ibn Khuzairnah].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC21"></a>Wiping Over the &#8216;Imaamah (Turban) Only</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">39. &#8216;Amr ibn Umayyah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) said: I saw Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam)<b> </b>wipe over his turban and leather socks. [Reported by al-Bukhaaree (al Fath, 1/266) and others].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">40. Bilaal (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) reports that the Prophet (sallallaahu&#8217;alaihi wa sallam) wiped over the leather socks and the head cover. [Reported by Muslim, 1/159].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC22"></a>Wiping Over the Turban and Forelock</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">41. Al-Mugheerah ibn Shu&#8217;bah (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) reports that the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) made wudoo and wiped over his forelock and over the turban and leather socks. [Reported by Muslim, 1/159].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qudaamah says in &#8216;al-Mughnee&#8217; (1/310); And if part of the head is uncovered and it is normally so, then it is preferable to wipe over that along with the turban &#8211; that is recorded from Ahmad: as the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) wiped over his turban and forelock &#8211; as occurs in the hadeeth of al-Mugheerah ibn Shu&#8217;bah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for caps/&#8217;prayer hats&#8217;, it is not permissible to wipe over them as Ahmad says for various reasons, from them: (1) They do not cover all of the head normally, nor are they tied around it. (2) There is no difficulty in their removal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the woman&#8217;s head cover &#8211; it is permissible to wipe over it as Umm Salamah used to wipe over her head cover &#8211; as reported by Ibn al-Mundhir. (See&#8217;al-Mughnee&#8217;, 1/312).</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC23"></a>Washing the Feet and Ankles</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah ta&#8217;ala says: <tt>...wa arjulakum ilaal ka'bayn...</tt>: &#8230;and (wash) your feet to the ankles [Soorat-ul-Maa&#8217;idah 5:7] [thus ordering the washing of the feet and ankles].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">42. Ibn &#8216;Umar (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhumaa) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) fell behind us and then came upon us during a journey, then we found him and it was time for &#8216;Asr &#8211; so we began to make wudoo and wipe over our feet, so he (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) called out at the top of his voice Woe to the ankles from the Fire. (two or three times) [Al-Bukhaaree (al Fath, 1/232) and Muslim, 3/128].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nawawi says in his explanation of Sahih Muslim after mentioning the hadeeth: Muslim&#8217;s intention (rahimahullah) in quoting these hadeeth was to prove with it the obligation of washing the feet &#8211; and that wiping them is not sufficient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">43. In the hadeeth of al-Bukhaaree and Muslim from Humraan ibn Abaan that &#8216;Uthmaan (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) called for water for wudoo and then mentioned the wudoo of the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) &#8211; then Humraan said: Then he washed his right foot to the ankle three times and then his left foot to the ankle three times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">44. As Abu Hurairah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) did in Muslim&#8217;s narration: &#8220;Then he washed his right foot till he reached the shin, then he washed the left foot till he reached the shin&#8221; and in the end of the hadeeth said: This is what I saw Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wasallam) do. [Muslim, 1/246].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this hadeeth &#8211; O Brother Muslim &#8211; it becomes clear that the ankles enter into this washing as is clear from his saying &#8217;till he reached the shin&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">45. Al-Mustaurad (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) said: When the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) made wudoo he would enter the water between his toes with his little finger. [Reported by Abu Dawood (no.148), at-Tinnidhee (no.40) and Ibn Maajah (no.446). Declared as &#8216;saheeh&#8217; by al-Albaanee].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-San&#8217;aanee says in &#8216;Subul-us-Salaam&#8217; after quoting this hadeeth: It is a proof for the obligation of wiping between the toes &#8211; and this also occurs in the hadeeth of Ibn &#8216;Abbaas which we have indicated &#8211; which is reported by at-Tirmidhee, Ahmad, Ibn Maajah and al-Haakim &#8211; and authenticated by al-Bukhaaree. And it is done by using the little finger. (See &#8216;Subul-us-Salaam&#8217;, 1/48).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">46. And Laqeet ibn Sabarah said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa salam) said <b>Complete the wudoo and wipe between the Asaabi&#8217; </b>(fingers and/or toes). [Abu Dawood (no.142), at-Tirmidhee (no.37), an-Nasaa&#8217;ee (no.114), Ibn Maajah (no.407), al-Hakim (1/148). Al-Albaanee says: Saheeh.]. As-San&#8217;aanee says: It clearly means both the fingers and toes and is shown clearly in the hadeeth of Ibn &#8216;Abbaas. [Subul-us-Salaam, 1/47].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC24"></a>The Reply to Those who Follow Wiping of the Feet Without Washing</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) Wiping the feet when not wearing anything on the foot is not established from the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam)<b>. </b>As for their using as a proof the reading of the Aayah:<tt>wamsahoo bi ru'oosikum wa arjulakum ilaal ka'bayn</tt>: rub your heads and your feet to the ankles&#8230;[soorat-ul-Maaidah 5:7] reading (arjulikum) &#8211; and saying that the feet are thus connected to (the command to wipe) the heads &#8211; and this is not correct, rather they are connected to (the order to wash) the hands. As for the reading of the word (arjulikum) with Kasra of the laam &#8211; as-San&#8217;aanee says That is for wiping over the leather socks &#8211; as is shown by the Sunnah &#8211; and this is the best interpretation for this particular recital. (As-Subul, 1/58).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) The Qur&#8217;aan is not to be explained according to the human intellect &#8211; especially in the matters of worship such as Salaat and wudoo , etc. &#8211; but by the Sunnah which explains this Pillar. And there are many such examples in the Qur&#8217;an which the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) explained by his sayings &#8211; and from this is the washing of the feet &#8211; and its proof from the Sunnah has preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) If they wish to use the intellect then we say to them: The bottom of the foot has more right to be wiped than the surface (their saying being the wiping of the surface), and if they say: Then what about the socks? we say: That is established from the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) just as washing the foot is also established in the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4) Leaving out one of two verbs and sufficing with one of them, as the Arabs, when two verbs come together having similar meaning and are followed by things related to them, makes it permissible to mention only one of the two verbs and attaching those things relating to the second to those relating to the first which is mentioned &#8211; according to what the wording demands, until it is as if the two are partners with regard to the verb, as the poet said: I fed it with hay and cold water. And what is meant is: I fed it with hay and gave it cold water to drink.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5) The saying of az-Zajjaj (a great scholar of the language): It is permissible that the wording (arjulikum) has the meaning of &#8216;wash the feet&#8217; as the wording (ilal Ka&#8217;bain) conveys that meaning &#8211; as the mentioning of a limit suggests washing just as Allaah ta&#8217;ala says ilaal maraafiq [that is the limit of the elbows is for washing] however, if wiping were intended then there would be no need for mention of a limit just as Allaah ta&#8217;ala says wamsahoo bi ru&#8217;oosikum not mentioning any limit (for wiping the head) and further the term wiping can be used to mean washing. (Al-Mirqaat, 1/400).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(6) And further, the great majority of scholars have agreed that it is obligatory to wash the feet and that is reported &#8211; and reaches the level of mutawaatir from the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) as al-Haafiz Ibn Hajr says; and further it is not established that any of the Sahaabah differed regarding that &#8211; except what is reported from &#8216;Alee, Ibn &#8216;Abbas and Anas (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhum) &#8211; and it is established that they went back on that. (Al-Mirqaat. 1/400~.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">47. And Abu Hurairah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) reports that Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) came to the graveyard and said .<b>..they will come on the Day of Judgement with their blazes shining from the wudoo</b> (It has preceded, no.7). Meaning the Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) will know from the traces of the washing, as for those who do not wash then he will not know them on the Day of Judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hajr says: And it is established that this shining of the faces, hands and feet are particular to the Muslim Ummah.</p>
<hr />
<h1 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC25"></a>Other Aspects of Wudoo</h1>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC26"></a>The Siwaak</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The SIWAAK is that which the mouth is brushed with. And it is also called the MISWAAK, the plural being: SOOK. And the siwaak comes from the Araak tree and it is a well-known tree. Abu Hanifah said: It is the best of the trees whose twigs are used for brushing the teeth&#8230; smelling of milk. Abu Ziyaad said: From it is taken there tooth-sticks &#8211; from its twigs and roots &#8211; and the best part for that is its roots, and it is broadly spreading..And Ibn Shameel: The Araak is a tall fine-shoot green tree with many leaves and branches, having weak wood and growing in hollows &#8211; miswaaks are taken from it, being one of the citrus trees. Its singular is Araak and its plural Araa-ik. (Lisaan-ul-&#8216;Arab, 268).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is mustahabb (desirable) to use the siwaak at many different times as is established from the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) that he used to use the siwaak at every Prayer, and before reading the Qur&#8217;an, and before sleeping and when waking, and when the breath changes &#8211; whether fasting or not &#8211; or whether at the start of the day or in the afternoon, and it is a form of worship which is easy therefore observe it, O my Muslim Brother.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">48. And also when making wudoo , as Abu Hurairah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) narrates that Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said I<b>f I did not fear to cause hardship to my Ummah I would have ordered them to use the siwaak with every wudoo.</b> [Reported by at-Tirrnidhee (no.22) who said: Hasan Saheeh, and Maalik (no.123), Ahmad (4/116), Abu Dawood (no.37) and others. Al-Albaanee declared it to be saheeh (Takhree; ul Mishkaat, no.390)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">49. And &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (radhiAllaahu&#8217; anhaa) narrates that Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>The siwaak is a means of cleansing the mouth and pleasing the Lord.</b> [Al-Bukhaaree reports it in mu&#8217;allaq form &#8211; connected by Ahmad, an-Nasaa&#8217;ee, Ibn Khuzaimah and Ibn Hibbaan].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC27"></a>Ad-Dalk (Rubbing the Water over the Body Parts):</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is part of the wudoo authentically reported from the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam). Al-Mustawrid ibn Shadad said: I saw Rasoolullah (sailallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) when he made wudoo rubbing his toes with his litle finger. [Saheeh as has preceded].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">50. Abdullah ibn Zaid (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) narrates that the Prophet (sallallaahu&#8217;alaihiwasallam) made wudoo and said <b>Rub in this way.</b> [See Nail-ul-Autaar, 4/39].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">51. He (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) also narrates that the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) made wudoo with two thirds of a mudd<a href="http://www.qss.org/articles/wudoo.html#fn2">[3]</a> (of water) and rubbed over his forearms. [Ibn Khuzaimah (no.118), and its isnaad is Saheeh &#8211; and al-Haakim (1/161) reports it by way of Yahyaa ibn Abi Zaa&#8217;idah].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC28"></a>Performing the Wudoo in the Order Mentioned in the Ayaah</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for what is narrated regarding the &#8216;order&#8217; as mentioned in the Aayah, then there is nothing to contradict that &#8211; and this order is obligatory (waajib) and it is said: Sunnah. [See Fiqh al Imam Sa&#8217;eed ibn al Musayyib, 1/64].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for what is related with regard to the Prophet&#8217;s wudoo (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) then it has been reported sometimes out of the regular order. And the proof is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">52. Al-Miqdaam ibn Ma&#8217;d Yakrib said: I came to the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) with water for wudoo , so he washed his hands three times, then washed his face three times, then washed his forearms three times, then washed his mouth and nose three times, then wiped his head and ears &#8211; their outsides and insides &#8211; and washed each of his feet three times. [Ahmad (4/132), Abu Dawood (1/19) with Saheeh isnaad. Ash-Shaukaanee (1/1~5) said: Its isnaad is good, and it is reported by ad-Diyaa in &#8216;al-Mukhtaarah&#8217;. And al-Albaanee records it in &#8216;as-Saheehah&#8217;, no.261] .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a proof that he (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) did not always stick to the regular order &#8211; and this is a proof that it is not obligatory &#8211; however, his sticking to it mostly shows that it is Sunnah. And Allaah Knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Suyooti says as is reported from him in &#8216;Aun al Ma&#8217;bood&#8217; ( 1/48): It is used as a proof &#8211; that is the aforementioned hadeeth &#8211; by him who says that sticking to the regular order in wudoo is not obligatory as he washed his mouth and nose after washing his arms.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author of &#8216;Aun al Ma&#8217;bood&#8217; says: This narration is &#8216;shaadh&#8217;<a href="http://www.qss.org/articles/wudoo.html#fn3">[4]</a> &#8211; and therefore not to be taken in contradiction to the established narrations which put the washing of the mouth and nose before the washing of the face.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: The difference of opinion between the scholars here is with regard to those parts of wudoo which are Sunnah. As for the obligatory duties &#8211; then they are according to the order mentioned in the noble Aayah, and the best thing is to perform all of the actions in the way mentioned in the majority of the ahaadeeth &#8211; and Allaah Knows best.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC29"></a>Al-Mawaalaat (Washing Each Part Directly After the Previous one &#8211; Leaving no Time Gap in Between)</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nothing other than this is established from the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam). It is however established that Ibn &#8216;Umar (radhiAllaahu&#8217; anhu) urinated within the market, then made wudoo and so washed his face and hands and wiped his head, then he was called to pray over a Janazzah so he entered the mosque then wiped over his leather socks, then prayed over it. [Reported by Maalik (no.72) and al-Baihaqee (1/84). And &#8216;Ataa didn&#8217;t see anything wrong with leaving such gaps whilst making wudoo and it is the saying of al-Hasan, an-Nakha&#8217;ee and the better reported of the two sayings of ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC30"></a>Beginning with the Right</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is washing the right hand before the left &#8211; and likewise the feet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">53. &#8216;Aaishah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;annaa) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) used to like to begin with the right in putting on shoes, combing his hair, in purification and in all of his affairs. [Al-Bukhaaree (al Fath) 1/235, Muslim (no.267) and others].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">54. Abu Hurairah (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) narrates that the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>When you dress and when you make wudoo , then begin with the right.</b> [Abu Dawood (4141), at-Tirmidhee (1766), an-Nasaa&#8217;ee (402). Al-Albaanee declares it to be saheeh].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC31"></a>Economizing in the Use of Water and not Being Wasteful</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">55. Anas (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) used to make wudoo with a mudd (of water) and make ghusl with a saa&#8217; or up to five mudds. [Muslim (1/156) and others]. A saa&#8217; is equal to four mudds. ( A mudd is that amount of water which is held by the two hands cupped together.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you consider this hadeeth well, O my Muslim Brother, you would feel ashamed of what some people do these days &#8211; one of them opening the water tap and making wudoo and sometimes talking to his companion whilst the water is running out &#8211; what an excess in wastefulness! So he who does that should fear Allaah and remember this hadeeth and keep it in mind and follow the Sunnah with regard to using the water sparingly and not being wasteful &#8211; and here the true following of the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) is made clear and the true Muslim&#8217;s belief. It is from the Sunnah for the Muslim who wishes to make wudoo to have with him a container large enough for a mudd of water &#8211; in order to force himself to return to the following of the Sunnah.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC32"></a>The Du&#8217;aa After the Wudoo</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">56. &#8216;Umar ibn al-Khattaab (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alahi wa sallam)<b> </b>said <b>None of you makes wudoo and completes the wudoo then says:<br />
</b><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.qss.org/images/wudoo/1.gif" alt="" align="center" /><br />
<b>Ashhadu anlaa ilaaha illallaahu wahdahu laa shareekalahu washhadu anna Muhammadan &#8216;abduhu wa rasooluhu </b>(I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and that Muhammad is His slave andMessenger) <b>except that all eight Gates of Paradise are opened for him &#8211; so that he enters by whichever he pleases.</b>[Reported by Muslim (no.234), Abu Dawood (no 169), at-Tirmidhee (no.55), an-Nasaa&#8217;ee (no.148), Ibn Maajah (no.470)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And at-Tirmidhee adds an authentic addition to it:<b><br />
</b><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.qss.org/images/wudoo/2.gif" alt="" align="center" /><br />
<b>Allaahumma aj&#8217;alnee minat-tawwabeen waj&#8217;alnee minal mutatahhireen </b>(O Allaah, make me one of those who constantly repents toYou and of those who purify themselves.) [Declared as Sahih by al-Albaanee].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">57. Abu Sa&#8217;eed al-Khudree (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) said Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam)said <b>Whoever makes wudoo then says upon finishing the wudoo:<br />
</b><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.qss.org/images/wudoo/3.gif" alt="" align="center" /><br />
<b>Subhaanakallaahumma wa bihamdika ashhadu anlaa ilaaha illa anta astaghfiruka wa atoobu ilaika </b>(I declare You free from all defects my Lord and all praise belongs to you and I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except You. I seek Your forgiveness and I turn to You) <b>It is written in a parchment, then sealed and is not opened till Judgement Day.</b> [Reported by Ibn ar-Sunnee in &#8216;Amal al Yaurn wal-l~ilah, no.30. Declared as Saheeh by al-Albaanee].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC33"></a>Washing Each Body-Part Once</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">68. Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) made wudoo (washing each part) once. [Al-Bukhaaree (al Fath) 1/226].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC34"></a>Washing Each Body-Part Twice</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">59. &#8216;Abdullaah ibn Zaid narrates that the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) made wudoo (washing each part) twice. [Al-Bukhaaree (al Fath) 1/226].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC35"></a>Washing Each Body-Part Twice</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">60. In the hadeeth of&#8217;Uthmaan (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) recorded by al-Bukhaaree and Muslim, he (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wasallam) washed each of the parts three times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from these ahaadeeth it becomes clear to us that, as is well-known to the large majority of scholars, washing each body-part once is obligatory &#8211; and the second and third washings are Sunnah &#8211; and it is better to do likewise following the Sunnah of the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) [&#8216;al-Majmoo&#8217; of an-Nawawi, 1/229].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC36"></a>The Desirability of Making Wudoo for Each Prayer</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafiz says in &#8216;al Fath&#8217; (1/172) in the question &#8216;Making wudoo without having broken it&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">61. Anas (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) says: The Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) used to make wudoo for every prayer. I said: What had you (the Sahaabah) used to do? He said: One wudoo was sufficient for us till such time as we broke it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth is an evidence that what is meant generally is the obligatory Prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Tahaawee says: It may be that that was obligatory upon him (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) particularly &#8211; then was abrogated on the Day of Fath by the hadeeth of Buraidah &#8211; meaning that which Muslim reports &#8211; that he (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) prayed all the Prayers on the Day of Fath with one wudoo and that &#8216;Umar (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) asked him about that so he (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>I did it deliberately.</b> Or it may be that he (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) used to do it out of desirability only, then feared that it might be thought to be obligatory and so left it to show the permissibility of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: The result is that making wudoo for every Prayer is mustahabb and praying all of the Prayers with one wudoo is permissible &#8211; and Allaah Knows best.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC37"></a>The One who is not Sure if he has Broken the Wudoo or not Relies upon that which he is Certain of</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he who knows that he has made wudoo then is not sure that he has broken it &#8211; then his wudoo remains. And he who knows that he has done that which breaks wudoo and doubts when he has made wudoo thereafter then he does not have wudoo . In each case he relies upon that which he is certain of before that which he has doubt about &#8211; and he throws the doubt away. And this is the saying of the great majority of scholars &#8211; and it is the saying of Abu Hanifah, ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee and Ahmad. [&#8216;Al-Mughnee&#8217;, 1/193, and ~iqh ul Awaaa&#8217;ee, 1/56].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">62. And the proof for this is what is established from Abu Hurairah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) who said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>If one of you feels something in his stomach and he isn&#8217;t sure did anything (wind) come out of it or not &#8211; then let him not leave the mosque until he hears a sound or finds a smell.</b> [Muslim (Sharh an-Nawawi, 4/51), &#8216;Aaridat-ul-Ahwadhee Sharh ut-Tirmidhee, 1/79].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the hadeeth is a proof that things remain upon their original state until there is a certainty of a change in that, and doubt does not harm that &#8211; so he who is sure of having made wudoo and thinks that he may have broken it, then he remains upon wudoo .</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC38"></a>A Man and Woman&#8217;s Washing from a Single Vessel</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">63. Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhumaa) narrates that one of the wives of the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) took a ghusl from Janaabah then saw Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam)<b> </b>about to take a ghusl from the water remaining &#8211; so she informed him that she had made ghusl therefrom &#8211; so Rasoolulah said <b>Nothing makes the water impure.</b>[Reported by Abu Dawood (no.67), and an-Nasaa&#8217;ee (no.326), and at-Tirmidhee who declared it to be hasan saheeh, and Ibn Maajah (no.370)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abd ul-Barr says: There is nothing in the Sharee&#8217;ah to prevent each of them washing with the water remaining from the other &#8211; either together or one after the other, and this is the saying of the scholars of the different lands and the great majority of scholars &#8211; and the ahaadeeth about it are Mutawaatir. (Al-Istidhkaar, 1/373).</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC39"></a>Making Wudoo after Eating Camel Meat</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">64. Jaabir ibn Samurah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) narrates that a man asked Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam): Should I make wudoo because of the meat of sheep? He (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>If you wish make wudoo and if you wish then do not make wudoo.</b> He said: Should I make wudoo from the meat of the camel? He (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>Yes, make wudoo from the meat of the camel.</b> He asked: May I pray in sheep-pens? He (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>Yes.</b> He asked: May I pray in the stalls of camels? He (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>No.</b> [Reported by Muslim, 1/189].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC40"></a>Drying the Body Parts after Purification</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Uthman ibn &#8216;Affaan, al- Hasan ibn &#8216;Alee, Anas ibn Maalik, al-Hasan al-Basree, Ibn Seereen, &#8216;Alqamah, al-Aswad, Masrooq, ad-Dahhaak, &#8216;Abdullaah ibn al Haarith, Abu Ya&#8217;laa, Abul Ahwas, Ash-Sha&#8217;bee, Ath-Thawree, Ishaaq, Ibn &#8216;Umar in a narration, and Abu Hanifah, Maalik, Ahmad, and the Shafi&#8217;ee Madhhab in one saying, all say that it is permissible after both wudoo and ghusl to dry the body-parts. And their evidence is what &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhaa) reports &#8211; she said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) had a cloth which he used to dry himself with after making wudoo . [Reported by at-Tirmidhee who declared it to be da&#8217;eef]. Then al Ainee states that an-Nasaa&#8217;ee records it in &#8216;al-Kunaa&#8217; with saheeh isnaad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: And it has other narrations which support and strengthen it. (See Fiqh al-Imam Sa&#8217;eed, 1/70). Al-Albaanee declares the hadeeth to be hasan. (Saheeh ul Jaami&#8217;, 4706).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">65. Salmaan al-Faarsee narrates that the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) made wudoo , then turned up a woollen cloak he had and wiped his face with it. [Reported by Ibn Maajah (no.468)]. In az-Zawaa&#8217;id it is said: Its isnaad is saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: In its isnaad is al-Wadeen ibn &#8216;Ataa who is sadooq but has a bad memory as al-Haafiz Ibn Hajr says in &#8216;Taqreeb ut-Tahdheeb&#8217;, so its isnaad is da&#8217;eef!! &#8211; but it is strengthened by the previous hadeeth of &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah to the level of hasan &#8211; and Allaah Knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some others hold it to be makrooh to dry the body-parts after Purification and their proof is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">66. What is established from Maimoonah (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhaa) who described the Prophet&#8217;s (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) ghusl from Janaabah and said: Then I brought him a cloth but he refused it. [Al-Bukhaaree, and Muslim &#8211; and the word is his].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Final word: Is that drying the body-parts is one of the desirable actions as shown by the hadeeth of Aa&#8217;ishah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhaa) &#8211; as for the saying that it is makrooh then that is not acceptable as the saying of Maimoonah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhaa) &#8220;but he refused it&#8221; does not amount to the fact that it is makrooh &#8211; and Allaah Knows best.</p>

<h1 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC41"></a>Those Things which Break Wudoo</h1>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC42"></a>(1) That Which Comes Out from the Two Private Parts (Front And Back):</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurairah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>Allaah does not accept the prayer of any one of you having committed hadath until he makes wudoo.</b> [Al-Bukhaaree (al Fath, 1/206) and Muslim (no.245)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">67. An-Nawawi says in &#8216;al-Majmoo&#8217; (2/3) as for that which comes out of the two private parts &#8211; then it breaks wudoo according to Allaah ta&#8217;alas saying: <tt>Aw jaa'a ahadukum min al ghaa'it...</tt>: or one of you comes from offices of nature&#8230;[Soorat-ul-Maa&#8217;idah 5:7] along with his (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) saying <b>There is no wudoo except from a sound or a smell.</b> [Saheeh and has preceded (Saheeh ul Jaarni&#8217; (7443)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He adds: So that which comes out of the front or back part of a man or woman breaks the wudoo &#8211; whether excretion or urine or wind &#8211; or a worm or pus or blood or stones or anything else and there is no difference in that for something which happens normally or rarely.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC43"></a>(2) Sound Sleep<a href="http://www.qss.org/articles/wudoo.html#fn4">[5]</a></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">68. &#8216;Alee ibn Abi Taalib (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>The eye is the drawstring for the anus, so he who sleeps then let him make wudoo.</b> [Abu Dawood (no.203), Ibn Maajah (no.477), Ahmad. Declared as Saheeh by al-Albaanee].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the hadeeth is an evidence that sleep does not in itself something that breaks wudoo , however the Purification is broken if it is possible for something to come out from the anus &#8211; however if that is restricted, e.g. by sitting flat on the earth, then that is not the case.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC44"></a>(3) Becoming Unconscious &#8211; Other than Sleep</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is the &#8216;intellect&#8217; going away by any means because of insanirt or fainting or intoxication &#8211; as in this condition he does not know whether his wudoo is broken or not. This is the saying of the great majority of scholars. (Sharh Saheeh Muslim (4/74) and al-Mughnee (1/164)).</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC45"></a>(4) Touching the Uncovered Private Parts</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">69. Abu Hurairah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>If one of you touches his penis and there is no veil between him and it nor any cover, then wudoo has become obligatory for him.</b> [al-Haakim (1/138) and others]. (Al-Albaanee says: hadeeth Saheeh.)</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC46"></a>(5) Touching the Penis</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">70. Busrah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhaa) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) <b></b>said <b>If one of you touches his penis then let him make wudoo.</b> [At-Tirmidhee (1/18) who said it is hasan saheeh. And also declared as Saheeh by Ahmad, al-Bukhaaree and Ibn Ma&#8217;een (Lum&#8217;aat ut-Tanqeeh Sharh Mishkaat ul Masaabeeh, no.319). Others also narrate it as authentic].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">71. Talq ibn &#8216;Alee (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu&#8217;alaihi wa sallam) was asked about a man&#8217;s touching his penis. Should he make wudoo ? He (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>And is it except a part of him? </b>[At-Tirmidhee (no.85) and he said: And this is the best of what is reported in this regard]. Al-Albaanee says: Its isnaad is Saheeh, and this (the view that it doesn&#8217;t break the wudoo) is established as being that of a group of the Sahaabah, from them: Ibn Mas&#8217;ood, &#8216;Ammaar ibn Yaasir, and because of these Imam Ahmad gave the choice between this and the one before it. Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah harmonized the two carrying the first to mean if he touched it with desire and this upon the touching without desire &#8211; and there is in this hadeeth that which gives that impression and it is his (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) saying &#8216;a part of him&#8217;. [Al-Mishkaat al Masaabeeh, notes on nos.3 19 and 320].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">(6) Touching a Woman with Desire:</h2>
<p><a name="_6"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">72. A man&#8217;s touching a woman without desire does not break the wudoo . &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhaa) says: <strong>Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) prayed and I was lying in front of him as in front of a Janaazah, so when he wished to prostrate I pulled up my leg.</strong> [Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">73. And in the same way a woman&#8217;s touching a man without desire does not break wudoo as is established from <strong>&#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhaa): I didn&#8217;t find the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) one night so I tried to find him with my hand &#8211; and my hand fell upon his feet which were raised up as he was making prostration</strong>. [Muslim (3/203) and an-Nasaa&#8217;ee (l/101)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we see from these two hadeeth that merely touching does not break the wudoo &#8211; and Allaah Knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author of&#8217;at-Ta&#8217;leeqaat us-Salafiyyah&#8217; upon Sunan of an-Nasaa&#8217;ee (1/23) says concerning &#8220;he pushed me with his foot&#8221;: It is well-known that that is a touching without desire. And so the author uses it as a proof that touching without desire does not break the wudoo . <strong>As for the touching with desire &#8211; its proof is that the wudoo is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> broken until a proof is established that it does indeed break it</strong> &#8211; and this is enough of a proof to show that it doesn&#8217;t break the wudoo for the one who holds that view &#8211; and above and beyond that is a further proof that it doesn&#8217;t break the wudoo is the hadeeth of kissing &#8211; as normally kissing is not free from touching with desire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author of &#8216;Aun al Ma&#8217;bood&#8217; (1/69) says regarding her saying &#8220;<strong>he kissed me and did not make wudoo</strong>&#8220;&#8216; &#8211; It contains a proof that touching a woman does not break the wudoo as kissing is part of touching and the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) did not make wudoo (before praying). And this (that <strong>touching a woman even with desire doesn&#8217;t break the wudoo</strong> ) is the saying of &#8216;Alee and Ibn &#8216;Abbaas and &#8216;Ataa ibn Taawoos, and Abu Hanifah and Sufyaan ath-Thawree. And this hadeeth is (in itself) da&#8217;eef but is supported by other narrations. And it is mursal &#8211; however ad-Daaraqutnee joins it &#8211; and it is (therefore) an authentic (saheeh) hadeeth inshaaAllaah. (See Nasb ur Raayah, l/70).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author of &#8216;al-Mughnee&#8217; (1/190) says: The touching is not in itself something which breaks wudoo but breaks wudoo as it leads to prostratic fluid or semen being emitted &#8211; so the condition which leads to breaking of the wudoo is considered &#8211; and that is when there is desire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Summary: <strong>That when a man and woman are safe from anything being emitted which breaks wudoo &#8211; then their wudoo is not broken;</strong> and it is preferable to be on the safe side, as they may not be safe from such emissions in the condition of desire &#8211; and Allaah Knows best.</p>
<hr />
<h1 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC47"></a>Conclusion:</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what Allaah ta&#8217;ala has made easy for us to gather together about the wudoo and its rulings, so we hope from Allaah the Most High, the All-Powerful, that we have been able to do justice to the subject &#8211; and we hope that any scholarly solicitous brother who comes across anything in our booklet which is incorrect to cover up and give sincere advice. And it is Allaah who grants success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>الصَّمَد</strong>  <strong><em>As-<u>S</u>amad</em> </strong>(the Perfect Lord and Master upon Whom the whole of creation depends), the Lord and Master Whose control is complete, upon Whom the whole of the creation depends for its needs because of His perfection in His self, His names, His attributes and His actions. The One Who remains and never passes away, the One Who neither eats nor drinks, free of all needs.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Allāh is <em>As-Samad</em>” – Shaykh ibn Uthaymeen</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Concerning his statement: &#8220;Allāh is <em>As-Samad</em>&#8220;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a clause of continuation, after He mentioned <em>Al-Ahadai&#8217;yyah</em> (the oneness), he mentioned <em>As-Samadiyyah</em>, and used a definite clause for both, to indicate exclusivity. That is Allah, alone, is <em>As-Samad</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What is the meaning of <em>As-Samad</em>?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said that As-Samad means <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He is the Perfect One, in His Knowledge, His Power, His Wisdom, His ’<em>Izzah</em> (Honor and Might), His Sovereignty and in all His Attributes</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also said:<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em> As-Samad</em> is the one who does not have any cavity</strong></span> &#8211; that is without intestines nor abdomen. That is why it is said: The Angels are <em>Samad</em> because they do not have cavities; they do not eat nor drink. This meaning is related from Ibn ’Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him.[1] And this does not negate the first meaning, because it indicates His self sufficiency from all of His creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is said: <em>As-Samad</em> has the meaning of the <em>Ma’ful</em> form, that is <em>Al-Masmudu ilaihi</em>;He who is betaken to by the creation of their needs, with the meaning that they incline to Him and they reach out for Him, and surrender their needs to Him. So it has the meaning of the everyone is in need of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These interpretations do not contradict one another in relation to Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and as such we say that each of these meanings are affirmed due to the lack of contradiction among them. We interpret it with a comprehensive interpretation; we say As-Samad is the One Who is Perfect in His Attributes, the One whom all His creatures are in need of; they are dependent upon Him. Therefore, the tremendous meaning of the word As-Samad becomes clear to you. He is the One independent of any need from all other than Him, Perfect in all of What is attributed to Him, and that all other than Him is in need of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If somebody says to you: “Allah rose above the Throne, does His rising above the Throne mean that He is in need of the Throne, such that if the Throne was removed, He would fall?” The answer is no! Never! Because Allah is <em>Samad</em>, perfect without need of the Throne. Rather the Throne, the heavens, the <em>Kursi</em> and all creatures are in need of Allah; He is independent of any need from them. We derive this from the word <em>As-Samad</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If somebody asks: &#8220;<strong>Does Allah eat and drink</strong>?&#8221; I say: Never; because Allah is <em>Samad</em>.” With this, we recognize that the word <em>As-Samad</em> is a word that covers all the perfect Attributes of Allah, and it relates to all the imperfect attributes of the creatures. That is why the are in need of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>The following is Translated &amp; Compiled by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 – Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, Allaah is not ashamed to set forth a parable</span></strong>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Baqarah: 26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – What is mentioned in the hadeeth of Ya’ala bin Umayyah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> saw a man bathing at an open place where there was no partitioning and without a wrapping garment, so the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> climbed the <em>Mimbar</em>, and he praised Allaah and glorified Him and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘Indeed Allaah <em>– Azza wa Jal –</em> is The Shy One, The One who Conceals, He loves modesty and covering up, so if one of you bathes (outside) then he should cover up.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Narrated by Abu Dawood and Nisaa’ee – authenticated by Albaani in ‘Irwa’ no. 2335]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – The hadeeth of Salman <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said: The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘Indeed your Lord <em>– Tabaaraka wa Ta’ala –</em> is The Shy One, The Generous, Allaah is Shy from His slave if the slave raises his hands towards Him, that He would return them without anything.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Narrated by Abu Dawood, Tirmidhi and Ibn Maajah – authenticated by Albaani in ‘Irwa’ no. 2335]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – The author Muhammad al-Hamood an-Najdi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Know – may Allaah have mercy upon me and you – that the greatest modesty which is necessary to have is with Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>, He Who fluctuates His blessings and His virtue day and night. We cannot do without Him even for a blink of an eye. We are under His Hearing and Sight, and nothing of our condition, statements and actions is absent from Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just like Allaah <em>–Azza wa Jal-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Whatever you (O Muhammad) may be doing, and whatever portion you may be reciting from the Qur’aan, – and whatever deed you (mankind) may be doing (good or evil), We are Witness thereof, when you are doing it. And nothing is hidden from your Lord (so much as) the weight of an atom on the earth or in the heaven. Not what is less than that or what is greater than that but is (written) in a Clear Record</span>.</strong> &gt;&gt; [Yunus: 61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Summarised from ‘an-Nahaj al-Asma’ fee Sharh ‘Asmaa Allaah al-Hussna 3/99-]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5  – Shaykh Muhammad Khaleel Haraas <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Name of Allaah Ta’ala <em>al-Hayyee</em> (The Shy One) is a Name which is appropriate to Him, and it is not like the <em>Hayya</em> (Modesty) of the creation, which is a change and effect, which seizes a person when he is frightened by that which brings him shame or fault.  Rather it is leaving that which is not appropriate with His abundant Mercy and His perfect Generosity and Kindness, and His great Pardoning and His Gentleness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the slave of Allaah openly sins even though modesty is the thing that he is in most need of, and modesty is the weakest thing he has, and he uses Allaah’s blessings to sin.  However, Allaah <em>– Subhanahu–</em> along with His perfection in not needing anything whatsoever and His complete ability over modesty, is shy from the slave from removing his veil and humiliating him, so Allaah covers up the slave with that which disguises him from the means of covering up, then after that Allaah pardons his sins and forgives them.  Just like the hadeeth of Ibn Umar <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">‘Indeed Allaah comes close to the believer, and covers him then asks him, between Himself and the slave: Did you not do such and such, on such and such day? Until the slave of Allaah acknowledges his sins, and is certain that he will definitely be destroyed and Allaah says to him: I covered up your sins in the <em>Dunyaa</em> and today I will forgive them for you.’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Narrated by Bukhari and Muslim &#8211; Taken from ‘an-Nahaj al-Asma’ fee Sharh ‘Asmaa Allaah al-Hussna 3/103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allāh , may His Praise and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Read the Text (Posted from above PDF):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great scholar, Hujjatul- Islaam, Aboo Ja’far al- Waraaq at-Tahaawee, in Egypt, may Allaah have mercy upon him, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>1. This is a mention of an explanation of the ‘Aqeedah (Creed and Belief), of the Ahul-Sunnah walJamaa’ah upon the way of the jurists of the Religion: Aboo Haneefah an-Nu’maan ibn Thaabit al-Koofee, and Aboo Yoosuf Ya’qoob ibn Ibraaheem al-Ansaaree, and Aboo ‘Abdillaah Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ash-Shaybaanee- may Allaah be pleased withthem all, and what they held as their Creed from the fundamentals of the Religion and what they held asReligion in obedience to the Lord of the creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>2. We say with regard to Tawheed of Allaah, holding as our Creed and Belief- due to the guidance to correctness granted by Allaah: that Allaah is One, having no partner.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>3. And there is nothing like Him.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>4. And nothing renders Him incapable;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>5. And nothing besides Him has the right to be worshipped.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>6. Ancient without any beginning, remaining forever without any end.*</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>7. He does not perish, nor pass away.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>8. Nothing occurs except what He wills.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>9. He is not reached by people’s conjecture nor can He be grasped by their understanding.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>10. He does not resemble the creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>11. Ever-Living, He does not die.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>12. The Independent Sustainer of everything Who does not sleep.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>13. Creator without any need. Provider without anydifficulty.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>14. Giver of death without any fear.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>15. The One who resurrects without any exertion.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>16. He has always had His attributes from before His act of creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>17. He was not increased in anything by their being brought into existence which was not already His attribute.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>18. And just as He has always possessed His attributes,then likewise He will always possess them forever.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>19. He did not acquire the name ‘al-Khaaliq’ (TheCreator) after the creation of the creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>20. Nor did He acquire the name ‘al-Baaree’ (TheOriginator and Maker) after bringing forth the beings.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>21. He possessed the meaning of ‘ruboobiyyah’(Lordship and Nurturing) even when there were no slaves under His Lordship, and the meaning of being the Creator even when there was no creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>22. And just as He is the One who is the Giver of life to the dead – after He gives them life, then He deservedthis name before He gave life to them; likewise He deserved the name ‘The Creator’ (al- Khaaliq) before He created and produced them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>23. This is because He has full power and ability overeverything.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>24. And everything is totally dependent upon Him.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>25. And every affair is easy for Him.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>26. He has no need of anything.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>27.[Meaning: There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All- Hearing, the All- Seeing.]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>28. He created the creation whilst having full Knowledge (of them).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>29. And He decreed fixed limits for them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>30. And He laid down fixed time-spans for them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>31. And nothing was hidden from Him before He created them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>32. And He knew whatever they were going to do, before He created them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>33. And He commanded them to obey Him, and He forbade them from disobeying Him.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>34. And everything occurs in accordance with His pre- decree.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>35. And His Will is enacted, not the will of His servants-except what He wills for them, so whatever He willed for them occurs, and whatever he did not will for them does not occur.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>36. He guides whoever He wishes, and protects and keeps safe as a favour (fadl) upon them; and He misguides whoever He wishes, and humiliates,1 and puts to trial from (His) Justice (‘adl).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>37. All of them vary within His Will (Mashee.ah), between His Favour and His Justice.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>38. He is Supreme and Exalted – High above having any opposites or rivals.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>39. None can repel His Decree and none can delay His Judgement and none can overcome His commands.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>40. We have Eemaan in all of that, and we are certain that everything comes from Him.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>41. And that Muhammad ( صلى الله عليه وسلم) is His chosen slave, His selected Prophet and HisMessenger with whom He is pleased.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>42. He is the last of the Prophets; the Imaam (leader) of those who have taqwaa (those who are dutiful toAllaah); the chief of the Messengers; and thebeloved one of the Lord of the whole creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>43. And every claim to Prophethood after him is erroneous, and is baseless futile desires.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>44. He is the one sent to the whole of the jinn and to allof mankind; with the Truth and the Guidance, and with light and radiance.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>45. And that the Qur.aan is the Speech of Allaah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>46. It originated from Him as something spoken, without us knowing how; and He sent it down to His Messenger as Revelation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>47. And the Believers attest to it as being the truth upon that basis.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>48. They have certainty that it is the Speech of Allaah – the Most High – in reality.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>49. It is not something created such as the speech of mankind.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>50. So whoever hears it and claims it is the speech of a human, then he has committed Unbelief.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>51. So Allaah has blamed and criticised such a person and has threatened him with Hell-Fire.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>52. So since Allaah has threatened with Hell those who say :[Meaning: This is nothing but the word of a human being]: then we know and we have full certainty that it is the Speech of the Creator of mankind.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>53. And it does not resemble the speech of humans.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>54. And whoever describes Allaah with any human characteristic, then he has disbelieved.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>55. So whoever comprehends this, will take it as a lesson. 56. And will be prevented from the like of the saying of the Unbelievers.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>57. And he will know that He &#8211; with His attributes is not like mankind.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>58. And Seeing (Allaah) by the people of Paradise istrue, without their encompassing Him and without us knowing how it will be.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>59. Just as is stated by the Book of our Lord,[Meaning: Some faces on that day will be radiant, looking at their Lord.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>60. And its explanation is as Allaah- the Most High-wanted and knew.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>61. And every authentic hadeeth reported from the Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) then it is just as he said.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>62. And its meaning is as he intended.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>63. We do not enter into that, interpreting it in accordance with our opinions, nor forming ideas based upon our desires.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>64. For no one will be safe in his Religion except one who submits to Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic – and to His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>65. And who refers whatever is unclear to him back to one who knows it.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>66. And Islam will not be firmly established except upon the basis of unrestricted submission and surrender.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>67. So whoever seeks after that which his knowledge hasbeen prevented from, and who is not satisfied regarding his understanding with submission, thenhis seeking will block him from pure and sincereTawheed and from clear awareness and from correct Eemaan.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>68. So he will waver between Unbelief and Eemaan, and believing and denying, and affirmation and rejection.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>69. He will be a person suffering from whisperings, lost, doubting, neither being a true Believer upon Eemaan, nor an outright rejecter and denier.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>70. And Eemaan (true Faith) in (ar-Ru.yah) the fact that the people of the Abode of Peace and Security will see Allaah &#8211; will not be correct from those of them who takes it to be in accordance with his own mistaken idea, or who misinterprets it with his own understanding.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>71. Since the correct interpretation of the seeing, and the correct interpretation of every meaning ascribed to Lordship is to leave interpreting it, and to adhere to submission.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>72. And upon this rests the Religion of Islaam.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>73. And whoever does not guard himself against negating and against likening the Creator to thecreation, then he will slip and go astray and will not attain the correct declaration of Allaah being free of imperfections.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>74. Since our Lord &#8211; the Majestic and Most High &#8211; hasthe attributes of Unity and Oneness.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>75. Having the attributes of Uniqueness, with no one from the creation sharing in the meaning of that.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>76. And He is highly Exalted above limits and goals, and having parts and limbs and appendages.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>77. He is not contained by the six directions, contrary to all of the living things.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>78. The ‘Mi’raaj’ (the Ascent through the Heavens) is true and the Prophet &#8211; may Allaah extol him and his followers and grant him peace and security-wastaken on the Night- Journey (al-Israa.).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>79. And he was taken bodily, whilst awake, up to the heavens.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>80. Then to whatever higher places Allaah wished, and Allaah bestowed honour upon him with whatever He wished.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>81. And He revealed to him what He revealed to him. [Meaning: The heart did not lie about what it saw.]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>82. So may Allaah extol him and grant him peace and security in the Hereafter and in this life.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>83. And the Lake (al-Hawd) with which Allaah – the Most High will honour him, as a relief from thirst for his Ummah – is true.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>84. And Intercession (ash-Shafaa’ah), which has been stored up for them, is true, as is related in the narrations.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>85. And the Covenant (al-Meethaaq) which Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; took from Aadam and his descendants is true.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>86. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; has always known the number of those who will enter Paradise, and the number of those who will enter the Fire, altogether.So that the number will not be increased, nor will itbe decreased.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>87. And the same applies to their deeds; He knew whatever they would do.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>88. Everyone will have what he was created for made easy for him.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>89. Deeds will be in accordance with their conclusions.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>90. And the fortunate person is the one who is fortunate by the decree of Allaah; and the wretched person is the one who is wretched by the decree of Allaah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>91. And Pre-decree (al-Qadr) is fundamentally the secret of Allaah – the Most High – within His creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>92. Knowledge of it is not acquired by any Angel drawn near, nor any Prophet sent.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>93. Delving deeply into it and looking into that leads to frustration and disappointment and is a ladder to deprivation, and is the level of arrogance.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>94. So beware of that: beware of looking into it, thinking about it, and entertaining whispered ideas about it.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>95. Since Allaah – the Most High – concealed the knowledge of Pre-Decree (al-Qadr) from His creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>96. And He forbade them from striving to attain it.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>97. Just as He &#8211; the Most High said in His Book: Meaning: He can not be questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned.]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>98. So whoever asks: why did He do (such and such) then he has rejected the Judgement of the Book.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>99. And whoever rejects the Judgement of the Book is one of the Unbelievers.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>100. So this is in summary what is required by one whose heart is enlightened, from the beloved servants (Awliyaa.) of Allaah – the Most High.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>101. And it is the level of those firmly grounded in knowledge.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>102. Because knowledge (al-‘Ilm) is of two kinds: knowledge which is present within the creation, and knowledge which is absent from the creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>103. So denying the knowledge which is present is Unbelief, and claiming to have the knowledge which is absent is Unbelief.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>104. And Eemaan (true Faith) is not established except through acceptance of the knowledge which is present, and leaving aside seeking the knowledge which is absent.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>105. And we have Eemaan in the Preserved Tablet (al- Lawh), and in the Pen (al-Qalam), and in everything which has been inscribed in it.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>106. So if the whole of the creation were to gather together regarding something which Allaah – theMost High – had written in it [i.e. in the PreservedTablet] that it was going to occur, and they tried to stop it from happening, then they would not be able to do that. And if they all gathered together concerning something which Allaah – the Most High – did not write in it, to try to make it happen – then they would not be able to do that.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>107. The Pen has run dry having written down whatever will occur until the Day of Resurrection. Andwhatever the servant misses out on then it was never going to come to him, and whatever befalls him, then it was never going to miss him.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>108. And it is upon the servant to know that Allaah had prior knowledge of everything that was going to occur in His creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>109. So He decreed that precisely and firmly.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>110. There is nothing to cancel it out; and there is no one from His creation- in His heavens or on His earth-who can rebut it, remove it, change it, reduce it oradd to it.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>111. And that is from the essential fundamentals of Eemaan, and the fundamental principals ofknowledge and awareness (of Allaah).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>112. And it is from the affirmation of the Tawheed of Allaah- the Most High- and His Lordship just as He- the Most Highsaid in His Book [Meaning: He created everything and gave it a predecreed measure.] And He the Most High said: [Meaning: And the Command of Allaah is a Decree determined.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>113. So woe to the one who becomes an adversary to Allaah- the Most High- regarding Pre-Decree.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>114. And who presents a diseased heart to delve into it.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>115. In his attempt to uncover the Hidden and Unseen (al- Ghayb) he has attempted to uncover a secret which issecure.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>116. And what he has said about it causes him to become a sinful and great liar.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>117. And the Throne (al-’Arsh) and the Foot-stool (al- Kursee) are true.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>118. And He has no need of the Throne or of whatever is beneath it.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>119. He encompasses everything and is above it.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>120. And He has rendered His creation incapable of encompassing (everything).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>121. And we say with Eemaan (true Faith) testifying to the truth and with full submission, that Allaah took Ibraaheem as an especially beloved one (Khaleel), and Allaah spoke directly to Moosaa.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>122. And we have Eemaan (true Faith) in the Angels and the Prophets.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>123. And in the Books which were sent down to the Messengers, and we bear witness that they were upon the clear truth.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>124. And we call those who pray towards our ‘Qiblah’ (direction of Prayer): Muslims and Believers (Mu.minoon).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>125. As long as they acknowledge that which the Prophet came with, and as long as they believe him in whatever he said and informed of.*</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>126. And we do not enter into vain speech concerning Allaah, nor do we dispute regarding Allaah’s Religion.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>127. And we do not dispute concerning the Qur.aan; and we bear witness that it is the Speech of the Lord of the whole of creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>128. The ‘Trustworthy Spirit’ (ar-Roohul-Ameen) [i.e. Jibreel] descended with it and he taught it to the chief of the Messengers- may Allaah extol him and grant him peace and security, and his true followers.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>129. And it is the Speech of Allaah the -Most High- nothing from the speech of the created beings equals it.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>130. And we do not say that it is created, and we do not oppose the united body of the Muslims.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>131. And we do not declare anyone from the people of the Qiblah to be Unbelievers because of a sin – as long as the person does not consider the sin to be lawful.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>132. And we do not say: ‘When a person has Eemaan then it will not be harmed by any sin which he commits.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>133. And we have hope for the doers of good from amongst the Believers that He will pardon them and enter them into Paradise by His Mercy: but we do not feel certain about their being safe, nor do we bear witness of Paradise for them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>134. And we seek forgiveness for their evil-doers, and we fear for them, but we do not cause them to despair.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>135. And feeling totally secure and totally despairing-both of these take a person outside the Religion of Islaam.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>136. And the true path for the people of the Qiblah lies between these two.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>137. And the servant does not exit from Eemaan except by denying that which entered him into it.*</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>138. And Eemaan (true Faith) is to affirm with the tongue,and to believe with the heart. **</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>139. Everything which is authentically from the Messenger (( صلى الله عليه وسلم) from the Legislation and the clear explanation is all true.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>140. Eemaan is one entity, and its people regarding it are the same. **</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>141. And variation in excellence between them is by fear and dutifulness, and by opposing desires, and by adhering to what has most right.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>142. And all of the Believers are ‘Awliyaa.’ of (Servants loved by) the Most Merciful; and those having themost honour with Allaah are the ones who are the most obedient, and those who most closely followthe Qur.aan.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>143. And Eemaan is (to truly believe) inAllaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers and the Last Day, and in Pre- Decree (al-Qadr): that which is sweet from it and what is bitter, that is from Allaah the Most High.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>144. and we are Believers in all of that.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>145. We do not differentiate between any of His Messengers, and we believe all of them regarding what they came with.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>146. And those guilty of major sins (Ahlul-Kabaa.ir) [from the Ummah of Muhammad { صلى الله عليه وسلم] will not remain forever in the Fire, if they die as people upon Tawheed;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>147. Even if they did not repent- as long as they meet Allaah upon awareness, (as true Believers) &#8211; then they will be under His Wish and Will (Mashee.ah), and His Judgement: if He wishes He will forgive them and pardon them, by His Favour, just as He- the Mightyand Majestic &#8211; said in His Book:[Meaning: And He forgives whatever islesser than that for whomever He wishes], and if He wishes He will punish them in the Fire, by His Justice.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>148. Then He will bring them out of it through His Mercy and through the Intercession of those who will intercede- from those who were obedient to Him.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>149. Then He will send them to His Paradise.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>150. And that is because Allaah- the Most High &#8211; is the Guardian of those who have awareness (ma’rifah) of Him, and He does not treat them in the two abodes like those who deny Him: those who fail to receive His Guidance, and do not attain His Guardianship.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>151. Allaah! O Guardian of Islaam and its people! Make us firm upon Islaam until we meet You with it.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>152. And we hold praying the Prayer behind everyrighteous or sinful person from the people of theQiblah, and upon whoever dies from them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>153. And we do not declare about anyone from them that he is going to be in the Paradise or that he is going to be in the Fire.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>154. Nor do we accuse them of Kufr (Unbelief), Shirk or Nifaaq (Hypocrisy) as long as nothing from that appears from them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>155. And we leave their hidden secrets to Allaah – theMost High.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>156. And we do not hold using the sword against anyone from the Ummah of Muhammad ( صلى الله عليه وسلم), except upon those whom it becomes obligatory to use it upon.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>157. And we do not hold rebelling against our rulers and those in authority over our affairs.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>158. Even if they oppress.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>159. And we do not make supplication against them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>160. And we do not take our hand away from obedience to them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>161. And we hold that obedience to them is a part of obedience to Allaah-the Mighty and Majestic-and an obligation, as long as they do not command with something sinful.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>162. And we make supplication for them that they be rectified and kept secure.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>163. And we follow the Sunnah and the ‘Jamaa’ah’ (the united body upon the truth), and we avoid separation, disputation and splitting.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>164. And we love the people of justice and trustworthiness, and we have hatred for the people of injustice and treachery.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>165. And we say: ‘Allaah knows best’ regarding whatever is unclear to us.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>166. And we hold wiping (al-mash) upon leather socks -on journeys or in residence, as occurs in the narrations.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>167. And the Hajj and Jihaad continue along with those in authority over the Muslims: those (leaders) who are righteous and those who are sinners, until the establishment of the Hour; nothing abolishes it or cancels it.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>168. And we have Eemaan in the (Angels who are) noble scribes (al-Kiraamul-Kaatibeen), since Allaah has appointed them as guardians over us.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>169. And we have Eemaan in the Angel of death(Malakul- Mawt), who is entrusted with taking the souls of the people.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>170. And in the punishment of the grave for those who are deserving of it; and in Munkar and Nakeer questioning each person in his grave about his Lord, his Religion, and his Prophet &#8211; as occurs in the narrations from Allaah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and from the Companions &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>171. And the grave will either be a garden from the gardens of Paradise, or a pit from the pits of the Fire.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>172. And we have Eemaan in the Resurrection (al-Ba’th), and in the recompensing for deeds on the Day ofResurrection; and in the presentation of deeds and in the Reckoning, and in the reading of the records; and in the reward and punishment; and in theBridge (as-Siraat) and in the Balance (al-Meezaan).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>173. And the Paradise and the Fire are both already created; they will never finish or pass away.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>174. And that Allaah- the Most High- created Paradise and the Fire before the rest of creation, and He created inhabitants for both of them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>175. So whoever He wishes from them will go toParadise, through His Favour (Fadl); and whoever He wishes from them will go to the Fire, from HisJustice (‘Adl).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>176. And everyone will act in accordance with what has been decreed for him and is going towards the destination he was created for.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>177. And good and evil are predecreed for the servants.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>178. And the ability which is necessary for an action to be carried out with regard to the like of ‘tawfeeq’ (Allaah’s guiding to it and granting it), which is such that it is not permissible to ascribe it to the created being – then this comes along with the action. As for the capability from the aspect of health, capacity, power, and soundness of limbs, then this is present before the action and the address (in the Legislation) relates to this, and it is just as He – the Most High- said: [Meaning: Allaah does not burden a soul except with what it can bear.]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>179. And the actions of the servants are created by Allaah, and earned by the servants.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>180. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High- did not burden them except with what they are capable of.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>181. And they are only capable of doing what they have been enjoined with.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>182. And this is the explanation of ‘Laa hawla wa laaquwwata illaa billaah’ (There is no change and no power except with Allaah’s aid).We say: there is no manoeuvring for anyone, and no movement for anyone, and no moving away from disobedience to Allaah – except with the aid ofAllaah; and there is no power for anyone to establish obedience to Allaah, and to remain firm upon it,except by Allaah’s tawfeeq (His granting successful attainment ofthat).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>183. And everything occurs with the Will (Mashee.ah) of Allaah &#8211; the Most High and His Knowledge, and His Ordainment and Pre-Decree.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>184. His Will overcomes all wills.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>185. And His Pre-Decree overcomes all efforts.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>186. He does whatever He wishes and He is never unjust, [He is Pure and free of every evil and tribulation, and He is free and far removed from every deficiency and blemish.]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>187. [Meaning]: He is not to be questioned about what He does, but rather they will be questioned.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>188. And there is benefit for those who are dead in the living making supplication and their giving in charity.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>189. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High-responds to supplications and fulfils their needs.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>190. He owns and has mastery over everything, and nothing owns and has mastery over Him.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>191. There is no independence from Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; even for the blink of an eye.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>192. And whoever thinks that he can do without Allaah for the blink of an eye has committed Unbelief, and has become from the people of destruction.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>193. And Allaah becomes angry, and becomes pleased, but not like anyone from the creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>194. And we love the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>195. And we do not go beyond the due limits in love of any one of them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>196. And we do not disown and free ourselves from anyone of them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>197. And we hate whoever hates them,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>198. And (we hate) whoever mentions them with other than good; and we do not mention them except with good.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>199. And love of them is Religion (Deen), true-Faith(Eemaan), and goodness (Ihsaan); and hatred of them is Unbelief (Kufr), Hypocrisy (Nifaaq) and Transgression (Tughyaan).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>200. And we affirm the Caliphate after Allaah’s Messenger ( صلى الله عليه وسلم): firstly for Aboo Bakr as-Siddeeq-radiyallaahu `anhu-, affirming his excellence and precedence over the whole of the Ummah; then for `Umar ibn al-Khattaabradiyallaahu `anhu-; then for `Uthmaan-radiyallaahu`anhu-; then for `Alee ibn Abee Taalib-radiyallaahu `anhu-; and they are the rightly guided Caliphs (al-Khulafaa. ur- Raashideen), and the rightly guided Imaams.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>201. And the ten whom Allaah’s Messenger ( صلى الله عليه وسلم) named and to whom he gave glad tidings of Paradise–we bear witness that they will be in Paradise, just as Allaah’s Messenger ( صلى الله عليه وسلم) bore witness, and his word is the truth; and they are: Aboo Bakr, `Umar, `Uthmaan, `Alee, Talhah, az-Zubayr, Sa`d, Sa`eed, ` Abdur-Rahmaan ibn `Awf, and Aboo `Ubaydah ibnal- Jarraah – and he is the eminently trustworthy one of thisUmmah – radiyallaahu `anhum ajma`een- (mayAllaah be pleased with them all.)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>202. And whoever speaks well of the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger ( صلى الله عليه وسلم), and his wives who were pure and free of having any stain upon their honour, and his offspring who were untainted and free of every impurity, then he is free of Hypocrisy.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>203. And the early scholars from the Salaf (the earlypredecessors), and the Taabi`een (successors) who came after them: the people upon good and the narrations, and the people of Fiqh and discernment; are not to be mentioned except with fine words; and whoever speaks ill of them then he is not upon the correct path.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>204. And we do not declare any of the ‘Awliyaa.’ (the beloved and obedient servants of Allaah) to be superior to any of the Prophets- `alaihimus-Salaam- and we say: a single Prophet is superior to all of the `Awliyaa.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>205. And we believe in what is reported from their miracles (karaamaat), and in the narrations about them which are authentically related by the reliable narrators.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>206. And we have Eemaan in the Signs of the Hour: such as the emergence of the Dajjaal,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>207. And the descent of `Eesaa ibn Maryam- `alaihis-Salaamfrom heaven.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>208. And we have Eemaan in the rising of the sun from where it sets.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>209. And in the emergence of the beast of the earth (Daabbatul- Ard) from its place.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>210. And we do not accept as true the saying of a fortune teller (kaahin) or a diviner (‘arraaf).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>211. Nor anyone who claims anything which goes against the Book, the Sunnah, and the consensus (ijmaa`) of the Ummah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>212. And we hold that the united body upon the truth (al- Jamaa’ah) is what is true and correct, and that separation is deviation and punishment.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>213. And the Religion of Allaah upon the earth and in the heavens is one, and it is the Religion of Islaam.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>214. He &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: [Meaning: The Religion with Allaah is Islaam], and He &#8211; the Most High- said :[Meaning: And I am pleased for you with Islaam asyourReligion].</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>215. And it lies between extremism and falling short,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>216. And between ‘tashbeeh’ (likening the creation to the Creator) and ‘ta`teel’ (negating Allaah’s attributes)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>217. And between fatalism (al-jabr) and denying Pre-Decree.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>218. And between feeling secure and despairing.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>219. So this is our Religion and our creed and belief,outwardly and inwardly; and we free ourselves before Allaah of everyone who opposes what we have mentioned and made clear.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>220. And we ask Allaah- the Most High &#8211; to make us firm upon Eemaan (true Faith) &#8211; and to conclude our lives with it.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>221. And that He keeps us safe from the variant heretic ideas and the opinions which cause separation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>222. And the corrupt sects</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>223. like the Mushabbihah,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>224. and the Mu’tazilah,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>225. And the Jahmiyyah and the Jabariyyah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>226. And theQadariyyah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>227. And from those who go against the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah and ally themselves with misguidance.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>228. And we are free of them, and we hold them to be misguided and corrupt, and preservation and guidance to what is correct is granted by Allaah.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Introduction by Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Defenders of the Creed and Belief</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah, the Lord of the whole of creation. May Allaah extol and grant peace and security to our Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu `alayhi wa sallam), the Seal and final one of the Prophets, and upon his true followers, and his companions and the tabi`een upon good until the Day of Recompensing. To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the One Free of all imperfections, has established for the creed and belief of the Muslims, trustworthy guardians from the scholars who are firmly founded in knowledge. So, when the enemies made attacks trying to corrupt the creed and belief of the Muslims, bringing misgivings and raising doubts from the disbelievers, the atheists, the hypocrites, and the companions of the deviant sects, those who deviated away from the methodology of the pious predecessors with regard to the Jahmiyyah, the Mu`tazilah, the Shee`ah, the Baatiniyyah and others; the Baatiniyyah, the Qadariyyah, the Khawaarij, the Murji`ah, the Soofiyyah, and the grave worshippers. Those scholars who are firmly founded in knowledge, who educate and train the people, stood to clarify the correct `aqeedah which is founded upon the Book and the Sunnah and that is what the salaf-us-saalih (pious predecessors) were upon from these affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They stood to repel the doubts and deviations which those contentious enemies put forth. So through them, Allaah threw back their plots into their necks, and their arrows rebounded into their own chests and the correct `aqeedah remained fully protected and clear in its signposts by means of what those imaams have written from books and treatises, some of them abridged and some large in size, which the Muslims studied generation after generation. From those Imaams who were rabbaniyyoon (scholars upon wisdom and taught their students in a wise manner) was Shaykhul-Islaam Muwaffaqud-Deen Aboo Muhammad, `Abdullaah ibn Qudaamah al-Hanbalee, with what he wrote in his book: Lum`atul-I`tiqaad al-Haadee ilaa Sabeel ar-Rashaad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I taught this book and those lessons were recorded on cassette tapes. One of the brothers, may Allaah bless him, transcribed those tapes and arranged them, then he showed the result to me, so I amended and corrected that and refined it. [So] from that came this book which I put forward for their reader despite its deficiency. However, it is a small effort, just as it has been said: &#8220;Giving something extra to your requirements is not generosity until you give generously when you only possess a small amount.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah to cause it (with what it contains) to be a benefit and that He forgives me wherever I have fallen short or made a mistake.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah extol and send peace and security upon our Prophet Muhammad, his true followers and companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">IBN MAAJAH reported in his &#8220;Sunan&#8221; [Book of the Adhaan &amp; the Sunnah regarding it: Chapter 5: The virtue of the Adhaan, and the reward for the Mu·adhdhins]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(no. 728): &#8220;Muhammad ibn Yahyaa narrated to us, and al-Hasan ibn `Alee al-Khallaal, both saying: `Abdullaah ibn Saalih narrated to us saying: Yahyaa ibn Ayyoob narrated to us: from Ibn Juraij: from Naafi`: from Ibn `Umar: that Allaah&#8221;s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Whoever gives the adhaan for twelve years then Paradise is binding for him, and sixty good deeds will be written for him each day, and for each iqaamah thirty good deeds.</strong></span>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Shaykh al-Albaanee said: &#8220;Saheeh”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Shaykh al-Albaanee brought it in &#8220;as-Saheehah&#8221; (no. 42) with the difference in wording: &lt;&lt;.<strong>..and sixty good deeds will be written for him each time&#8230;</strong>&gt;&gt;, and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Reported by Ibn Maajah (no. 728), al-Haakim (1/205) &#8211; and from him by al-Bayhaqee (1/433), and Ibn `Adiyy (1/220), al-Baghawee in &#8220;Sharhus-Sunnah&#8221; (1/58/1-2), and ad-Diyaa· in &#8220;al-Muntaqaa min masmoo&#8221;aatihi bi Marw&#8221; (32/1) &#8230;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Baghawee said: &#8220;&#8221;Abdullaah ibn Saalih, the scribe of al-Layth, was &#8220;sadooq&#8221;, except that some things deserving criticism occurred in his narrations of hadeeth”, therefore al-Boosayree said in &#8220;az-Zawaa·id&#8221; (q. 48/2): &#8220;Its isnaad is weak because of the weakness of `Abdullaah ibn Saalih.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the hadeeth has another weakness, and it is the &#8220;`an`anah&#8221; of Ibn Juraij, and al-Bayhaqee said after it: &#8220;And Yahyaa ibn al-Mutawakkil reported it from Ibn Juraij: from someone who narrated to him from Naafi`. al-Bukhaaree said: And this is more correct.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: So it becomes clear that this chain of narration does not establish proof. However al-Haakim mentioned a witness for it, by way of Ibn Wahb: Ibn Lahee`ah related to me: from `Ubaydullaah ibn Abee Ja`far: from Naafi` &#8211; with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is a &#8220;<em>Saheeh</em>&#8221; <em>isnaad</em>: all its narrators are reliable; and even though there is speech concerning the memory of Ibn Lahee`ah, then this is only the case when the narrator from him is other than one of the `Abdullaahs &#8211; and Ibn Wahb is one of them &#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore the hadeeth becomes &#8220;<em>Saheeh</em>&#8220;, and all praise is for Allaah for His granting the successful attainment of correctness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this hadeeth becomes a clear virtue for the mu·adhdhin who is constant upon his adhaan for the aforementioned period, and it will not be hidden that this has the condition that the person gives the adhaan purely and sincerely seeking the Face of Allaah &#8211; the Most High, not seeking by means of it provision, nor doing it for show or repute, because of the many established proofs in the Book and the Sunnah which show that Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; will not accept actions unless they are done purely and sincerely for Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Refer to the book of &#8220;<em>ar-Riyaa</em>.&#8221; (performing deeds for show) at the beginning of &#8220;<em>at-Targheeb watTarheeb</em>&#8221; of al-Mundhiree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is established that a man came to Ibn &#8220;Umar and said: &#8220;I love you for Allaah&#8221;s sake.&#8221; He said: &#8220;&#8221;Then bear witness that I hate you for Allaah&#8221;s sake!&#8221;&#8221; He said: &#8220;Why?&#8221; He said: &#8220;&#8221;<strong>Because you sing in your adhaan and you take payment for it!!</strong>&#8220;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; at-Tabaraanee reported it in &#8220;al-Mu&#8221;jamul-Kabeer&#8221; (12/264/13059) and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is truly a cause of sorrow is that this tremendous act of worship, and this visible sign of Islaam, has been turned away from by most scholars of the Muslims in our lands. So you will hardly see a single one of them giving adhaan in a mosque, except as Allaah wishes. Indeed they perhaps shy-away from performing it, whereas you may see them rushing for the position of imaam, indeed disputing over it!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is to Allaah that we raise our complaint about the strangeness of this time.&#8221;&#8221;</p>

<p>Leaving the correct path occurs in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>first </strong>is one who leaves the correct path but only intends good
<ul>
<li>He did not seek knowledge from the correct place and is heading for destruction</li>
<li>Following him in his error knowingly is a path leading to destruction</li>
<li>He should be advised privately (if he is not calling to his error)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>second</strong> one leaves the correct path deliberately, obstinately and knowing the Truth
<ul>
<li>He wishes to mislead the people and he is a devil</li>
<li>The devil misleads people from the Straight Path (<em>aayah</em> and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>adeeth mentioned as proof)</li>
<li>It is obligatory to warn against this person otherwise he will fool the people</li>
<li>This is the role of the knowledge-based refutations, <em>rudood</em></li>
<li>Clarifying the Truth is a trust and responsibility Allaah placed upon the scholars</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">TAMAAM-UL-MINNAH’<br />
Translated by Dawud Burbank (rahimahullaah)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many writers – especially in the present age – despite their differing madhabs and specialities – are in the habit of quoting Ahaadeeth attributed to the Prophet (s.a.w.s) – without declaring those which are weak there from, out of ignorance of the Sunnah, or desiring that, or being too lazy to refer back to the books of the experts in that field – and some of those experts are lenient in that about narrating Ahaadeeth about excellent actions. Aboo Shaamah said [‘al-Baa’ith ‘alaa Inkaar il-Bida’ wal-Hawaadith’ p.54] :<strong>&#8221; And this is with the verifiers of the scholars of Ahaadeeth and with the scholars of Usool and Fiqh a mistake, rather they should make its status clear if known – and if not then that will fall under the threat in his (s.a.w.s) saying : &#8221; He who narrates from me a saying which he thinks is a lie, then he is one of them. &#8221; Reported by Muslim. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the ruling for one who remains silent about weak Ahaadeeth concerning excellent actions!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then how about that which concerns rulings and its like?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And know that this done by one of two men : &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) Either he knows the weakness of those Ahaadeeth and he does not indicate their weakness – then he does not indicate their weakness – then he is one who deceives the Muslims, definitely entering under the aforementioned threat – as Ibn Hibbaan says in his book ‘Ad-Du’afaa’ (1/7-8).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; In this narration is a proof that if the Muhaddith narrates something which is not         authentic from the Prophet (s.a.w.s) from what is attributed to him incorrectly and he knows that – then he is like one of the liars – and the text of the narration is even stronger than that, he (s.a.w.s) said : <strong> &#8221; He who narrates Ahaadeeth form me and he thinks it is a lie.. &#8220;</strong>and he did not say : <strong> &#8221; Which he is sure is a lie&#8221;,</strong> so everyone who doubts about what he narrates whether it is authentic or not – then he falls under the address of that narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibn ‘Abdul-Haadee quotes this in ‘as-saamirul-munkee’ (p.165-166) and agrees to it, or that he does not know that is it weak &#8211; and he is also sinful due to his taking it upon himself to attribute it to the Prophet (s.a.w.s) without knowledge, and he (s.a.w.s) said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8221; It is enough falsehood for a person that he narrates everything which he hears&#8221; [Reported by Muslim in the introduction of his ‘saheeh’ see ‘as-saheehah, no. 205]. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he has his share of the sin lying upon the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.s), since he (s.a.w.s) indicated that he who narrates everything which he hears &#8211; and like him is the one who writes is – falls for certain into lying upon him – and therefore he is one of the liars. Firstly – the one who invented it,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and secondly this one who spread it! And Ibn Hibbaan also said (1/9) :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8221; And this narration contains a strong warning against a person’s narrating everything which he hears until he knows for certain that it is authentic.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And an-Nawawee clearly states that the one who does not know whether Ahaadeeth is weak or not then it is not permissible for him to use it as a proof without researching and checking it if he knows how – or by asking the people of knowledge if he does not know.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Translated by Dawud Burbank rahimahullaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Muhammad Naasiruddeen al-Albaanee was asked, &#8220;Our Shaikh, may Allaah bless you, the scholars of the Salaf, may Allaah have mercy upon them, mention that Tawheed is of three types: &#8216;ar-Ruboobiyyah,&#8217; &#8216;al-Uloohiyyah&#8217; and &#8216;al-Asmaa was-Sifaat,&#8217; so is it correct for us to say that there is a fourth Tawheed that is &#8216;Tawheedul-Haakimiyyah&#8217; or &#8216;Tawheed of Judgement?&#8217; So he replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8216;Al-Haakimiyyah&#8217; is a branch of the branches of Tawheedul-Uloohiyyah, and those who focus their attention upon this newly invented saying in the present age use it as a weapon not to teach the Muslims the Tawheed that all of the Prophets and Messengers came with, but rather as apolitical weapon. So if you wish I will establish for you what I have just said, even though this question has repeatedly been answered by me, many times &#8211; or if you wish we will continue upon our topic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have said in similar circumstances, as support for what I have just said, that usage of the word &#8216;al-Haakimyyah&#8217; is part of the political da&#8217;wah that is particular to some of the parties present today; and I will mention here something that occurred between myself and someone who gave the khutbah in one of the mosques of Damascus. So on the day of Jumu&#8217;ah he gave a khutbah which was all about judgement/decree being for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. But this person made an error with regard to a matter of fiqh. So after he had finished the prayer I went forward to him and gave him &#8216;salaam,&#8217; and said to him, &#8216;O my brother, you did so and so, and that is contrary to the Sunnah.&#8217; So he said to me, &#8216;I am a Hanafee, and the Hanafee madhhab says what I have done.&#8217; So I said, &#8216;Subhaanallaah! You have given khutbah that judgement/decree is just for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, but you only use this word to attack those rulers whom you think are Unbelievers because they do not rule according to the Islamic Sharee&#8217;ah. But you have forgotten about yourselves &#8211; that Allaah&#8217;s decree/judgement covers every Muslim. So why, when I say to you that the Messenger did so and so, why do you say, &#8216;But my madhhab is such and such.&#8217; Then you have contradicted that which you call the people to.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if it were not for the fact that they use this saying as a tool for political propaganda of theirs, then we would say, &#8216;This is our merchandise that has been returned to us.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the da&#8217;wah that we call the people to contains &#8216;al-Haakimiyyah&#8217; and other than &#8216;al-Haakimiyyah&#8217;: Tawheedul-Uloohiyyah and Tawheed of worship &#8211; that which you concentrate upon enters within it. We are the ones who propagated what you mention whilst you are focusing upon &#8216;al-Haakimiyyah,&#8217; the hadeeth of Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan, that when the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa-sallam) recited this ayah to his noble Companions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They (the Jews and the Christians) took the Rabbis and learned men as lords besides Allaah. Soorah at-Tawbah (9):31</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">then &#8216;Adiyy ibn Haatim at-Taa&#8217;ee said, &#8216;By Allaah, O Messenger of Allaah, we did not take them as lords besides Allaah.&#8217; So he said, &#8216;When they made something lawful forbidden for you, had you not used to declare it forbidden; and when they made lawful something forbidden, had you not used to take it as being lawful?&#8217; He said, &#8216;As for that, then it did used to happen.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Then that is your taking them as lords besides Allaah.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we are the ones who propagated this hadeeth, and then it reached the others. Then they advanced one part of Tawheedul-Uloohiyyah or worship, with this innovated title for political aims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I do not see anything (wrong) in a terminology such as this if only they had not left it as mere propaganda without their acting as it requires. So it is, as I have just mentioned, a part of Tawheed of worship &#8211; but you will see them worshipping Allaah in whatever manner each of them feels like, and if it is said, as we have just mentioned in the incident of the man who gave the khutbah, &#8216;that someone is acting contrary to the Sunnah,&#8217; or &#8216;this is something contrary to the saying of the Messenger (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa-sallam),&#8217; then he says, &#8216;My madhhab is such and such.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That judgement/decree is for Allaah alone is not just a proof against the Unbelievers and the mushriks, but also against anyone who transgresses against Allaah by contradicting what came from Allaah in His Book, and from His Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa-sallam) in his Sunnah. This is what I have as a reply to the likes of this question.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Taken from &#8216;al-Muslimoon,&#8217; no. 639, 25th of Dhul-Hijjah 1417H which corresponds to Friday the 2nd of May 1997.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The first type of craving for wealth is that a person has extreme love for wealth and also relentlessly exerts efforts to attain it &#8211; via means which are lawful &#8211; being excessive in that, striving hard and making painstaking efforts and toiling in order to attain it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been reported that this hadeeth was in response to the appearance of some elements of th is, as at-Tabaraanee reports from `Aasim ibn `Adiyy, radiyallaahu `anhu, who said, `I bought a hundred shares from the shares of Khaybar and that reached the Prophet sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam so he said, <b>&#8220;Two ravenous wolves remaining amongst sheep whose owner has lost them will not be more harmful than a Muslim`s seeking after wealth and status is to his Deen.”</b> [It is quoted by al-Haithumee in Majma` uz-Zawaa`id (10/250) and he attributed it to at-Tabaraanee in al-Awsat and said, &#8220;Its isnaad is hasan (good).&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing more to chasing after wealth than the wastage of a person&#8217;s noble life for that which has no value. Instead he could have earned a high rank (in Paradise) and everlasting bliss, but he lost this due to his craving after provision &#8211; which had already been assured to him and allotted to him, and it was not possible for anything to come to him except what was decreed for him &#8211; then on top of this he does not benefit from that, but rather abandons it and leaves it for someone else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He departs from that and leaves it behind so that he will be the one held accountable for it, yet someone else benefits from it. So in reality he is only gathering it for someone who will not praise him for that, whilst he himself goes on to One who will not excuse him for that &#8211; this itself would indeed be enough to show the blameworthiness of this craving.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The person who has this craving wastes his valuable time and engages himself in that which is of no benefit to himself &#8211; in journeying and exposing himself to dangers in order to amass that which will only benefit someone else, so it is as is said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;So one who spends his days in gathering wealth<br />
Out of fear of poverty &#8211; then he has achieved only poverty.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was said to a wise man, &#8220;So and so has amassed wealth,&#8221; so he said, &#8220;Then has he amassed days in which to spend it?&#8221; It was said, &#8220;No.&#8221; So he said, &#8220;Then he has amassed nothing!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was also said in some narrations from the People of the Book, &#8220;Provision has already been allotted and the one greedy for wealth is deprived. Son of Aadam! If you spend your life in seeking after this world then when will you seek after the Hereafter?&#8221; &#8220;If you are unable to do good deeds in this world, then what will you do on the Day of Resurrection?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas`ood, radiyallaahu `anhumaa, said, &#8220;Certain faith (yaqeen) is that you do not make the people happy by angering Allaah, and that you do not envy anyone for that which Allaah has provided, and that you do not blame anyone for something which Allaah has not given you &#8211; since provision will not be brought on by a person&#8217;s craving after it, nor will it be repelled by a person&#8217;s disliking it. Indeed Allaah through His Justice has made joy and happiness dependant upon having certain faith and contentment, and He has made worries and sorrow spring from doubt and displeasure.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the Salaf (predecessors) said: &#8220;Since predecree (qadr) is a reality then craving is futile. Since treachery exists in people&#8217;s characters then trusting everybody is to expose oneself to humiliation. Since death awaits everybody, then being satisfied with this world is foolishness.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdul-Waahid ibn Zayd (from the successors of the Taabi`een of Basrah, died after 150H) used to swear by Allaah that a person&#8217;s craving after this world was more fearful to him than his worst enemy. He also used to say, “O my brothers! Do not grow up craving after his riches and increase in earnings or wealth, rather look upon him with the eye of one who detests that he is preoccupying himself with that which will cause his ruin tomorrow in the Place of Return &#8211; and is proud with that.&#8221; He also used to say, &#8220;Craving is of two types: Craving which is an affliction and craving which is beneficial. As for the craving which is beneficial, then it is one&#8217;s desire for that which is obedience to Allaah, and as for the craving which is an affliction then it is a person&#8217;s craving after this world.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Craving after this world torments a person, he is preoccupied and does not attain joy or pleasure whilst amassing &#8211; since he is preoccupied. He does not find time &#8211; due to his love of this world – for the Hereafter, and is preoccupied with that which will perish and forgets that which will abide and remain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this regard a person said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Do not envy a brother who craves after riches –<br />
rather look upon him with aversion.<br />
Indeed the one who craves is preoccupied with his<br />
wealth from having any happiness due to his belongings.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Someone else said in this regard:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“O gatherer and miserly one being watched closely by time<br />
which is wondering which of its doors it should close.<br />
You have gathered wealth, but think have you gathered for it &#8211;<br />
O gatherer of wealth &#8211; days in which you can spend it.<br />
Wealth is hoarded away with you for those who will inherit it &#8211;<br />
The wealth is not yours except on the day when you spend it.<br />
Satisfaction is for the one who settles in its neighbourhood<br />
And in its shade he finds no worries to disturb him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A wise person wrote to a brother of his who desired this world: &#8220;To proceed, you have become one who craves after this world. It will serve you whilst taking you away from it with accidents, illnesses, calamities and infirmity. It is as if you have not seen one who craves prevented from what he desires, nor one who shuns this world granted provision, nor one who died despite having great wealth, nor one who is fully satisfied in this world with a small amount.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A desert Arab rebuked a brother of his for covetousness, saying, &#8220;O my brother you are a seeker and one sought. You are being sought by One whom you cannot escape, and you are seeking that for which you have been sufficed. O brother, it is as if you have not seen one who craves being prevented, nor one who shuns the world being granted provision.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A wise man said, &#8220;The people who have the greatest degree of restlessness are the envious, those who have the greatest degree of happiness are the contented. Those who persevere most through suffering are those who are covetous. Those who have the simplest and most pleasant life are those who most strongly refuse this world. The one who will suffer the greatest regret is the scholar whose actions contradict his knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second type of craving after wealth is that in addition to what has been mentioned in the first type, he also seeks wealth through unlawful means and withholds people&#8217;s rights &#8211; then this is definitely blameworthy greed and covetousness. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And whoever is saved from his covetousness, such are those who are successful.” [Soorah al-Hashr (59):9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in Sunan Abee Daawood from `Abdullaah ibn `Amr, radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu, from the Prophet sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam that he said, &#8220;Beware of greed (avarice) for indeed greed (avarice) destroyed those who came before you. It ordered them to cut off ties of relationship so they cut off ties of relationship, and it ordered them to be miserly so they were miserly, and it ordered them to commit sins so they committed sins.&#8221; [Reported by Aboo Daawood (transl. vol.2, p.445, no.1694), and al-Haakim (1/415) who declared it saheeh and adh-Dhahabee agreed, and Ahmad reports it (2/159, 195) with similar wording. I (Badr `Abdullah al-Badr) say: Its isnaad is saheeh.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in Saheeh Muslim from Jaabir, radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu, that the Prophet sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam said, &#8220;Beware of greed (avarice), since greed (avarice) destroyed those who came before you. It led them to shed their blood and make lawful what was forbidden for them.&#8221; [Reported by Muslim (transl. vol.4, p.1366, no. 6248) and others, an-Nawawee said in explanation of the hadeeth, &#8220;al-Qaadee `Iyaad said: It is possible that this destruction was the destruction of those whose blood was spilled who were mentioned here, and it is possible that it is destruction in the Hereafter &#8211; and this is more apparent, and it is possible that it means destruction in both this world and the Hereafter. A number of people have said that avarice/greed (<i>shuhh</i>) is more severe than miserliness (<i>bukhl</i>) and causes the person to withhold to a greater degree. Some say that it is miserliness combined with covetousness. Some say that miserliness is with reference to specific actions whereas avarice/greed is general. Some say that miserliness is in particular actions and avarice/greed is with reference to wealth and good actions. Others say that avarice/greed is desiring that which one does not possess and being miserly about what one does possess.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the scholars say, &#8220;Avarice is eager craving which causes a person to take things which are not lawful for him, and to withhold the rights of others. Its reality is that a person craves that which Allaah has forbidden and prohibited him from, and that one is not contented with the wealth and womenfolk and whatever else Allaah has made lawful for him. So Allaah, the Most High, has made lawful for us that which is good from foods, drinks, clothing and women and has forbidden us to acquire these things except by lawful means and He made lawful for us the blood and wealth of the Unbelievers and those fighting against us. He also forbade us from everything impure from foods, drinks, clothing and women, and He forbade us from seizing people&#8217;s wealth and spilling their blood unjustly. So he who limits himself to that which is permitted for him is a Believer, and one who goes beyond that into what he has been forbidden &#8211; then this is blameworthy avarice which is inconsistent with <i>Eemaan</i> (true faith in belief, word and action).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore the Prophet sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam informed that avarice causes a person to cut off relations, commit sins and to be miserly &#8211; and miserliness is a person&#8217;s clinging on greedily to what he has in his hand. Whereas avarice is seeking to obtain that which does not belong to him unjustly and wrongfully &#8211; whether it is wealth or something else. It is even said that it is the head of all sins &#8211; this was how Ibn Mas`ood, radiyallaahu `anhu, and others from the Salaf explained avarice and greed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from this the meaning of the hadeeth of Aboo Hurairah, radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu, will be understood. He reports that the Prophet sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam said, &#8220;Avarice (<i>shuhh</i>) and <i>Eemaan</i> will not combine in the heart of a Believer.&#8221; [This is part of a hadeeth whose wording is, &#8220;Dust in the way of Allaah and the smoke of Hell-Fire will never combine in the belly of a servant, nor will avarice and Eemaan ever combine in the heart of a servant.&#8221; It is reported by Ibn Abee Shaibah (5/344), Ahmad, an-Nasaa&#8217;ee (6/13,14)&#8230; and its chain of narration is hasan lighairihi (good due to supports).] Also in another hadeeth from the Prophet sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam he said &#8220;The best of <i> Eemaan</i> is self-restraint (<i>sabr</i>) and compliance/liberality (<i>musaamahah</i>).&#8221; [This hadeeth has been reported from four Companions: (i) `Umayr ibn Qataadah al-Laythee, by al-Bukhaaree in at-Taareekhul-Kabeer (3/2/530) and al-Haakim (3/ 626), (ii) Jaabir ibn `Abdillaah &#8211; by Ibn Abee Shaibah in al-Eemaan (no.43) and Ibn Hibbaan in al-Majrooheen (3/136), (iii) `Amr ibn `Abasah &#8211; by Ahmad (4/375) and (iv) `Ubaadah ibn as-Saamit &#8211; by Ahmad (5/319), and the hadeeth is saheeh due to these chains &#8211; and Allaah knows best.] <i>Sabr</i> here has been explained to be withholding oneself from forbidden things, and <i>musaamahah</i> as the carrying out of the obligatory actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also the word <i>shuhh</i> (avarice) may sometimes be used to mean <i>bukhl</i> (miserliness) and vice-versa, however in origin they are different in meaning, as we have mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the person&#8217;s craving after wealth reaches this level then the deficiency it causes in a person&#8217;s Religion is clear &#8211; since failing to fulfill what is obligatory and falling into what is forbidden reduce one&#8217;s Religion and <i> Eemaan</i> without a doubt to the point that nothing but a little remains of it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="font-size:11px;line-height:1.5em;">It was a khutbah given by him on the 12th of Muharram 1411AH which was published in Arabic and translated to English by Dawud Burbank rahimahullaah.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah, in whose Hand is the dominion of the heavens and the earth. Sovereignty is His, all praise is for Him, and He is a witness of everything. All His prescribed laws and what He has decreed are from His Wisdom. He does whatever He wills and commands whatever He wishes. I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah alone, having no partner, the Guardian, the One Worthy of all Praise. I testify that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger, the last of the prophets and their leader and the best of worshippers; may Allaah extol and send complete peace upon his family, his Companions and those who follow them in goodness till the Day of Judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, says, explaining His complete Power, and perfect Wisdom, that what He alone orders is what happens, and that He is the one governing and controlling His servants &#8211; granting security, fear, ease, hardship, facility, difficulty, straightened circumstances and prosperity&#8230; Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">يَسْأَلُهُ مَن فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۚ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ هُوَ فِي شَأْنٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;"><i>Whosoever is in the heavens and on earth begs of Him. Every day He has a matter to bring forth</i></span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"><i> (such as giving honour to some, disgrace to some, life to some, death to some etc)</i></span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"><i>!&#8221;  </i></span></strong>(Soorah ar-Rahmaan (55): 29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah, the Most High, controls the affairs of His creation enforcing His rulings sometimes according to His Wisdom and Beneficence, and sometimes according to His Wisdom and Justice, and your Lord never treats anyone unjustly:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَمَا ظَلَمْنَاهُمْ وَلَٰكِن كَانُوا هُمُ الظَّالِمِينَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;We wronged them not, but they were wrong-doers.&#8221;</span> </strong></i>(Soorah az-Zukhruf (42): 76)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>O Muslims:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed we believe in Allaah and His predecree (<em>Qadr</em>), and belief in Allaah&#8217;s predecree is one of the pillars of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong><em>Eemaan</em> is belief in the heart, saying of the tongue and action of the limbs</strong>.) [Translator&#8217;s Note]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We believe that whatever good or state of ease and security comes upon us then it is from Allaah&#8217;s blessings upon us and it is an obligation upon us that we give praise and thanks to the One who granted and provided that for us. This is done by returning to obedience to Him, avoiding whatever He forbade and doing whatever He ordered. If we carry out our duty of obedience to Allaah then we will be giving thanks for His blessings and would then deserve the increase in these blessings which Allaah has promised us from His bounty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَمَا بِكُم مِّن نِّعْمَةٍ فَمِنَ اللَّهِ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whatever of the blessings and good things you have, it is from Allaah</strong></span>.&#8221; </i>(Soorah an-Nahl (16):53)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and He, the Most High says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِذْ تَأَذَّنَ رَبُّكُمْ لَئِن شَكَرْتُمْ لَأَزِيدَنَّكُمْ ۖ وَلَئِن كَفَرْتُمْ إِنَّ عَذَابِي لَشَدِيدٌ</span><br />
<i></i></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;And </strong>(remember)<strong> when your Lord proclaimed: &#8216;If you give thanks, I will give you more </strong>(of My blessings)<strong>, but if you are thankless, verily My punishment is indeed severe.'&#8221;</strong> </span></i>(Soorah Ibraaheem (14):7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>O Muslims:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Alhamdu&#8217;Lillaah</em> (All Praise and thanks are for Allaah), we live in this land in a state of security and ease, but this state of security and ease cannot continue except through obedience to Allaah. As long as we order good and forbid evil, as long as we cooperate in ordering good and forbidding evil, since those who order good and forbid evil are at the forefront of the <em>Ummah</em> (Nation, the Muslims as a group), and they repel the causes of punishment and chastisement, so we should assist them and be with them. If they err we should inform them of their mistake and warn them about it and lead them to the guidance and not let their mistake become a reason to remove and distance them from this responsibility &#8211; that is not the correct way.<br />
<b><br />
O Muslims:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993366;">Whatever harm and hardship has befallen the people in their wealth or security, individuals or societies is due to their sins and their having neglected the commands of Allaah and his prescribed laws, and their seeking judgement amongst the people by other than the prescribed laws of Allaah &#8211; who created all of creation and was more merciful to them than their mothers and fathers, and He is the One who knows better than themselves what is most beneficial for them.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>O Muslims:</b><br />
<b><br />
I repeat this sentence because of its importance and because many of the people turn away from it:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>I say (meaning the Shaykh):</b> whatever harm and hardship has befallen the people in their wealth or security, individuals or societies is due to their sins and their having neglected the commands of Allaah and his prescribed laws, and their seeking judgement amongst the people by other than the prescribed laws of Allaah &#8211; who created all of creation and was more merciful to them than their mothers and fathers, and He is the One who knows better than themselves what is most beneficial for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, says, explaining that in His Book, so that we may realize and take warning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَمَا أَصَابَكُم مِّن مُّصِيبَةٍ فَبِمَا كَسَبَتْ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَيَعْفُو عَن كَثِيرٍ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much.&#8221;</span></strong> </i>(Soorah ash-Shoora (42):30)</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">مَّا أَصَابَكَ مِنْ حَسَنَةٍ فَمِنَ اللَّهِ ۖ وَمَا أَصَابَكَ مِن سَيِّئَةٍ فَمِن نَّفْسِكَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;Whatever of good reaches you, is from Allaah, but whatever of evil befalls you, is from yourself.&#8221; </i></span></strong>(Soorah an-Nisaa&#8217; (4):79)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whatever good comes upon us &#8211; blessings or security &#8211; it is from Allaah, it is He who provided that, its beginning and end, from His beneficience. It is He who granted us from His bounty that we should carry out what which would lead to it, and it is He who granted us His blessings and completed that for us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for whatever evil has befallen us, whether famine or fear, or whatever else causes harm, then it is due to our own selves, we are the ones who have wronged ourselves and led ourselves to destruction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>O people:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many people today attribute the misfortunes which befall them, whether relating to wealth and economics, or security and political affairs to purely materialistic causes, to political causes, economic reasons, or problems due to borders. There is no doubt that this is due to their limited understanding and weakness of their eemaan and their failure to reflect upon the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>O Muslims, Believers in Allaah and His Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Behind these reasons are causes prescribed as such by Allaah, reasons and causes for these misfortunes which are stronger, greater and produce a more severe effect than the material reasons. However the material reasons may be a means of bringing about what is due to the causes prescribed by Allaah which necessitates the misfortune and punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>ظَهَرَ الْفَسَادُ فِي الْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ أَيْدِي النَّاسِ لِيُذِيقَهُم بَعْضَ الَّذِي عَمِلُوا لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</strong> </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Evil </strong>(sins and disobedience of Allaah etc.)<strong> has appeared on the land and sea because of what the hands of men have earned </strong>(by oppression and evil deeds etc.)<strong>, that Allaah may make them taste a part of that which they have done, in order that they may return </strong>(by repenting to Allaah)<strong>.&#8221; </strong></span> (</i>Soorah ar-Room (30):41)<br />
<b><br />
</b><b>O people, O Muslims, O nation of Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Give thanks for the blessings of Allaah upon you which you are about to hear of. O nation of Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم you are the best and most noble of the nations of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. Allaah does not punish this nation for its disobedience and sins in the way that He punished the previous nations. He will not cause its destruction with a single overwhelming punishment as happened to &#8216;<em>Aad</em> (See Soorah al-Haaqqah (69):6-7), when they were destroyed by the violent wind which He unleashed upon them for seven nights and eight days in succession so that they were left lying like the hollow trunks of palm trees &#8211; do you see any remnants of them? He will not destroy it with the like of the punishment of <em>Thamood</em> (See Soorah al-Haaqqah (69):5) who were seized by the terrible shout and the earthquake so that they lay prostrate corpses in their homes. And He will not destroy it with the like of the punishment of the people of <em>Loot</em> (See Soorah al-A&#8217;raaf (7):80-84), against whom Allaah sent a violent wind and stones from the sky and turned their homes upside down.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>O Muslims:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, from His Wisdom and His Mercy, punishes this nation for its sins and disobedience by setting some part of it upon the others so that they destroy one another and take each other prisoner. Allaah, the Might and Majestic, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>قُلْ هُوَ الْقَادِرُ عَلَىٰ أَن يَبْعَثَ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابًا مِّن فَوْقِكُمْ أَوْ مِن تَحْتِ أَرْجُلِكُمْ أَوْ يَلْبِسَكُمْ شِيَعًا وَيُذِيقَ بَعْضَكُم بَأْسَ بَعْضٍ ۗ انظُرْ كَيْفَ نُصَرِّفُ الْآيَاتِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَفْقَهُونَ وَكَذَّبَ بِهِ قَوْمُكَ وَهُوَ الْحَقُّ ۚ قُل لَّسْتُ عَلَيْكُم بِوَكِيلٍ لِّكُلِّ نَبَإٍ مُّسْتَقَرٌّ ۚ وَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;Say: &#8216;He has power to send torment on you from above you or from under your feet, or to cover you with confusion in party strife, and make you to taste the violence of one another.&#8217; See how variously We explain the Ayaat, so that they may understand.</i></span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;"><i><br />
But your people </i></span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"><i>(O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم)</i></span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"><i> have denied it </i></span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"><i>(the Qur&#8217;aan)</i></span><span style="color:#008000;"><i><span style="color:#008000;"><b> though it is the Truth. Say: &#8216;I am not responsible for your affairs.&#8217; For every news there is a fact</b> (i.e. for everything there is an appointed term and you will come to know)<b>.&#8221;  </b></span></i></span>(Soorah al-An&#8217;aam (6):65-67)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Katheer quotes a number of ahaadeeth &#8211; (ahaadeeth, sing. hadeeth: Sayings narrated from the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم, regarding his words, actions or attributes) &#8211; in his Tafseer of the first aayah. From these is that reported by al-Bukhaaree from Jaabir ibn &#8216;Adbullaah (radhiyAllaahu &#8216;anhumaa) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When the (following) aayah was revelaed:<br />
<i><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Say: &#8216;He has power to send torment on you from above you&#8230;&#8221;</strong></span></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم said:<br />
<i><br />
<strong>&#8216;I seek refuge with Your Face.&#8217;</strong></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;&#8230;or from under your feet&#8230;&#8221;</i></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><i>&#8216;I seek refuge with Your Face.&#8217;</i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8216;or to cover you with confusion in party strife, and make you to taste the violence of one another.&#8221;</i></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><i>&#8216;This is lighter&#8217; or &#8216;&#8230;easier.'&#8221;</i></strong><br />
<b><br />
</b>(Reported by al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh (Eng. trans. vol 6, p.120-121 no. 152)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported by Muslim from Sa&#8217;d bin Abee Waqqaas (<em>radhiyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</em>) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;We went along with Allaah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم until we came to the mosque of Banoo Mu&#8217;aawiyah, so Allaah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم entered and prayed two rak&#8217;ahs so we prayed along with him. So he called upon his Lord for a long time, then he said:<br />
<i><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>&#8216;I asked my Lord for three things: I asked Him that He should not destroy my nation with a deluge so He granted me that: I asked him that He should not destroy my nation with famine &#8211; as happened to the people of Fir&#8217;awn so He granted me that: and I asked Him that they should not fight amongst themselves &#8211; but He refused me that.&#8221;</strong></span></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Khabbaab ibn al-Aratt, (<em>radhiyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</em>), who said:<br />
<i><br />
&#8220;I came to Allaah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم on a night in which he spent the whole of it in prayer until it was fajr, so Allaah&#8217;s Messenger concluded his prayer with tasleem. I said: &#8216;O Messneger of Allaah: You have prayed a prayer this night the like of which I have not seen you pray.&#8217;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم said:<br />
<i><br />
<strong><span style="color:#993300;">&#8216;Indeed it was a prayer of hope and fear. In it I asked my Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, for three things. He granted me two and refused me one. I asked my Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, that He should not destroy us with that which He destroyed the nations before us &#8211; and He granted it to me; I asked my Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, that He should not overwhelm us with an enemy from other than us &#8211; so He granted it to me; and I asked my Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, that He should not cause us to divide into separate groups each attacking the others, but He refused me that.'&#8221;</span></strong></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Imaam Ahmad, an-Nasaa&#8217;ee and at-Tirmidhee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>You believe in these <em>Aayaat</em> and you believe in the narrations which are authentic from Allaah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم so why will you not reflect upon them? Why will you not reflect upon them?</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why will you not attribute these misfortunes which occur to deficiency in your own practice of the Deen so that you turn back to your Lord and save yourselves from the causes of overwhelming destruction?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So fear Allaah O servant of Allaah and look to your affairs and repent before your Lord and correct your way towards Him. Know O nation that these punishments which have come upon you and these trials that have been inflicted upon you are your own doing and due to your sins. So for each chastisement repent and turn to Allaah and seek the refuge of Allaah, the Most High, from the trials; the material trials relating to the person: killing, injury and being forced from ones home; trails relating to wealth: decrease and loss: and trails relating to the Deen (the way of life prescribed by Allaah) &#8211; the doubts and desires which assail the hearts and keep the Ummah away from the Deen of Allaah, and keep it away from the way of our Pious Predecessors (<em>Salaf</em>) and which lead it to destruction. The trials of the heart are the worst and the most severe of all the trials in this world since worldly misfortunes when they occur can only cause loss in this world, which will pass away anyway, whether sooner or later but trials relating to the Deen cause loss of this world and the Hereafter:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>قُلْ إِنَّ الْخَاسِرِينَ الَّذِينَ خَسِرُوا أَنفُسَهُمْ وَأَهْلِيهِمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ۗ أَلَا ذَٰلِكَ هُوَ الْخُسْرَانُ الْمُبِينُ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Say </strong>(O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم)<strong> : The losers are those who will lose themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection. Verily, that will be a manifest loss!&#8221;</strong></span> </i>(Soorah az-Zumar (39):15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>O Allaah, we ask you whilst awaiting fulfillment of one of the duties You have made obligatory upon us &#8211; that You make us of those who take heed of Your Signs and receive admonition when Your punishment descends.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah, grant that the Islamic Ummah and its leaders truly turn back to You in open and in secret, in their sayings and their actions so that the Ummah is rectified, since rectitude of the rulers is a cause of the rectitude of the Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah, we ask you that You rectify those in charge of the affairs of the Muslims and that You grant that they are able to take heed from events and that You direct them to that which You love and is pleasing to You &#8211; O Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah, we ask You that you keep away from them every evil adviser &#8211; indeed You have full power over everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah, guide them through good advisers to that which is good &#8211; those who will advise them and encourage them in good &#8211; O Lord of all the worlds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah, whoever amongst the advisers of those in authority over the Muslims is not a sincere adviser to them, and is not sincere to the people them remove them and replace them with those who are better than them &#8211; O Lord of all the worlds. O Possessor of Majesty and Nobility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah, Lord of all the worlds, and may He extol and send peace upon our Prophet Muhammad, upon his family, true followers and all his Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aameen.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Second Khutbah</b></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah, many pure and blessed praises as our Lord loves and is pleased with, and I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone, having no partner. All praise is for Him at the beginning and the end. I testify that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger, the one whom He chose and took as His <em>khaleel</em>, may Allaah extol him and send peace upon him, his family, followers, Companions and those who follow in his way.<br />
<b><br />
</b>To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>O servant of Allaah! Fear Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and beware of neglecting the prescribed laws of Allaah. Beware of neglecting Allaah&#8217;s signs. Beware of failing to reflect upon the Book of Allaah. Beware of failing to know the Sunnah of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم &#8211; since in the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم lies your success (if you cling to them if you attest to the truth of what they inform of and follow their commands) in this world and the hereafter.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Servants of Allaah&#8230;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are some people who doubt and seek to cause doubts that sins are a cause of misfortunes, and that is because of the weakness of their eemaan and their negligence in reflecting upon the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and I will recite for the benefit of such people the saying of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَوْ أَنَّ أَهْلَ الْقُرَىٰ آمَنُوا وَاتَّقَوْا لَفَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِم بَرَكَاتٍ مِّنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَلَٰكِن كَذَّبُوا فَأَخَذْنَاهُم بِمَا كَانُوا يَكْسِبُونَ أَفَأَمِنَ أَهْلُ الْقُرَىٰ أَن يَأْتِيَهُم بَأْسُنَا بَيَاتًا وَهُمْ نَائِمُونَ أَوَأَمِنَ أَهْلُ الْقُرَىٰ أَن يَأْتِيَهُم بَأْسُنَا ضُحًى وَهُمْ يَلْعَبُونَ أَفَأَمِنُوا مَكْرَ اللَّهِ ۚ فَلَا يَأْمَنُ مَكْرَ اللَّهِ إِلَّا الْقَوْمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;And if the people of the towns had believed and had taqwa </strong>(piety)<strong>, certainly, We should have opened for them blessings from the heavens and the earth, but they belied </strong>(the Messengers)<strong>. So we took them </strong>(with punishment)<strong> for what they used to earn </strong>(polytheism, and crimes etc.)<strong>. Did the people of the towns them feel secure against the coming of Our punishment by night while they are asleep? Or, did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of Our punishment in the forenoon while they play? Did they then feel secure against the plot of Allaah. None feels secure from the plot of Allaah except the people who are lost.&#8221;</strong></span> </i>(Soorah al-A&#8217;raaf (7):96-99)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the Pious Predecessors (Salaf) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>&#8220;If you see Allaah grant blessings to a certain person, and then you see that person continuing in disobedience to Him, then know that this is from Allaah&#8217;s plan against him</strong> and that he is referred to by Allaah, the most Highs, saying:</i></p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَالَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا سَنَسْتَدْرِجُهُم مِّنْ حَيْثُ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ وَأُمْلِي لَهُمْ ۚ إِنَّ كَيْدِي مَتِينٌ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em><strong>&#8220;We shall gradually seize them with punishment in ways they perceive not. And I respite them; certainly My plot is strong.&#8221; </strong></em></span>(Soorah al-A&#8217;raaf (7):182-183)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Muslims, O worshippers of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>By Allaah, sins affect the security of a land; they affect its ease; its prosperity; its economy; and they affect the hearts of its people. Sins cause alienation between the people. Sins cause one Muslim to regard his Muslim brother as if he were upon a separate religion other than Islaam.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if we sought to rectify ourselves, our families, our neighbours and those in our areas, and everyone we are able to rectify, if we mutually encouraged good and forbade evil, if we assisted those who do this with wisdom and wise admonition &#8211; then it would produce unity and harmony. Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, says:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">وَلْتَكُن مِّنكُمْ أُمَّةٌ يَدْعُونَ إِلَى الْخَيْرِ وَيَأْمُرُونَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمُنكَرِ ۚ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ وَلَا تَكُونُوا كَالَّذِينَ تَفَرَّقُوا وَاخْتَلَفُوا مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَهُمُ الْبَيِّنَاتُ ۚ وَأُولَٰئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Let there arise out of you a group of people inviting all that is good (Islaam), enjoining the ma&#8217;roof and forbiddin the munkar. And it is those who are successful. And be not as those who divided and differed among themselves after the clear proofs had come to them. It is they for whom there is an awful torment.&#8221;</strong></span> </i>(Soorah Aali-&#8216;Imraan (3):104-105)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[TN] <strong>Ma&#8217;roof</strong>: Tawheed (making all worship for Allaah alone) and all that Islaam orders one to do. </span><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Munkar</strong>:  Shirk (associating others with Allaah in worship), Kufr (disbelief) and all that Islaam has forbidden).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I call myself and you, O my brothers, to come together upon the Deen of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic; support one another in establishing the Sharee&#8217;ah of Allaah; advise each other sincerely with wisdom and wise admonition; debate with those whom we have to debate with in the best way and by satisfying them with textual proofs and intellectual proofs and do not abandon the people of false beliefs upon their falsehood since they have a right upon us that we should explain the truth to them and encourage them to follow it and that we explain what is false to them and warn against it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for remaining a disunited nation having no regard for one another and not caring about the affairs of each then whoever does not care about the Muslims is not from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Muslims, I say and repeat that it is binding upon us, being Muslims and Believers that we see the occurrences and misfortunes from the Islamic perspective as shown by the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم. Since if we look at them from a materialistic perspective then the unbelievers are stronger and greater than us in the materialistic sense and they hold sway over us and enslave us through that. However, if we look from an Islamic perspective by the way of the Book and the Sunnah then we will abandon all that is a cause of these misfortunes, and if we return to Allaah and aid the Deen of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, then Allaah says in His Book, and He is the most truthful in speech and most capable, He, the Mighty and Majestic:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَيَنصُرَنَّ اللَّهُ مَن يَنصُرُهُ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَقَوِيٌّ عَزِيزٌ </span><strong><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِينَ إِن مَّكَّنَّاهُمْ فِي الْأَرْضِ أَقَامُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَآتَوُا الزَّكَاةَ وَأَمَرُوا بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَنَهَوْا عَنِ الْمُنكَرِ ۗ وَلِلَّهِ عَاقِبَةُ الْأُمُورِ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, Allaah will help those who help His (cause). Truly, Allaah is All-Strong, All-Mighty. Those (Muslim rulers) who, if We give them power in the land, (they) order the establishment of prayer and the payment of Zakaat (the obligatory charity), and they enjoin the ma&#8217;roof and forbid the munkar. And with Allaah rests the end of (all) matters (of the creatures).&#8221;</span></strong> </i>(Soorah al-Hajj (22):40-41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He did not say &#8220;those whom if We give them power in the earth establish arenas of sin, idle, frivolity and shamelessness&#8221; rather he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;<strong>Those (Muslim rulers) who, if We give them power in the land, (they) order the establishment of prayer and the payment of Zakaat (the obligatory charity), and they enjoin the ma&#8217;roof and forbid the munkar. And with Allaah rests the end of (all) matters (of the creatures).</strong>&#8220;&#8221;</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consider carefully, O Muslim brother, how Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَيَنصُرَنَّ اللَّهُ مَن يَنصُرُهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Verily, Allaah will help those who help His (cause). Truly, Allaah is All-Strong, All-Mighty</strong></span>.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He stressed this promise of help with terms of emphasis: an implicit oath, the letter laam of emphasis, and the noon of emphasis. He further emphasized it by His saying:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَقَوِيٌّ عَزِيزٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong><i>&#8220;Truly, Allaah is All-Strong, All-Mighty.&#8221;</i></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since by His Power and His Might He helps those whom He wills, and consider how He ended the two Aayahs with His saying:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">وَلِلَّهِ عَاقِبَةُ الْأُمُورِ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;And with Allaah rests the end of (all) matters (of the creatures).&#8221;</strong></span></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person may say due to his faulty thinking: &#8220;<strong>how can we be aided and granted victory against the unbelieving nations which are stronger and more powerful than us</strong>.&#8221; So Allaah, the Most High, explains that the affairs are under His control only and that He has power over everything. We all know what affect earthquakes have &#8211; occurring when Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, has ordered:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">كُن فَيَكُونُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i><b>&#8220;Be! and it is.&#8221; </b></i></span>(Soorah an-Nahl (16):40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; and such huge and embracing destruction occurs in a single second as cannot be produced by the strongest of these nations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>By Allaah, if we truly aided Allaah&#8217;s Deen as we aught to then we would be granted victory over every enemy upon the earth, but unfortunately many of us are appendages of the enemies of Allaah and the enemies of His Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم &#8211; observing their actions against Allaah and His Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم then following them in that. Perhaps even going to their lands and tossing our flesh and blood &#8211; sons and daughters &#8211; into those lands where nothing heard but church bells&#8230; where in no <em>adhaan</em> (call to prayer) is heard&#8230; no mention of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, is heard&#8230; and nothing is seen except sin and idle frivolity&#8230;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>So we ask Allaah, the Most High, that He turns the misguided of this Ummah back to the guidance, and that He makes us all to support one another and aid one another in carrying out good and righteousness until we return to this Ummah its lost glory and honour. Indeed He is one fully able and having this power to do that.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>O Allaah accept from us (our righteous deeds). Indeed You are the one who hears and knows everything.</strong><b><br />
O Allaah accept from us (our righteous deeds). Indeed You are the one who hears and knows everything.<br />
</b><b>O Allaah accept from us (our righteous deeds). Indeed You are the one who hears and knows everything.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>O Allaah, extol Muhammad and his true followers and family as You extolled Ibraaheem and the family of Ibraaheem. Indeed You are worthy of all praise, the most noble.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>O Allaah, send blessings upon Muhammad and upon his true followers and family as You are Worthy of all Praise, the Most Noble.</strong><b><br />
</b></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Weight of &#8216;Laa ilaaha illAllaah&#8217;</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdullaah ibn `Amr said, “Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu ` alayhi wa sallam said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘A man from my nation will be called out in front of the whole of the creation on the Day of Resurrection.  So ninety-nine scrolls will be laid out for him.  Each of the scrolls will be as far as the eye can see.  Then it will be said, “Do you deny anything from this?” So he will say, “No, O my Lord.” So it will be said, “Do you have any excuse or any good deed?” So the man will fear and he will say, “No.”  So it will be said: “Yes indeed, you have good deeds with Us.  You will  not be wronged with regard to them.” So a parchment will be brought out for him containing, ‘I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger. So he will say, “O my Lord, what is this parchment in comparison to those scrolls?” So it will be said, “You will not be wronged.” So the scrolls will be placed on one scale and that parchment will be placed on one scale.  So the scrolls will be lighter and the parchment will outweigh.’”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Ibnul-Mubaarak in his book az-Zuhd and in his Musnad and by Imaam Ahmad and by at-Tirmithee and Ibn Maajah and others besides.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albaanee</strong> declared this hadeeth saheeh, authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee</strong> hafizahullaah mentioned some points of benefit with regard to this hadeeth.  He said, “The hadeeth contains a number of points of benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The <strong>first</strong> benefit is that the people of sins will be beneath al-mashee·ah (Allaah’s Will and Wish).  If Allaah wishes He will forgive them by His favour.  And if He wishes He will punish them by His justice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The <strong>second</strong> point of benefit is that whoever is such that his eemaan (true belief) and his towheed is strong, and his attachment to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, this fact may be a means for wiping away all of his evil deeds.  And there is no clearer proof for this than the fact that this small parchment will outweigh and overcome all of the rest of the scrolls.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The <strong>third</strong> point of benefit is that the person who is guilty of major sin, he does not become a disbeliever, as the Khawaarij and the Mu`tazilah claimed.  Rather he is beneath mashee·atullaah (the Wish and Will of Allaah).   So even if he is punished, then still he will not remain forever in the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The <strong>fourth</strong> point of benefit is the tremendous virtue of Laa ilaaha illAllaah, none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah over the rest of deeds. So when a Muslim says it, knowing its meaning and acting in accordance with it, then that is the case, tremendous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The <strong>fifth</strong> point of benefit is establishment of al-meezaan (Balance of deeds) with which the deeds will be weighed on the Day of Resurrection, and that it is a balance which is true and real.  It will be erected on the Open Plain of the Resurrection before the passing over the Siraat (Bridge).  This is the most correct of the sayings which the People of Knowledge mention.”</p>
