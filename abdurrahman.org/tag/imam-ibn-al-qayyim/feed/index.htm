<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said that <em>Al-Hawaa</em> is a hidden trap that one must not feel secure from. Ash-Sha&#8217;bee <sup>[34]</sup> said: <strong>&#8220;It is called <em>Hawaa</em> because it throws down its&#8217; adherent.&#8221;</strong> In its general and unrestricted meaning, it demands ready pleasure without thinking about the outcome. It incites the immediate obtainment of lusts even though it is, sooner or later, the cause of greater sufferings. This life has an outcome before that of the Hereafter, and <em>Al-Hawaa</em> blinds its follower from giving notice to this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man&#8217;s <em>Muroo&#8217;ah</em>, <sup>[35]</sup> religion, and rationalism all forbid the pleasure whose outcome will be painful and prohibit lust whose legacy is sorrow and regret, each telling the self when it desires [pleasure and lust], &#8220;Don&#8217;t do it!&#8221; The self would obey the winner.<sup>[36]</sup> Don&#8217;t you see because of the weakness of the rationalistic restraint in a child, he prefers what he desires even though it may lead to his own destruction. On the other hand, the one who does not abide by the <em>Deen</em> prefers and likes what he desires even if it would lead to his destruction in the Hereafter because of the weakness in compliance to the Deen&#8217;s prohibitive code. The one who does not respect his <em>Muroo&#8217;ah</em> prefers what he likes even if he injures [or shatters] or even loses his <em>Muroo&#8217;ah</em> because of the weakness in adhering to its prohibitive code. What place does this hold in comparison with the saying of Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee <sup>[37]</sup>: &#8220;<strong>If I knew that cold water would injure my <em>Muroo&#8217;ah</em>, I would not drink it</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since man has been distinguished from other forms of creation by being subjected to the trials of Al-Hawaa, and because at all times he encounters all kinds of events and occurrences, two references of judgment have been established in order to deal with him: The <em>Deen</em> and reasoning. He is always commanded to refer all of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> related incidents to these judges [Deen and reasoning] and to submit to their ruling. He should train himself to ward off <em>Al-Hawaa</em> whose consequences are safe in order to train himself to abandon Al-Hawaa, which have harmful consequences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let the reasonable person know that lust addicts reach a state in which they do not find pleasure therein. Yet, they are unable to give it up, because it becomes to them like an indispensable form of living.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why you see the alcoholic and <em>Al-Jimaa&#8217;</em> [38] addict does not reach one tenth of the enjoyment achieved by those who sometimes infrequently drink [39] or engage in <em>Al-Jimaa</em>&#8216;. However, it is the habit which requires that of him. Consequently, he drives himself into destructive paths to attain what is demanded by the habit. Had he been relieved from the <em>Rayn</em> [40] of <em>Al-Hawaa</em>, he would have known that he was miserable wherefore he anticipated happiness, depressed wherefore he thought he was glad, and in pain where from he sought pleasure. He is like a bird that was deceived by a grain of wheat, neither he was able to get it, nor he was able to free himself from the trap he got caught in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if it is asked: <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>&#8220;How could a person who fell in <em>Al-Hawaa</em> free himself from it?</strong></span>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The response is: &#8220;By the help and success granted by Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى), he will be able to liberate himself from <em>Al-Hawaa</em> by holding to the following matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. A determined free will: having a vigilant care and sense of honor for himself, jealously protecting it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. A dose of patience making himself endure the bitter taste of the moment (i.e. the time his <em>Hawaa</em> is active).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Strength and self-determination that encourages him to drink that dose [of patience]. His courage is a moment of forbearance, and the best of living attained by an &#8216;<em>Abd</em> is through his perseverance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Being aware of the splendid impression of the outcome and the cure achieved by that dose [of perseverance].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Being aware of the pain that exceeds the pleasure arising from following his <em>Hawaa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. Keeping his good standing before Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) and in the hearts of Allaah&#8217;s &#8216;<em>Ibaad</em>. Certainly this is better and more beneficial to this than taking pleasure in following his <em>Hawaa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. Preferring the joy of &#8216;<em>Iffaah</em> [41] and its honor and sweetness over the pleasure of disobedience and wrong-doing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. Having delight in overcoming his enemy and driving him away disgraced in his rage, grief, and worry, being unable to get hold of him as he wishes. In fact, Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) loves for His &#8216;<em>Abd</em> to abandon and enrage his enemy as He has said in his noble Book:</p>
<p><strong> وَلَا يَطَئُونَ مَوْطِئًا يَغِيظُ الْكُفَّارَ وَلَا يَنَالُونَ مِنْ عَدُوٍّ نَّيْلًا إِلَّا كُتِبَ لَهُم بِهِ عَمَلٌ صَالِحٌ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Nor they take any step to raise the anger of disbelievers nor inflict any injury upon an enemy but is written to their credit as a deed of righteousness.</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;aan,SooratAt-Tawbah. 9:120].</p>
<p><strong> لِيَغِيظَ بِهِمُ الْكُفَّار</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>That He may enrage the disbelievers with them</strong> (i.e. the Sahaabah)<strong>.</strong> </span>[Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat Al-Falh, 48:29].</p>
<p><strong>وَمَن يُهَاجِرْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ يَجِدْ فِي الْأَرْضِ مُرَاغَمًا كَثِيرًا وَسَعَةً</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He who emigrates </strong>[from his home]<strong> in the Cause of Allaah, will find on earth many dwelling places and plenty to live by.</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat An-Nisaa&#8217;. 4:100],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means, &#8220;A place where he abandons and assails the enemies of Allaah.&#8221; The sign of true love is to enrage the enemies of the Beloved and to forsake them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. Contemplating the fact that he has not been created to [be a slave of] Al-Hawaa, but that he has been prepared for a great task that will not be achieved unless he disobeys his Hawaa, as it was said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>&#8220;Indeed they have prepared you for a task such that if you are aware of it (i.e. its importance and great outcome);</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Then you would hold yourself above giving respect to the negligent.&#8221;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. That he should not choose for himself a state such that the unintelligible animal is better than him. Indeed the animal is able by means of his natural instincts to distinguish between beneficial and harmful situations, preferring the beneficial above the harmful. For the same purpose, man has been endowed with the faculty of reason. If he does not differentiate between what hurts or benefits him, or, in the case he realizes this but prefers what is harmful to him, then the status of an unintelligible animal is better than his. The evidence for this lies in the fact that an animal takes a share of enjoyment in the taste of food, drinks, and sexual relations that is not attainable by man, and that it lives a comfortable life free from thought and worry. Hence it is driven to its slaughtering place preoccupied with its lusts [42] due to the lack of knowledge about the consequences. Man will not procure the same damage done to the animal because of the intensity of the preoccupying thought, and the weakness of the used male organ, and so forth. Had the attainment of what is desired been a virtue, the right of man, who is the pure extract of the world, to it would have not been diminished while making it abundant to the animals. In the augmentation of man&#8217;s share of reasoning, knowledge, and cognition is a substitute for that (i.e. animalistic lust).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. Let him lead his heart through the consequences of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> and contemplate:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many virtues were missed because of his disobedience? And how much Ratheelah (vices) did it make him commit?</li>
<li>How many meals became inaccessible because of few meals?</li>
<li>How often a pleasure caused the loss of many?</li>
<li>How often did a desire break a rank, lower a head, [43] render a good reputation bad, inherit blame, leave behind it humiliation and dishonor that water cannot wash away. Yet, the eye of the follower of Hawaa is blind!</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. The intelligent person should imagine the attainment of his desire, his condition after his wish was fulfilled, what did he miss, and what occurred to him?</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>&#8220;The most excellent of people is the one who does not embark upon a means to accomplish something </strong>[44]<br />
<strong> Until he distinguishes (the evil,harms) that may be incurred by its consequences.&#8221;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. The intelligent person should really imagine what would the situation of another person be after he fulfills his desire then think of himself as being in the same standing. Indeed, the judgment respect of a thing is the same as respecting the like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. He should give a thought as to what his self really demands from him regarding the thing he desires. He should then question his <em>Deen</em> and rationale about it, they will inform him that it is nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abdullaah Ibn Mas&#8217;oud [45] said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>If anyone of you admires a woman, let him remember Manatinaha&#8230;</strong>&#8221; [46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15. He should keep himself far from the humiliation of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> because whenever someone obeys his <em>Hawaa</em> he will sense disgrace within himself. He should not be deceived by the force, assault, and pride of the followers of <em>Al-Hawaa</em>, for they have the most lowly internal character of men; they have mustered both arrogance and humiliation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16. He should compare the safety of Deen, honor, and property, and rank to the attainment of the desired pleasure. He will not find any suitability whatsoever between them. Thus he should be aware that he is from the most ignorant of men if he would trade this (Deen, honor, property, rank, etc..) for that (i.e. <em>Hawaa</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17. He should keep himself far from being under the subdual of his enemy, the Shaytaan, who, if he sees the &#8216;<em>Abd</em> in a state of weak determination and motivation and having an inclination towards his <em>Hawaa</em>, he would eagerly hope to overcome and possess him and control him with the bridle of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> leading him wherever he wants. And whenever he senses in him a strong determination, self-honor, and high motivation, he would not hope to get hold of him except secretly and by the way of deceit or circumvention. [47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18. He should realize that <em>Al-Hawaa</em> does not associate with any affair except that it corrupts it. If it gets to the knowledge, it causes him to go to Bid&#8217;ah and <em>Dhalaalah</em> [48] and its follower will become from amongst <em>Ahlul Ahwaa&#8217;</em> [49] If it affects <em>Al-Zuhd</em> [50], it will lead its adherent to Ar-Riyaa&#8217; [51] and to stand in opposition to As-Sunnah.[52] If it gets in a legal judgment, it leads its follower to injustice and hinders him from the truth. If it gets to the division of <em>Al-Qismah</em>,[53] it changes from a just into an unjust division. If it gets to the decisions of <em>Wilaayah</em> [54] and &#8216;<em>Azl</em> [55] it leads its adherent to commit treason against Allaah  (سبحانه و تعالى) and against the Muslims whereby he puts in charge or removes from duty according to his <em>Hawaa</em>. If it enters into worship it will deviate him from obedience and means of closeness [to Allaah]. Thus it associates not with anything but renders it corrupt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19. He should realize that there is no way for the Shaytaan to come in upon the son of Adam except from the gate of his Hawaa. He goes around him trying to find how to invade him so that he renders his heart and deeds corrupt. The only means of entrance he finds is that of Al-Hawaa, and so he creeps along with it like poison creeping in the body.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20. Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) has made <em>Al-Hawaa</em> an opposite to what He has revealed to His Messenger. He has made its following directly opposite to the following of His Messengers, and He classified mankind into two groups: The followers of Revelation and the followers of Al-Hawaa, And this is found in many places in the Qur&#8217;aan, as in His saying:</p>
<p><strong>فَإِن لَّمْ يَسْتَجِيبُوا لَكَ فَاعْلَمْ أَنَّمَا يَتَّبِعُونَ أَهْوَاءَهُمْ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if they answer you not </strong>(i.e. do not follow the doctrine of Tawheed, nor follow you)<strong>, then know that they only follow Ahwaa&#8217;ahum</strong> (i.e. their evil inclinations: lust, desire, etc.)</span> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat AI-Qasas, 28:50].</p>
<p><strong>وَلَن تَرْضَىٰ عَنكَ الْيَهُودُ وَلَا النَّصَارَىٰ حَتَّىٰ تَتَّبِعَ مِلَّتَهُمْ ۗ قُلْ إِنَّ هُدَى اللَّهِ هُوَ الْهُدَىٰ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if you</strong> [O Muhammad]<strong> were to follow their </strong>[Jews and Christians] <strong>desires after what you have received of Knowledge</strong> (i.e. Qur&#8217;aan),<strong> then you would find neither a Waliy </strong>[protector or guardian]<strong> nor any helper against Allaah.</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat Ai-Baqarah. 2-120].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are other Aayaat of similar meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21. Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) likened the followers of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> to the most contemptible animals in form and in concept. Sometimes He compared them to a dog, as in His saying:</p>
<p><strong>وَلَٰكِنَّهُ أَخْلَدَ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ وَاتَّبَعَ هَوَاهُ ۚ فَمَثَلُهُ كَمَثَلِ الْكَلْبِ إِن تَحْمِلْ عَلَيْهِ يَلْهَثْ أَوْ تَتْرُكْهُ يَلْهَث</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>But he clung to the earth and followed his own vain desires. So his description is the description of a dog: If you drive him away, he lolls his tongue out, or if you leave him alone, he [still] lolls his tongue out.</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat Al-&#8216;Araaf, 7:176].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sometimes He compared them to wild donkeys:</p>
<p><strong>كَأَنَّهُمْ حُمُرٌ مُّسْتَنفِرَةٌ</strong><br />
<strong>فَرَّتْ مِن قَسْوَرَةٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>As if they were frightened [wild] donkeys. Fleeing from a hunter, or a lion, Or a beast Of prey.</strong> </span>[Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat At-Muddaththir, 74:50-51].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sometimes He changed their forms into that of monkeys and pigs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">22. The one who follows <em>Al-Hawaa</em> neither deserves to be obeyed, nor to be an Imaam or to be followed, because Allaah removed him away from Imaamah (leading as an Imaam) and forbade obedience to him. As to his removal, it is because Allaah said to His Khaleel [56] Ibraaheem:</p>
<p><strong>إِنِّي جَاعِلُكَ لِلنَّاسِ إِمَامًا ۖ قَالَ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِي ۖ قَالَ لَا يَنَالُ عَهْدِي الظَّالِمِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Verily, I am going to make you a leader </strong>[Prophet]<strong> of mankind.&#8221; </strong>[Ibraaheem] <strong>said: &#8220;And of my offspring</strong> [to make leaders]<strong>.&#8221; </strong>[Allaah] <strong>said: &#8220;My Covenant includes not Ath-Thaalimeen </strong>(polythe&#8217;ists and wrong-doers)<strong>.&#8221;</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;aan Soorat Al-Baqarah, 2:124).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means that &#8220;My Covenant regarding Imaamah (Prophethood, leadership, etc.) does not include a Thaalim (polytheist and wrongdoer}.&#8221; Anyone who follows his Hawaa is a Thaalim as Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) said:</p>
<p><strong>بَلِ اتَّبَعَ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا أَهْوَاءَهُم بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Nay, but those who do wrong follow their own Ahwaa&#8217;ahum Without knowledge.</span></strong> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat Ar-Room, 30:29].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prohibition to obey the follower of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> because of Allaah&#8217;s (سبحانه و تعالى) saying:</p>
<p><strong>وَلَا تُطِعْ مَنْ أَغْفَلْنَا قَلْبَهُ عَن ذِكْرِنَا وَاتَّبَعَ هَوَاهُ وَكَانَ أَمْرُهُ فُرُطًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And obey not him whose heart We have made heedless of Our Remembrance, one who followed his Hawaa and whose affair </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">[deeds]</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> has been lost.</span> </strong>[Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat Al-Kahf, 18:28],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">23. Allaah has made the one who follows <em>Al-Hawaa</em> at the same rank as that of the image-worshipper. He said in two places of His Book:</p>
<p><strong>أَرَأَيْتَ مَنِ اتَّخَذَ إِلَٰهَهُ هَوَاهُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Have you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">[O Muhammad]</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> seen him who has taken as his Ilaah </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">[god]</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> his own Hawaa?</span> </strong>[57] {Qur&#8217;aan,Soorat Al-Furqaan, 25:43].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan [58] commented: &#8220;He is the hypocrite; there is nothing that he desires except that he follows it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said: &#8220;The hypocrite is a slave of his Hawaa: there is nothing that he desires except that he commits it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">24. Verily, <em>Al-Hawaa</em> is the <em>Hithaar</em> [59] of Hell-Fire which surrounds it, he who walks across it will fall in Hell, just as the Prophet  (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said in the hadeeth reported in As-Saheehain:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Al-Jannah is surrounded by all kinds of disliked and undesirable things, while the Fire (Hell) is surrounded by all kinds of desires and passions.&#8221;</strong> [60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the &#8220;Sunan&#8221; of At-Tirmithee in the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah which he attributed to the Prophet  (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) [he said]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) created Al-Jannah and An-Naar [the (Hell) Fire], He send Jibreel to Al-Jannah and said: <strong>Go and look at it and at what I have prepared therein for its people.</strong> He went and looked at it and at what Allaah has prepared therein for its people, then came to Him and said: By Your Might, no one who hears of it will fail to enter it. He gave an order respecting it, and accordingly it was surrounded with undesirable things, and said [to Jibreel]: <strong>Go and look at it and at [the things] which I have prepared therein for its people</strong>. He went and looked at it, and found that it was surrounded with disliked and undesirable things, then came to Him and said: By Your Might, I am afraid that no one will enter it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, [Allaah] then said: <strong>Go to An-Naar and look at it and at [the things] which I have prepared therein for its people</strong>. [He went] and found that it was heaped up, one part upon another, then he came to Him and said: By Your Might, no one who hears of it will enter it. He gave a command respecting it, and it was surrounded with desirable things and passions and then said: <strong>Go back to it</strong>. He went and said: By Your Might, I am afraid that no one will remain who does not enter it.&#8221; [61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">25. It is feared that he who follows <em>Al-Hawaa</em> may become altogether detached from <em>Eemaan</em> (Faith) while being unaware. In fact, it has been confirmed that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>None of you is a true believer until his Hawaa is in accordance with what I have brought forth</strong>. &#8221; [62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>The most dreadful thing I fear in regard to you is the seductive lusts in your bellies and in your private parts, and the misleading ways of Al-Hawaa</strong>&#8221; [63]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">26. The following of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> is from the destructive sins. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Three [things} lead to safety and three cause destruction. Those that lead to safety are: fearing Allaah in secrecy and in the open, uttering the truth at times of satisfaction and anger, and moderation at times of poverty and wealth. As to the [three] that cause destruction, they are: the Hawaa being followed, niggardliness being obeyed, and conceitedness.&#8221; [64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">27. The opposing of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> inherits strength in the heart, tongue and body of [Allaah&#8217;s] &#8216;Abd. Some of As-Salaf (righteous predecessors) said: &#8220;The one who overcomes his Hawaa is like him who conquers a city by himself.&#8221; And in the authentic hadeeth attributed to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The strong is not the one who overcomes the people by his strength, but the strong is the one who controls himself-while in anger.&#8221;</strong> [65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever he trains himself on opposing his Hawaa, he would gain additional strength to his own.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">28. The most enriched in Al-Muroo&#8217;ah of the people is him who has the strongest opposition to his Hawaa. Mu&#8217;aawiyah [66] said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<em>Al-Muroo&#8217;ah</em> is the abandonment of desires and passions, and the disobedience of <em>Al-Hawaa</em>. The following of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> weakens the <em>Al-Muroo&#8217;ah</em>, and its opposition strengthen it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29. There isn&#8217;t a day that passes except that <em>Al-Hawaa</em> and the mind fight within its follower. Whoever of them overpowers its master, it will expel the other and take full control; and the decision will be its. Abu Ad-Dardaa&#8217; [67] said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When a man wakes up, both his Hawaa and deeds meet; if his deeds are in accordance with his Hawaa, then his day is an evil one; and if his Hawaa is pursuant to his deeds, then his day is a good one.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">30. Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) has made the wrong and the following of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> .associates of each other, and has made the right and the opposition of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> as associates. As some of As-Salaf said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If two affairs were dubious to you and you don&#8217;t know which one is right, then oppose the one close to your Hawaa for it is more likely that error is committed when <em>Al-Hawaa</em> is being pursued.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">31. <em>Al-Hawaa</em> is a disease and its remedy is in opposing it. Some learned men said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If you wish, I will inform you of your illness, and if you wish I will tell you of your remedy: Your disease is your Hawaa, and your treatment is to abandon and oppose it.&#8221; Bishr Al-Haafee, [68]  &#8220;All kinds of affliction are manifested in your Hawaa, and the complete healing is in your opposition of it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">32. The Jihaad against Al-Hawaa, if it is not more important than the Jihaad against the Kuffaar, certainly it is not less in importance. A man told Al-Hasan Al Basree &#8220;O Abaa Sa&#8217;eed! What kind of Jihaad is the best? He said: &#8220;It is the Jihaad of your Hawaa&#8221; I heard my Shaykh [69] saying: &#8220;The Jihaad against one&#8217;s self and against Al-Hawaa constitutes the basis for the Jihaad against the Kuffaar and the Munaafiqeen (hypocrites), because one is unable to make Jihaad against them until he makes Jihaad against himself and his Hawaa first, so that he can go out to [confront] them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">33. <em>Al-Hawaa</em> is Takhleel (disorder and confusion of the intellect) and opposing it is Himiyyah [70] It is feared for the one who became excessive in Takhleet and retired himself from Al-Himiyyah, that his disease [mental sickness] may cause him to fall in a state of Sara&#8217;.[71] &#8216;Abdul Malik Ibn Quraib [72] said: &#8220;I passed by a bedouin who was suffering from an intensive inflammation in his eyes and his tears were shedding on his cheeks. I said: &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you wipe off your eyes?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8220;The doctor prevented me from doing this, and there is no good in him who if urged to refrain [from doing something wrong] does not abstain, and if he is being commanded [to do something good] does not comply.&#8221; I said then: &#8220;Would you like something?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Yes! But I am in a state of Hitniyyah; the lusts of the people of [Hell] Fire overcame their Himiyyah, and thus they were destroyed.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">34. The pursuing of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> renders the doors of success closed for the &#8216;Abd, and opens for him the doors of failure. So you see him often repeating the [following statement]: &#8220;Had Allaah bestowed His success, then it [the affair] would have been as such and such,&#8221; while in fact he barred himself from the ways of success by pursuing his Hawaa. Al-Fudayyl Bin &#8216;lyaad [73] said; &#8220;Whoever has been overtaken by his Hawaa and by the following of lusts, the sources of success will be severed from him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the scholars said: &#8220;Al-Kufr [74] originates from four things: anger, lust, hope, and fear.&#8221; He then added, &#8220;I have seen two of them manifested: a man who got angry and then killed his mother, and another who fell in love and became a Christian&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">35. The one who stands by his Hawaa, his intelligence and mental perception will become corrupt because he acted unfaithfully towards Allaah in his mind and, consequently, Allaah perverted it for him. This is the way He deals with anyone who betrays Him in any affair: He renders it in a bad state for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">36. The one who broadens for his self the scope of pursuing Al-Hawaa, will put it under restriction in his grave and on the Day of his Return, The one who restrains it by opposing Al-Hawaa, brings ease upon it in his grave and on the Day of his Return. Allaah pointed to this in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And their recompense shall be Al-Jannah and silken garments, because they were patient.</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;aan: Soorat Al-lnsaan, 76:12],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since patience, which is holding oneself from pursuing Al-Hawaa, includes harshness and restrictions, accordingly Allaah will recompense them with the smoothness of silk and the wideness of Al-Jannah, Abu Sulaimaan Ad Daaraanee [75] commented on the above Aayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah shall recompense them for taking patience against lusts.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">37. The following of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> throws down the &#8216;Abd preventing him to stand up and walk with those saved on the Day of Resurrection, just like when his heart fell [in a state of Sara&#8217;] in this life which kept him from their company. Muhammad Bin Abee Al-Ward said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There is one of Allaah&#8217;s days when no one who pursues his Hawaa shall be saved of its evil. The slowest in his ability to stand up amongst those thrown down on the Day of the Resurrection is the one whose thrown in a state of Sara&#8217; by his lusts&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">38. The pursuing of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> breaks up and weakens one&#8217;s resolution, and opposing [Al-Hawaa] solidifies and strengthens it. Resolution is the thing upon which one rides upon in his journey to Allaah and the Last Day. If that which is ridden became inactive, the traveler would almost be disabled to proceed in his journey.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahyaa Bin Mu&#8217;aath [77] was asked: &#8220;Who is most sound in resolution of men?&#8221; He answered: &#8220;The one who overcomes his Hawaa&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">39. The parable of the one who follows his own whim is like that who rides on a tough, strong-tempered, Jamooh [78] horse without a bridle, about to be thrown down by his horse during its run or it would lead him to his death. A learned man said: &#8220;The most rapid means to ride onto Al-Jannnah is the Zuhd respecting this life, and the most rapid means to get on to An-Naar is the love of lusts. And him who boards his Hawaa, it will hastily take him to the valley of perdition.&#8221; Another said: &#8220;The most endowed with honor of the scholars is the one who flees with his <em>Deen</em> from this Dunya [79] and who is hard to be led to follow Al-Hawaa.&#8221; &#8216;Ataa&#8217; [80] said: &#8220;The one whose Hawaa overtakes his rationale causing him to become affected with grief and agitation because of lacking the strength to be patient, would be put to shame.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">40. The Tawheed and the following of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> are two contrary matters: because <em>Al-Hawaa</em> is an idol, and each &#8216;Abd has an idol in his heart, the magnitude of which depends upon his Hawaa; Rather, Allaah sent His Messengers to destroy the idols and to call for His worship Alone, having no partners or associates. Nay, Allaah&#8217;s intent is not just to demolish the corporeal images and leave the images imbedded in the heart, but rather to destroy those in the heart first.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan Bin &#8216;AH Al-Muttawwi&#8217;ee [81] said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The idol of each person is his Hawaa, he who breaks it by the way of opposition deserves the title of honourableness.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just contemplate about the saying of AlKhaleel (Ibraaheem to his people [as Allaah said]:</p>
<p><strong>مَا هَٰذِهِ التَّمَاثِيلُ الَّتِي أَنتُمْ لَهَا عَاكِفُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">What Are these images, to which you are devoted?</span></strong> [Qur&#8217;aan,Soorat Al-Anbiyaa&#8217;, 21:52],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and you will certainly find it identical to those images which the heart likes and devotes itself to and worships it besides Allaah. He, Allaah, said:</p>
<p><strong>أَرَأَيْتَ مَنِ اتَّخَذَ إِلَٰهَهُ هَوَاهُ أَفَأَنتَ تَكُونُ عَلَيْهِ وَكِيلًا</strong><br />
<strong>أَمْ تَحْسَبُ أَنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ يَسْمَعُونَ أَوْ يَعْقِلُونَ ۚ إِنْ هُمْ إِلَّا كَالْأَنْعَامِ ۖ بَلْ هُمْ أَضَلُّ سَبِيلًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Have you </strong>[O Muhammad] <strong>seen him who has taken his illaah </strong>(god)<strong> as his own desire? Would you be then a Wakeel </strong>[a protecting guide]<strong> over him? Or do you think that most of them hear or understand? They are only like cattle. Nay, they are even farther astray from the Path </strong>[i.e. even worst than Cattle]</span> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat Al-Furqaan, 25:43-44].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">41. Opposing <em>Al-Hawaa</em> is the means to drive away diseases from the heart and from the body, and its following brings forth diseases to the heart and to the body. Heart diseases are all from following of Al-Hawaa. If you search for the causes behind diseases of the body, you will find that most of it are because of preferring <em>Al-Hawaa</em> over what should be abandoned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">42. The origin for the enmity, evil, and envy that occurs between people is from the following of Al-Hawaa. The one who opposes his Hawaa relieves his heart, body, and limbs, putting himself to ease and thus relieves others. Abu Bakr Al-Warraaq [83] said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When the Hawaa prevails, the heart turns dark and when it does so, the breast becomes straitened and when that happens, the moral character deteriorates and consequently people will hate him and he will hate them. Then think of the evil, enmity, neglect of rights, etc. that arise from this mutual hatred!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">43. Allaah has created in man an intellect and a Hawaa; whichever of the two becomes manifest, the other will hide, as Abu &#8216;Ali Ath- Thaqafee said;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever is overcome by his Hawaa, his intellect will be hidden from him. So, look at the end of him whose intellect is masked from him and became overpowered by something else.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ali Bin Sahl [84] said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The intellect and <em>Al-Hawaa</em> are in conflict. Success is the associate of the intellect and defeat is the associate of Al-Hawaa. The self stands between both; whichever of the two prevails, the self will side with it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">44. Allaah has made the heart the king of the limbs and the place of the origination of knowledge, love, and &#8216;Uboodiyyah of Him. He tested him with two kinds of authority, two armies, two aids, and two sets of preparations. The truth, Zuhd, and guidance is one authority. Its aids are the angels, and its army is truthfulness and sincerity, and its preparation is in avoiding Al-Hawaa. The other authority is falsehood. Its aids are the Shayaateen and its troops and the preparation is the following of Al-Hawaa. The self stands between the two armies. The army of falsehood will have access to the heart only from its direction and frontier breaches, for it pervades the heart and aligns itself with its enemy against it (the heart) and thus the calamity will overtake it. It is the self, therefore, that offers its enemy from its own preparations, and opens for him the gate of the city and thus he enters and takes full control, and the heart takes the defeat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">45. The worst of enemies to man is his Shaytaan and his Hawaa, and the best friend he has is his intellect and his associate angel who gives him advice. If he follows his Hawaa, he gives his hand in surrender to his enemy, submitting himself as a captive to him, making him [the enemy] rejoice at his affliction, and causing displeasure to his friends and supporters. These are precisely the difficult moments of a calamity, wretchedness, the manifested divine decree of an evil ending, and the malicious joy of enemies. [86]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">46. Each &#8216;Abd has a beginning and an end. He whose start is the following of AlHawaa, shall end up in a state of disgrace, humiliation, bereavement, and trials. What is being followed commensurate with the [&#8216;Abd&#8217;s] degree of dependency upon his Hawaa. Rather, at the end, the followed turns to a suffering that agonizes him in his heart as one poet put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>&#8220;Desires that were, at the age of youthfulness, sweet to those who wished</strong><br />
<strong> then, became a suffering at Al-Masheeb (an old age)&#8221;</strong> [87]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you contemplate about the case of everyone who is in a bad and miserable state, you would find that it began with him embracing his Hawaa and giving it preference over his intellect. Anyone who begins by opposing his Hawaa and obeying the call of his Rushd,[88] his end will be that of honor, might, richness, and high rank before Allaah and before the people. Abu &#8216;Ali Ad-Daqqaaq89 said: &#8220;The one who controls his lust in his youthfulness, Allaah will honor him when he is in his age of maturity.&#8221; AlMuhallab Bin Abee Sufrah90 was asked: &#8220;How did you attain this status of yours? He said: &#8220;Through firm obedience and rebellion against Al-Hawaa.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are the situations regarding the stand against <em>Al-Hawaa</em> in the beginning and in the end of one&#8217;s life in this world. With respect to the Hereafter, however, Allaah has made Al-Jannah the end for him who opposed his Hawaa and An-Naar the end for the one who followed his Hawaa [91]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">47. <em>Al-Hawaa</em> is slavery to the heart, an iron chain round the neck, and a fetter to the leg. Its follower is a captive to everyone with a bad character. Thus whoever opposes it, liberates himself from slavery and becomes free, and takes off the chain round his neck and becomes in a state similar to that of a man belonging entirely to one master after belonging to many partners disputing one another.[92]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">48. Opposing <em>Al-Hawaa</em> puts the &#8216;Abd in the rank of the one whose oath Allaah fulfills. The goals that He will accomplish for him will be many-fold that which he was unable to attain as a result of neglecting his Hawaa. He is like the one who relinquished a Ba&#8217;arah and was given a pearl as a compensation for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whatever he is able to gain from the way of following <em>Al-Hawaa</em> is incomparable with what he looses from present and future benefits and from good living. So try to comprehend the stretching forth of the hand of Yoosuf, theSiddeeq95 in expenditure, the unconstriction with his tongue, the establishment of his feet [in power], and the rejoice that touched him after he came out of the jail because he restrained himself from the Haraam [unlawful].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">49. Opposing <em>Al-Hawaa</em> entitles the honor in this world and in the Hereafter and self-esteem, outwardly and inwardly. Following it, however, lowers the rank of the &#8216;Abd in this life and in the Hereafter and humiliates him, outwardly and inwardly. When Allaah gathers mankind on one plane [on the Day of Resurrection], an announcer will call, &#8220;This day the people of generosity will be distinguished from those who amassed wealth. Now let the pious stand.&#8221; [97] They will stand and walk toward the place of honor while the followers of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> bending their heads down before Allaah] in the Mawqif [98] amidst the &#8220;heat of AI-Hawaa&#8221; its sweat and its suffering. The others [the pious] will be in the shade of the &#8216;Arsh. [99]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">50. If you contemplate about the seven whom Allaah will shade in the shade of His &#8216;Arsh wherein there is no shade but His,[100] you will find that they deserved that shade because of their opposition to Al-Hawaa. Indeed the Imaam having authority and power will not be able to establish justice except by opposing his Hawaa. And with respect to the youth who prefers the sincere worship of Allaah over the urge of his youthfulness, had it not been for the opposition of his Hawaa, he would not be able to accomplish this state of worship. As to the person whose heart is attached to the mosques, the thing that drove him to this condition is the opposition of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> which invites him to the places of lusts. Concerning the person who gives charitable gifts secretly so that his left hand does not know what his right hand has given, had it not been for his subduing of his Hawaa, he would have not been able to attain this state.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the person who was invited by a charming woman of noble birth [to have illegal sexual intercourse with her], feared Allaah and opposed his Hawaa. As to the one who remembers Allaah in seclusion and his eyes becomes flooded with tears for fearing Him, the thing that made him reach this state is the opposing of his Hawaa. Consequently, they were saved from being affected by the intense heat of the Al-Mawqif on the Day of Resurrection and the sweating therein. The people [adhering to] <em>Al-Hawaa</em> will experience the utmost degree of intense heat and sweating while they are still waiting to enter the &#8220;Prison of Al-Hawaa&#8221; Allaah is the One to be petitioned to grant us protection from the Ahwaa&#8217; (Sing. Hawaa) of ourselves which are inclined to evil, and that He makes our Hawaa in accordance with what He loves and is acceptable to Him. He has power over all things, and He is most worthy of answering our petition.</p>

He also studied in &#8216;Iraaq under Imaam Muhammad Ibn al-Hassan, the famous student of Imaam Abu Haneefah.

<p style="text-align:justify;">[39] Islaam prohibits all forms of intoxication. The evil associated with alcoholic drinks is much greater than the little enjoyment that may be felt by few drinks. In fact the few drinks demand more of it until the person feels high. Then the demand grows to reach a state higher than with his first one. Addiction slowly creeps to destroy the drinker&#8217;s life and in many cases his family. Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) said:</p>

He was the first to openly recite the Qur&#8217;aan in Makkah. The Mushrikeen harmed him for his recitation. He prayed to the first Qiblah (Al-Quds, Jerusalem) and to the second and last Qiblah (Makkah). He migrated twice, once to Abyssinia (the first migration) and the second to Al-Madeenah. He attended the battle of Badr, Uhud and all the other confrontations with the Mushrikeen. The Khaleefah &#8216;Umar Ibn AI-Khattaab assigned him to teach Islaam to the people of Al-Khoofah in &#8216;Iraaq. Later &#8216;Uthmaan (radiAllaahu anhu) called him to Al-Madeenah where he died in the year 32/654. He was known for his great knowledge in Qur&#8217;aan and its Tafseer. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) attested to &#8216;Abdullaah&#8217;s knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[46] That is when he is inclined by his desire and lust to indulge in an unlawful act with her, let him remember something that may turn off his desire, like manatinaha: all forms of her menses and the odor associated with that. [I asked Shaykh Muhammad Bin Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaymeen about this explanation of Ibn Mas&#8217;oud&#8217;s saying and, alhamdulilaah, he affirmed it.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[47] Especially at times of unawareness. &#8216;Abdullaah Bin Mas&#8217;oud said: &#8220;You are at a time when the truth leads <em>Al-Hawaa</em> and there shall come a time when <em>Al-Hawaa</em> will lead the truth. So, we seek refuge in Allaah from that time to come.&#8221; [See Al-Jaami&#8217; li Ahkaam Al-Qur &#8216;aan by Al-Qurtubee (Beirut, Lebanon: Daarul-Kutub Al-Ilmiyyah, 1413/1993), V. 19, p. 135.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[48] Deviation from the right path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[49] <em>Ahlul-Ahwaa&#8217;</em> (The People of Corrupt Desires): The people who follow concepts of belief and methodologies of understanding and practices deviating from the right path, or from the truth, thus following their [corrupt] desires. [Some of their qualities are presented in the Appendix],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[50] <em>Zuhd</em>: To lead a pious life devoted to Allaah taking the least that is sufficient of the lawful things of life. It does not mean to abandon lawful means of earning, property, children, etc., nor exaggerating in performing acts of worship. [See a discussion on this subject in the Appendix],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[51]<em> Ar-Riyaa&#8217;</em>: Showing off, and not doing an action solely for the sake of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[52] Mystic Sufism adopted ways of Zuhd that stand in direct opposition to the guidance of the Prophet&#8217;s Sunnah. [See the Appendix under <em>Zuhd</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[53] <em>Al-Qismah</em>: Generally it refers to the division of property, shares, booties, profits, etc. In the Qur&#8217;aan it refers to the division of the deceased&#8217;s property in accordance with the laws of inheritance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[54] <em>Wilaayah</em>: Appointing a person in charge of an office or an authority over a thing (town, district, country, province or the like).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[55] &#8216;<em>Azl</em>: Removal of someone from his office or exercise of authority.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[56] <em>Khaleel</em>, i.e. Allaah&#8217;s Khaleel: The one whom Allaah has distinguished by love and honor. Ibraaheem Al-Khaleel is Prophet Ibraaheem whom, like Prophet Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) Allaah has distinguished by love and honor.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[59] <em>Hithaar</em>: Anything forming a barrier, an obstruction, a partition, or a fence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[60] An agreed upon hadeeth. [See Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, V. 8, Hadeeth #494.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[61] Reported by At-Tirmithee who said that it is &#8220;hasan-saheeh&#8221;.- It is also reported by An-Nasaa&#8217;ee and Abu Daawood. Shaykh Al-Albaanee concluded that it is authentic in Saheeh Al-Jaami&#8217; #5210 and in Mishkaatul Masaabeeh #5696. The terminology &#8220;hasan-saheeh &#8221; used by At-Tirmithee refers to one of two situations regarding the hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1-That it is reported through one way of narration and there is a disagreement regarding the status of one narrator in the chain: Some consider him sound while others consider him &#8220;hasan,&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2-It is reported via two chains of narration, one &#8220;Hasan&#8221; and the other &#8220;saheeh&#8221;. (See Al-Haafith Ibn Hajar&#8217;s An-Nukal &#8216;Alaa Nuzhatin-Nalhar fee Tawdeeh Nukhbatul-Fikar (Dammaam, KSA: Daar Ibnul-Jawzee, 1414/1994)], pp. 93-94.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The &#8220;hasan&#8221; (fine) is itself authentic but does not reach the level of authenticity of the &#8220;saheeh&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[62] Shaykh Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee, may Allaah protect him, said: The Isnaad (chain of narration) of this hadeeth is weak because of the status of weakness of Nu&#8217;aim Bin Hammaad (a narrator). See Shaykh Al-Albaanee&#8217;s comments on Al-Tabreezee&#8217;s Mishkaatul Masaabeeh [Beirut, Lebanon: AI-Maktab Al-Islaamee, 1405/1985], V. l,p. 59. Al-Haafith Ibn Rajab observed another cause of weakness of this hadeeth in his commentary on An-Nawawee&#8217;s authentication of the same hadeeth. [See Ibn Rajab&#8217;s Jaami&#8217; Al-&#8216;Uloom wal Hikam (Beirut, Lebanon; Muassasatur-Risaalah, checked by Shu&#8217;ayeb Al-Ama&#8217;out and Ibraaheem Baajis, 1412/1991], V. 2, p. 394.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[63] Reported by Imaam Ahmad, and Al-Haithamee said: &#8220;It was reported by Ahmad, Al-Bazzaar, and At-Tabaraanee in his  Ma&#8217;aajim: As-Sagheer, Al-Awsat. and Al-Kabeer, and its narrators are &#8216;men of Saheeh1 [i.e. generally classified in the category of sound, reliable, or even less. This does not necessarily mean that the rest of conditions required to authenticate the Isnaad (chain of narration), not to mention the hadeeth itself, are usually met.] [See Shaykh Al-Albaanee&#8217;s introduction to Saheeh At-Targheeb war Tarheeb by AlMunthiree, pp. 43-50.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[64] Al-Muhaddith Shaykh Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee said that the hadeeth is hasan. See As~Silsi!ah As-Saheehah, #1802, and Saheeh Al-Jaami&#8217;, #3045.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[65] An agreed upon hadeeth, [See Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, V. 8, Hadeeth #135.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[66] <strong>Mu&#8217;aawiyah</strong> is the Sahaabee Sakhr Bin Harb Bin Umayyah Bin &#8216;Abd Shams Bin &#8216;Abd Manaaf Bin Qusay Bin Kilaab, Abu&#8217;Abdur Rahmaan. The Ameer of Al-Mu&#8217;mineen, and the King of Islaam. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O Allaah! Bestow upon him the knowledge of the Book (i.e. the Qur&#8217;aan) and save him from torment.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Imaam Ahmad in Fadaa &#8216;il As-Sahaabah, V. 2, p. 913.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The checker said its Isnaad is hasan because of other narrations]. He also invoked Allaah saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;O Allaah! Make of him (i.e. Mu&#8217;aawiyah) a guide (to the truth), cause him to be rightly directed, and cause others to be rightly directed by him.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Imaam Ahmad, V. 5 #17438, and by At-Tirmithee. Al-A!baanee said it is saheeh (see Saheeh Sunan At-Tirmithee, #3018).] He was one of the Sahaabah who recorded the Revelation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Contrary to many false reports, Mu&#8217;aawiyah did not seek to take over the Khilaafah from &#8216;Ali Shaykh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah, Imaam Ath-Thahabee, AtTabaree, and many other scholars from the Salaf asserted that Mu&#8217;aawiyah used to acknowledge that &#8216;Ali is better than him and that he [Mu&#8217;aawiyah] does not deserve the Khilaafah. His position, however, was that he wanted &#8216;Ali to punish the assassins of &#8216;Uthmaan^ before he would give his loyalty to him. He thought that he was on the truth regarding this matter. &#8216;Ali on the other hand, conditioned that Mu&#8217;aawiyah must give the pledge of loyalty to him because he was the Khaalefah and that he thought it is wise to wait until he consolidates his power and then seek &#8216;Uthmaan&#8217;s assassins. &#8216;Ali had nothing to do with the killing of &#8216;Uthmaan Based upon many authentic narrations and prophecies from the Prophet Ahlus-Sunnah consider to be on the side of the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fitnah was ignited by a group of dissidents known as As-Saba&#8217;iyyah whose leader, &#8216;Abdullah Bin Saba&#8217;, was a Jew who considered &#8216;Ali to be Allaah incarnate! Most of the Sahaabah kept themselves away from the fitnah and only a few, not exceeding thirty, shared in the fighting between the army of &#8216;Ali and Mu&#8217;aawiyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Islamic rule at the time of Mu&#8217;aawiyah&#8217;s Kingdom was very strong whereby the Muslims ruled a vast area extending from Khurasaan in the East to the West African coast, and from Cyprus in the Mediterranean to the Yemen in the South. [See Tahqeeq Mawaaqif AsSahaabah Fee Al-Fitnah; Establishing the (True) Position of the Sahaabah During the Fitnah (i.e. Between &#8216;Ali and Mu&#8217;aawiyahby Dr. Muhammad Amakhzoon, V. 2, pp. 93-130, published by Daar Tayebah and Maktabat Al-Khawthar, Riyaadh, KSA, 1415/1994.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason why that I have highlighted some of these important facts is that most of what had been written about this fitnah is either a) fully historical and not authenticated, b) compiled by orientalists, or c) promoting baseless accounts by the Raafidhah (the rejectionists of the Shee &#8216;ah). The fully documented and authenticated reports from the Muhadditheen regarding the fitnah gave us the true positions of the Sahaabah regarding this matter. An excellent source is Al- &#8216;Awaasim Minal Qawaasim by Abu Bakr Bin &#8216;Al-Arabi AI-Maalikee (not the infamous mystic Sufi Ibn &#8216;Arabi) with commentary by Muhib-ed-Deen AI-Khateeb, 5th edition, Maktabat AsSunnah, Cairo, 1408.

He is known as the <em>Hakeem</em> (the wise man) of this Ummah. He was from the few amongst the Sahaabah who collected the Noble Qur&#8217;aan. He reported one hundred and ninety seven Ahaadeeth.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Note</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is considered a Sufi in the context of the early practice of sufism in which some of its followers were mostly interested in leading a pious life of Zuhd (an abstemious way of life), patience, clemency, sincerity, truthfulness, etc.. Overall they were close to the teachings of the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah, although some of them exaggerated and (or) introduced innovated forms of worship and concepts. [See Majmoo&#8217; Fataawaa Shaykh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah, 10:366-367, and Ibnul Jawzee in Talbees Iblees, p. 156.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Historically the process started in Basra, &#8216;Iraaq by the time when the majority of <em>Taabi&#8217;ee</em> (the followers of) <em>At-Taabi&#8217;een</em> passed away (Ibid, 10:358). Many of them used to wear woollen (<em>suf</em>) clothing a sign of disassociation from the wordly life. The first to establish a &#8220;house for the sufiyyah&#8221; was a man by the name of &#8216;Abdul Waahid Bin Zayed (Ibid, 10:359). In their works there is a blend of truth and falsehood. The majority of the scholars, including Imaam Shaafi&#8217;ee, Ahmad, Maalik, and others from Ahl-ul-Hadeeth, criticized their ways especially their so-called <em>Samoa</em>&#8216; [singing aimed to stimulating a state of <em>Wajd</em> (ecstasy)] and excessive worship. Whatever opposes the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah and the way of the Salafis to be rejected and whatever is in agreement is accepted because it is not innovated. The acceptance is not an approval of the terminology or the essence of Sufism in any of its stages. It remains to be remembered that it is not true that every pious and <em>Zaahid</em> Muslim is necessarily a Sufi. The <em>Zuhaad</em> (Sing. <em>Zaahid</em>) of the later times were more influenced by scholastic theology (<em>Ilm Al-Kalaam</em>) which began to creep into the Ummah following the translations of many of the philosophical concepts of the Hindus, Greeks, Romans, and Persians (Ibid, 10:367). Consequently, they deviated from the way of the Sahaabah and their followers from At-Taabi&#8217;een (Ibid, 10:358;366-367). It is known that <em>Zuhd</em> practices developed into organized forms of hunger, poverty, self-strive, seclusion, sleeplessness, wandering, handclapping, dancing, going to the markets in strange ways, abandoning the interest in hadeeth knowledge, and other extremes. Sufism further developed into a school of mysticism and corrupt creed and methodology. [See Talbees Iblees, pp. 156-165, published by Maktabat-ul Qur&#8217;aan, Cairo, Egypt.]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Muslim. See Saheeh Muslim, V. 4, Hadeeth #6757.] In another narration by Muslim and Ahmad, the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)  said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;There is none amongst you with whom there is not an companion from amongst the jinn </strong>[devils] <strong>and an attache from amongst the angels.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>But as for him who feared standing before his Rabb </strong>[Allaah]<strong>, and restrained himself from impure evil desires and lusts, verily, Al-Jannah will be his abode.</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat An-Naazi &#8216;aat, 79:40-41].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[92] Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) said:</p>
<p><strong>ضَرَبَ اللَّهُ مَثَلًا رَّجُلًا فِيهِ شُرَكَاءُ مُتَشَاكِسُونَ وَرَجُلًا سَلَمًا لِّرَجُلٍ هَلْ يَسْتَوِيَانِ مَثَلًا ۚ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ۚ بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah puts forth a similitude: A </strong>[slave]<strong> man belonging to many partners </strong>[like those who worship others along with Allaah] <strong>disputing with one another, and a </strong>[slave]<strong> man belonging entirely to one master </strong>[like those who worship Allaah Alone],<strong> Are those two equal in comparison? All the praises and thanks are due to Allaah! But most of them know not.</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat Az-Zumar (39:29)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[93] Ba&#8217;rah(Pl. Ba&#8217;r) A piece of animal dung. This signifies what is low.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[94] Signifying what is precious.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[95] The man of truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[96] In his eloquent and clear speech with the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[97] &#8220;This is from the Ghaybiyaat ( matters of Al-Ghayb) and it is not confirmed by an authentic evidence.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[98] The standing before Allaah on the Day of Resurrection awaiting His Judgment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[99] Know, may Allaah&#8217;s Mercy be upon you, that the shade sometimes is mentioned in relation to Allaah and sometimes in relation to His &#8216;<em>Arsh</em>. Many authentic narrations reported by Imaam Ahmad, Ad-Daarimee, Al-Baghawee, At-Tirmithee, Al-Haakira, At-Tabaraanee and others state that the shade is that of the &#8216;Arsh. As Al-Haafith Ibn Hajar explained, these narrations when related to the context of the agreed upon hadeeth: &#8220;<strong>Allaah will give shade to seven, on the Day when there would be no shade but His&#8230;</strong>&#8221; preponderates that the shade is that of the &#8216;<em>Arsh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Al-&#8216;Uthaymeen commented that the Prophet&#8217;s statement: &#8220;<strong>On the Day when there would be no shade but His&#8230;</strong>&#8221; means that there would be no shade except that which He creates and that the belief that the shade is that of Allaah&#8217;s Essence is false, because this would imply that the sun is above Allaah the Most Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[See <em>Fathul Baaree</em> V. 2, p. 144, and <em>Sifaatullaah Al-Waaridah Fil Kitaabi-wasSunnah</em>, by &#8216;Alawee Bin &#8216;Abdul QaadirAs-Saqqaaf pp. 171-174, and <em>Sharhul &#8216;Aqeedah Al-Waasitiyyah</em> by Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaymeen, V. 2, p. 136.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[100] The seven were mentioned in the hadeeth in which the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah will give shade to seven, on the Day when there will be no shade but His. [These seven persons are]:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(1) a just ruler,</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(2) a youth who has been brought up in the worship of Allaah [i.e. worships Allaah sincerely from his childhood},</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(3) a man whose heart is attached to the mosques [i.e. he offers the five compulsory <em>Salaat</em> (prayers) in the mosques],</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(4) two persons who love each other only for Allaah&#8217;s sake and they meet and part in Allaah&#8217;s Cause only.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(5) a man who refuses the call of a charming women of noble birth for illegal sexual intercourse with her and says: I am afraid of Allaah.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(6) a man who gives charitable gifts so secretly that his left hand does not know what his right hand has given [i. e. nobody knows how much he has given in charity}, and</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(7) a person who remembers Allaah in seclusion and his eyes become flooded with tears, &#8220;</li>
</ul>
<p>[Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim. The text is that of Al-Bukhaaree: Saheeh AI-Bukhaaree, V. 1, Hadeeth #629.]</p>

<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s Side Point: Ibn Al-Qayyim rahimahullaah in his book Jalaa.ul-Afhaam (جلاء الأفهام) made an important point that with regard to the names of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, that just as we have a principle with regard to the Names of Allaah the Most High, that all of Allaah’s Names have along with them an Attribute (contrary to what some of the Mu`tazilah and the Jahmiyyah and their like say); the same point applies to the names of the Prophet Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam – his names are not just merely names; all his names are also characteristics found in him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s Side Point: Some of the names of the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam are as follows:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>Muhammad</strong> (محمد) sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam – the praiseworthy one and also the one who praises abundantly. Amongst the evidences is the aayah,</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Muhammad is but a Messenger and many Messengers have passed away before him</span></em><br />
(Soorah Aal-`Imraan (3), aayah 144)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise the aayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Muhammad is not the father of any of your men</span></em><br />
(Sooratul-Ahzaab (33), aayah 40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, in Soorah Muhammad (47), aayah 2 and Sooratul-Fath (48), aayah 29 the name Muhammad is mentioned for the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and in many, many ahaadeeth.</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;" start="2">
<li><strong>Ahmad</strong> (أحمد) – the most praiseworthy one. An evidence for that is one aayah in the Qur.aan, in the saying of `Eesaa `alayhis-salaam when he foretold of the coming of a Prophet that would come after him,</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">a Messenger bringing glad tidings, who will come after me; his name will be Ahmad</span></em><br />
(Sooratus-Saff (61), aayah 6)</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;" start="3">
<li><strong>Al-Maahee</strong> (الماحي) – the one who eliminates or wipes away; meaning, the one through whom Allaah wipes away unbelief. The evidence for this name is the hadeeth of Jubayr ibn Mut`im radiyAllaahu `anh.</li>
<li><strong>Al-Haashir</strong> (الحاشر) – the first one to be resurrected and the one after whom the rest of the people would be resurrected. The evidence is the same hadeeth of Jubayr ibn Mut`im radiyAllaahu `anh reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim.</li>
<li><strong>Al-`Aaqib</strong> (العاقب) – the last Prophet. The proof being the same hadeeth.</li>
<li><strong>Al-Muqaffaa</strong> (المقفى) or <strong>Al-Muqaffee</strong> (المقفي) – the one who follows on from the previous Messengers and is the final one of them. The evidence for that is the hadeeth of Aboo Moosaa Al-Ash`aree radiyAllaahu `anh, reported by Muslim.</li>
<li><strong>Nabeeut-Tawbah</strong> (نبي التوبة) – the Prophet of repentance; the one through whom Allaah opened the gate of repentance to His servants. The proof being the same hadeeth of Aboo Moosaa Al-Ash`aree radiyAllaahu `anh.</li>
<li><strong>Nabeeur-Rahmah</strong> (نبي الرحمة) – the Prophet of mercy; the one whom Allaah sent as a mercy to the creation. The evidence is the hadeeth of Aboo Moosaa Al-Ash`aree radiyAllaahu `anh.</li>
<li><strong>Nabeeul-Malhamah</strong> (نبي الملحمة) – the Prophet of slaughter or wars; the one sent to fight against the enemies of Allaah. The evidence of this is the hadeeth of Hudhayfah radiyAllaahu `anh reported by Tirmidhee in his Shil.</li>
<li><strong>An-Nabeeul-Mustafaa</strong> (النبي المصطفى) – the chosen Prophet. The evidence being a hadeeth of `Awf ibn Maalik Al-Ashjaa`ee radiyAllaahu `anh.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Along with these names, some of the scholars mention that Allaah has described the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam with a number of attributes and titles in the Qur.aan.  Amongst the titles given to the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam in the Qur.aan are:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>`Abdullaah</strong> (عبد الله) – the slave of Allaah</li>
<li><strong>`abd</strong> (عبد) – a slave</li>
<li><strong>rasool</strong> (رسول) – a Messenger</li>
<li><strong>nabee</strong> (نبي) – a Prophet</li>
<li><strong>ummee</strong> (أمي) – unlettered</li>
<li><strong>shaahid</strong> (شاهد) – a witness,</li>
<li><strong>mubashshir</strong> (مبشر) – a bringer of glad tidings</li>
<li><strong>nadheer</strong> (نذير) – a warner and a caller to Allaah by His Permission</li>
<li><strong>siraajan muneeraa</strong> (سراجا منيرا) – a shining lamp</li>
<li><strong>ra&#8217;oofan raheemaa</strong> (رؤوفا، رحيما) – compassionate and merciful</li>
<li><strong>mudhakkiran</strong> (مذكّرا) – one who reminded the people of their Lord</li>
<li><strong>rahmah</strong> (رحمة) – a mercy</li>
<li><strong>ni`mah</strong> (نعمة) – a favor</li>
<li><strong>haadee</strong> (هادي) – a guide</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are titles and attributes mentioned in the Qur.aan with regard to the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and other scholars mention many others besides these.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>With regard to the ahaadeeth that were evidences for the names, they are:</strong></span></p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>The hadeeth of Jubayr ibn Mut`im radiyAllaahu `anh who said, “Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said,</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">لي خمسة أسماء: أنا محمد، وأحمد، وأنا الماحي الذي يمحو الله بي الكفر، وأنا الحاشر الذي يحشر الناس على قدمي، وأنا العاقب</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I have five names: I am Muhammad and Ahmad and I am Al-Maahee &#8211; the one through whom Allaah wipes away unbelief, and I am Al-Haashir – the one whom the people will be resurrected after me, and I am Al-`Aaqib – the last Prophet.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Reported by Al-Bukhaaree as hadeeth 3532 and also by Muslim.</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;" start="2">
<li>The hadeeth of Aboo Moosaa Al-Ash`aree radiyAllaahu `anh who said,</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يسمي لنا نفسه أسماء.  فقال: &#8220;أنا محمد، وأحمد، والمقفي، والحاشر، ونبي التوبة، ونبي الرحمة&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam used to call himself different names to us.  So he said, ‘I am Muhammad and Ahmad and Al-Muqaffee (the one who came at the end of all the Prophets before) and Al-Haashir (the first one to be resurrected) and Nabeeut-tawbah (the Prophet of repentance) and Nabeeur-rahmah (the Prophet of mercy).’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Muslim.</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;" start="3">
<li>The hadeeth of Hudhayfah radiyAllaahu `anh who said, “I met the Prophet sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam on one of the paths of Al-Madeenah; so he said,</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">أنا محمد وأنا أحمد وأنا نبي الرحمة ونبي التوبة وأنا المقفي وأنا الحاشر ونبي الملاحم</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I am Muhammad and I am Ahmad and I am the Prophet of mercy and the Prophet of repentance and I am the one who comes last after the other Prophets and I am the one who will be resurrected first and the Prophet of wars or slaughter.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Tirmidhee in his Shamaa.il and declared Hasan (Good) by Shaykh Al-Albaanee.</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;" start="4">
<li>The evidence for the last name, “An-Nabee Al-Mustafaa” (the chosen Prophet) is a slightly longer hadeeth. It is an incident which happened in Al-Madeenah.  Shaykh Al-Albaanee declared the hadeeth authentic (Saheeh) in his checking of Ibn Katheer’s Seerah.  The hadeeth is reported by Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad from `Awf ibn Maalik Al-Ashjaa`ee radiyAllaahu `anh who said,</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam went off one day and I was with him until we entered a church (synagogue) of the Jews in Al-Madeenah on a festival day of theirs and they disliked that we should enter upon them.  So he, sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, said to them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O company of Jews, show me twelve men who bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and then Allaah will remove the anger that He has upon them from every Jew beneath the sky.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they were silent, none of them answered him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he repeated it to them but none of them answered him. So he said, ‘You have refused.  So by Allaah, I am certainly Al-Haashir (the one who will be resurrected first) and I am Al-`Aaqib (the last Prophet), and I am An-Nabeeul-Mustafaa (the chosen Prophet) whether you believe or whether you reject me’.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The companion said, “Then he departed and I was with him until we had almost gone out (of the church of the Jews) when a man said from behind us, ‘Remain where you are O Muhammad.’ So that man said, ‘O company of Jews, what sort of person do you know me to be amongst you?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said, ‘By Allaah, we do not know there to have been any man amongst us who knew the Book of Allaah better than you do, nor anyone having more religious knowledge than you do, nor than your father before you, nor than your grandfather before your father.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, ‘Then I testify in his favor that By Allaah! He is the Prophet of Allaah who you find mentioned in the Tawraat.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then they said, ‘You have lied’ and they rebutted his saying and spoke evil of him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said, ‘You people have lied; your speech will never be accepted.  You have just been praising him as you have done with good, but when he believed then you declared him to be a liar and you said about him what you said.  So you speech will never be accepted.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The companion said, “So the three of us went out – Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, myself and `Abdullaah ibn Salaam (the Jew who just entered into Islaam). No one else from the Jews believed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Most High sent down concerning him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Say, “Do you see, if it is indeed from Allaah and you disbelieve in it, when a witness from Banoo Israa.eel witnesses to the like of it and he believes in it, but you people reject haughtily.&#8221; Then Allaah does not guide an unbelieving, wrongdoing people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sooratul-Ahqaaf (46), aayah 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Al-Albaanee said the hadeeth is Saheeh (authentic).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation and notes by Owais Al-Hāshimī<br />
19 Ramaḍān 1437</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawzīyah – Allāh have mercy on him – said while describing the way of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم in reciting the Qurān:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People have differed as to which is best: tartīl (slower) recitation covering less (of the Qurān), or faster recitation with more covered; which of them is better? They had two opinions on this.</p>

<p><strong>Transcription of the Audio:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillaah hir Rahman nir Raheem. Alhumdulillahi Rabbil Aalameen<br />
Wa sallallahu ala Muhammadin wa ala aalihi wa sahbihi wa sallam</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The pillars of Kufr are four, they are,</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Haughtiness and disdainfullnes : This prevents the person from submission i.e. yielding.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Envy (Al Hasad) : This prevents him from accepting the naseehah i.e. the advice and from exerting it.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Anger (Al Ghadab) : This prevents him from being just.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Lusts : This prevents him from giving himself to worship.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If the pillar of false pride and haughtiness is demolished, then submission will become easy for him. If the pillar of envy is demolished, then it becomes easier for him to accept advice and to offer it. If the pillar of anger is demolished, it becomes easy for him to be just and humble. If the pillar of lust is demolished, it becomes easy for him to be patient and ready for worship.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The demolishing of mountains is much more easier than demolishing these four pillars for the one who is  afflicted with it, specially if they are entrenched in him and became as a firmed attribute, because no action can be upright with the presence of these pillars and no soul can be sanctified and purified having these established in it and whenever the person wants to exert himself to do or to act, these four pillars come and corrupt his work. And all other defects originate from these four and if these four are established in the heart it will make him see falsehood in the form of the truth and truth in the form of falsehood and good in the form of wrong and wrong in the form of good and it will make this life grow nearer to him and make the hereafter far removed from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you contemplate the Kufr of the nations before, you will see that the Kufr of the nations originated from these four pillars and upon these four pillars the punishment will befall. The intensity of the punishment and it&#8217;s severity will depend upon how these four and entrenched. So whoever opens for himself these four pillars is indeed has opened all the doors of evil, sooner or later and whoever has closed the doors of these then he indeed has closed all the doors of evil because these four prevents submissiveness, sincerity, repentance and longing and turning to Allah, acceptance of the truth, the advice to the Muslims, humbleness to Allah and to his creation. This is what these four pillars can do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The origin of these four pillars is from man&#8217;s ignorance concerning his Lord and ignorance concerning himself.  Had he known of his Lord qualified with the most perfect and magnificent attributes and had he known himself qualified with all forms of defects, he wouldn&#8217;t be haughty, angry, envious of others because envy in fact is one form of opposition to Allah because he dislikes the favour and blessing of Allah which he bestowed upon his slave while Allah loves that. Not only that, he likes that it to be rifted from his brother and Allah does not like that. So he is opposing Allah in his pre-decree and what Allah loves and his honour and that is why Iblees (Satan) is enemy  because his sin was due to haughtiness, arrogance and envy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can these be removed?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These two qualities, knowing Allah and Tawheed, and content with him and pleased with him and turning to him, takes away these two qualities of haughtiness and envy and taking anger away by knowing oneself that the self does not deserve all that so that to be angry for it and to avenge for its all sake. In this case this will prompt it to be contempt once this is taken out. Otherwise then this will be preference for the self over its creator and originator. The greatest thing to repel this defect is to train the self to get angry for Allah&#8217;s sake and whatever at any time enters the self this type of anger for Allah&#8217;s sake, there will exit the anger for its self and the opposite is true. As to the lust, its cure, its healing is in the correct knowledge. Yielding to the self&#8217;s lust deprives it from the correct knowledge and putting it on a diet in that respect puts it on the linkage with the correct knowledge. The more you are open the door for lusts, the more you are trying to deprive the self  from the correct knowledge and the more you close it, the more you will be linked to the correct knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anger is like the wild animal. If its owner releases it, it starts by eating him up first. Lust is like the fire when the person ignites it it begins by burning him there in first. Al-Kibr, haughtiness, false pride, arrogance is like confronting the king regarding the king&#8217;s possession and kingdom, if he does not destroy you he will expel you. Envy is like opposing someone who is more powerful and more stronger than you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>This is based on Imam Ibn Al Qayim&#8217;s (rahimahAllah) specification of these four pillars of Kufr.</em></span></p>

<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ إِذ ظَّلَمُوا أَنفُسَهُمْ جَاءُوكَ فَاسْتَغْفَرُوا اللَّهَ وَاسْتَغْفَرَ لَهُمُ الرَّسُولُ لَوَجَدُوا اللَّهَ تَوَّابًا رَّحِيمًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If, when they had wronged themselves, they had come to you &#8211; O Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) – and had sought Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness, and the Messenger had asked for Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness for them, then they would have found that Allaah would have accepted their repentance and had mercy upon them. </strong></span><span style="text-align:center;">[Sooratun-Nisaa (4): 64]</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Ibnul-Qayyim (<em>rahimahullaah</em>)</strong> said:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Since Allaah – the One free of all imperfections – knew that those to whom the Messenger was sent would certainly wrong themselves and follow their desires, He guided them to that which would repel the evil of that wrong and remove its causes. This lay in two things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>, there was something that they themselves were to do, which was to seek forgiveness of their Lord – the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>, there was something for someone else to do, and this was that the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) should ask forgiveness for them when they came to him, submitted obediently to him and acknowledged their wrong-doing. So, if they were to do these two things, they would find that Allaah would accept their repentance and forgive them. He would accept their repentance, thus wiping away the effect of their sins and protecting them from their evils. In addition to this, He would grant them His Mercy, His favourable and fine treatment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, what share of this Aayah is there for a person who wrongs himself after the death of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ? Does the use of the Aayah support those people who claim that the person should go to his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) grave; ask for forgiveness there, and for his intercession?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reply is that, as for the share of the person who wrongs himself after the death of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) with regard to this Aayah, he should ask for Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness, with sincere repentance and this applies in every time and place. It is not a condition for the correctness of his repentance that he should go to his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) grave, and ask for forgiveness there. (By consensus- Ijmaa&#8221;).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">As for going to his grave and seeking forgiveness there and seeking his intercession, using this Aayah as an evidence, then the Aayah does not indicate this in any sense at all. It only refers to going to him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ; not going to his grave; nor does it state that he will seek forgiveness for them if they seek intercession from him after his death.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is thus shown to be a false and futile argument which is further clarified by the fact that the Companions, those who of all people knew best about the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) , did not understand the Aayah in this way. So it is known that this is an innovation. That which is most frequently used as evidence by those who permit it, is the narration of al-`Utabee from an unknown Bedouin, even though we do not know any chain of narration for it. If this disconnected report, or it&#8217;s like, were a hadeeth or a report from a Companion, then it would not be permissible to use it as a proof, and its ruling would not be binding upon us because of its lack of authenticity. How then can it be permissible to use as proof for this a story that is not authentic, concerning a Bedouin who is unknown!? [1]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaikh ‘Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Naasir as-Sa`dee</strong> (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Meaning: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If, when they had wronged themselves, they had come to you &#8211; O Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">i.e. acknowledging their sins, and fully confessing them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>…and had sought Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness, and the Messenger had asked for Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness for them, then they would have found that Allaah would have accepted their repentance and had mercy upon them</strong></span>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">i.e. He would have turned to them, forgiven their wrongdoing, and been Merciful to them; by accepting their repentance, guiding them to it and granting it to them, and rewarding them for it. This coming to the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was something specific to his lifetime.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>This is what the context indicates, because seeking forgiveness from the Messenger cannot occur except in his lifetime. As for after his death, then nothing can be sought from him; rather that would be shirk.&#8221;</strong></span> [2]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Sending Salaat* Upon The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم)</strong><br />
[* i.e. saying &#8220;Allaahumma salli &#8216;alaa Muhammad&#8230;&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam an-Nasaa·ee</strong> –rahimahullaah- reported in his &#8220;Sunan&#8221; (no.1297):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Ishaaq ibn Mansoor related to us, saying: Muhammad ibn Yoosuf narrated to us, saying: Yoonus ibn Abee Ishaaq narrated to us: from Burayd ibn Abee Maryam who said: Anas ibn Maalik narrated to us, saying: Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Whoever sends a single salaat upon me, then Allaah will send ten salawaaat upon Him, and ten sins will be removed from him, and he will be raised by ten ranks</span></strong> &gt;&gt;.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaanee-rahimahullaah- declared it &#8220;Saheeh&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaikh al-Albaanee</strong> said in &#8220;Sifatus-Salaat&#8221; (p.165): ‘‘The most correct saying about the meaning of salaat upon the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the saying of Abul-&#8216;Aaliyah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Allaah&#8217;s salaat upon His Prophet is His extolling him [[to the Angels]] and exalting him; and the salaat of the Angels and others upon him is to request this from Allaah -the Most High&#8221;; and what is meant is seeking increase, not the initiation of salaat al-Haafiz [Ibn Hajr] mentioned it in &#8220;al-Fath&#8221;.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim</strong> -rahimahullaah, in his book &#8220;Jalaa·ul-Afhaam fee Fadlis-Salaati was-Salaam &#8216;alaa khayril anaam (صلى الله عليه و سلم)&#8221;, mentions <strong>forty benefits arising from sending salaat upon Allaah&#8217;s Messenger</strong> (صلى الله عليه و سلم):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Compliance with the Command of Allaah-the Perfect and Most High. [i.e. in Aayah 65 of Sooratul-Ahzaab].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Conformity with Him- He the Perfect- in sending salaat upon him, even though the two forms of salaat are different. So our salaat upon him is a supplication and a request, whereas the salaat of Allaah-the Most High-upon him is extolling and ennobling&#8230;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Conformity with the Angels in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Attaining ten salawaat [[plural of salaat]] from Allaah by the person who sends salaat upon him once.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. That he is raised by ten levels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. That he has ten good deeds written for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. That ten sins are erased from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. That it is to be hoped that his supplication will be responded to if he precedes it with that. So it causes the supplication to ascend to the Lord of creation, when prior to this it was suspended between the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. It is a means to attain his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) Intercession, if it is accompanied by a request for alwaseelah (a singular station in Paradise) for him, or even if it is on its own&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. It is a means for forgiveness of sins …</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. It is a cause for Allaah to suffice the servant with regard to whatever concerns him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. It is a means for the person to gain nearness to him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) on the Day of Resurrection…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">13.( It has the position of being like an act of charity upon a needy person.)**</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. It is a cause for the fulfillment of your needs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15. It is a cause for Allaah to send salaat upon the person, and for the salaat of His Angels upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16. It is a cleansing (zakaat) and purification for the person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">17. (It is a cause for the servant to receive glad tidings of Paradise before his death…) **</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">18. (It is a means for salvation from the terrors of the Day of Resurrection…) **</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19. It is a cause for the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to respond to the one who sends salaat and salaam upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">20. (It is a cause for the servant to remember that which he has forgotten.) **</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21. It is a cause of good for the gathering, and for its not becoming a source of regret for its people on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">22. (It is a means to repel poverty&#8230;) **</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">23. It repels from the person the description of being a miser, if he sends salaat upon him whenever he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">24. He becomes saved from being supplicated against that his nose should be cleaved in dust, for abandoning it when he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">25. It puts its companion upon the path to Paradise, and it causes the one who abandons it to err with regard to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">26. It saves from the stench of a gathering wherein Allaah and His Messenger are not mentioned, and where Allaah-the Most High- is not praised and extolled, and where salaat is not sent upon His Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">27. It is a means for the completion of the speech which was begun with praise of Allaah and salaat upon His Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">28. (It is a cause for the servant&#8221;s light to be increased upon the Bridge (as-Siraat).) **</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29. It takes the servant away from coarseness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">30. It is a cause for Allaah –the Perfect- to bestow favourable praise upon the one who sends salaat upon him, praising him to the inhabitants of the Heavens and the earth. This is because the one who sends salaat upon him is asking Allaah to extol His Messenger, and to honour, and ennoble him. So recompense conforms to the type of deed, so the one who sends salaat must in turn receive some form of this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">31. It is a cause of blessing for the one who sends salaat, in his self, his deeds, and his life, and the means of his welfare. This is because the one who sends salaat is supplicating to his Lord that He should bless him and his true followers; and this supplication will be answered; and recompense conforms to the deed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">32. It is a means for his attaining the Mercy of Allaah, since mercy is either the meaning of the salaat –upon the saying of some; or it is otherwise something necessitated by it, and required from it-upon the correct saying. So the one who sends salaat upon him must certainly receive Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">33. It is a means to perpetuate his love of the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم),and to increase it, and to multiply it; and that is one of the essential fundamentals of Eemaan, which it will not be complete without; since the more a servant mentions the one he loves, and remembers him in his heart, and remembers his fine qualities, and those things which instill love of him, then his love of him will increase, and yearning for him will grow, and this will overcome his whole heart. But if he turns away from mentioning him and from thinking of him and of his fine qualities in his heart, then love of him will be reduced in his heart. So there is nothing more pleasing to the one who loves than seeing the one whom he loves, and nothing gives greater pleasure to his heart than mentioning him, and thinking of him and of his fine qualities. So when this becomes strong in his heart, then his tongue will praise and extol him…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">34. That salaat upon him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is a cause of his loving that person. So because it is a cause for the one who sends salaat upon him to increase in love of him, likewise it is a cause for him to love the one who sends salaat upon him (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">35. It is a means for the guidance of the person and for his heart to have life…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">36. (It is a cause for the one who sends salaat upon him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to have his name presented to him, and for his being mentioned to him&#8230;) **</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">37. (It is a cause for the feet to be planted firmly upon the Siraat, and for the person&#8221;s passing over it&#8230;) **</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">38. That sending salaat upon him fulfils the slightest part of his right…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">39. That it comprises remembrance of Allaah and thankfulness to Him, and recognition of His Favour upon His servants in sending him. So the one who sends salaat upon him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) includes in his salaat upon him remembrance of Allaah and remembrance of His Messenger…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">40. That salaat upon him from the person is supplication (du&#8217;aa), and the persons du&#8217;aa. to his Lord and his requests to his Lord are of two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) His requesting his own needs and concerns, and whatever he requires throughout the night and the day. So this is supplication and request, and is to give precedence to that which the servant loves and seeks;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) His requesting that He should extol His chosen and beloved servant, and increase him in nobility and honour, and make mention of him, and elevate him. So there is no doubt that Allaah-the Most High-loves that, and his Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) loves it. So the one who sends salaat upon him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) has turned his requests, that which he desires, and that which he seeks towards that which is loved by Allaah-the Most High- and His Messenger; and he has given preference to that over his own needs and requirements. Indeed this that he seeks has become the most beloved of things to him, and that which he most prefers. So he has given preference to that which Allaah and His Messenger love over that which he himself loves. So he has given preference to Allaah and to what He loves over everything else, and recompense conforms to the action. So whoever gives preference to Allaah over everything else, then Allaah will give preference to him over others…&#8221;&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">In the Name of Allaah, the Most Beneficent the Most Merciful</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Verily! Allaah will not change the good (or bad condition) of a people as long as they don’t change their state of goodness (or sins and wrong doings etc) themselves.&#8221;</strong></span> [13:11].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Ibnul Qayyim</strong>, rahimahullahs, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">&#8220;Ponder upon the Hikmah (Wisdom) of Allaah, the most High, where He has made people&#8217;s kings, leaders, and those of authority over them, of the same kind as their own deeds. It is as if the people&#8217;s deeds appeared in the forms of their kings and leaders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">If the people are upright, then their kings and rulers will be upright, and if they turn away (from uprightness), then their leaders will turn against them. And if they oppress and tyrannize, then their kings and rulers will tyrannize and oppress. And if deception and treachery becomes manifest amongst them, then the same will appear in their rulers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">If the people refrain from fulfilling the rights of Allaah upon them and become niggardly (regarding their execution), then their kings and rulers will refuse to give them their rights and will become niggardly (withhold their rights from them). And if they take away from those whom they oppress that which they deserve not to take, then the kings will take away from the people that which they deserve not to take and will levy taxes and impose tasks upon them. And whatever the people unjustly take from the oppressed, their kings take the same by force from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">So those in charge of the people appear in the forms of their (the ruled) deeds. And it befits not the Divine Wisdom that the evil and wicked be ruled except by those of the same kind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">And since the early [Muslims] were the best and most righteous of generations, their rulers were of the same standing. But when the people turned weak, their rulers turned to be of their own rank.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">So it befits not the Hikmah (Wisdom) of Allaah in these times (Ibnul Qayyim times [1] ) that rulers the like of Mu&#8217;aawiyah and &#8216;Umar bin &#8216;Addil &#8216;Azeez, be in charge over us, and even less the like of Abee Bakr and &#8216;Umar. Rather, our rulers are in accordance with our own rank and standing, and the ones who ruled those before us were (also) in accordance with these people own rank and standing. And both matters (the status of the former rulers and those of this time) are as necessitated and entailed by [Allaah&#8217;s] Hikmah.&#8221; [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is very evident that from the legal perspective and by the consensus of the early Muslims, as well as by way of intellect and experience, that the true change of the status of the Ummah occurs when it turns to Allaah and follows the ways that made the early generations successful. Imaam Maalik, rahimahullah, summed it in words few in number, profound in meaning:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Nothing will benefit the Ummah to come except that which benefited the early Ummah.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who adopt the path of confrontation with the rulers, thinking that the change comes through this way, are trailing the path of misguidance and a path whose consequences proved it wrong by all perspectives. This is the same path taken by the early dissidents (khawaarij) who followed the mutashaabih (not entirely clear) texts instead of following the muhkam (clear) texts and referring whatever may be not entirely clear to that which is mukham. The following of the mutashaabih is a path of fitan (afflictions) that led to the rebellion against the leaders of the sahaabah, and in our times has caused bloodshed and suffering and retardation of da&#8217;wah. Allaahul Must&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This matter is a matter of Deen and not a matter of emotions. And since the textual proofs are replete commanding the believers that they must obey those in authority, even if they oppress and take ones wealth, etc As long as they do not command the believer to do sin, then we have no choice but to comply and obey. Otherwise, we will be inventing a new Deen. Allaah, the One Free of all imperfection, the most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Let those beware who withstand the Rasool&#8217;s (صلى الله عليه و سلم) orders, unless some fitnah befalls them or a grievous penalty be inflicted on them&#8221;</strong></span> [24:63]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Whatever was not Deen at the time of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) cannot be considered to be a part of the Deen today.&#8221;</strong> </span>[Imaam Maalik].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the person choses to contend the way of the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), then let him remember the following aayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">If anyone contends with and opposes the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers way, We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell- what an evil destination!</span></strong> [4:115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah, the most Merciful, guide us all to the truth and make us hold to it and may He, the most High and Majestic, save us all from fitan and guide us (ruled and rulers) to His Path. Aameen.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Imaam Ibnul Qayyim</b> (rahimahullaah) talked about what people think is the fitnah of &#8220;our times&#8221;, i.e. meaning his own times, but this applies just as well to the contemporary fitnah of our own times. About the ways of Allaah (Azza wa Jal) in this creation vis-a-vis the rulers and the ruled, he said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And contemplate Allaah&#8217;s (Azza wa Jal) Wisdom when He made people of authority, making them a reflection of the ruled. It is as if the deeds of the ruled appear in the form and deeds of their rulers :</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">if the <b>ruled</b> are upright, then their <b>rulers</b> will be upright</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">if the <b>ruled</b> incline away from uprightness, then their<b> rulers</b> will do the same to them</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">if the <b>ruled</b> transgress and oppress, then their <b>rulers</b> will do the same to them</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">if there appears deception and plotting from the <b>ruled</b>, then it will be the same from their <b>rulers</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">if the <b>ruled </b>take away the rights of the people and become miser as to the rights of others, then their <b>rulers</b> will do the same to them and deprive them of their rights</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">if the<b> ruled </b>take away from the oppressed /weak among them that which they deserve not to take in their transactions with them, then their <b>rulers</b> will do that towards the ruled&#8217;s wealth and take what they deserve not, and impose on the<b> ruled </b>taxes and assignments</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and whenever the <b>ruled</b> take from the oppressed and weak unjustly, then their <b>rulers</b> will do the same to them and take it by force</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">so the actions of the <b>ruled </b>appear in the actions of the <b>rulers</b> and <b>it is not in the Divine Wisdom that Allaah (Azza wa Jal) assigns authority over the wicked and evils ones, EXCEPT to the ones who are of their own kind<br />
</b><br />
Since the first generation was of the best generation and of the most righteous, &#8230; so were their leaders righteous</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>It is not befitting Allaah&#8217;s Wisdom that in &#8220;our times&#8221; (Ibnul Qayyim&#8217;s times) that those assigned to authority over us be the like of Muawwiya and &#8216;Umar bin &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Aziz, not to mention Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar. The leaders of those before us were in accordance with their own conditions and ranks. Our leaders are in accordance with our own condition and rank. In both cases, this is entailed by the Wisdom of Allaah (Azza wa Jal).&#8221;</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such is the conclusion of Imaam Ibnul Qayyim (rahimahullah) concerning his times, i.e. the 8th century A.H., so what do you think about our own times?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Wisdom of Allaah (Azza wa Jal) pertains to His Attributes. He puts things in accordance with His Hikmah and puts them in their proper places with what fits. The Wisdom of Allaah (Azza wa Jal) has a noble and most perfect objective.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who hasten in making these roads for &#8220;deliverance&#8221; and see getting rid of the rulers as the solution to their problems, they confuse symptoms and disease.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The rulers are seen as being the causes when in reality they are only the symptoms. The true illness is within the ruled. Therefore, all endeavors towards finding a solution should focus on the ruled themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The deeds of the ruled are reflected in the deeds of the people having authority over them. When the people are not ready and are away from the deen of Allaah, who would you expect them to deserve as rulers?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Contemplate this very carefully!</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">From the signs of happiness and joy is that whenever a worshipper increases in knowledge, his humbleness and mercy increases. Whenever he increases in acts of worship, his fear and caution increases. Whenever he increases in age, his greed decreases. Whenever he increases in wealth, his generosity and spending increases. And whenever he increases in status and position, his nearness to the people increases as does his fulfilling their needs and being humble with them.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">And from the signs of misery is that whenever a worshipper increases in knowledge, his pride and arrogance increases. Whenever he increases in acts of worship, his bragging increases as does his belittling of people while always giving himself the benefit of the doubt. And whenever he increases in status and position, his arrogance and ego increases.</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of these things are trials from Allaah and a test by which He tests His servants, and because of them, some people attain happiness and others become miserable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, some things people honor and admire are also trials like possessions, authority, and wealth. Allaah says about His prophet, Sulaymaan, when he saw the throne of Bilqees in front of<br />
him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;هَذَا مِنْ فَضْلِ رَبِّي لِيَبْلُوَنِي أَأَشْكُرُ أَمْ أَكْفُرُ &#8220;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>This is from the favor of My Lord to test me whether I will be grateful or ungrateful</strong></span>. [Soorah An-Naml, 27:40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, blessings are tests from Allaah that make apparent the gratitude of the grateful, and the ingratitude of the ungrateful. In the same way, hardhips are also trials from Him سُبْحَانَه .He tests by way of blessings and hardships.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;فَأَمَّا الإِنْسَانُ إِذَا مَا ابْتَلاهُ رَبُّهُ فَأَكْرَمَهُ وَنَعَّمَهُ فَيَقُولُ رَبِّي أَكْرَمَنِ وَأَمَّا إِذَا مَا ابْتَلاهُ فَقَدَرَ عَلَيْهِ<br />
رِزْقَهُ فَيَقُولُ رَبِّي أَهَانَنِ &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And as for man, when his Lord tests him and is generous to him and favors him, he says, “My Lord has honored me!” But when He tests him and restricts his provision, he says, “My Lord has humiliated me!”</strong></span> [Soorah Al-Fajr, 89:15-16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In other words, it’s not the case that everyone I increase with honor and blessings, that’s My way of honoring him. And everyone I tighten his sustenance and test him, it’s not necessarily that I’m humiliating him.</p>

<p><strong><span class="style41">Based upon the work of Imam Ibnul Qayyim (rahimahullaah)</span></strong></p>
<p><b><span style="color:#993300;">The 10 Ways &#8211; point-by-point &#8211; to escape the envy of the envious person</span>:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1</b>&#8211; Seeking refuge in Allaah from the evil of the <i>haasid</i> (the envious one).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>2</b>&#8211; Fearing Allaah, Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;aala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>3</b>&#8211; Being patient when dealing with this enemy, and not wasting time via confronting him or arguing with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>4</b>&#8211; Tawakkul (relying on Allaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>5</b>&#8211; Don&#8217;t even allow your heart to become occuppied with the envier&#8217;s foolishness, and try your best to erase it from your thoughts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>6</b>&#8211; Turning to Allaah and being sincere to Allaah, and making the love of seeking Allaah&#8217;s Pleasure and repenting to Allaah one&#8217;s main primary concern.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>7</b>&#8211; Repenting to Allaah for sins which allowed the enemy to gain asendancy over him; no one is given the ability to overpower a slave except due to that&#8217;s slave&#8217;s sins (sins he knows of and the sins he may not know of).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>8</b>&#8211; Giving sadaqah and treating others well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>9</b>&#8211; Repelling the evil with good &#8211; and this is from the most difficult upon the soul.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>10</b>&#8211; Implementing and actualizing Tawheed, which in reality encompasses everything that has preceded, and it revolves around it. And for one to actualize Tawheed, he must learn it. One should learn Tawheed and the right of Allaah upon His slaves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666699;">By Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah as-Salafi <em>-Rahimullaah-<br />
</em>From his book  ‘Madarij as-Salikeen’</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah as-Salafi <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘</strong>Allaah’s slave cannot implement &lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship&gt;&gt; except with two great principles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of which is following the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second is <em>Ikhlaas</em> (sincerity) for the One worshipped.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is then implementing &lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people are divided into four categories in relation to these two principles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first of which is the people who have <em>Ikhlaas</em> for the One worshipped and for following the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>. They are, in reality, the people of &lt;&lt; You (Alone) we worship&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So all their actions are for Allaah, their sayings are for Allaah, their giving and their prohibiting are for Allaah, their loving is for Allaah and their hating is for Allaah.  Their apparent dealings and hidden dealings are for Allaah’s Face Alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They do not want reward from the people for this or thanks, nor do they desire position with them, nor do they request praise or status in their hearts or escape from their criticisms.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather they hold the people at the same status as those who are in graves. They do not possess any harm or benefit for them, neither life or death, nor the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, action done for the sake of the people, desiring refuge and status among them and hoping for harm and benefit from them, never emanates from the one who knows the people, but rather itemanates from the one who is ignorant of their affairs and one who is ignorant of his Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who knows the people places them according to their status.  So whoever knows Allaah, then he makes his actions and sayings sincerely for Allaah, he obeys Him and prohibits for Him,loves for Him and hates for Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A person does not deal with any thing from the creation, to the exclusion of Allaah, except due to his ignorance of Allaah and his ignorance of the creation.  Otherwise, if he knew Allaah and knew the people, he would prefer his dealing with Allaah to his dealing with the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, all his actions and worship should be in agreement with the command of Allaah and with what Allaah loves and is pleased with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the only actions which Allaah accepts from the one who performs them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this, He tries His worshippers with life and death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Who has created death and life, that He may test you which of you is best in deed. &gt;&gt; [Mulk: 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He made whatever is on the earth as beautification for it so He could test which of them is the best in action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fudayl bin ‘Aayaad said: ‘A good action is one that is sincere and correct.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘O Abu ‘Alee which one is sincere and correct?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘If the action is sincere but is not correct, then it will not be accepted and if it is correct but not sincere it will not be accepted, until it is sincere and correct.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Khaalis</em> (sincere) is that which is for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Sawaab</em> (correct) is that which is according to the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what is mentioned in the saying of Allaah <em>–Ta’ala-</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord.’  &gt;&gt; [Khaf: 110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And who can be better in religion than one who submits his face (himself) to Allaah (i.e. follows Allaah’s Religion of Islaamic Monotheism); and he is a good-doer. &gt;&gt; [Nisa: 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah does not accept actions except those that are sincerely for His Face, following His command. Anything other than these are rejected and returned to the one who performs them– even though he is in a great need of their being accepted – them being scattered in all directions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Saheeh, from the hadeeth of ‘Aeysha, on the authority of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>: ‘Every action which we have not commanded then it is rejected.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every action without a precedent does not increase the one performing it except in distance from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah <em>–Ta’ala –</em> is surely worshipped according to His commands and not by opinions and desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second category is the one who neither has <em>Ikhlaas</em> nor does he follow.  His action is then not in accordance with the <em>Sharia’</em> nor is it sincerely for the one worshipped, such as actions which are beautified for the people, those who show off hypocritically by other than what Allaah and His Messenger legislated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These people are the most evil of creation, they are the most hated to Allaah <em>–Azza wa Jal</em>.  They have a greater share in the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Think not that those who rejoice in what they have done (or brought about), and love to be praised for what they have not done,- think not you that they are rescued from the torment, and for them is a painful torment.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[aal-Imraan:188]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They rejoice in what they have been given of <em>Bida’</em>, misguidance and<em>Shirk</em> and they love being praised for falsely following the Sunnah and <em>Ikhlaas</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many of this type – from those who ascribe themselves to knowledge, poverty and worship – from those who deviated away from the <em>Sirat al-Mustaqeem</em> (straight way).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed they perform <em>Bida’</em> and misguidance, they show off – boasting about their actions, loving to be praised for that which they have not done of <em>Ittiba</em> (following the Messenger), <em>Ikhlaas</em> (sincerity) and<em> Ilm</em> (knowledge). They are the people who have Allaah’s Anger upon them and are the people of misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third category is he who is sincere in his actions, however he is not upon path of following the command, just like the ignorant worshippers and those who ascribe themselves to paths of <em>Zuhud</em>and poverty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everyone who worships Allaah without following Allaah’s command, believing that his act of worship is a form of drawing closer to Allaah, then his condition is like this.  Such as the one who thinks that listening to whistling and the clapping of hands is a form of drawing closer to Allaah or that being in isolation – which necessitates leaving the <em>Jummah</em> prayer and the congregational prayer – is a form of drawing closer to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or the one who thinks that continuous fasting, day and night, is a form of drawing closer to Allaah or fasting the day which all the people refrain from fasting is a form of drawing closer to Allaah or other similar examples.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth category is when his actions follow Allaah’s command, but they are for other than Allaah, such as obedience to those who hypocritically show off or like a man who fights to show off, or fanatically or for bravery or performs <em>Hajj</em> so it can be said that he performs <em>Hajj</em> or reads Qur’aan so it can be said that he recites Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Outwardly, the actions of these people are righteous actions which have been commanded, however they are not righteous and so they will not be accepted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allaah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him), and perform prayer and give the <em>Zakaat</em>: and that is the right religion &gt;&gt;[al-Bayyinah: 5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So everyone has been ordered not to worship other than Allaah except by what He has commanded, having <em>Ikhlaas</em> for Him in worship and these are the people of</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything) &gt;&gt;’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">By Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah as-Salafi <em>-Rahimullaah-<br />
</em>Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘From the levels of &lt;&lt; It is only You we worship and only You we ask for help&gt;&gt; is the level of <em>al-Istiqaama</em> (being steadfast on the right way).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; Indeed, those who have said, ‘Our Lord is Allaah’ and then remained steadfast – the angels will descend upon them, [saying], ‘Do not fear and do not grieve but receive good tidings of Paradise, which you were promised.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[Fussilat :30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; Indeed, those who have said, ‘Our Lord is Allaah,’ and then remained steadfast – there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve. Those are the companions of Paradise, abiding eternally therein as reward for what they used to do.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[al-Ahaqqaf : 13-14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah said to His Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; So remain steadfast as you have been commanded, [you] and those who have turned back with you [to Allaah], and do not transgress. Indeed, He Sees of what you do. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[Hood :112]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He explained that <em>Istiqaama</em> is the opposite of oppression, which is overstepping the bounds in everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; Say, O [Muhammad], ‘I am only a man like you to whom it has been revealed that your god is but one God; so take a straight course to Him and seek His forgiveness. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"> [Fussilat : 6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; And [Allaah revealed] that if they had remained steadfast on the right way, We would have given them abundant provision So We might test them therein. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[Jinn:16-17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most truthful of this <em>Ummah</em> and the one who had the greatest <em>Istiqaama</em> – Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> was asked about <em>Istiqaama</em>? He answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘That you do not associate anything with Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What he intended was <em>Istiqaama</em> upon pure <em>Tawheed</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar bin al-Khattab <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<em>Istiqaama</em> is that you remain steadfast upon commands and prohibitions. And do not dodge them in the way that foxes swerve away.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Uthmaan bin ‘Affan <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘To be steadfast means that you make your actions purely and sincerely for Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ali bin Abee Taalib <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> and Ibn ‘Abbas <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘To be steadfast means: to perform the obligatory worship.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Be steadfast upon the command of Allaah, fulfil His obedience, and distance yourself from sinning against Him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujahid said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Be steadfast upon the testification of <em>‘</em><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> (‘There is none worthy of worship, in truth, except Allaah’) until they meet Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Be steadfast upon love for Allaah and His worship and do not turn away from Him to the right or to the left.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Saheeh of Muslim from Sufyaan bin Abdullaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said: ‘I said O Messenger of Allaah tell me a statement about Islaam, which I can only ask of from you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> – answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Say, I believe in Allaah, then be steadfast.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in the Saheeh of Muslim from Thawbaan <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> – who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Be steadfast, and you will not be in loss, and know that the best of your actions is the prayer, and no one is continuous upon <em>Wudoo</em> except a believer.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is required from the slave of Allaah is to remain steadfast, and that is being steadfast and upright. If he is not capable of remaining steadfast, then he should do that what is close to remaining steadfast as possible, however, if he falls below that, then he is in loss and in a state of negligence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As is mentioned in the Saheeh of Muslim from the hadeeth of Abu Huraira <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> – who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Adhere to the correct way and if you cannot then that which is nearest to it, and know that none of you will not succeed with just his actions alone.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They asked: ‘Not even you O Messenger of Allaah?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> – answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Not even me, only if Allaah encompasses me with mercy from Himself and His excellence.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All the different levels and status of the Deen are gathered together in this hadeeth, so the command of being steadfast means to be correct, namely to be correct in intentions, statements and in actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8211; mentioned in the hadeeth of Thawbaan that they would not be capable of continuously remaining steadfast, so he referred them to coming closer to being steadfast, namely that they come as close as possible to being steadfast according to their own capability, like the person who shoots at a target but he does not hit the target however he comes close to it.  Along with this he <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> – informed them that being steadfast and coming close to being steadfast will not grant you success on the Day of Judgement by itself. Therefore, one should not just rely upon ones actions alone, or be amazed by his actions, nor should one view his success through his actions alone, rather his success is with the mercy of Allaah and His pardoning and His excellence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Istiqaama</em> is a comprehensive word, its meaning embodies the <em>Deen</em>. And it is to stand in front of Allaah with honesty and adhering to the reality of truth, and fulfilling Allaah’s covenant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Istiqaama</em> is linked to sayings, actions, situations and intentions, so to possess<em>Istiqaama</em> in these matters means that they are done for Allaah and for the sake of Allaah and upon the command of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some righteous people said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Make <em>Istiqaama</em> your companion, not one who seeks a miracle, even though your inner self desires to seek a miracle, because your Lord requests <em>Istiqaama</em> from you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The greatest of miracles is adhering to <em>Istiqaama</em>’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Madarij as-Salikeen’ vol 2 p.103]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#666699;">By Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah as-Salafi <em>-Rahimullaah-<br />
</em>From his book ‘Madarij as-Salikeen’ </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed Allaah mentioned ‘<em>as-Sakeenah</em>’ (Tranquility) in His Book in six places:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) The saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; وَقَالَ لَهُمْ نَبِيُّهُمْ إِنَّ آيَةَ مُلْكِهِ أَنْ يَأْتِيَكُمُ التَّابُوتُ فِيهِ سَكِينَةٌ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;  And their prophet said to them, Indeed, a sign of his kingship is that the chest will come to you in which is assurance from your Lord &gt;&gt;[al-Baqarah: 248]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) The saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; ثُمَّ أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ سَكِينَتَهُ عَلَى رَسُولِهِ وَعَلَى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;  Then Allah sent down His tranquility upon His Messenger and upon the believers &gt;&gt;[Tawbah: 26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3) The saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إِذْ يَقُولُ لِصَاحِبِهِ لَا تَحْزَنْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ مَعَنَا فَأَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ سَكِينَتَهُ عَلَيْهِ وَأَيَّدَهُ بِجُنُودٍ لَمْ تَرَوْهَا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;  and he said to his companion, ‘Do not grieve; indeed Allah is with us.’ And Allah sent down his tranquility upon him and supported him with Angels you did not see &gt;&gt;[Tawbah: 40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4) The saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; هُوَ الَّذِي أَنْزَلَ السَّكِينَةَ فِي قُلُوبِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ لِيَزْدَادُوا إِيمَانًا مَعَ إِيمَانِهِمْ وَلِلَّهِ جُنُودُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمًا &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;  It is He who sent down tranquility into the hearts of the believers that they would increase in faith along with their [present] faith. And to Allah belong the soldiers of the heavens and the earth, and ever is Allah Knowing and Wise. &gt;&gt;[al-Fath: 4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5) The saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; لَقَدْ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِذْ يُبَايِعُونَكَ تَحْتَ الشَّجَرَةِ فَعَلِمَ مَا فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ فَأَنْزَلَ السَّكِينَةَ عَلَيْهِمْ وَأَثَابَهُمْ فَتْحًا قَرِيبًا &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;  Certainly was Allah pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you, [O Muhammad], under the tree, and He knew what was in their hearts, so He sent down tranquility upon them and rewarded them with an imminent conquest  &gt;&gt;[al-Fath: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6) The saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; إِذْ جَعَلَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا فِي قُلُوبِهِمُ الْحَمِيَّةَ حَمِيَّةَ الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ فَأَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ سَكِينَتَهُ عَلَى رَسُولِهِ وَعَلَى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; When those who disbelieved had put into their hearts chauvinism – the chauvinism of the time of ignorance. But Allah sent down His tranquility upon His Messenger and upon the believers &gt;&gt;[al-Fath: 26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> used to read the <em>Ayaat</em> of<em>as-Sakeenah</em> (Tranquility) if matters became intense for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I heard him talk about a great incident which occurred when he was sick, the general intellect is too deficient to comprehend how evil souls emerged and waged war against him in his state of weakness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When this matter became intense, I said to my relatives and those around me: ‘Read the <em>Ayaat</em> of <em>as-Sakeenah</em> (Tranquility).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I would be free from this condition, and I would sit up as if a transformation had taken place and there was nothing wrong with me.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah as-Salafi -Rahimullaah-<br />
Translated by Umm Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed a slave commits a sin and enters Paradise through committing it and he performs a good deed and enters the Hellfire through performing it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was asked ‘How is this (possible)?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘A sin is committed and thus does not cease to be before his eyes (causing him to be) fearful of it, concerned about it frightened and weeping due to his regret of doing it. Feeling ashamed due to this action before his Lord The Most High, with his head lowered between his hands, and his heart broken and despondent due to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore that sin will be more beneficial to him than numerous acts of obedience could be. As a consequence these previously mentioned matters are the cause for this slave of Allaah’s happiness and success until that sin will be a reason for him to enter Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A slave of Allaah performs a good deed and he continues to view it as if he has performed a favour for his Lord and is egotistic due to that good deed, and he is conceited, vain and arrogant due to the sin. So he says I did such and such action (boasting) causing to him to inherit the characteristic of pride, haughtiness and adopting an overbearing attitude.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This becomes the reason for his destruction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus if Allaah Ta’ala intends good for the needy slave He trials him with something in order to bring him down and to lower his neck in humiliation and to decrease his importance to himself. However if Allaah intended for him (the slave) anything other than good He (Allaah) would have left him alone and his vanity and pride and this is the deception which necessitates his destruction.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘al-Waabil as-Sayyib min Kalim at-Tayyib’ By Ibn al-Qayyim page 15]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center"><span style="color:#003300;">The Four Principles of &lt;&lt;You (Alone) We Worship&gt;&gt; </span><br />
<span style="color:#003300;">By Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah as-Salafi <em>-Rahimullaah-<br />
</em>From his book ‘Madarij as-Salikeen’</span><br />
<span style="color:#003300;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Four Principles</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship&gt;&gt; is built upon four principles which comprise conviction in what Allaah and His Messenger love and are pleased with from the statements of the tongue and the heart and from the actions of the heart and the limbs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Uboodiyaah</em> (servitude to Allaah) is a comprehensive title for these four levels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the real people of &lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship&gt;&gt;are the people of these four levels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the statement of the heart, it is the belief in what Allaah <em>–Subhanahu-</em>informed of about His Self, His Names and His Attributes, His Actions, His Angels and the meeting with Him; as was revealed upon the tongues of His Messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the statement of the tongue, it is information of Allaah and His Names and Attributes….etc.  Calling to and defending that, clarifying the falsity of <em>Bida’</em> -which opposes Allaah – establishing His remembrance and conveying His commands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Actions of the heart include having love for Him, reliance upon Him, turning repentantly to Him, fear of Him and hope in Him, making the <em>Deen</em> sincerely for Him, having patience upon His commands and prohibitions and upon what He has decreed, being pleased with that and with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, having obedience to Allaah and loyalty to Him, having submission for Him and humility and being subservient to him, having serenity with Him as well as other actions of the hearts whose obligation is greater than that of the actions of the limbs and whose recommended actions are more beloved to Allaah than the recommended actions of the limbs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Actions of the limbs without the actions of the hearts are either lacking in or are of little benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the actions of the limbs then they are like prayer and striving, moving one’s feet to <em>Jumu’ah</em> and the congregational prayer, helping the weak one and being good to the creation etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, &lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship&gt;&gt; is adhering to these four rulings and accepting them and &lt;&lt; and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything). &gt;&gt; Is requesting help upon these principles and having the capability to perform them. &lt;&lt;Guide us to the Straight Way&gt;&gt; consists of knowing these two matters (&lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything). &gt;&gt;) in detail, the guidance to establish them and to have the methodology of the path of the righteous in seeking Allaah with these principles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The <em>Da’wah</em> of the Prophets</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of the Messengers did indeed invite to &lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything). &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed all of them invited to the <em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah and to having sincerity of worship for Him, from the first of them to the last of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nooh <em>–alayhi sallam &#8211;</em> said to his people: &lt;&lt; ‘Worship Allaah! You have no other <em>Ilâh</em>(God) but Him.’ &gt;&gt; [al-‘Araaf: 59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as Hood, Salih, Shuaib <em>–alayhimus-salaam &#8211;</em> and Ibraheem <em>–alayhi sallam &#8211;</em> said.  Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And verily, We have sent among every <em>Ummah</em> a Messenger (proclaiming): ‘Worship Allaah (Alone) and avoid (or keep away from) <em>Tâghût</em> (all false deities, etc. i.e. do not worship <em>Tâghût </em>besides Allaah).’ &gt;&gt; [Nahl: 36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And We did not send any Messenger before you except that We inspired him (saying): <em>Lâ ilâha illa Ana </em>[none has the right to be worshipped but I (Allaah)], so worship Me (Alone and none else).’ &gt;&gt; [Anbiyaa: 25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;O (you) Messengers! Eat of the <em>Taiyibât </em>[all kinds of <em>Halâl </em>foods], and do righteous deeds. Verily! I am Well-Acquainted with what you do. And verily! This, your religion (of Islaamic Monotheism) is one religion, and I am your Lord, so keep your duty to Me. &gt;&gt; [Muminoon: 51-52]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Characteristic of <em>Uboodiyaah</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala made <em>al-Uboodiyaah</em> (servitude to Allaah) a characteristic of the most perfect of His creation and as such made them close to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;The Messiah will never be proud and reject to be a slave of Allaah, nor the Angels who are near (to Allaah). And whosoever rejects His worship and is proud, then He will gather them all together unto Himself. &gt;&gt; [Nisa’:172]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Surely, those who are with your Lord (Angels) are never too proud to perform acts of worship to Him, but they glorify His Praise and prostrate before Him. &gt;&gt; [Ara’af: 206]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this explains there being a complete stop in the saying of Allaah in Soorah Anbiyaa &lt;&lt; To Him belongs whosoever is in the heavens and on earth. &gt;&gt; Stop here  then resume reading from &lt;&lt; And those who are near Him (i.e. the angels) are not too proud to worship Him, nor are they weary (of His worship). They (i.e. the angels) glorify His Praises night and day, (and) they never slacken (to do so). &gt;&gt; [Anbiyaa: 19-20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are two complete separate sentences, i.e. indeed to Allaah belongs whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth as a slave and Angel.  Then resumed with another sentence, He said: &lt;&lt; And those who are near Him (i.e. the angels) are not too proud to worship Him &gt;&gt; i.e. that the Angels who are there are not too proud to worship Him such that they do not worship him haughtily with rejection, nor would they scorn or reject worshipping Him, nor are they (too) arrogant to worship, nor do they tire so that they become heedless of it, nor do they cease.  Rather, their worship of Allaah and their distancing Him from imperfection is the same as breathing is to the son of Adam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the first is the characteristic of the slaves of Allaah with regards to Allaah’s<em>Ruboobeeyah</em> (Lordship) and the second is the characteristic with regards to the slaves of Allaah’s <em>Ilaaheeyah</em> (Worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And the slaves of the Most Beneficent (Allaah) are those who walk on the earth in humility and sedateness &gt;&gt; [Furqan: 63] to the end of the Soorah[1].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;A spring wherefrom the slaves of Allaah will drink, causing it to gush forth abundantly. &gt;&gt; [Insaan: 6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; and remember Our slave Daawood,&gt;&gt; [Saad: 17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And remember Our slave Ayoob, &gt;&gt; [Saad: 41]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And remember Our slaves, Ibrahim, Ishaaq, and Ya’qoob &gt;&gt; [Saad: 45]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said about Sulayman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; How excellent a slave! Verily, he was ever oft-returning in repentance (to Us)! &gt;&gt; [Saad: 30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said about the Messiah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; He [‘Iesa] was no more than a slave. We granted Our Favour to him &gt;&gt; [Zukhruf: 59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah made ‘Isa’s <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> goal to be <em>Uboodeeyah</em> (servitude to Allaah) and not <em>Ilaaheeyah</em> (being worshipped), unlike what his enemies, the Christians have done.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah describes the noblest of His creation and the highest of them to Him with the status of <em>Uboodeeyah</em> (servitude to Allaah), which is the noblest of ranks.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And if you are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down to Our slave (Muhammad Peace be upon him)&gt;&gt; [Baqarah: 23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Tabaraka wa Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Blessed be He Who sent down the criterion (of right and wrong, i.e. this Qur’aan) to His slave (Muhammad) &gt;&gt; [Furqan: 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; All the praises and thanks be to Allaah, Who has sent down to His slave (Muhammad) the Book (the Qur’aan)&gt;&gt; [Kahf: 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah spoke about His slave with <em>Uboodeeyah</em> in regards to the revelation of the Book (Qur’aan) to him and likewise in regards to the challenge of bringing something similar to the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; (It has been revealed to me that) When the slave of Allaah (Muhammad) stood up supplicating to (his Lord Allaah) in prayer to Him they (the Jinns) made around him a dense crowd as if sticking one over the other (in order to listen to the Prophet’s recitation). &gt;&gt; [Jinn: 19] So Allaah mentions him with Uboodeeyah in the matter of giving Dawa’ to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Glorified (and Exalted) be He (Allaah) [above all that (evil) they associate with Him] Who took His slave for a journey by night &gt;&gt; [Isra’: 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah mentions him with <em>Uboodeeyah</em> in the matter of the night journey.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Saheeh on the authority of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> that he said: ‘Do not over praise me like the Christians over praised the son of Maryam.  Indeed I am a slave of Allaah and His Messenger.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the hadeeth: ‘I am a slave. I eat what a slave eats and sit like a slave sits.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the <em>Saheeh</em> of Bukhari on the authority of Abdullaah bin ‘Amr who said: ‘I read the description of Muhammad <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> in the Torah: Muhammad the Messenger of Allaah, My slave, My messenger, I named him al-Muttawakil, he does not have evil manners nor is he hard-hearted.  He was not one to raise his voice to compete in market places, he will not respond to evil with an evil, but he will pardon and forgive.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah – Subhanahu – gave absolute glad-tidings and signs for His worshippers, where He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; So announce the good news to My slaves, those who listen to the Word [good advice <em>Lâ ilâha ill-Allâh</em> (none has the right to be worshipped but Allaah) and Islaamic Monotheism, etc.] and follow the best thereof (i.e. worship Allaah Alone, repent to Him and avoid <em>Tâghût, </em>etc.) &gt;&gt; [Zumar: 17-18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah provided them with absolute security.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; (It will be said to the true believers of Islaamic Monotheism): My worshippers! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve, (You) who believed in Our <em>Ayaat</em>and were Muslims (i.e. who submit totally to Allaah’s Will and believe in the Oneness of Allaah – Islaamic Monotheism).&gt;&gt; [Zukhruf: 68-69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaytaan had his authority over Allaah’s slaves, specifically, cut short and he placed his authority over the one who aligned himself with him and associated partners with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; ‘Certainly, you shall have no authority over My slaves, except those who follow you of the <em>Ghâwîn</em> (<em>Mushrikûn</em> and those who go astray, etc.).&gt;&gt; [Hijr: 42]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Verily! He has no power over those who believe and put their trust only in their Lord (Allaah). His power is only over those who obey and follow him (Satan) and those who join partners with Him (Allaah) [i.e. those who are <em>Mushrikûn</em> &#8211; polytheists]. &gt;&gt; [Nahl: 99-100]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> made <em>Ihsaan</em> (perfection of worship) of<em>Uboodeeyah</em> (servitude to Allaah) the highest level of the <em>Deen</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said in the <em>hadeeth</em> of Jibraeel – when Jibraeel asked the Messenger about <em>Ihsaan</em> – ‘Worship Allaah as if you see Him, and if you do not see Him, then know that He sees you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from ‘Madarij as-Salikeen’ vol 1 p.120</p>
<hr size="1" />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] &lt;&lt; And the slaves of the Most Beneficent (Allaah) are those who walk on the earth in humility and sedateness, and when the foolish address them (with bad words) they reply back with mild words of gentleness. And those who spend the night before their Lord, prostrate and standing. And those who say: ‘Our Lord! Avert from us the torment of Hell. Verily! Its torment is ever an inseparable, permanent punishment.’ Evil indeed it (Hell) is as an abode and as a place to dwell. And those, who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor niggardly, but hold a medium (way) between those (extremes). And those who invoke not any other <em>ilâh </em>(god) along with Allaah, nor kill such life as Allaah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment. The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace; Except those who repent and believe (in Islaamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds, for those, Allaah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. And whosoever repents and does righteous good deeds, then verily, he repents towards Allaah with true repentance. And those who do not witness falsehood, and if they pass by some evil play or evil talk, they pass by it with dignity.And those who, when they are reminded of the <em>Ayât</em> of their Lord, fall not deaf and blind thereat. And those who say: “Our Lord! Bestow on us from our wives and our offspring who will be the comfort of our eyes, and make us leaders for the <em>Muttaqûn</em>“(pious) Those will be rewarded with the highest place (in Paradise) because of their patience. Therein they shall be met with greetings and the word of peace and respect. Abiding therein; excellent it is as an abode, and as a place to dwell. Say: ‘My Lord pays attention to you only because of your invocation to Him. But now you have indeed denied (Him). So the torment will be yours for ever (inseparable permanent punishment).’ &gt;&gt;[Furqan: 63-77]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#666699;">An Explanation That &lt;&lt; Guide us to the Straight Way &gt;&gt; to the End of the <em>Soorah</em> is a Refutation of the Rafidah</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">By Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah as-Salafi <em>-Rahimullaah-<br />
</em>From his book ‘Madarij as-Salikeen’</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p>The point which refutes their statement is that:</p>
<p>Allaah <em>-Subhana wa Ta’ala &#8211;</em> has divided the people into three categories:</p>
<p>1 – Those &lt;&lt;on whom You have bestowed Your Grace&gt;&gt; who are the people of <em>as-Siraat al-Mustaqeem </em>(the Straight Way), those who knew the truth and followed it.</p>
<p>2 – &lt;&lt;Those who earned Your Anger&gt;&gt; they are those who knew the truth and rejected it.</p>
<p>3 – &lt;&lt;Those who went astray&gt;&gt; they are those who were ignorant of and made mistakes in the truth.</p>
<p>So everyone who knows the truth and follows it; then he is foremost on the <em>Siraat al-Mustaqeem </em>(the Straight Way).</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the Companions <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhum</em>&#8211; of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> are more befitting of this description than the Rawafidah. This is since it is not possible that the Companions <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhum</em>&#8211; of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> were ignorant of the truth while the Rawafidah knew it, or that the Companions –<em>RadhiAllaahu anhum</em>&#8211; rejected the truth while the Rawafidah held fast to it.</p>
<p>We have indeed seen the signs showing which of the two groups are the people of truth.</p>
<p>So, we have seen the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>. They were granted victory over the lands of the<em>Kuffar</em> which then became lands of Islaam and they were granted victory over the hearts with the Qur’aan, knowledge and guidance.So, their signs show that they are the people of <em>as-Siraat al-Mustaqeem</em>.</p>
<p>However, we have seen the opposite of this with the Rafidah in every time and place. There was never ever an enemy of the Muslims, outside of the Rafidah, except that they would help them against Islaam.</p>
<p>How much evil of affliction and calamity did they inflict upon Islaam and its people?</p>
<p>Did the swords of the <em>Mushrikeen</em>, the idol-worshippers -from the military of Hulakoo (Ghengis Khan) and those who were with him from the Tartars – not wreak havoc except under the leadership of the Rafidah?</p>
<p>Were the <em>Masajid</em> not destroyed and <em>Musaahif</em> (Qur’aans) not burnt, the leaders of the Muslims, their scholars, their worshippers and their <em>Khaleefah</em> not killed except due to the Rafidah and their foolish followers?</p>
<p>Their support for the <em>Mushrikeen</em> and the Christians is well-known amongst the learned and lay people and their influence in the <em>Deen</em> is well-known.</p>
<p>So which of the two groups has more right to the <em>Siraat al-Mustaqeem</em> and which one of them has earned the right to anger and misguidance if you do but know?</p>
<p>This is why the Salaf explained that the <em>Siraat al-Mustaqeem</em> and its people are Abu Bakr, Umar and the Companions <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhum</em>&#8211; ofAllaah’s Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and its <em>Tafseer</em> is just as they said. This is because the Siraat (Path) that they were upon was their path, the exact, same path of their Prophet. They were the onesupon whom Allaah bestowed His Grace while He was Angry with their enemies and He ruled that their enemies were upon misguidance.</p>
<p>Abul-Aaliyah Rufeea’ ar-Reeyahee- and al-Hasan al-Basaree – from the most noble of the <em>Tabi’een</em> said:</p>
<p>‘<em>As-Siraat al-Mustaqeem</em> is the Messenger of Allaah &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>and his two Companions.’</p>
<p>Abul Aaliyah also said about the saying of Allaah ﭽ ﭫ ﭬ ﭭ ﭮ ﭼ &lt;&lt;The Way of those on whom You have bestowed Your Grace &gt;&gt; ‘they are the family of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>Abu Bakr and Umar.’</p>
<p>That is the truth as his family, Abu Bakr and Umar were upon one way and there was no difference between them, they had loyalty towards one another. The Companions praised Abu Bakr and Umar and waged war against those who warred against these two and there is safety for the one who honours these two. This is well-known amongst the Ummah, to both the learned and the layperson.</p>
<p>Zayd bin Aslam said: ‘Those on whom Allaah has bestowed His Grace; they are the Messenger of Allaah &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> Abu Bakr and Umar.’</p>
<p>There is no doubt that those who are blessed are those who follow the Messenger.</p>
<p>As for those who have anger upon them, then they are those who do not follow him.</p>
<p>Those who followed and obeyed the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>from the <em>Ummah</em>, were his Companions and his family.</p>
<p>Those who followed the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> the most from his Companions; who were regarded as his sight and hearingwere Abu Bakr and Umar.</p>
<p>Those who are the severest in opposition to the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> are the Rafidah. Their opposition to him is well-known amongst all the sects of the <em>Ummah</em>.</p>
<p>This is why the Rafidah hate the Sunnah and its people, they have enmity towards it and its people so, they are the enemies of his &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> Sunnah.</p>
<p>The Messenger’s &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> family and those from their children who follow them are perfect heirs, rather they are his true heirs.</p>
<p>So it becomes clear that the <em>Siraat al-Mustaqeem </em>is the path of the Messenger’s &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> Companions and his followers.</p>
<p>The path of the people who have the Anger of Allaah upon them and are upon misguidance, is the path of the Rafidah.</p>
<p>In this exact, same way the Khawarij are refuted, since their enmity towards the Companions is well known.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">By  Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah as-Salafi <em>-Rahimullaah-<br />
</em>From his book ‘Madaarij as-Saalikeen’ </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<em>Al-Hayaa</em> (modesty) is divided into 10 subdivisions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Hayaa Jinayah</em> (the shamefulness of committing a crime), <em>Hayaa Taqseer</em> (the shamefulness of deficiency), <em>Hayaa Ijlaal</em> (the modesty regarding the magnificence of Allaah), <em>Hayaa Karm</em> (modesty in being hospitable), <em>Hayaa Hishmaa</em> (shyness in personal matters), <em>Hayaa Istissghar lilnafs </em>(modesty and humbling one’s soul), <em>Hayaa Muhabbah</em> (bashfulness of love), <em>Hayaa Uboodeeyah </em>(shyness in worship), <em>Hayaa Sharaf wa Izzah</em> (being ashamed of his own nobility and honour) and <em>Hayaa</em> (being shy) of one who is modest from his own self.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <em>Al-Hayaa</em> (the shamefulness) of committing a crime:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this is the <em>Hayaa</em> of Aadam <em>-alaihi salam-</em> when he fled in Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> said ‘Are you escaping from Me O Aadam?’ he answered: ‘No, my Lord rather being ashamed in front of You.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. <em>Hayaa Taqseer</em> (the shamefulness of deficiency):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is like the <em>Hayaa</em> of the Angels who glorify Allaah day and night and do not disobey Him and when the Day of Judgment comes they say ‘You (O Allaah) are far from imperfection and we did not truly carry out Your worship.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. <em>Hayaa Ijlaal</em> (modesty regarding the magnificence of Allaah):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>Hayaa</em> is of having knowledge, it is the level of knowledge a slave has of his Lord – then the level of his <em>Hayaa</em> in this, will be in accordance to his level of knowledge of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. <em>Hayya Karm</em> (modesty in being hospitable):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like the <em>Hayya</em> of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>from the people when they called him to the <em>Walima</em> (wedding party) of Zainab and they sat with him for a very long time and he stood up and was shy from telling them to leave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. <em>Hayaa Hishmaa</em> (Shyness regarding personal matters):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like the <em>Hayya</em> of Ali bin Abi Taalib <em>-radiAllaah anhu &#8211;</em> in asking the Prophet regarding the discharge/wetness a man feels when being aroused, due to the status of the Prophet’s <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>daughter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. <em>Hayaa Istissghar lilnafs</em> (modesty and humbling one’s soul):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like the <em>Hayaa</em> of the slave of Allaah from His Lord when he asks Him for his needs, whereby he realizes that he is so needy and is humbled by it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There could be two reasons for this type of <em>Hayaa</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) The questioner regards himself as small and insignificant and regards his sins as great in number.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b) He (the questioner) regards the One he is asking (Allaah) as Great.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. <em>Hayaa Muhabbah</em> (bashfulness of love):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the <em>Hayaa</em> of the one who loves when he remembers what he feels for his beloved, to such an extent that if this feeling occurs to him in the absence of his beloved then it stimulates the <em>Hayaa</em> in his heart and reaches his face (bashfulness) and he does not know why he feels this is.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. <em>Hayaa Uboodeeyah</em> (shyness in worship):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>Hayaa</em> is combined with love and fear and one witnesses that his worship of the One being worshipped (Allaah) is not good enough and the worth and value of the One being worshipped is higher and more magnificent than his worship. Thus this worship will certainly obligate his feeling shy of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. <em>Hayaa Sharaf wa Izzah</em> (being ashamed of nobility and honour):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the value and the goodness of his sacrifice, giving and goodness is less (than he is capable of) then <em>Hayaa</em> emanates from this  great and powerful soul and his soul becomes ashamed even though he has sacrificed (but it is not according to the caliber of his capability).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. As for the <em>Hayaa</em> of the person from his own self:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the <em>Hayaa</em> of the honorable, noble and lofty soul, which is not pleased with the deficiency within itself, which is(the deficiency) of being satisfied with less (goodness). So he finds himself being shy from himself to such a degree that it is as though he possesses two souls one soul feels shy from the other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the most complete type of <em>Hayaa</em>, because if a soul feels shyness from his own self then it will obviously feel a greater shyness from other than himself.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Summarised from ‘Madaarij as-Saalikeen’ vol.2 p.250-251 as collected in ‘Nadratul Na’eem’ 5/1798]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Taken from the book : </strong><strong> Tools for the Patient &amp; Provisions for the Thankful<br />
</strong>By Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad – may Allaah have mercy upon him – said: ‘Allaah <em>&#8211; Subhanahu   &#8211;</em> mentions <em>Sabr</em> (patience) in the Qur’aan in 90 places.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we will mention the different types of Ayaat where <em>Sabr</em>(patience) is mentioned, and <em>Sabr</em> is of many types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1)</strong>The command of having patience. As in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>And endure patiently, for your patience is not but from Allah</em>))[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>So wait  patiently for the command of your Lord</em>))[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2</strong>) The prohibition of what opposes patience. Like in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>A</em><em>nd be in no haste about them (Unbelievers).</em>))[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>So do not become weak, nor be sad</em>))[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying: ((<em>And be not like the Companion of the Fish</em>))[5]  and in brief, having patience with everything He has prohibited, since it opposes patience, which He has commanded us to have.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3)</strong> Attaching success to patience. As in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>O you who believe! Endure and be more patient, and guard your territory by stationing army units permanently at the places from where the enemy can attack you, and fear Allah so that you may be successful.</em>))[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He attached success to all of these matters together.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4)</strong> Notification that the reward is multiplied for the patient ones, more than the other people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>T</em><em>hese will be given their reward twice over, because of what  they were  patient with</em>))[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>Only those who are patient shall receive their rewards in full, without reckoning</em>))[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sulayman bin al-Qasim said: ‘The reward for every action is known, except the reward for patience.  Allaah Ta’ala said: ((<em>Only those who are patient shall receive their rewards in full without reckoning</em>)).[9]  Then Sulayman said: ‘like a heavy rain fall.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>5)</strong> Linking patience with leadership in the <em>Deen</em> and with having<em>Yaqeen</em> (certainty), Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>And We made from among them (children of Israel) leaders, giving guidance under Our command, when they were patient and used to believe in Our Ayaat</em>.))[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So with patience and certainty, leadership is achieved in the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>6)</strong> Allaah makes them victorious, by Allaah <em>&#8211; Subhanahu-</em> being with them.  He Ta’ala said: ((<em>Surely, Allah is with those who are patient</em>)).[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu ‘Alee ad-Daqaaq said: ‘The <em>Sabiroon</em> (patient ones) are victorious and have honour in both worlds, since they have been told that Allaah is with them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>7)</strong> That Allaah Ta’ala has combined three matters for the <em>Sabiroon</em>which He did not gather for anyone other than them. They are that Allaah gives the Salaat upon them (i.e. those who are blessed &amp; will be forgiven) from Himself, and gives them mercy from Himself, and He gives them guidance from Himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>But give glad tidings to those who are patient. Who when afflicted with calamity say: “Truly! To Allaah we belong and to Him we shall return. “They are those on whom are the Salaawat (who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and they are those who receive His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided ones.</em>))[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the Salaf said – the patient person is honoured according to the affliction that he has been given – ‘What is wrong with me that I am not patient, and indeed Allaah has promised me three characteristics for being patient, and every one of these characteristics is better than the world and everything in it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>8)</strong> Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> made <em>Sabr</em> as an aid and a tool, and He commanded us to take assistance with <em>Sabr</em>, and He said: ((<em>And</em><em> seek help in patience and prayer</em>))[13] so whoever has no <em>Sabr,</em> has nothing to help him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>9)</strong> Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> attached victory to patience and piety, Allaah Ta’ala said: ((<em>Yes, if you hold on to patience and piety, and the enemy comes rushing at you; your Lord will help you with five thousand angels having distinctive marks</em>))[14] this is why the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘and know that victory comes with patience.’[15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>10</strong>) Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> made patience and piety a great form of protection from the deception of the enemy and his evil planning. So the slave does not request a form of protection greater than patience and piety.  Allaah Ta’ala said: ((<em>But if you remain patient and become pious, not the least harm will their cunning do to you</em>))[16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>11)</strong> Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> said that His Angels send their salaams upon those who have patience, in Paradise.  Like He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>And the angels shall enter unto them from every gate saying: Salamun Alikum for what you were patient with!  Excellent indeed is the final home</em>.))[17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>12)</strong> That Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> allows the patient people to punish the enemy for what they, the enemy, afflict upon them, and then Allaah swears, stressing an oath with utmost emphasis, that being patient is better for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>And if you punish your enemy, then punish them with the like of that with which you were afflicted.  But if you endure patiently, verily, it is better for those who are patient</em>.))[18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So ponder over this oath which uses [some of the words, which show great emphasis in the Arabic language, (Translators note)] in the answer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>13</strong>) That Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> has prepared forgiveness and a great reward for patience and good actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He said : ((<em>Except  those who show patience and do  righteous good deeds, for them is forgiveness and a great reward</em> ))[19] and Allaah has exempted these patient ones, from those despised types of humans who are characterized with despair and disbelief when they are afflicted, and with delight and pride when they receive a blessing.  There is no escape from this despised character except with patience and good actions, just like forgiveness and a great reward cannot be acquired except with patience and good actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>14)</strong> That Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> made <em>Sabr</em> for afflictions from the things He had determined, meaning that from those things that are determined are the most noble and the most honoured, and Allaah said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>And verily, whosoever shows patience and forgives, that would truly be from the things recommended by Allaah</em>))[20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Luqman said to his son: ((<em>Enjoin what is good and forbid what is wrong, and bear with patience whatever befalls you.  Verily, these are some of the important commandments ordered by Allaah with no exception</em>))[21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>15)</strong> Allaah promised the believers victory and success. This is His word, which He told them previously and it is a beautiful word, and He informs them that they can only achieve this victory and success with patience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>And the fair word of your Lord was fulfilled for the children of Israel, because of their endurance</em>))[22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>16)</strong> Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> linked His love with patience and He made it for the patient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>And many a Prophet fought (in Allaah’s way) and along with him (fought) large bands of religious learned men.  But they never lost heart for that which befell them in Allaah’s way, nor did they weaken or degrade themselves. And Allaah loves those who are patient.</em>))[23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>17</strong>) That Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> informs us about a good characteristic and it is not attained except by the patient, and He mentions this in two places in His Book : in <em>Soorat al-Qassas</em> about the story of Qaroon, and those who were given knowledge said to those who wished they had what they had been given :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(( <em>Woe to  you! The reward of Allah (in the Hereafter) is better for those who believe and do  righteous good deeds, and this none shall attain except those who are patient</em>))[24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in <em>Soorat Ha-Mim Sajda</em>, where the slave is commanded to repel evil with that which is better than it, so if he does this, then he will become closer with the one with whom he had enmity as if he was a close and beloved friend, then Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>But none is granted such goodness except those who are patient, and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion (of the happiness in the Hereafter</em>).))[25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>18)</strong> Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> informs us that indeed those who benefit from His <em>Ayaat</em>, and He admonishes them with these <em>Ayaat</em>, are the patient and thankful people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said: ((<em>And indeed We sent Moses with Our Ayaat “Bring out your people from the darkness into light, and remind them of the Days of Allah.” Truly, in this there are signs for every patient, thankful person.</em>))[26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Ta’ala said about Luqman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>Do you not see the ships sail through the sea by the grace of Allah? That He may show you His signs? Verily in this are signs for every patient, grateful person</em>.))[27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He Ta’ala said regarding the story of Saba:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>So We made them as tales (in the land), and We dispersed them all, totally. Verily, in this are signs for every steadfast, grateful person.</em>))[28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>And among His signs are the ships, in the sea, like mountains. If He Wills, He can cause the wind to cease, and then they would become motionless on the back (of the sea).  Verily in this are signs for everyone who is patient and grateful</em>.))[29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are four places in the Qur’aan which indicate that those who benefit from the <em>Ayaat</em> of the Lord are the patient and thankful people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>19)</strong> That Allaah Ta’ala commended His slave Ayyoob with the best of praise due to his patience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>Truly We found him patient. How excellent a slave! Verily, he was ever oft-turning in repentance (to Us)</em>!)).[30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He called Ayyoob an excellent slave, by knowing that he was a patient person, and this indicates that the person who does not have patience when he is afflicted by trials is indeed a wretched slave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>20)</strong> Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> gave a verdict of loss, as a general verdict about everyone who does not believe, and they are not from the people of <em>Haqq</em> (truth) and patience.  This shows that no one benefits except the people upon the truth and with patience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said: ((<em>By ‘Al-Asr’ (the Time).  Verily! Man is in loss. Except those who believe and do righteous good deeds, and recommend one another to the truth and recommend one another with patience</em>.))[31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Shafiee said: ‘If all the people ponder over this <em>Ayaah</em> it would suffice them.’ This is why the perfection of a slave is in the perfection of his sustenance: the sustenance of knowledge and the sustenance of good actions, and they are <em>Imaan</em> and righteous actions.  And just as the slave needs to perfect himself, he also needs to perfect others than himself, and that is done with advising with the truth and advising with patience, and the basis for this and its foundation and the trunk upon which it stands is indeed <em>Sabr</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>21)</strong> Allaah singled out the people of the right hand in that they are the people of patience and compassion. They are characterized as such due to their having these two characteristics, and that they advise others with these characteristics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>Then he became one of those who believed, and recommended one another to perseverance and patience, and also recommended one another to mercy and compassion.  They are those on the Right Hand (the dwellers of Paradise)</em>.))[32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is restricted to the people of the right hand who have these two characteristics.  People in comparison to these two characteristics are of four types: those who have these two characteristics are the best of these four types; the evilest type is the one who does not have any patience nor does he have any mercy; the type that follows next is he who has patience but no mercy; then after them is the fourth type who has mercy and compassion, but has no patience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>22)</strong> Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> linked <em>Sabr </em>with the ‘<em>Arkaan</em> (pillars) of Islaam and with all the aspects of <em>Imaan</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He linked patience with <em>Salah</em> (prayer), like in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>And</em><em> seek help in patience and prayer</em>))[33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He linked patience with general good deeds, like His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>Except those who show patience and do righteous good deeds, for them is forgiveness and a great reward</em>))[34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He linked it to piety. Like His saying: ((<em>Verily</em><em>, he who fears Allaah with obedience to Him and is patient.</em>  ))[35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He linked it to being thankful. Like His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>Truly, in this there are signs for every patient, thankful person</em>.))[36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He attached patience to the truth.  Like His saying: ((<em>And recommend one another to the truth and recommend one another with patience</em>))[37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He linked it with mercy. Like His saying: ((<em>And recommended one another to perseverance and patience, and also recommended one another to mercy and compassion</em>))[38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He linked it with <em>Yaqeen</em> (certainty). Like His saying: ((<em>When they were patient and used to believe in Our Ayaat</em>))[39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He linked patience to truthfulness.  Like in His saying: ((<em>The men and women who are truthful, the men and women who are patient</em>.))[40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He made patience as a reason for His love, and His closeness and His victory, and His help and His good reward. Just some of these characteristics are sufficient as a honour and a favour, and Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from the book: <strong>Tools for the Patient &amp; Provisions for the Thankful<br />
</strong>By Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Imaan</em> is of two halves; half is patience (<em>Sabr</em>) and half is being thankful (<em>Shukr</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">More than one from amongst the <em>Salaf</em> said: ‘Patience is half of<em>Imaan</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullaah bin Masood <em>&#8211; radi Allaahu anhu –</em> said: ‘<em>Imaan</em> is of two halves: half is patience and half is gratitude.’<br />
This is why Allaah <em>– Subhanahu –</em> combines patience and being thankful in His saying: &lt;&lt;<em>Truly, in this there are signs for every patient, thankful person.</em>&gt;&gt;[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allaah has mentioned in the verses of soorat Ha Mim ‘Ain Seen Qaaf 33, and soorat Saba 19, and in soorat Luqman 31.  Indeed there are considerations which have been mentioned for these classifications of patience and gratitude:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Consideration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That <em>Imaan</em> is a definition for all sayings, actions and intentions. And this is divided into two divisions: performing righteous actions and leaving prohibitions; so doing an action is obedience to Allaah and that is the reality of <em>Shukr</em>. Leaving a prohibition is being patient in keeping away from sins, and all of the <em>Deen</em> is about these two aspects: doing that what you have been commanded to do, and leaving what you have been commanded to leave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second Consideration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That <em>Imaan</em> is built upon two pillars: <em>Yaqeen</em> (certainty), and <em>Sabr</em>(patience). They are two pillars that are mentioned in His <em>Ta’ala</em>’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<em>And We made from among them (Children of Israel), leaders, giving guidance under Our Command, when they were patient and used to believe with certainty in Our Ayaat</em>&gt;&gt;[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So with <em>Yaqeen</em>, the reality of commands and prohibitions is known, and the reality of reward and punishment is also known.  With patience commands are carried out, and patience also stops a person from doing that which he has been prohibited from.  He will not achieve true faith in fulfilling commands and keeping away from prohibitions, knowing these commands and prohibitions are from Allaah, nor will he achieve true faith of reward and punishment, except with <em>Yaqeen</em> (certainty).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not possible for the slave to remain steadfast upon carrying out commands, and stopping oneself from prohibitions except with patience, therefore patience becomes half of <em>Imaan</em>, and the second half of <em>Imaan</em> is being thankful, by carrying out what he has been commanded with, and leaving that which he has been prohibited from.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Third Consideration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Imaa</em>n is sayings and actions.  Sayings of the heart, and sayings of the tongue.  Actions of the heart, and actions of the limbs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The explanation of this is: whoever knows Allaah with his heart, and does not affirm it with his tongue then he cannot be a believer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allaah said concerning the people of Pharaoh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <em>And they belied the Ayaat, wrongfully and arrogantly, though they themselves were convinced thereof [i.e. those (Ayaat) are from Allaah]</em> &gt;&gt;[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And like wise, Allaah said concerning the people of ‘Aad and the people of Salih :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<em>And ‘Ad and Thamûd (people)! And indeed (their destruction) is clearly apparent to you from their (ruined) dwellings. Shaytan made their deeds fair seeming to them, and turned them away from the Right Path, though they were intelligent.</em> &gt;&gt;<em><strong>[4]</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Musa said to Pharaoh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(( <em>Musa  said: “Verily, you know that these signs have been sent down by none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth as clear evidences</em> ))<em><strong>[5]</strong></em><em>.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these people achieved the sayings of the heart: which are <em>al-Ma’rifah</em> (knowing) and <em>‘ilm</em> (knowledge), but despite this they were not regarded as believers.  Also, the person who says with his tongue that which is not in his heart is not regarded as a believer, but rather he is regarded as being from the hypocrites.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, the one who knows with his heart and affirms it with his tongue is not regarded as a believer with just that, until he performs actions of the heart from love and hate, friendship and hostility; so he loves for Allaah and His Messenger, and he has loyalty to the<em>‘Aawliyah </em>(friends) of Allaah and he shows enmity to the enemies of Allaah, and he submits his heart to Allaah Alone.  Submitting oneself to following His Messenger and obedience to Him (Allaah), and adhering to His <em>Sharia’</em> externally and internally, and if he does this, it is not sufficient for him to have complete <em>Imaan</em> until he does that what he has been commanded with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these four <em>‘Arkaan </em>(pillars) are the <em>‘Arkaan</em> of <em>Imaan </em>upon which<em>Imaan</em> is built, and it is: going back to knowledge and action, and abstaining from that which is prohibited, which is also regarded as action. Both knowledge and action cannot be achieved except with patience, so <em>Imaan</em> becomes two halves: one of which is patience, and the other which is the result of this patience, is knowledge and action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fourth Consideration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The soul has two forces: a driving force, and a restraining force, and the soul is always going back and forth between the rules of these two forces; driven towards that which it loves, and abstaining from that which it dislikes.  The whole of the <em>Deen</em> is based upon, motivating oneself and abstaining.  Motivation towards obedience, and abstention from sinning against Allaah. It is not possible to achieve any of these except by patience</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fifth Consideration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The whole of the <em>Deen</em> is hope and fear, so the believer is one who has hope and fear.  Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> said: &lt;&lt;<em>Verily, they used to hasten on to do good deeds, and they used to call on us in hope and in fear</em>&gt;&gt;[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in  the supplication at the time of going to sleep, which Bukhari narrated in his ‘<em>Saheeh</em>’: ‘O Allaah, indeed I have submitted my self to You, and directed my face towards You, and entrusted my matters to You.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So you will never find a believer except that he is one who has hope and fear.  Hope and fear are not established except on the stalk of patience, so fear encourages him to be patience and hope steers him towards being thankful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Sixth Consideration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That everything that a slave is exposed to in this world, does not exclude that which will benefit him in this world and in the Hereafter, or that which will harm him in this world and in the Hereafter, or that which will benefit him in one of these two places, and harm him in the other.  The noblest types of action that a person does are those that benefit him in the Hereafter, and he leaves the other world and leaves that which will harm him in it, and this is the reality of <em>Imaan</em>.  Hence the action that benefits him is<em>Shukr</em> (thankfulness), and leaving that which harms him is patience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Seventh Consideration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That a slave cannot separate himself from an action that he does, nor a prohibition that he leaves, and destiny overtakes him.  He has an obligation of three things, patience and thankfulness.  So fulfilling that which you have been commanded to do is <em>Shukr</em> (thankfulness) and leaving prohibitions and being patient with your destiny, is patience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Eighth Consideration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the slave consists of two aspects which call him: an invitation that calls him to the <em>Duniya</em> and its worldly desires and delights.  And an invitation that calls him to Allaah and the Hereafter, and that which has been prepared in it for the <em>‘Aawliyah</em>of Allaah from amongst its everlasting blessings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the rebel of worldly passions and desires is <em>Sabr</em>, and that which responds to Allaah and the Hereafter is <em>Shukr</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Ninth Consideration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Deen</em> revolves around two fundamental principles: determination and perseverance. These are two principles which are mentioned in the hadeeth which has been narrated by Ahmad and an-Nisaee on the authority of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> ‘O Allaah verily I ask of You perseverance in my affairs, and determination in conduct.[7]<br />
The foundation of <em>Shukr</em> is the correctness of resolve, and the foundation of <em>Sabr</em> is the force of perseverance, so when a slave is supported with determination and perseverance, then he has indeed been supported with assistance and capability.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Tenth Consideration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the <em>Deen</em> is built upon two foundations: Truth and patience, and both are mentioned in the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<em>And they advise one another to the truth, and recommend one another with patience</em><em>.</em>&gt;&gt;[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what it is required of the slave is to do actions truthfully with in himself, and implementing them amongst the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is the reality of <em>Shukr</em>, which is not possible for the slave unless he is patient upon it, and in doing that <em>Sabr</em> becomes half of<em>Imaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211;<em>Subhanahu Ta’ala-</em> knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;" align="center">‘Miftah dar as-Sa’ada’<br />
(Key to the land of happiness)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center">By Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Knowledge &amp; Ignorance are not equal</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the excellence of knowledge and the people of knowledge, Allaah <em>– Subhana wa Ta’aala –</em> negated equality between the people of knowledge and other than them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just like He negated equality between, the companions of Paradise and the companions of the Hell-fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Ta’aala</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; <strong>Say: “Are those who know equal to those who know not?</strong>” &gt;&gt; [ Zumar :9 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; <strong>Not equal are the dwellers of the Fire and the dwellers of the Paradise</strong> &gt;&gt; [ Hashr :20 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates the elevated excellence of the people of knowledge and their distinguished nobility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Vol 1 /11/221</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Wisdom is knowledge</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Ta’aala</em> testifies for the one who, has been given knowledge, that He has given him lots of good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Ta’aala</em> said: &lt;&lt;<strong> He grants <em>Hikmah </em>to whom He pleases, and he, to whom<em>Hikmah </em>is granted, is indeed granted abundant good</strong>&gt;&gt; [ Baqarah :269 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qootayba and the majority of the scholars said: Wisdom is to be on the truth and to act upon it, and that is beneficial knowledge and good actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Vol 1/26/227</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Knowledge is the Greatest Blessing</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Ta’aala</em> has given numerous blessings to His Messenger, and has given him excellence.  Allaah <em>Ta’aala</em> has made the greatest blessing that He gave to him the Book and <em>Hikmah </em>(wisdom).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah taught him that which he did not know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Ta’aala</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; <strong>Allaah has sent down to you the Book and <em>Al­-Hikmah </em>and taught you that which you did not know. And Ever Great is the Grace of Allaah unto you</strong> &gt;&gt; [Nisa: 113]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Vol 1 / 27 / 227<strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Blessing of knowledge obligates thankfulness to Allaah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Ta’aala</em> reminded His believing slaves with this blessing, and He commanded them to be thankful for it, and that they should remember Him, for the blessings He bestowed to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Ta’aala</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; Similarly, We have sent among you a Messenger of your own, reciting to you Our Verses and sanctifying you, and teaching you the Book and the <em>Hikmah </em> and teaching you that which you did not used to know. Therefore remember Me, I will remember you, and be grateful to Me and never be ungrateful to Me. &gt;&gt; [ Baqarah : 151-152 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Vol 1 / 28 / 227</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Knowledge is Goodness in this World</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan said regarding “the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’aala</em> &lt;&lt; “<strong>Our Lord! Give us in this world that which is good!</strong>” &gt;&gt; [ Baqarah: 201]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is knowledge and worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And regard Allaah’s saying &lt;&lt;<strong>and in the Hereafter that which is good</strong>&gt;&gt; [ Baqarah : 201 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is Paradise.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is from the best explanations of this <em>Ayaah</em> indeed the greatest of the goodness of this world, is beneficial knowledge and good actions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah<br />
Taken from ‘Miftah dar as-Sa’ada’ (key to the land of happiness)<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying of Allaah Ta’ala :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>((By <em>Al-‘Asr</em> (the time). Verily! Man is in loss, except those who believe and do righteous good deeds, and recommend one another to the truth and recommend one another to patience.))</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shafiee – may Allaah be pleased with him – said: ‘If all the people reflected over this <em>Soorah</em> it would be sufficient for them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The explanation of this is that this <em>Soorah</em> has four levels, and by completing these, a person can achieve the highest goal in being complete.</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>The first is: Knowing the truth.</li>
<li>The second: his acting upon the truth.</li>
<li>The third: Him teaching the one who is deficient in the truth.</li>
<li>The fourth: Being patient in learning the truth, and acting upon it, and teaching it.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> mentioned these four levels in this <em>Soorah</em>, and Allaah<em>Subhanahu</em> testified in this <em>Soorah</em> by al-Asr (the time) that everyone is in loss, except those who believe and do righteous, good deeds and they are those who knew the truth, and they testified to the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the above is a level.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They did righteous, good deeds and they are those who performed worship with what they knew about the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a level.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They advise with the truth; they advise one another, teaching and guiding each other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the third level.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They advise with patience; they were patient with the truth, and they advised each other with patience upon the truth, and to be steadfast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is the fourth level.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the end of completeness; indeed completeness is that a person is complete in himself, and completes others.  His completeness is by correcting his two strengths, the strength of knowledge and the strength of actions.  Correction of the strength of knowledge is with <em>Emaan</em>, and correction of the strength of actions is by doing righteous deeds, and by completing people other than himself, and by learning this knowledge, and being patient upon it, and his recommending with patience upon knowledge and action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this <em>Soorah</em>, even though it is brief, is one of the most collective soorahs of the Qur’aan for goodness from all its different angles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allaah Who has made the Qur’aan sufficient for everything, a cure from every disease, a guidance to all that is good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">By Shaykhul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah as-Salafi <em>-Rahimullaah-<br />
</em>Translated &amp; Compiled  by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;The Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wasallam –</em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">ذَاقَ طَعْمَ الإيمانِ : مَنْ رَضِيَ بالله ربًّا، وبالإسلام دينًا، وبمحمَّدٍ رَسُولاً</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘The <strong>sweetness of <em>Eemaan</em></strong> has been tasted by he, whomever is pleased with Allaah as a Lord, Islaam as a religion and Muhammad as a Messenger.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[Collected by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">مَنْ قَالَ حِيْنَ يَسْمَعُ النِّدَاءَ رَضِيتُ بِاللَّهِ رَبًّا، وَبِمُحَمَّدٍ رَسُولاً، وَبِالإِسْلاَمِ دِينًا. غُفِرَ لَهُ ذَنْبُهُ</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;Whoever says, when he hears the call to prayer, I am pleased with Allaah as a Lord, Muhammad as a Messenger and Islaam as a religion, then his sin will be forgiven.&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[Collected by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The levels of the religion revolve around these two <em>Ahadeeth</em> and they end with these.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed these two <em>Ahadeeth</em> include being pleased with the <strong><em>Ruboobeeyah</em> </strong>(Lordship) of Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em>, and His <strong><em>Ulooheeyah</em> </strong>(worshipping Him), being <strong>pleased</strong> with His Messenger and having <strong>obedience</strong> to him, and being <strong>pleased</strong> with Allaah&#8217;s religion and having <strong>submission</strong> to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever has these <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>four aspects</strong></span> combined, then he truly is a <strong><em>Siddeeq</em> </strong>(truthful) person. It is an easy claim and statement to say, but it is from the most difficult matters in reality and in being tested, especially if what occurs opposes the desires of the soul and the intent of that becomes clear that being pleased was stated with just the tongue, so it was upon the tongue and not with ones actions.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Therefore, being pleased with Allaah&#8217;s <strong><em>Ieelaheeya</em> </strong>(meaning the One who is worshipped):</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">includes being pleased with loving Him alone, being fearful of Him, having hope in Him, and turning repentantly to Him, and having devotion for Him,  andstrength of intention and having all love for Him,  the person being pleased does everything to please his beloved, and this includes His worship and having sincerity for Allaah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Being pleased with His Ruboobeeyah (Lordship):</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This includes being pleased with what Allaah has planned and disposed for His slave. Being pleased with Allaah&#8217;s <em>Ruboobeeyah</em> also includes singling Allaah out alone for having trust and reliance upon Him, and seeking assistance with Him, trusting Him, having reliance upon Him, and that a person is pleased with everything that Allaah does to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first: includes being pleased with what He commands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second: includes being pleased with what He destined for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many people who are pleased with Allaah as a Lord and they do not desire any other Lord except Him, however, they are not pleased with Him with being the only <em>Wali</em> (Guardian) and being the only Helper. But they have loyalty to <em>Awaliyah</em> other than Allaah, thinking that they are bringing you closer to Allaah, and that being loyal to them is like being loyal to those who are close to the king, and this is specific Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Tawheed is that a person does not take any one other than Allaah as an <em>Awaliyah</em>, and the Qur&#8217;aan is full of the description of the <em>Mushrikeen</em> that they took <em>Awaliyah</em> other than Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is not the loyalty that one has for Allaah&#8217;s Prophets, His Messengers and His believing slaves, since this is from the completion of <em>Eemaan</em> to have loyalty to His Prophets, and this is in fact complete loyalty for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, having loyalty for His <em>Awaliyah</em> is one colour and taking a <em>Wali</em> other than Allaah is a different colour. Whoever has not understood the distinction and criterion between them, then he must study Tawheed from its foundation, since this issue is a foundation of Tawheed and its base principle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many people who desire to take someone other than Allaah as a judge to whom they can take their judgements to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With whom they could debate, and be pleased with his judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These three levels are the pillars of Tawheed; that none other than Allah is taken as a Lord, or as a deity and none other than Him has a command.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Being pleased with His Prophet:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for being pleased with His Prophet as a Messenger: then this includes having prefect obedience to him, and complete submission to him, whereby the Prophet &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8211; is foremost to a person than his own self.  So he does not take guidance except from the places of the Messenger&#8217;s speech,  he does not turn for a judgement except to him, and no one gives a judgement above his,  and he totally is not pleased with someone else&#8217;s judgement, not in anything from the <em>Asmaa</em> (Names) of Allaah and His characteristics and His actions, nor in anything from the perception and sense of the reality of <em>al</em> <em>Eemaan</em> and its different  levels,  nor in anything from the <em>Ahkam</em> (rulings) apparent and hidden, and a person is not pleased with a ruling regarding these things from someone other than the Messenger, and he is not pleased except with his ruling.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If however a person is incapable of following the Messenger&#8217;s judgement, then him having someone else&#8217;s judgement then this is from the view of forceful nourishment for a person who cannot find that which would sustain himself with except from dead flesh and blood.  The best that can be said about this situation is that it is like using dust, which is used for <em>Tayummum</em> (dry ablution) when a person is incapable of using water for purification.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Being pleased with His Deen (Religion):</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for being pleased with the <em>Deen</em>, so if the <em>Deen</em> says something or gives a ruling or commands or prohibits then a person should be completely pleased with it. There does not remain any opposition and resistance in his heart from its ruling, and he submits to it with total submission.  Even if it opposes what his own self intends, or his desires, or the statement of the one whom he blindly follows, or his Shaykh or his sect, this is where all the people desert you except the <em>Ghuraba</em> (those who adhere to the <em>Sunnah</em>) in this world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Beware of feeling distressed and lonely of being isolated and alone [i.e. Since the people abandon you for holding on to the Sunnah, being from the <em>Ghuraba</em>.]  since indeed it is -and I swear by Allaah- the distinction of honour and companionship with Allaah and His Messenger and it is the soul of being close to Allaah.  And being pleased with Allaah as a Lord, Muhammad as a Messenger and Islaam as a religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From: ‘Madarij as-Salikeen’ 2/170-172]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">The Different Wordings of the Hadeeth</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 &#8211; From Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri saying that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahualayhiwasallam–</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(مَنْ قَالَ: رَضِيتُ بِاللَّهِ رَبًّا وَبِالْإِسْلَامِ دِينًا وَبِمُحَمَّدٍ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ نَبِيًّا وَجَبَتْ لَهُ الْجَنَّةُ)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever says: ‘I am pleased with Allaah as the Lord, Islaam as the Religion and with Muhammad as the Prophet, then Paradise becomes obligatory for him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected in SilsilahSaheehah 334 &amp;Saheeh Abu Dawood 1368]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 &#8211; From Aamir bin Sa’ad bin Abee Waqas from his father from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahualayhiwasallam –</em>that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(مَنْ قَالَ حِينَ يَسْمَعُ الْمُؤَذِّنَ: وَأَنَا أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ رَضِيتُ بِاللَّهِ رَبًّا وَبِالْإِسْلَامِ دِينًا وَبِمُحَمَّدٍ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ رَسُولًا غُفِرَ لَهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِنْ ذَنْبِهِ)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever says when he hears the <em>Mu’adhin</em> (the caller to the prayer): <em>Wa Ana Ashhaduanala  </em><em>ilaha ‘illa Allaah wahdahu la shareekalahu wa Ashhaduanna Muhammadan Abduhu wa Rasooluhu Radeetu Billaahi Rabban wa BilIslaami Deenan wa Bi Muhammad </em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam Rasoolan.’</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I testify that there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah Alone and He has no partners and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger, I am pleased with Allaah as the Lord, with Islaam as the Religion and with Muhammad as the Messenger’) Then his previous sins are forgiven.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected in Saheeh Abu Dawood 537]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 &#8211; From al-Munaydhir a Companion of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and he used to be in Africa who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – </em>say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">من قال إذا أصبح :&#8221; رضيت بالله ربا و بالإسلام دينا و بمحمد نبيا &#8220;،فأناالزعيم لآخذن بيده حتى أدخله الجنة</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever says in the morning: ‘I am pleased with Allaah as the Lord, Islaam as the Religion and with Muhammad as the Prophet,’ then I am a guarantor that I will indeed definitely take him by his hand until I can enter him in to Paradise.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected in At-Targheeb by al-Mundhari, Tabarani &amp; Albaani in Silsilah Saheehah 2686 and he said the Hadeeth is <em>Thaabit</em> (Established)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Ayni said in his explanation of Abu Dawood:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the Messenger’s saying: ‘I am pleased with Allaah as the Lord’ means: I am convinced by Him, He is sufficient for me, and I do not require anyone along with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the Messenger’s saying:  ‘and with Muhammad as the Prophet,’ means: that I am content with Muhammad as a Messenger to me and to all the other Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the Messenger’s saying:  ‘Islaam as the Religion’ means: I am content with Islaam as a religion, meaning I do not desire another way other than Islaam, and I do not follow except that which is in agreement with the <em>Sharia’</em> of Muhammad <em>– alayhi as-Salaam-</em> or that I do not desire other than Islaam as a <em>Deen</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[SharhAbeeDawood by al-Ayani 2/484]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Ayni continues in his explanation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is said what is the intent of the saying: ‘as a <em>Deen’</em>, I say: the meaning of <em>Deen</em> here is Tawheed; … . . as in the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ومَنيَبتَغ غَيرَ الإِسلاَم دينا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And whoever seeks a religion other than Islaam&gt;&gt;[Ala-Imran: 85]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Means: Tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the authentic <em>hadeeth</em> from Umar who said: ‘While we were with the Messenger of Allaah that day, all of a sudden a man came to visit whose clothing was exceedingly white…..’ to the end of the <em>hadeeth</em>. So here the Messenger of Allaah generalized the ‘<em>Deen’</em> upon ‘Islaam, <em>Eemaan</em> (faith) and <em>Ihsaan</em> (perfection of worship)’  due to his saying: Indeed that was Jibraeel who came to you to teach you your <em>Deen</em>.’ He taught them these three things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, sometimes the <em>Deen</em> is stated for the three things which Jibraeel <em>– Alayhi as-Salaam –</em> inquired about, and sometimes it is stated for Islaam as is in the saying of Allaah Tala’a:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">اليَومَ أكمَلتُ لَكُم دينَكُم وَأتمَمتُ عَلَيكم نعمَتيوَرَضيتُ لَكُمُ الإسلاَمَ دينا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islaam as your religion.&gt;&gt;[al-Maidah: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From: ‘SharhAbeeDawood’ by al-Ayani 2/486-7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Saying it three times is not Authentic</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Da’eef</em></strong><strong> &#8211; </strong>From Abee Salaam the servant of the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> from the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is no Muslim or human or slave who says when the morning comes and when the evening approaches, <strong>three times</strong>: ‘I am pleased with Allaah as the Lord, Islaam as the Religion and with Muhammad as the Prophet, except that it is a right upon Allaah that he will please him on the Day of Judgement.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ibn Abee Shaybah in ‘al-Musannaf’ and in ‘al-Musnad’ &amp; Albaani declared it <strong><em>Da’eef</em></strong> in Silsilah Ahadeeth ad-Da’eefah no. 5020]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Da’eef</em></strong><strong> &#8211; </strong>‘who says when the morning comes and when the evening approaches, <strong>three times</strong>: ‘I am pleased with Allaah as the Lord, Islaam as the Religion and with Muhammad as the Prophet.’ except that it is a right upon Allaah that he will please him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Albaani declared it <strong><em>Da’eef</em></strong> in ‘Da’eef al-Jamia’ as-Sagheer’ No. 5734]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation of the Meanings of the Names of the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) &#8211; Taken from &#8216;Zaad al-Ma`aad&#8217; (1/88-97) of ibn al-Qayyim, rahimahullaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillaahir-Rahmaanir-Raheem</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) has been called by many names and titles in the Qur`aan and Sunnah, each one of them describing a special quality of this exalted personality. And in understanding them and reflecting upon them, we can, by the permission of Allaah, increase in our love and following of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam). This discussion is taken from &#8216;Zaad al-Ma`aad&#8217; (1/88-97) of ibn al-Qayyim, rahimahullaah, summarised.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The names of the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) are of two types:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Those names that are specific to him and none of the Messengers before him had these names, like Muhammad, Ahmad, al-Aaqib, al-Haashir, al-Muqaffee, Nabi al-Malhama.</li>
<li>Those names and qualities that are not specific to him, and were shared by the Messengers before him, but are found in him in the most complete and perfect forms. Like: Messenger of Allaah, His Prophet, His Servant, Prophet of Mercy etc.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What follows is an explanation of some of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Muhammad</strong>: is a passive participle, whosoever is praised, possessing many praiseworthy qualities then he is muhammad. And Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) is praised more than any other person, and this is why &#8211; and Allaah knows best &#8211; he was called by this name in the Torah, due to the many praiseworthy qualities which he, his religion, and his nation possess such that even Moses wished that he would be from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ahmad</strong>: Derived, as is Muhammad, from the noun hamd (praise). A group of scholars said that it is a passive participle, meaning: his praising of Allaah is more than any other person&#8217;s praise of him, and therefore he is the most deserving of being praised and the first. So in meaning Ahmad is similar to Muhammad except that the distinction is that he is Muhammad due to his possessing many praiseworthy qualities, and he is Ahmad due to his being praised in a more excellent way than the praise of any other. And this is the most complete meaning of this word, and the most extensive in commending him (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also these two names stem from his character, and the praiseworthy qualities specific to him, and it is because of these that he is called Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and Ahmad. And he is the one who is praised by the People of the Heaven, the People of the earth, the People of the world and the People of the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Mutawakkil</strong>: (The One who puts his trust in Allaah). In the Saheeh of Bukhaaree from the hadeeth of Abdullaah bin Umru who said, &#8220;I read the description of the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) in the Torah: Muhammad is Messenger of Allaah, My servant and Messenger, I have called him al-Mutawakkil. He is neither rude nor harsh and he does not shout in the markets, and he does not return an evil for an evil, rather he overlooks and forgives. And I will not make him to die until I make firm the nation through him, causing them to say: there is none worthy of worship except Allaah.&#8221; {1}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) is the most deserving of this name, because the trust he put in Allaah to establish the religion was a trust unequalled by any other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Maahee</strong>: (the destroyer/effacer). This has been explained in the hadeeth of Jubair bin Mut`am: &#8220;al-Maahee: the one through whom Allaah destroys and effaces unbelief.&#8221; {2}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Disbelief was not destroyed and removed by any single person as completely as was done by the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam). For indeed he was sent, and all of the inhabitants of the earth were in disbelief, except for some remnants of the People of the Book. Consisting of the worshippers of idols, the Jews who had the Anger of Allaah on them, the Christians who had been misguided, the atheist Saabi`een, the worshippers of the stars and the fire, and the philosophers who did not acknowledge the laws of the Prophets. And Allaah effaced them all through His Messenger until He established His religion and made it supreme over all others, and made it spread to the extent that the night and day spreads, and made his call as the rays of the sun in the various lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Haashir</strong>: (the Gatherer). He is the one who gathered and united the people at his feet, and therefore it was as if he had been sent for this purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Aaqib</strong>: (The Last). He is the one who came at the end of the line of Prophets, and there is no prophet after him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Muqaffee</strong>: (). He is the one who was sent with the characteristics of the Messengers that had preceded him, and was their seal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Nabi at-Tawba</strong>: (the Prophet of Repentance). It was by him that Allaah opened the door of repentance for the inhabitants of the earth [by them accepting his message], and Allaah forgave them with a forgiveness that was not given to the people before him. {3}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) was the one who sought forgiveness from Allaah the most, to the extent that he would say, &#8220;My Lord forgive me and turn toward me, You are The Oft-Forgiving, The Oft-Returning&#8221; {4}, 100 times in a single sitting. And he used to say, &#8220;O people repent to Allaah, your Lord, for indeed I repent to Allaah 100 times in a day&#8221;. {5}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise the repentance of his (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) nation is more complete than the repentance of all the other nations, the most quickest in being answered, and the easiest to be obtained. For the repentance of the previous nations was of the most difficult matters, to the extent that the repentance for the worshippers of the cow amongst the People of Israa`eel was to kill those worshippers. {6} But as for this nation, then from the Kindness of Allaah to it is that he has made repentance dependant upon sorrow and abstaining (from the sin in question).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Nabi al-Malhama</strong>: (The Prophet of Slaughter). He was the one who was sent with Jihaad to the enemies of Allaah, and no prophet before him did Jihaad to the extent that the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and his nation fought Jihaad. And the like of the large wars that took place between him and the disbelievers were not seen before him. For his nation fought the disbelievers in lands to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Nabi ar-Rahma</strong>: (The Prophet of Mercy). He was the one whom Allaah sent as a Mercy for the universe. And Allaah was Merciful to all the people of the earth through him, both the believers and the disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Faatih</strong>: (the opener/conqueror). It was through him that Allaah opened the door of guidance after it had been closed, and opened closed eyes and deaf ears and sealed hearts. And through him Allaah conquered the lands of the disbelievers, and opened the doors of Paradise, and opened through him the ways of acquiring beneficial knowledge and righteous actions. And He opened through him both the doors of this world and the hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Ameen</strong>: (the Trustworthy). He is the most deserving out of all creation for this name. For he is the trustee of Allaah of His revelation and religion. And he is the trusted one in the Heaven and in the earth. And this is why he was called al-Ameen before his Prophethood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Basheer</strong>: (the Bearer of glad tidings). He is the bearer of glad tidings for the one who obeys him of reward, and he is the Warner (an-Nadheer) of the one who disobeys him of punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah called him his <strong>servant (Abd)</strong> in many places in His Book for example, &#8216;Blessed be He who revealed the Furqaan to His servant&#8217;. {7}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is established that he (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;I am the <strong>Master (sayyid) of the children of Aadam</strong> [on the Day of Judgement] and I am not being arrogant.&#8221; {8}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah called him an <strong>Illuminating Lamp (Siraaj Muneer)</strong>. And all praise is due to Allaah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From &#8220;Zâd al-Ma&#8217;âd fî Hadyi Khayri-l &#8216;Ibâd&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of the Prophet&#8217;s <i>Ghazwat</i>, <i> Bu&#8217;uth</i> and <i>Saraya</i> [1] occurred after the <i>Hijrah</i>, within a span of ten years. There were either twenty-seven <i>Ghazwat</i>, or twenty-five, or twenty-nine. The Prophet <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> had to fight in nine battles, <i>Badr</i>, <i>&#8216;Uhud</i>, <i>al-Khandaqh</i>, <i>Quraidhah</i>, <i>al-Mustaliqh</i>, <i> Khaybar</i>,<i> al-Fath&#8217;</i> (Conquering of Makkah), <i>&#8216;Hunayn</i> and <i>Tâ&#8217;if</i>. It was said that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> also fought against <i>Banî an-Nadhîr</i> (a Jewish tribe) and at <i>al-Ghabah</i> and <i>Wadi al-Qura</i>, which was a suburb of Khaybar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <i>Saraya</i> of the Prophet <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and the armies he sent, they numbered close to sixty. There were seven major battles: <i>Badr</i>, <i>&#8216;Uhud</i>, <i>al-</i><i>Khandaqh</i>, <i>Khaybar</i>, <i>al-Fath&#8217;</i>, <i>&#8216;Hunayn</i> and <i>Tabuk</i>. [2] Several parts of the Qur&#8217;ân mentioned these major <i>Ghazwat</i>. For instance, Sûrah al-Anfâl (chapter 8) was revealed about <i>Ghazwat Badr</i>, while the last part of Sûrah ali-&#8216;Imrân (chapter 3) was about <i>Ghazwat &#8216;Uhud</i>, from Allâh&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And (remember) when you [Muhammad <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i></b><b>] left your household in the morning to post the believers at their stations for the battle&#8221;</b> [3:121],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">until just before the end of the Sûrah. The beginning of Sûrah al-Ahzâb (chapter 33) was revealed about the battles of <i>al-Khandaqh</i>, <i>Quraydhah</i> and <i>Khaybar</i>. Sûrah al-&#8216;Hashr (59) was revealed about <i>Banî an-Nadhîr</i>, <i>al-Fath&#8217;</i> (48) about <i>al-&#8216;Hudaibiyyah</i> and the battle of <i>Khaybar</i>. The conquering of Makkah was mentioned indirectly in Sûrah al-Fath&#8217; and directly in Sûrah an-Nasr (110). He <i> sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was wounded during the battle of <i>&#8216;Uhud</i>. [3] The angels fought alongside the Prophet <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> during the battles of <i>Badr</i> [4] and <i>&#8216;Hunayn</i>. They also descended during the battle of <i>al-Khandaqh</i> [5], where they shook the <i>Mushriks</i> [surrounding <i>Madînah</i>] and defeated them. During that battle, the Prophet <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> threw a handful of sand at the faces of the <i>Mushriks</i> (Polytheists) and they fled [without a fight]. [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <i> sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> won decisively in two battles, <i>Badr</i> and <i>&#8216;Hunain</i>. He used <i>al-Manjaniq</i> (mongonel, or catapult) during on battle, <i>at-Tâ&#8217;if</i>, and took cover behind a trench during <i>Ghazwat al-Khandaqh</i>, also known as <i>Ghazwat al-Ahzâb</i>. Salmân al-Farsî <i>radiallâhu &#8216;anhu</i> suggested that the trench be dug in that battle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah (d.751 H), rahimahullaah 1<br />
From al-Istiqaamah magazine Shawwal 1418H/ February 1998</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O you who believe! Remember Allaah and remember Him a lot.&#8221; [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:4I]. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Those men and women who remember Allaah a lot.&#8221; [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:35]. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;So when you have finished the rights of your Pilgrimage, then remember Allaah as you remember your fore-father, or with more intense remembrance.&#8221; [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:200]. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These verses contain a command to remember Allaah intensely and abundantly, since the worshipper is in dire need of [remembering Allaah] and cannot do without it even for a twinkling of an eye. This is because every moment that a person does not spend in the dhikr (remembrance) of Allaah will not be of any benefit to him. Rather, the harm entailed in being neglectful of the dhikr of Allaah is far greater than any benefits that can be gained. One of the &#8216;aarifeen (those who are knowledgeable about Allaah) said:&#8221;If a person were to spend such and such number of years engaged [in the dhikr of Allaah], then he turns away from it for just a moment, what he will lose is far greater than whatever he has already gained.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bayhaqee relates from &#8216;Aaishah radiallaahu &#8216;anhaa that the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said: &#8220;There is no time in which the son of Aadam does not remember AIIaah in it, except that it will be a source of regret for him on the Day of Judgement&#8221; 2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mu&#8217;aadh ibn jabal radiallaahu &#8216;anhu relates that the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said: &#8220;The people of Paradise will not have any regrets except for those moments in which they were not engaged in the dhikr (remembrance) of Allaah.&#8221; 3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mu&#8217;aadh ibn Jabal also relates that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam was asked: What action is the most beloved to Allaah? So he replied: &#8220;That you continue to keep your tongue moist with the dhikr of Allaah, until you die.&#8221; 4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>POLISHING THE HEART</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dardaa radiallaahu &#8216;anhu said:&#8221;For everything there is a polish and the polish for the heart is the dhikr of Allaah&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bayhaqee relates from Ibn &#8216;Umar radiallaahu &#8216;anhu that AlIaah&#8217;s Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said: &#8220;For everything there is a polish, and the polish for the hearts is the dhikr (remembrance) of Allaah. There is nothing more potent in saving a person from the punishment of Allaah than the dhikr of Allaah.&#8221; It was said: Not even Jihaad in the path of Allaah. So he replied: &#8220;Not even if you were to continue striking with your sword until it breaks.&#8221;5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that hearts becomes rusty just as copper and silver coins become rusty. The polish for [this rust] is the dhikr of AIlaah. This is because [dhikr] is like a polish [which polishes the heart] like a shiny mirror. When dhikr is left, the rust returns. But when dhikr resumes, then the heart is [again] polished. And hearts become rusty due to two things:-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) neglecting remembering Allaah, and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) committing sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The polish for these two things is:-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) seeking Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) dhikr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>CONFUSING TRUTH WITH FALSEHOOD</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever neglects [remembering Allaah] most of the time, then his heart will become rusty in accordance with how neglectful the person is. And when this [filthy] rust accumulates on the heart, then it no longer recognises things as they really are. Thus, it views falsehood as if it is the truth, and truth as if it is falsehood. This is because this rust darkens and confuses the heart&#8217;s perception, and so it is unable to truly recognise things for what they really are. So as the rust accumulates, the heart gets blackened, and as this happens the heart becomes stained with this filthy rust, and when this occurs it corrupts the heart&#8217;s perception and recognition of things. The heart [then] does not accept the truth nor does it reject falsehood, and this is the greatest calamity that can strike the heart. Being neglectful [of dhikr] and following of whims and desires is a direct consequence of such a heart, which [further] extinguish the heart&#8217;s light and blinds its vision. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:<br />
<strong>&#8220;And do not obey him whose heart We have made to be neglectful of Our remembrance, one who follows his own whims and desires and whose affairs are furat [have gone beyond bounds and whose deeds have been lost].&#8221; [Soorah al-Kahf 18:28]. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>QUALITIES OF A GUIDE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when a worshipper desires to follow another person, then let him see: Is this person from the people of dhikr, or from the people who are negligent [about remembering Allaah]? Does this person judge in accordance with his whims and desires, or by the Revelation? So, if he judges by whims and desires then he is actually from those people who are negligent; those whose affairs have gone beyond bounds and whose deeds are lost.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The term furat [which occurs in the above verse] has been explained in many ways. It has been explained to mean:- (i) losing the rewards of that type of action which is essential to do, and in which lies success and happiness; (ii) exceeding the limits of something; (iii) being destroyed; and (iv) opposing the truth. Each of these sayings are very close in meaning to each other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point is that Allaah &#8211; the One free from all imperfections, the Most High &#8211; has prohibited following all those who possess such attributes. So it is absolutely essential that a person considers whether such attributes are found in his shaykh, or the person who&#8217;s example he follows, or the person that he obeys. If they are, then he should distance himself from such a person. However, if it is found that the person is, in most cases, pre-occupied with the dhikr of Allaah and with following the Sunnah, and his affairs do not exceed the limits, but rather he is judicious and resolute in his affairs, then he should cling to him very firmly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, there is no difference between the living and the dead, except with the dhikr of Allaah; since [the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam] said: &#8220;The example of one who remembers Allaah and someone who does not, is like the example between the living and the dead.&#8221;6</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Imaam Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyyah<br />
</span>Source:His monumental book Ad-Daa wad-Dawaa [The Sickness and the Cure] (pg.22 -23)</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;">al-ibaanah Publications</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here there occurs a <strong>very popular question</strong> and it is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">If the thing that is being supplicated for is already decreed for the servant, then there is no doubt that it is going to come to pass for him, regardless of whether he supplicates for it or not. And if it has not been decreed for him, then it will not come to pass, regardless of whether he asks Allaah for it or not.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">There is one group that perceives this question to be valid and so they have abandoned the supplication and are of the view that there is no benefit in doing it. These people, along with their excessive ignorance and misguidance are in clear contradiction, for if we were to follow their opinion, it would require us to reject all the different means for attaining something (desired).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it can be said to one of them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If satisfying your appetite and quenching your thirst were already decreed for you, then there is no doubt that they are going to come to pass, whether you eat and drink or you don&#8217;t. And if they were not decreed for you, they will not come to pass, whether you eat and drink or you don’t.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, if a child were decreed for you, then you will definitely receive it, whether you have sexual intercourse with your wife or you don&#8217;t. And if that was not decreed for you, then it will not come to pass. Thus there is no need for marrying, having sexual relations and so on and so forth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who says such a statement? Is it one possessing common sense or a beast? Rather, even the animal has a natural inclination (fitrah) towards seeking the means of attaining something (desired), which (for example) will give it sustenance and livelihood. So the animals have more common sense and possess more understanding than these types of people who are like cattle – nay, far worse!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Some of them try to be clever and say:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Preoccupying oneself with supplication falls into the realm of worship solely – Allaah will reward the one supplicating, without that having an effect on what he is asking for in any way. According to this type of person, there is no difference between supplicating and refraining from supplicating by heart and tongue, with regard to that having an effect on attaining what is being asked for. And according to them, the relation of the supplication to it (what is being asked for) is like its relation with silence. There is no difference between them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Another group, more slick than this one says:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, the supplication is a sign, which Allaah displays as a symbol that a matter has been carried out. So when Allaah grants his servant the ability to supplicate, it is a sign and a symbol that the matter he was requesting has been carried out. This is just as if one were to see a frigid black cloud during the winter season. It is a sign and an implication that it will rain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say: Similarly is enacting good deeds with respect to reward, and committing disbelief and sins with respect to punishment – they are pure signs for the occurrence of (either) reward or punishment – not means (by which the result will be attained).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, according to them, with the matters of breaking, kindling and destroying – none of these things serves as a means for the occurrence (result) of a wreck, fire and death, respectively. Nor is there any connection between those things and what results from them, other than the fact that they are normally paired together – not that one is caused due to the means of the other!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They have contradicted perceptual observation and common sense with this opinion, as well as revelation and fitrah (natural inclination), not to mention all of the other intellectual groups. Rather, those with intellects laugh at them!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The correct view:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a third category, apart from those mentioned by the questioner. And it is that <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>the decreed result is preordained along with its proper means, which lead to its occurrence. One of these means is the supplication</strong></span>. It is not preordained just like that, without any means (leading to its occurrence), rather it is preordained along with its proper means (which will ensure its occurrence). So when a person comes across the means, the decreed matter will come to pass. And if he does not come across those means, the decreed matter is denied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So satisfying one’s appetite and quenching one’s thirst are preordained with (the means of) eating and drinking. Children are preordained with (the means of) sexual intercourse. Harvesting crops is preordained with (the means of) planting and, the withdrawal of the soul from an animal is decreed with slaughter. Likewise, entrance into Paradise is preordained with (good) deeds, while entrance into the Hellfire is preordained with (bad) deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This category is the true one. And it is the one that the questioner has been deprived of and not granted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="color:#ffffff;">Tags: dua can change destiny hadith, dua can change taqdeer hadith, can dua change destiny of marriage, nothing can change the divine decree except dua, can dua change qadr islamqa, nothing can change qadr except dua</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The objective behind fasting is to restrain the soul from (its) desires and to prevent it from those things, which are beloved to it. And its purpose is to control the soul&#8217;s strength, so that it can be prepared to attain what is found in it (the fast) from success and joy for the soul. Through the fast, one curbs his hunger and thirst and is reminded of the condition of the hungry stomachs of needy people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Through fasting, one narrows the passages the Devil has inside the servant (of Allaah) by narrowing the passages of food and drink. Also, it prevents the forces of the limbs from getting too accustomed to things that are harmful to it in this world and the hereafter. And each of the soul&#8217;s body limbs and energies can cease their rebelliousness (to Allaah) and be harnessed by its bridle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, the fast is the bridle of those who fear and obey Allaah and the shield of those wage war (against desires). And it is a garden for the righteous and devoted servants of Allaah. And it is for the Lord of the worlds, over all other actions (done to please Allaah). This is since the person who fasts, in fact does nothing. He only abandons his desire and his food for the sake of the One whom he worships.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So fasting is an abandonment of those things that the soul loves and desires, preferring instead Allaah&#8217;s love and contentment. And it is a secret kept between the servant and his Lord – no one else is aware of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fasting has an amazing effect in preserving one&#8217;s outer limbs and inner capacities as well as protecting the soul from being overtaken by destructive components, which can ruin and destroy it. And it has a remarkable effect in causing all the harmful things that prevent the soul from being healthy to be emptied out. So fasting guards and protects the health of the person&#8217;s heart and body limbs. And it returns the soul all that the hands of the desires has taken from it. So it is from the greatest ways of improving one&#8217;s Taqwaa, as Allaah says: <b>&#8220;O you who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you in order that you attain Taqwaa.&#8221;</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <b>&#8220;Fasting is a shield.&#8221;</b> And he commanded those who had intense desires for marriage but were not able to marry, to observe fasting, making it a shield against those desires (of marriage).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the benefits of fasting are born witness to by sensible minds and upright intuitions, one will come to realize that Allaah prescribed it as a mercy for mankind, goodness to them and a protection and shield for them. The Prophet&#8217;s (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) guidance concerning it was the most perfect of guidance, and the best for reaching the desired objective and the easiest on the soul.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since restraining the soul from what it loves and desires is from the most difficult and hardest of things, its obligation was delayed until the middle of Islaam, after the Hijrah. This was at the point when the Tawheed and the Prayer had become firmly established in the souls of the Muslims and when they loved the commands of Allaah. So their souls were lead to its obligation in gradual steps. It became obligatory in the second year of Hijrah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) died, he had fasted nine Ramadaans in total. Originally, it was obligated as an option left to the people to choose whether they wanted to fast or to feed needy people for every day. Then that option was transferred into the final obligatory fasting. And the matter of feeding people was left only for the old men and women who did not have the ability to fast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fasting had three stages. The first stage was its being obligated with the option of fasting or feeding a needy person. In the second stage, only the fasting was allowed, but if the person fasting slept before breaking his fast, he was forbidden from eating and drinking until the following night. This was abrogated in the third stage. And this is the stage at which the Religion has settled with until the Day of Judgement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam <strong>Ibnul-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah</strong> (d.751H)<br />
Source : Kitaabur-Rooh<em> (p. 44)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The soul (<i>ar-rooh</i>) is connected to the body in five different ways, to which different rules apply.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Its connection to the body as a fetus in his mother’s womb.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Its connection to the body after a person is born.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Its connection to the body when a person is asleep, when the soul is connected in one way and separated from it in another way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Its connection to the body in <i>al-Barzakh</i> (the period between a person’s death and the Day of Resurrection), when it has departed from the body and separated from it, but is not separated completely in such a way that there is no connection at all. We have mentioned at the beginning of this reply that there are <i>ahaadeeth </i>and reports which indicate that the soul is returned to the body when somebody sends the greeting of salaam to a deceased person. This returning is of a special nature which does not mean that the life is restored to the body before the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Its connection to the body on the Day when bodies will be resurrected. This is the most perfect type of connection to the body, and has no comparison to the previous types, because after that the body will never die, sleep or have anything wrong with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a person is asleep, his soul is in his body and he is alive, although his being alive is not the same as that of a person who is awake, for sleep is comparable to death. Similarly, when a dead person’s soul is returned to his body (when the greeting is sent upon him), he is in a state between one who is alive and one who is dead, whose soul is not restored to his body. This is like the case of a sleeping person who is in a state between life and death. We hope that this will dispel a lot of your confusion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">By the Imâm &#8211; the Shaykh of Islâm &#8211; Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah [1]<br />
Al-Ibaanah Magazine , Issue No.3 &#8211; Dhul-Qa’dah 1416H / April 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[1] Six Etiquettes of Learning</b> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim &#8211; <i>rahimahullâh</i> &#8211; said:<br />
“There are six stages to knowledge:-<br />
<i>Firstly</i>: Asking questions in a good manner.<br />
<i>Secondly</i>: Remaining quiet and listening attentively.<br />
<i>Thirdly</i>: Understanding well.<br />
<i>Fourthly</i>: Memorising.<br />
<i>Fifthly</i>: Teaching.<br />
<i>Sixthly</i> &#8211; and it is its fruit: Acting upon the knowledge and keeping to its limits.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[2] Fruits of Humility</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim &#8211; <i>rahimahullâh</i> &#8211; said: [4]<br />
One of the <i>Salaf</i> (Pious Predecessors) said: “Indeed a servant commits a sin by which he enters Paradise; and another does a good deed by which he enters the Fire.” It was asked: How is that? So he replied: “The one who committed the sin, constantly thinks about it; which causes him to fear it, regret it, weep over it and feel ashamed in front of his Lord the Most High &#8211; due to it. He stands before Allâh, broken-hearted and with his head lowered in humility. So this sin is more beneficial to him than doing many acts of obedience, since it caused him to have humility and humbleness &#8211; which leads to the servant’s happiness and success &#8211; to the extent that this sin becomes the cause for him entering Paradise. As for the doer of good, then he does not consider this good a favour from his Lord upon him. Rather, he becomes arrogant and amazed with himself, saying: I have achieved such and such, and such and such. So this further increases him in self-adulation, pride and arrogance &#8211; such that this becomes the cause for his destruction.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[3] Purifying the Heart</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim &#8211; <i> rahimahullâh</i> &#8211; said:<br />
“There is no doubt that the heart becomes covered with rust, just as metal dishes &#8211; silver, and their like &#8211; become rusty. So the rust of the heart is polished with <i>dhikr</i> (remembrance of Allâh), for <i>dhikr </i> polishes the heart until it becomes like a shiny mirror. However, when <i> dhikr</i> is abandoned, the rust returns; and when it commences then the heart again begins to be cleansed. Thus the heart becoming rusty is due to two matters: sins and <i>ghaflah</i> (neglecting remembrance of Allâh). Likewise, it is cleansed and polished by two things: <i>istigfâr</i> (seeking Allâh’s forgiveness) and <i>dhikr</i>.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[4] Jihâd Against the Self</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Jihâd (striving) against the soul has four stages:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Firstly</i>: To strive in learning guidance and the religion of truth, without which there will be no success. Indeed, there can be no true happiness, nor any delight in this world and in the Herefater, except through it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Secondly</i>: Striving to act upon what has been learnt, since knowledge without action will not benefit, rather it will cause harm.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Thirdly</i>: Striving to invite others towards it and to teach those who do not know, otherwise he may be considered from those who hide what Allâh has revealed of guidance and clear explanation. Such knowledge will neither benefit, nor save a person from the punishment of Allâh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Fourthly</i>: Striving to be patient and persevering against those who oppose this <i> da’wah</i> (call) to Allâh and those who seek to cause harm &#8211; patiently bearing all these hardships for the sake of Allâh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When these four stages are completed then such a person is considered to be amongst the <i> Rabbâniyyûn</i>. The <i>Salaf</i> were agreed that a Scholar does not deserve the title of <i>Rabbânî</i> until he recognises and knows the truth, acts upon it, and teaches it to others. So whosoever has knowledge, acts upon it, and teaches this knowledge to others, is considered from the <i>Rabbâniyyûn</i>.” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[5] Trials of the Heart</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyirn said, whilst commenting upon the following hadîth: <i>“Trials and tribulations will be presented to hearts, as a reed mat is interwoven stick by stick. Any heart which absorbs these trials will have a black mark put in it. However, any heart that rejects them will have a white mark put in it. The result is that hearts will be of two kinds: one white like a white stone, which will not be harmed by trials as long as the heavens and earth endure; and the other dark and rusty, like an over-turned vessel; not able to recognise the good, nor reject evil, but rather being absorbed with its desires.”</i> [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The <i>fitan</i> (trials) which are presented to the hearts &#8211; and which are the cause of its weakness &#8211; are: [i] the trials relating to <i>shahwah</i> (false desire) and [ii] the trials relating to <i>shubhah</i> (doubt) &#8230; So the first causes intentions and desires to be corrupted, whilst the second causes knowledge and beliefs to be corrupted.” [8] Speaking about such trials, he &#8211; <i>rahimahullâh</i> &#8211; said: “Hearts &#8211; when exposed to such <i> fitan</i> (trials) &#8211; are of two types: [The first type]: a heart, which, when exposed to such trials, absorbs it like a sponge that soaks-up water, leaving in it a black stain. Such a heart continues to soak-up the various trials that are presented to it, until it becomes dark and corrupted &#8211; which is what is meant by <i>“an over-turned vessel”</i>, so when this occurs, two dangerous and deadly diseases take hold of it and plunge it into destruction</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Firstly</i>: confusing good with evil, so it neither recognises the good, nor rejects the evil. This disease may take hold of it to such an extent that it believes good to be evil; and evil to be good, <i>Sunnah</i> to be <i> bid’ah</i> (innovation); and innovations to be the <i>Sunnah</i>, and the truth to be falsehood; and falsehood the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Secondly</i>: judging by its whims and desires, over and against what Allâh’s Messenger <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> came with &#8211; being enslaved by its whims and desires and being led by them also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[The second type]: a white heart in which the light of <i>îmân</i> is bright and its radiance is illuminating. So when trials are presented to such a heart, it rejects and turns away from them. This further increases its light and illumination and its strength.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[6] Four Principles of Worship</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“(The <i>Âyah</i>): <b>“You alone do we worship.”</b> [Sûrah al-Fâtihah 1:5] is built upon four principles:- Ascertaining what Allâh and His Messenger love and are pleased with, from [i] the sayings of the heart and [ii] of the tongue; and [iii] the actions of the heart and [iv] of the limbs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <i>al-’ubûdiyyah</i> (servitude and slavery to Allâh) is a comprehensive term for all these for stages. The one who actualises them has indeed actualised: <b>“You alone do we worship.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>The saying of the heart</b></i>: It is <i>i’tiqâd</i> (belief) in what Allâh &#8211; <i>the Most Perfect</i> &#8211; informed about His Self; concerning His Names, His Attributes, His Actions, His Angels, and all that He sent upon the tongue of His Messenger <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>The saying of the tongue</b></i>: It is to inform and convey (what Allâh has revealed), to call to it, defend it, to explain the false innovations which oppose it, to establish its remembrance and to convey what it orders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>The action of the heart</b></i>: Such as love for Him, reliance upon Him, repenting to Him, having fear and hope in Him, making the <i>Dîn</i> purely and sincerely for Him, having patience in what He orders and prohibits, having patience with what He decrees and being pleased with it, having allegiance and enmity for His sake, humbling oneself in front of Him and having humility in front of Him, becoming tranquil with Him and other than this from the actions of the heart which are actually connected to the action of the limbs &#8230; and actions of the limbs without the action of the heart is of little benefit, if any benefit at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>The action of the limbs</b></i>: Such as Prayer and <i>Jihâd</i>, attending the <i>Jumu’ah</i> and being with the <i>Jamâ’ah</i>, aiding those who are unable and displaying goodness and kindness to the creation, and other than this.” [10]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>References</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. He is Abû ’Abdullâh, Shamsud-Dîn Muhammad ibn Abû Bakr better known as Ibn al-Qayyim (or Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah). He was born in the year 691H in the city of Damascus. From an early age he set about acquiring knowledge and studied under many prominent teachers, the most notable of whom was Shaykhul-Islâm Ibn Taymiyyah. His students include the likes of Ibn Kathîr, adh-Dhahabî, Ibn Bajab, Ibn ’Abdul-Hâdî and others. He authored over ninety books and booklets &#8211; all of them being characterised by their touching address to the soul and the heart, as well as their accuracy, precision and depth of research. Ibn al-Qayyim died on the night of Thursday 13th Rajab at the time of the ’Ishâ <i>adhân</i> in the year 751H. Testaments about his comprehensive knowledge, firm adherence to the way of the <i>Salaf</i>; excellent manners, worship and <i>zuhd</i> have been given by Al-Hâfidh Ibn Hajar in ad-<i>Dururul-Kâminah</i> (3/400), Al-Hâfidh Ibn Rajab in <i> Dhayl Tabaqâtul-Hanâbilah</i> (2/447), ash-Shawkânî in <i>al-Badrut-Tâli’</i> (2/143-146) and also Al-Hâfidh Ibn Kathîr who said about him in <i>al-Bidâyah wan-Nihâyah</i> (14/246): “He attained great proficiency in many branches of knowledge, particularly knowledge of <i>Tafsîr</i>, Hadîth and <i>Usûl</i>. When Shaykh Taqiyyud-Dîn Ibn Taymiyyah returned from Egypt in the year 712H, he stayed with the Shaykh until he died, learning a great deal of knowledge from him; along with the knowledge which he had already occupied himself in obtaining. So he became a singular Scholar in many branches of knowledge. He also continued to seek knowledge greatly day and night and was constant in humbly calling upon his Lord. He recited well and had fine manners. He had a great deal of love and did not harbour any envy for anyone, nor harm anyone, nor seek to find fault with anyone, nor bear any malice towards anyone. I was one of those who most often kept company with him and I was one of the most beloved of people to him. I do not know anyone in the world, in this time, who is a greater worshipper than him. His <i>Salâh</i> (Prayer) used to be very lengthy, with prolonged <i>rukû’</i> (bowing) and <i>sujûd</i> (prostration). His companions would often reproach him for this, yet he never retorted back, nor did he abandon this practice &#8211; may Allâh shower His Mercy upon him.”<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Audio Excerpt: <a title="Day 12: Only Performing one Umrah in one Journey" href="http://www.miraathpublications.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Miraath-Publications-BiteSize-Ramadhaan-1434-Articles-Day-12.mp3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Miraath Publications – BiteSize Ramadhaan 1434 Articles – Day 12</a></p>
<p>Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr <strong>Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah</strong> (d.751 A.H.) -Rahimullaah- said:</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<blockquote><p>‘The Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- would not perform an extra Umrah exiting out of Makkah, after already having performed one, as many of the people do nowadays. Rather all the Umrahs that the Messenger performed were upon entering Makkah.</p>
<p>He -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- lived in Makkah for thirteen years after the revelation had first descended, and it is not reported from the outset about him that he performed Umrah exiting from Makkah in that time period.</p>
<p>So, the Umrah that the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- performed and legislated, is the Umrah of entering into Makkah, there is no Umrah for the person who is in Makkah and he goes outside the boundary of Makkah whereby he can enter again and perform Umrah. This was not ever done by anyone at the time of the Prophet, except by ‘Aeysha alone out of all those who were with her. This was because she had made the intention and entered into Ihram but had begun her menstrual cycle. So the Prophet ordered her to connect up her Umrah with the Hajj, and informed her that her Tawaf of the House and going between Safa and Marwa, would indeed be sufficient for her Hajj and Umrah together (instead of performing a separate Umrah).</p>
<p>So she found that her female companions were returning with a Hajj and a separate Umrah, since they had intended to perform Hajj at-Tamattu (with an Umrah and a Hajj), and they had not begun their menstrual cycle and did not have to combine their Umrah in with the Hajj. However, she would have only returned with an Umrah within her Hajj, so he -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- ordered her brother to take her to perform an Umrah from at-Tan’eem, to soothe her heart, and her brother did not perform an Umrah from Tan’eem in that Hajj nor did anyone else from those who were with him.’</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>[Taken from: ‘Zad al-Ma’ad’ 1/94]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani (d.1420A.H) -Rahimullaah- was asked:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">‘Is it permissible for me to perform Umrah twice in one journey, since I am from Jordan. The first one from Abyaar Ali (the local name for the Meeqat Dhul Hulayfah just outside Madina), and the second from at-Tan’eem (outskirts of Makkah), just like ‘Aeysha -Radhi Allaahu anha. If this is not permissible, then can I perform it for my deceased father or mother? May Allah reward you with goodness.</span></p>
<p><strong>The Shaykh answered:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>‘The person who wants to repeat an Umrah then it is necessary for him to return to the Meeqat from whence he entered into Ihraam, whether that is for his own self or for his parents.<br />
As for entering into Ihraam from at-Tan’eem, from whence the Noble lady ‘Aeysha entered into Ihraam, then this ruling is specific for ‘Aeysha and those who are in a similar condition to her.</p>
<p>I term this Umrah from at-Tan’eem as the Umrah of the menstruating woman. The reason for this is because when ‘Aeysha -Radhi Allaahu anha- went out with the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- to perform the farewell Hajj, and she had entered into Ihraam to perform Umrah, but when she reached a place close to Makkah, known as ‘Sarif’ the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- entered upon her and found her crying. So he said to her:</p>
<p>مالك أنفست</p>
<p>‘Why are you crying? Have you started your menstrual cycle?’</p>
<p>She replied: ‘Yes, O Messenger of Allaah.’</p>
<p>He –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said:</p>
<p>هذا أمر قد كتبه الله على بنات آدم، فاصنعي ما يصنع الحاج غير ألَّا تطوفي ولا تصلي</p>
<p>‘This is a matter which Allaah has written for the daughters of Adam, so do that which the person performing Hajj does, except do not perform the Tawaf and do not perform the Salat.’</p>
<p>So she did not perform the Tawaf or the Salat until she had become clean in Araafat, then she continued with the rites of Hajj and accomplished Hajj completely. When the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- had decided to travel and return to Madina, he entered upon ‘Aeysha in her tent and again he found her crying.</p>
<p>He asked her: ‘What is wrong with you?’</p>
<p>She said: ‘What is wrong with me? The people are returning with Hajj and Umrah, and I am returning with Hajj without Umrah.’</p>
<p>The reason was because her menstruation had caused her Umrah to be changed to a Hajj, a Hajj Mufrad (Hajj without Umrah), so here she is saying, she is crying out of grief of what she missed out from performing an Umrah before performing the Hajj, whereas her co-wives like Umm Salamah and other than her, returned with Umrah and Hajj, and that is why was crying.</p>
<p>She said: ‘Why should I not cry? The people are returning with a Hajj and Umrah and I am returning with a Hajj.’ So the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- had compassion on her and ordered her brother AbdurRahmaan bin Abi Bakr as-Siddiq to accompany her, with him on his camel and go out with her to at-Tan’eem. So he did that and she returned, and performed an Umrah and soothed her soul.</p>
<p>This is why we say, if a woman is afflicted with that which had afflicted ‘Aeysha from amongst the women, whereby her menstrual cycle started, while she wanted to perform Umrah, and she could not complete the Umrah, so that her Umrah was changed into a Hajj. So here a woman can perform Umrah in place of what she missed out on, in the same way that Allaah legislated upon the tongue of His Messenger for ‘Aeysha, so the woman who was menstruating goes out again to at-Tan’eem and comes and performs an Umrah.</p>
<p>As for men then, Alhamdulillah they do not menstruate so they do not take the ruling of the menstruating woman. The proof is, as some of the scholars of Seerah and history of the Companions, say: a hundred thousand Companions performed Hajj with the Messenger, not one of them did an Umrah the like of the Umrah of ‘Aeysha -Radhi Allaahu anha, so if that was something good then they would have proceeded us in that action. Therefore, the person who wants to perform an Umrah returns to the Meeqat and enters into Ihraam from there, whether for himself or for his mother and father.</p>
<p>This is sufficient and praise be to Allaah Lord of all the worlds.’</p></blockquote>

<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>Every intelligent person knows that Shaytān has no way to [attack] him except from three angles:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1. Extravagance</strong>. [A person] takes more than he needs, so it becomes superfluous; and [surplus] is the share of Shaytān and his point of entry to the heart. The way to avoid this is to avoid giving the self all it wants of food, sleep, pleasure and comfort. When you close this door, you will be safe from the enemy entering through it.</span></p></blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>2. Heedlessness</strong>. One who remembers [Allāh] is in an impenetrable fortress. If he becomes forgetful and heedless, he opens the gates of the fortress, and the enemy enters, after which it is difficult to expel him.</span></div>
</blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>3. Affectation</strong> of what does not concern oneself, or what one is not qualified to involve oneself in.</span></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p style="text-align:center;">(<strong>Continuation on Wiswas</strong>, obsessive thoughts, whispers of satan)</p>
</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Salamu &#8216;alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh. I decided to continue on the issue of <strong>Wiswas</strong> and I hope you have benefited as I have benefited. Barak Allahu fikum, if you know someone who&#8217;s affected by this, then please forward it to him/her, let the present convey to the absent. I decided to pick out benefits that are very interesting from a book that was written by Ibn-ul-Qayyim (rahimahullâh) so enjoy, benefit and forward to others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit 1: <em>They rejected the Sunnah of the prophet</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn Qayyim:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;They rejected the Sunnah of the prophet (salla Allahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), to the extent that someone thought that if he performed ablution in the manner of the prophet (salla Allahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and washed like him, he would still not be able to cleanse himself properly. The prophet (salla Allahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) used to perform Wudhu&#8217; (ablution) with a quarter of Syrian Ratl (I.e. Syrian measure equal to 3.202kh [3.202 litres of water]), and washed his body with one ratl and a quarter. A person who is under the influence of the devil&#8217;s inspiration would see that measure as not even enough to wash his hands.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Waswasah: The whispering of the Shaitan, english, p. 18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit 2: &#8220;This is not enough for two people to wash properly!&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn Qayyim:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It was also reported that the prophet (salla Allahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) used to perform Ghusl (the major ritual ablution of the whole body) with &#8216;Aishah (radhiya Allahu &#8216;anha) using just one large bowl, in which some traces of dough remained. If the person, under the influence of Satan, heard of someone doing likewise, he would object to him, saying &#8220;This is not enough for two people to wash properly!&#8221;.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Ibid, p. 19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit 3: A knowledgeable person</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imâm Ahmad (may Allah bless him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;A knowledgeable person should only use a small quantity of water.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Ibid, p. 20)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit 4: The person under the influence of Satan&#8217;s whisperings would not agree</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn Qayyim:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When the prophet (salla Allahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) performed ablution or washed all his body, he used to put his hand inside the container to get water; he would rinse his mouth and wash his nose. The person under the influence of Satan&#8217;s whisperings would not agree; he would most likely consider that water as impure, and would never share one container with his wife! He would feel disgust at the thought of it, the way the disbeliever feels when Allah&#8217;s Name is mentioned.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Ibid, p. 20)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit 5: Excessiveness in religion (Beware!)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbas (radhiya Allahu anh) said &#8220;In the morning of al-Aqabah, the prophet (salla Allahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said to me, while he (salla Allahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) was mounting his camel: &#8216;Pick up some stones for me&#8217;. So I collected seven stones for him. He then started shaking them in his hand and said: &#8216;Such people (who exceed the boundaries of Allah), you should aim at.&#8217; Then he (salla Allahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8216;O people, beware of excessiveness in religion; for people before you were destroyed by their excesses in religion.&#8221; (Recorded by Ahmad and an-Nassai.) (Ibid, p. 26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Barak Allahu fikum, that&#8217;s it for now, to be continued.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn al-Qayyim</strong> (Rahimahullah) narrated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported that in Egypt, there was a man who would maintain the mosques, making the call to prayer, etc. He was, by all outward means, an obedient person and devout worshipper.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One day, as he usually would, he ascended the minaret to make the call to prayer. At the base of the minaret, there was a Christian woman standing. He saw her, and was seduced by her looks. So, he descended the minaret, went to her, and entered her home. She said to him: “Who are you, and what do you want?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied: “I want you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said: “Why?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: “You have enslaved my eyes, and you have captured my heart.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said: “I will never answer your desire in a doubtful or suspicious manner.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: “Ok, so, I will marry you, then.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said: “You are a Muslim, and I am a Christian. My father will never allow me to marry you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: “So, I will become a Christian.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said: “If you wish to do so, go ahead.“</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the man became a Christian in order to marry this woman, and lived with the woman’s family in her house. Later on that day, however, he was on the roof of the house. He fell from the roof and died without even having enjoyed his new bride. So, he lost the woman, and he lost his religion.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center">By Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah as-Salafi <em>-Rahimullaah-<br />
</em>Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari mentions in his ‘Saheeh’ from Wahab bin Munnabih that it was said to him: ‘Is not <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> the key to Paradise?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘Of course, however there is no key except that it has teeth, so if a key is brought which has teeth then it will be opened, otherwise it will not open.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘<strong>Allaah Subhanahu has placed keys for everything that is necessary</strong></span>, and they open the way, so Allaah made purification the key for prayer, as the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">‘The key to prayer is purification.’ [Saheeh al-Jamia as-Sagheer No.5885] .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">Like wise</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ihram is the key to Hajj,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Truthfulness is the key to righteousness,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tawheed is the key to Paradise,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Asking good questions and being attentive is the key to knowledge,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Patience is the key to victory and triumph,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Gratitude is the key to increase of provision,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Remembrance of Allaah is the key to having loyalty to Allaah and His love,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taqwa (piety) is the key to success,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fervent desire and dread of Allaah is the key to being successful,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dua’ (Supplicating) is the key to being responded to,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zuhd (Abstaining from the luxuries of the world) is the key to desiring the Hereafter,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reflecting about that which Allaah calls His slaves to is the key to Eemaan (having faith),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Making the heart accept Islaam and making it secure for Allaah and having sincerity for Him by having love and hate and fulfilling His commands and leaving the prohibitions is the key to going in front of Allaah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Pondering upon the Qur’aan, and imploring Allaah before dawn and not sinning is the key to giving the heart life,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Being kind to the worshippers of the Creator and striving to benefit His worshippers is the key to obtaining mercy,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Striving to seek forgiveness from Allaah and Taqwa (piety) is the key to Rizq (provisions),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Obedience to Allaah and His Messenger is the key to honour,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Longing for the Hereafter is the key to being prepared for the Hereafter,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fervent desire for Allaah and the Hereafter is the key to all goodness,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Love for the world, continuously longing for it and turning away from the Hereafter is the key to all evil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a great matter from the most beneficial chapters of knowledge, namely knowing the keys to goodness and evil.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Haadi al-Arwaaha ila Bilaad al-Afraaha’ by Ibn Qayyim vol 1 p.139]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim</strong>, rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is quite amazing how it can be easy upon a person to be cautious and wary with regards to [different impermissible acts such as]: eating from unlawful means, oppression, adultery and fornication, stealing, drinking intoxicants, looking at prohibited things and the likes, and yet quite difficult for him to be careful about the movement of his tongue. So bad that you find a person towards whom the people point to concerning his practice of the Religion, his asceticism, and worship, and despite this he says statements that anger Allaah greatly and he shows no concern about this, yet this statement will take him [to a Fire] that is farther than distance between east and west. (1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How many people do you see from amongst those who have enough piety to abstain from lewd, indecent acts, oppression and wrong doing, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">but their tongues rip apart the honor of both the dead and the living and they show not a care in the least</span>.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center">From the Secrets of <em>Fatiha</em> and What it Contains<br />
By Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah as-Salafi  <em>-Rahimullaah-</em><br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <strong><em>Two Strengths</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The human being has two strengths:</p>
<ol>
<li>The strength of researched knowledge.</li>
<li>And the strength of practical firm determination of actions.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> A human’s complete happiness is dependent upon the perfection and completion of the two strengths of knowledge and firm determination of actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the perfection and completion of the strength of knowledge, then this is achieved</p>
<ol>
<li>by knowing his Creator and his Originator,</li>
<li>knowing His Names and Attributes;</li>
<li>by knowing the path which leads to Him, and</li>
<li>by knowing what causes weakness in following that path, and</li>
<li>by knowing himself and his shortcomings and mistakes.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having awareness of these <strong>five points</strong>, leads the human to achieve perfection in the strength of knowledge. The most knowledgeable of the people are those who know and understand these points the most.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> As for the perfection and completion of the strength of practical firm determination of actions, this can only be achieved by complying with the rights of Allaah <em>-Subhanahu-</em> which He has over the slave, and the slave fulfills them with <em>Ikhlaas</em> (sincerity), truthfulness, faithfully, being righteous and by following and testifying to Allaah’s favours upon the slave of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The slave has shortcomings in fulfilling Allaah’s rights, and so is ashamed to face Allaah with what (little) he has from servitude to Him. The slave knows that his servitude to Allaah is less than that which Allaah is worthy of, in fact it is even less and lesser than that.  There is no way for him to perfect these two strengths except with Allaah’s help.  Allaah guides him to the straight path to which He guided, His <em>‘Aawliyaa</em> and those who are close to Him. Allaah averts him from going off the path (<em>Siraat</em>), through either becoming corrupted in his strength of knowledge, and he falls into misguidance, or from his strength of actions, which obligates anger upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <strong><em>The Principles of Guidance in Sooratul – Fatiha</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The complete happiness of a human cannot be achieved except with a combination of these matters, and they are included in Sooratul Fatiha and these matters are arranged in the best way, so the saying of Allaah Ta’ala: <span style="color:#339966;">&lt;&lt;All praise belongs to Allaah, the Lord of all the worlds * The Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.  * The Only Owner (and the Only Ruling Judge) of the Day of Recompense (i.e. the Day of Resurrection)&gt;&gt;</span> comprises the first principle, which is knowing about Allaah and His Names, His Attributes and His Actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Names mentioned in this Soorah are the principle names of Allaah’s Beautiful Names, which are; the Name ‘<strong>Allaah</strong>’, ‘<strong>ar-Rabb</strong>’ (The Lord) and <strong>‘ar-Rahmaan</strong>’ (The Most Merciful).</p>
<ul>
<li>The Name ‘Allaah’ comprises the attributes of al-Ulooheeya (worship).</li>
<li>The Name ‘ar-Rabb’ comprises the attributes of Roobubeeyah.</li>
<li>The Name ‘ar-Rahman’ comprises the attributes of Beneficence, generosity and Kindness.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meanings of the Names of Allaah revolve around this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;">&lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything)&gt;&gt;</span> : This is knowing the path leading to Allaah, which is none other than worshipping Him Alone with what Allaah loves and is pleased with, and seeking aid from Him whilst worshipping Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for His saying: <span style="color:#339966;">&lt;&lt;Guide us to the Straight Way &gt;&gt;</span> this comprises the explanation that the slave of Allaah has no way to his own happiness except by <em>Isteeqamah</em> (being upright) on the <em>Siraat al-Mustaqeem</em> (the straight path).  There is no path for him to <em>Isteeqamah</em> except by Allaah’s guidance, just as there is no way for him to Allaah’s worship except by Allaah’s aid, in the same way there is no path for him to <em>Isteeqamah</em> upon the correct way except by Allaah’s guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Allaah’s saying: <span style="color:#339966;">&lt;&lt; not (the way) of those who earned Your Anger, nor of those who went astray&gt;&gt;</span> this contains the two extremities of deviancy from the straight path.  Deviating to one of these sides leads to misguidance, which is the corruption of knowledge and belief deviating to the other side, to Allaah’s anger which is due to corruption of the intention and action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first part of the <em>Soorah</em> is mercy, the middle is guidance and last part is blessings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <strong><em>The Slave of Allaah is between Blessings and Guidance</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The portion of blessings a slave of Allaah has is related to the amount of guidance he has.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proportion of guidance for a slave of Allaah is related to the portion of Mercy. So, the whole matter returns back to Allaah’s Blessings and His Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Blessing and Mercy are from those things which necessitate Allaah’s <em>Roobubeeyah</em> (Lordship). Indeed Allaah is The Merciful and The Giver of blessings and these are from the obligations of His <em>Ilaheeyaeehi</em> (being the One worthy of worship), so He is the deity in Truth, even if the rejecters deny it, and the <em>Mushrikeen</em> associate partners with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever puts into effect the meanings of <em>Fatiha</em> with knowledge and understanding, practically and immediately; then he will have been successful in his perfecting [knowledge and action] in the best way. Then his worship of Allaah becomes a distinct worship by which his grade is raised above that of the general worshippers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Wa Allaahul Must’aan</em>.’</p>

Aboo Tasneem Daawood Adeeb al-Atharee, [Khutbah, Mar &#8217;05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Overview</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Allaah wishes to make clear (what is lawful and what is unlawful) to you,and to show you the ways of those before you, and to accept your repentance,and Allaah is the All­Knower, All­Wise. Allaah wishes to accept your repentance, but those who follow their lusts, wish that you should deviate tremendously away from the right path. Allaah wishes to lighten (the burden) for you; and man was created weak.&#8221;</strong> [Sooratun-Nisaa&#8217;, 4:26-28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that reflective thoughts are not themselves harmful; rather what becomes harmful are constant (obsessive) ponderings. A thought about something is like a passer-by, if you do not call him, he will pass you by and go upon his way. However, if you call him, he will dupe and deceive you by his speech, and this is the easiest thing to do for the Nafs that is filled with falsehood. However, it is the most difficult thing to bear for the Nafs that is contended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has placed in all of mankind two kinds of Nafs :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Nafs Ammaarah</strong> (the soul that commands evil), and  <strong>Nafs Mutma&#8217;innah</strong> (the soul that is content). They always oppose each other, so what is sweet for one is bitter for the other. There is nothing more difficult for the soul that commands evil than to go against its desires by working for Allaah&#8217;s pleasure, however, this is the most beneficial thing for it. Likewise, there is nothing more difficult for the soul that is content  than to work for other than the pleasure of Allaah. Every person has both a Nafs Mutma&#8217;innah and a Nafs Ammaarah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Additionally, there is an angel on the right side (of every person) and it works in conjunction with the Nafs Mutma&#8217;innah. Likewise, on the left side (of every person), there is a Shaytaan that works in conjunction with the Nafs Ammaarah, and there is a constant, ongoing struggle between the two and it does not cease until this person&#8217;s appointed time in this life ceases. Falsehood always sides with the Shaytaan and the Nafs Ammaarah, whereas the truth always sides with the angels and the Nafs Mutma&#8217;innah, and the victor alternates.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, victory comes with patience and whoever remains patient and has<b> </b>taqwaa (fear and consciousness) of Allaah, then he will be granted the upper-hand in this life and in the next. This is the law of Allaah that never changes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Khutbatul Haajah ….</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My Dear Brothers and Sisters in Al-Islaam, those of you who believe in Allaah and His Angels, His Books, His Messengers and the Divine Decree &#8211; the good and the evil of it, the sweet and the bitter of it. O You who believe, those of you who believe in the things that we cannot see, those things that are hidden from our view, those things like the Angels, and the Jannah and the Naar, the Paradise and the Hellfire, and those things that we can&#8217;t see like the Jinn and our Nafs. The Jinn is a creature that Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala has created to worship Him, similar to the human being, but he is a creature that we cannot see in this life and this Dunya with our eyes. And as Imaam as-Shaafiee (rahimahullaahi ta&#8217;ala) said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Anyone who says that they can see the Jinn in this life, then their testimony, (their Shahaadah) will never be taken. Their testimony for the contract of  marriage or contract of business or any type of testimony will not be accepted for no one can see the Jinn in this life. &#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other creatures that Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala has created is inside of ourselves, that creature is called an-Nafs. In the Khutbahtul Haajah the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihiwa sallam) used to say for every Jummah and every salaatul Eid whether it be Fitr or Adha and at the weddings, he used to say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Innal Hamda lillaah Nahmaduhu wa nasthaeenuhu wa nasthaghfirhu wa na&#8217;oozu billaahi min shuroori anfusinaa, wamin saiyyia&#8217;athia&#8217;amaalina ..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah. We praise Him and beseech His help and in Him we seek forgiveness and we seek the refuge of Allaah from the mischief of our Anfus – the mischiefness of our souls, that Nafs similar to Shaitaan, similar to Iblees, similar to the Jinn that whispers to the human beings to make them think things, to make them say things, to make them do things that they should not be saying or doing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah subhanawata&#8217;ala He says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Surely We created the human being and we know what his nafs whispers to him.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is not a Muslim who is sitting in this blessed Masjid, this House of Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala that does not have a jinn that whispers to him or her something evil. Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala again in His Book says (Surah 114 An-Naas) :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Say to them O Muhammad, [Peace and blessings be upon him] I seek refuge with the Lord of the human beings; the Master, the King ofthe human beings; the God of the human beings;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(there is a jinn that is called <strong>Al-Khannas</strong>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We seek refuge with our Lord, the King, the Master, the God of mankind from this Khannas; We seek refuge with Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala from the Khannas, the one who is Muthawa&#8217;ariee al-Mukhthafee &#8211; the one who is hidden, we can&#8217;t see him but he comes to us and he says, &#8216;say that, do this, say this and do that..&#8217; and he runs away.  He runs away the coward that he is. Those things go inside of our hearts and they go inside of our minds.  We seek refuge with Allaah from the one who whispers in the Sadr – in our sudoor (in our chests) from the jinn and the men. Because we have the Jinn (the Shayaateen) and the Shayaateen from the human beings. i.e we have the devils from the Jinn and the devils from the men and both of them whisper. But our Nafs is something that is with us all time and it whispers to us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Walillaahil Hamd – All Praise is due to Allaah – that Allaah (subhana wata&#8217;ala) has favoured this Ummah to not being held accountable for the things they have in their mind, for not being held accountable for the things they have in their hearts – unless they say those things or do those things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is not one of us that does not have evil thoughts – not one of us. All of us have evil thoughts. But the Prophet [Peace and blessings be upon him]  on the authority of Abu Huraira (radiallaahu tha&#8217;ala anhu warad&#8217;aahu) collected by Imaam Muslim in his saheeh, &#8216;the Prophet [Peace and blessings be upon him]  said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has absolved, Allaah has excused, Allaah has pardoned, Allaah has forgiven, Allaah has done away with for this  Ummah , for me – My ummah, for this nation, this Ummah of Islaam all the things that they think about &#8211; all the things that comes to their minds and their hearts – all those evil thoughts about backbiting their brother, and slandering their sister, and picking up that glass of beer, whisky or wine, when they have the thought of smoking the marjua&#8217;ana or have the thought to commit zinaa (wa iyyadu billaah) or have the thought of stealing or robbing or  any of those evil thoughts or even worse &#8211;  thoughts about prophets and messengers of Allaah, which some of us unfortunately have in our heads and in our minds or thoughts that are bad about Muhammad [Peace and blessings be upon him]  himself –Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala has excused us and pardoned us. &#8216;Maa lam tha&#8217;lam awthatha kallam.&#8217; As long as we don&#8217;t do those things or say those things then, those things that are in our minds of evil – those things that are in our minds that whisper to us from our nafs or from Shaitaan or evil, of wretchedness, those horrible thoughts that come to our minds we are forgiven. Walillaahil Hamd we are forgiven.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The companions of the Messenger of Allaah  [Peace and blessings be upon him]  &#8211; they were the best of human beings after the prophets and the messengers but they also used to have bad thoughts. As the hadith of the companions of the Prophet [Peace and blessings be upon him] said : &#8216;that a party of the companions of the messenger of Allaah [Peace and blessings be upon him] they came to him asking him : O&#8217; Messenger of Allaah, one of us have some things in the inside of our heads. We have some thoughts that comes to our minds that are so ugly, they are so horrendous, they are so horrible, they are so evil that we are even afraid to talk about them. The Messenger of Allaah [Peace and blessings be upon him] said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do you really have those type of thoughts in your minds? You really have those evil thoughts in your minds, you really find those things in your minds?&#8217; They said : &#8216;Yes, we have these evil thoughts O&#8217; Messenger of Allaah.&#8217; The Messenger of Allaah [Peace and blessings be upon him] said: &#8216;zaakaa sarihul Imaan. Zaakaa sarihul Imaan … &#8211; that is clear, pure,faith.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration collected by Imaam Abu Dawuud (rahimahullaah): the prophet [Peace and blessings be upon him] said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Allaahu Akbar, Allaahu Akbar, Allaahu Akbar.., Allaah is theGreatest, Allaah is the Greatest, Allaah is the Greatest, Praise be to Allaah the one Who has diminished, has minimized those evil thoughts to just a whisper..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">to just a whisper so that you won&#8217;t say it or you won&#8217;t do it Wa lillaahil Hamd.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>** 2nd part of the Khutbah**</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our beloved brothers and sisters in Islaam, those of you who have been pardoned by Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala for the evil thoughts that you have in your minds and the evil suggestions that come to your hearts, O you who believe those of you who has been excused from those wretched ideas that you have, we must realize that we are human beings. We are fragile creatures. We are human beings that are created weak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are human beings that are not able to control ourselves except Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala gives us mercy to us – and except that Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala gives the bounty to us. We are creatures that we are not able to control ourselves as the Prophet [Peace and blessings be upon him]. He said that &#8211; when Allaah warned Adam in Jannah and left Adam as He wanted to leave him, for the time He wanted to leave him &#8211; then Iblees went around Adam looking at him and he saw that he was a creature at the point &#8216;into him&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Ibn Kathir (rahimahullaah) says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;going into him from his nostrils and out from his backside, checking him out and finding he was hollow – he realized that Adam was a creature &#8216;Laa yatha maalak&#8217; &#8211; that he was a creature who could not control himself. We are blessed by Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala to have the sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah [Peace and blessings be upon him] to explain to us what to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are blessed by Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala to have the Qura&#8217;an to seek refuge with Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala so that when we go to bed at night – we cup our hands and we say : &#8220;Qul Huwallaahu Ahad,.. and we say Qul Aoozu birabbil Falaq.. and we say Qul Aoozu birabbin Naas..&#8217;so that Shaitaan or any evil will not approach us and then we spit in our hands and we wipe as much of our bodies that we can and we say Ayatul Kursi– the verse of the footstool before we go to bed and we seek refuge with Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala when we walk into the bathroom from the Khubz wal Khabaiz – from the male and female jinns and we seek refuge with Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala before we approach our wives, making dua against Shaitaan and him against his Qaidaah — against his plots and his harming our children.. and we can go on and on ..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What Allaah and His Messenger [Peace and blessings be upon him] have given us to protect ourselves from Shaitaan and to protect ourselves from the whispers of our nafs. The Ulamaa in following the way of the Prophet [Peace and blessings be upon him] they have explained to us that everything begins as a &#8216;khatrah&#8217;  &#8211;  everything begins as a &#8216;thought&#8217;. So they have said, &#8216;Protect yourselves !! Ward off the thoughts !! And if you don&#8217;t ward off the thoughts, then the thought will become an idea. And ward off and make guard against the idea – because if you don&#8217;t ward off the idea then it will become lust.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It first begins as a thought.. brothers, then sisters it becomes an idea.. if you don&#8217;t ward yourself and guard yourself from the original thought, that thought will become an idea and if you don&#8217;t guard yourself from that idea, then it will become &#8216;shahwa&#8217; – lust. Now you have to make war on the shahwa. Now you have to make war, jihad on your desires, on your lusts. And if you don&#8217;t do that then that desire, that lust becomes resolved in determination. And if you don&#8217;t make war on that determination and resolve the results from that thought, from  that idea that is transmuted that changed from idea to lust then it will become &#8216;Azeema wahimma&#8217; &#8211; it will become resolved in determination.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you don&#8217;t defend yourself from that , if you don&#8217;t make jihad on that, then it becomes an action. And if you don&#8217;t protect yourself and ward off from that and do the opposite of that action, then it becomes a habit. Then it becomes a habit &#8211; that thing becomes &#8216;you&#8217;. And it is going to be very, very difficult to get rid of this. If you don&#8217;t do the opposite of that thing that has become an action, it will become a habit and the Ulamaa of science say &#8216;that we are creatures of habits.&#8217; It starts with a thought. It starts with a thought which becomes an idea, an idea that becomes lust and a lust that becomes resolve and you let these things become planted in your heart and in your mind and then it becomes &#8216;you&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First a thought comes : &#8216;Tell a lie.&#8217;Then when you don&#8217;t do something to guard against that, it becomes an idea. It becomes an ideology in your heads. And then if you don&#8217;t guard against that, it becomes a desire. And if you don&#8217;t make war on that, then it becomes resolve – something that is becoming firmly planted in the soil of your nafs, in the dirt of your nafs and your nafs now becomes a seed that has become firmly rooted. And if you don&#8217;t guard against and get rid of that, then it becomes an action and from an action it becomes a habit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sumail (rahimahullah) one of the Tabi&#8217;oon, Sammaak Ibn Waleed (rahimahullaahi ta&#8217;ala) said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;I asked Ibn Abbas (radiallaahu anhu) there is something that I find in my chest.&#8217; Ibn Abbas  said, &#8216;What is it that you find in your chest.&#8217; He said: &#8216;It is something Wallaahi ya Abdullaah, (it means Abdullaah Ibn Abbas, I swear by Allaah), I don&#8217;t want to even mention it as it is so evil.&#8217; Ibn Abbas started laughing and said : Allaah tabarakwa ta&#8217;ala says &#8216;if you have doubt about any thing which Allaah has revealed, then ask the people of the Book – those who came before you for they also had doubts. To get rid of that evil thought you should say that Allaah is :&#8217;*Huwal Awwalu wal Aakhiru, wa Daahiru wal-Baatinu, wa huwa ala&#8217;akulli shai&#8217;in aleem.*&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what you should say. This is what Abdullaah ibn Abbas said. When those evil thoughts come to you or you have any doubts about your Deen, you have any doubts about the angels, you have any doubts about the messengers, you have any doubts about the sunnah, you have any doubts about anything of Islaam – you have any doubts whatsoever then say :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;*Huwal Awwalu wal Aakhiru, wad Daahiru wal-Baatinu, wa huwa ala kulli shai&#8217;in aleem.*&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala to protect us from the evil of ourselves, from the shuroor of our Anfus, from the evil of our nafs (when they whisper to us) and we ask Allaah to give us protection from the Shayateen – both from the Jinn and the men and we ask Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala by His Greatest Name to let us see His face and be in the closest proximity of the Prophet Muhammad [Peace and blessings be upon him]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#888888;">by Imam Ibn ul Qayyim Jawziyyah,</span><br />
<span style="color:#888888;">[Madarij as-Saalikeen 1/100-101, 105], Slightly adapted by Dr Saleh as-Saleh</span><br />
<span style="color:#888888;">From a footnote in &#8220;The Dispraise of Al-Hawaa (Desire) by Ibnul Qayyim Al-Jawziyyah&#8221; © 1998 Dar al-Bukhaari</span></p>
<blockquote><p>`Uboodiyyah is a comprehensive term that asserts the meaning of the Verse (Aayah).<br />
&#8220;You Alone do we worship and You Alone do we seek for Help.&#8221; (Qur&#8217;an 1:5)</p></blockquote>
<p>It comprises the slavery of the heart, tongue and limbs to Allaah ta`aala.</p>
<p>The slavery of the heart includes both the Qawl (saying of the heart) and `Amaal (actions of the heart).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Qawl of the heart</strong> is the belief (I`tiqaad) in what Allaah has informed about His Self, His Names and Attributes, His Action, His Angels, and that which He revealed in His Book and sent upon the tongue of His Messenger Muhammad sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The `Amaal of the heart</strong> include love for Allaah, reliance upon Him, turning to Him in repentance, fearing Him, having hope in Him, devoting the Deen sincerely to Him, having patience in what He orders and forbids, having patience with His decrees and being pleased with them, having allegiance for His pleasure, having humility for Him and humbling oneself in front of Him, and becoming tranquil with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Qawl (saying) of the tongue</strong> is to convey what Allah has revealed (in the Qur&#8217;an and authentic Sunnah) regarding Himself, His Names and Attributes, His Actions, His Commands, His Prohibitions, and all that is related to this Deen), to call to it, defend it, to expose the false innovations which oppose it, and to establish its remembrance and to convey what it orders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The `Amaal (actions) of the limbs</strong> include the Salaat (prayers), Jihaad, attending  the Jumu`ah prayers and the rest of the Jamaa`aat (congregational prayers), assisting those who are unable, and acting with goodness and kindness to creation, and other such acts.</p>
<p>This comprehensive meaning of the <strong>`Uboodiyyah pertains to its specific type</strong>. The people who fall under this type of `Uboodiyyah are the believers who obey, love, and sincerely follow the Deen of Allaah ta`aala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <strong>second type of `Uboodiyyah is the general one</strong> in which all creatures in the heavens and in the earth are subdued to Allaah&#8217;s sovereign Authority and Power; everything is subservient to His Will, and Authority; nothing occurs or ceases to occur except by His leave; His is the Kingdom and He disposes the affairs as He pleases. This type of `Uboodiyyah is known as the `<span style="color:#993300;">Uboodiyyah of Qahr (Subduing) and Mulk</span> (Sovereignty, Kingship, Possession, Mastership, etc.).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the part of the Aayah signifying &#8220;You do we worship&#8221; asserts the adherence to the four principles of `Uboodiyyah:</p>
<ol>
<li>The sayings of the heart The actions of the heart,</li>
<li>The sayings of the tongue, and</li>
<li>The actions of the limbs.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other part, &#8220;You Alone do we seek for Help,&#8221; stresses the fact that the believer must ask Allaah alone to help him establish the `Uboodiyyah and succeed in executing all what it requires.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A Precious Gem: The Reward of Being Busy in the Service of Allah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the servant of Allah begins the day and the evening, without having any other concern except Allah, the Almighty, He will fulfill all his needs and relieve all his worries. He will empty the servant&#8217;s heart for the sake of His Love, his tongue will constantly remember Him and he will have the strength to perform religious duties for His sake.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if he begins the day and the evening, without having any other concern except the life of this world, Allah, the Almighty will cast worry and grief into his heart. He, the Almighty will leave him to himself, and keep his heart busy with things other than His Love. His tongue will not remember Allah but will only be concerned with the creation. He will use all his strength in things other than the sake of Allah, and he will remain busy in the service of creation. He will work very hard in the service of others. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Just like a bellows that pumps itself up and then squeezes itself to the utmost in the service of others. Therefore, whoever refuses to submit to Allah, to obey and love Him, will be afflicted with the servitude, love and service of creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Almighty says in the Qur&#8217;an which means,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And whosoever turns away (blinds himself) from the remembrance of the Most Beneficent (Allah) (i.e. this Qur&#8217;an and worship of Allah), We appoint for him Shaitan (Satan devil) to be a Qarin (an intimate companion) to him&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Az-Zukhruf, 43:36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sufyan bin &#8216;Uyaynah said, &#8220;You will never bring forward any famous proverb but I will bring the likeness of it from the Qur&#8217;an,&#8221; Thereupon someone said to him, &#8220;So where is in the Qur&#8217;an<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> &#8220;Give your fellow brother a date, and if he does not accept it then give him a firebrand.&#8221;</strong></span> He then recited the previous Qur&#8217;anic verse.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Let&#8217;s strive to be close to Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let&#8217;s long for the dwelling of peace wherein there is no toil, stress or weariness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The easiest way is to consider the fact that you are passing a period that lies between two other periods, namely your current life, which is the present one and it is between your past and your future.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The past can be set aright through repentance, regret and asking the forgiveness of Allah, and this is a way, which affords you no toil, weariness or hard work, as it is concerned with the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The future can be set aright by abstaining from misdeeds, and this is a means of comfort and relief for you, for it is not a difficult act, but it is an intention that relieves your body, heart, and your mind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In brief, your past is set aright through repentance; your future is set aright through abstention, determination and intention, which have nothing to do with overburdening the body.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, our concern here is with the present time as it stands between the two other periods. If you waste it, then you are wasting your happiness and salvation. On the contrary, if you maintain it through setting your past and present aright, indeed you will attain success, salvation, relief, and pleasure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Improving your present state is much more difficult than setting your past and your future aright, because it means that you should abide by the most deserving and beneficial deeds to achieve happiness. There are great differences between people in this regard. This is your chance to take the provision for your Hereafter, either Paradise or Hellfire. So, if you take this path to your Lord, you will attain glorious happiness and great success during this short period of time which has no value compared with eternity. However, if you prefer vain desires, idleness, play and amusement, the period would pass quickly, followed by a permanent and great pain, the suffering of which is much more severe than the suffering of patience, the patience required to obey Allah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: AL-FAWAID: A Collection of Wise Sayings</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Almighty says,which means,<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allah knows but you do not know.&#8221;</span> (AI-Baqarah, 2:216)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this Qur&#8217;anic Verse, there are several judgments, meanings and benefits for the servant.    If the    servant knows    that misfortune can produce a desirable thing, and that the desirable thing can produce a misfortune, he would not feel secure against the harm that can come from delight, and he would not lose hope of delight to come from harm, for he does not know the outcomes of things. Verily, it is Allah Who knows about that which the servant does not know, and in this context the following issues must be noted:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nothing is more beneficial for him than abiding by the judgments of Allah, even if it is difficult for him at the beginning, because all its outcomes are good, delightful, and pleasurable. In the same way, nothing is more harmful for him than committing what is forbidden, even if he loves it. All its outcomes are pain, grief, evil and misfortune.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the mind bears little pain in comparison to the great pleasure and abundant good that it will experience, and likewise man is expected to avoid little in exchange for great rewards and preventing great pain and long term evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this way, we can see that the perception of the ignorant does not go beyond the basics of life; his perception does not reach the goals, but the intelligent person always keeps his eye on the goals behind his actions in life.<br />
<span style="color:#339966;"><br />
<strong>The intelligent person perceives forbidden things like delicious food, which contain fatal poison. Whenever its pleasure arouses his interest, the reality of the poison would push him away from it. Also, he perceives the orders of Allah as bitter medicine that leads to good health and recovery. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever its bitterness urges him not to take it, the reality of its usefulness leads him to comply. This requires knowledge that is more than the rudiments of the religion in order to understand the essential goals. It also requires strong patience to adjust oneself to it, in order to bear the difficulties that will be encountered for the sake of the goal. So if he loses certainty and patience, it would be difficult to achieve the goal, and on the other hand if his certainty and patience is strong, every difficulty would be rendered easy for him for the sake of permanent good and eternal pleasure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are other meanings of this verse. It also requires the servant to leave all his affairs in the Hands of the One Who knows the outcomes of all things, and to be pleased with whatever He chooses for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><span style="color:#993300;">Also, the meanings of the verse include the fact that he should not propose or choose for his Lord, and should not ask Him for that which he has no knowledge of, for his harm and ruin may be in it and yet he does not know. He should simply ask his Lord to choose good for him and make him pleased with His choice, for that indeed would be the best ending. Also when he  leaves all his affairs to his Lord, and is satisfied with His choice for him, Allah will support him by providing him with ability, determination and patience. He, the Almighty would also keep him away from the evil that the servant would have encountered if he had chosen for himself. He would show him some of the positive outcomes of His Choice, which he would not have attained if he had chosen for himself.</span><br />
</span><br />
Such thinking relieves him of the burdens of trying to choose for himself as Allah frees his heart from estimations and arrangements, which fluctuate in difficulty. And in spite of this, the servant would always be surrounded by what was initially preordained for him. If he is pleased with the Choice of Allah, the preordainment would grant him what is praiseworthy, worthy of thanks and worthy of Allah&#8217;s Mercy. Otherwise, the preordainment would incur on him all that is dispraised and unworthy of Allah&#8217;s Mercy, because it was his own choice. When he truly leaves his affairs to Allah and truly becomes pleased with that, he would be surrounded by kindness and care in the preordainment, and he would be under the care and kindness of Allah. His Kindness protects him from that which he fears and His Care makes it easy for him to bear that<br />
which He preordained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the pre-ordainment is implemented upon the servant, the greatest cause of its implementation would be his trying to avoid it. Therefore, there is nothing more beneficial for him than submission.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>AL-FAWA&#8217;ID: A Collection of Wise Syaings</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Forbidden pleasure is combined with ugliness and it will cause pain after the moment has passed. If you feel strongly inclined toward it, you should think about the pain it will leave behind. It is necessary to compare the two matters and discover the difference between them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Suffering pain while worshiping Allah is combined with a good soul that will bear the fruit of pleasure and relief. When the soul finds it heavy and thinks to stop the pain and then compares the end results of the two  matters, he will surely prefer the way of hardship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you feel pain because of deeds, you should think about the happiness, joy, and pleasure you will gain, then the pain will seem easy to bear. If you get hurt because of abandoning some kind of forbidden pleasure, you should think about the pain that follows it and compare the two kinds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To make the correct choice, you must know the reasons and consequences of each act and then choose that which is more deserving and useful. Whoever succeeds at doing this, would choose the better and prefer it. Whoever thinks about this Worldly life and the Hereafter, would know that he will never gain either of them except by hardship. He should bear this hardship in order to gain the best and more lasting of them.</p>

If he is hungry, stays awake, and keeps his body busy in serving Allah, his soul will find itself lighter and more peaceful so that it would long for the place from which it was created and miss its heavenly world. But if he secures food, blessings, sleep, and rest, the body will incline to remain at the place from which it was created and the soul would be pulled along with it and be in a prison. If it was not for the fact that it would get used to that prison, it would ask for help, as a tortured person does, to find relief from the pain resulting from the separation and departure from its own world from which it was created.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In general, the more the body is light, the more the soul will be light and seek its heavenly world, and the more the body is heavy and seeks desires and relief, the heavier the soul will be and it will come down from its heavenly world and become lower and more earthly. You may see the soul of a man in Heaven while his body is on the earth. Another person serves Allah with his body and his soul is low and wandering about in lowly matters. When the soul separates from the body, it would either catch up with its high or low place. With the high, it would  find every blessing, happiness, beauty, pleasure, and good living while with the low it would find every distress, grief, suffering, sadness, and bad and difficult thing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says, which means,<br />
<em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;But whosoever turns away from My Reminder (i.e. neither believes in this Qur&#8217;an nor acts on its orders, etc.) verily, for him is a life of hardship.&#8221;</span></em>(Taha, 20:124)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;My Reminder&#8221; is His words, which He revealed to His Messenger, and &#8220;turns away&#8221; is by neglecting and abandoning working according to these words, and the majority of explanations saw that &#8220;life of hardship&#8221; is torture in the grave. Ibn Mas&#8217;ud, Abu Hurairah, Abu Sa&#8217;eed AI-Khudry, and Ibn &#8216;Abbas agreed on that and it has a traceable hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This life of hardship is in return for relieving the body and soul with pleasures, desires and relief. The more you enrich the soul, it will restrain the heart until you live a life of hardship, and the more you restrain the soul, it will enrich the heart until that heart will be delighted and relieved. Hardship in this worldly life, following piety will find its relief in partition and the Hereafter, and relief in this worldly life following desires will find its hardship in the partition and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should choose one of the two: the better, more pleasant, and more lasting.You may distress the body in order to relieve the soul but do not distress the soul to relieve the body; relief and distress of the soul is greater and more lasting while relief and distress of the body is shorter and easier.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A Precious Gem: This Life of Deception</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This worldly life is like an unchaste woman, who is not satisfied with one husband. So! be satisfied with whatever Allah grants you from this worldy life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Walking thereon is like walking in a land that is filled with beasts, and water that teams with crocodiles. That which causes delight, turns to be the source of grief. Pain is found in the midst of pleasures, and delights are derived from its sorrows. As a bird sees the wheat, so does one&#8217;s insight perceive polytheism, while vain desires render its holder blind. Lusts were granted in abundance to humans, but those who believed in the unseen turned away from them! while those who follow their lusts were caused to regret.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first category, are those, in which Allah says,which means, &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">They are on (true) guidance from their Lord, and they are the successful.</span>&#8221; (AI-Baqarah, 2:5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the other category, are those to whom Allah says which means, <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;(0 you disbelievers)! Eat and enjoy yourselves (in this worldly life) for a little while. Verily, you are the Mujrimun (polytheists, disbelievers, sinners, criminals, etc.).&#8221;</span> (AI-Mursalat,77:46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the successful ones are aware of the reality of this worldly life being sure of the inferiority of its degree, they overcame their vain desires for the sake of the Hereafter. They have been awakened from their heedlessness to remember what their enemies took from them during their period of idleness. Whenever they perceive the distant journey they must undertake, they remember their aim, so it appears easy for them. Whenever life becomes bitter, they remember this verse, in which Allah says,  which means,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;This is your Day which you were promised&#8221;.</span> (Al Anbiya&#8217;, 21:103)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Source</strong>: Al-Fawaaid – A COLLECTION OF WISE SAYINGS – Imam Ibn AI-Qayyim,</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"> Rendered into English by: Bayan Translation Services</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In order for a place to contain something, it must be free from whatever contradicts it. This principle appljes to mankind and all creation as well as to belief and desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if the heart is obsessed by belief in falsehood, there will be no place for truth. Accordingly, if the tongue is involved in trivial discourse, one shall be incapable of useful speech, unless falsehood is abandoned.Hence, if the body is busy doing wrong actions, then acts of worship will be inapplicable unless these contradictory actions are abandoned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is how this principle is applied to concrete objects, and it is also applied to belief and religion. If the heart deviates from loving Allah, lacks yearning for Him and longing for His closeness, then the removal of contradictory feelings, like being related to other than Allah, is the only way for this heart to be overwhelmed by love for Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For the tongue to remember Allah, and the body to serve Him, one should be free of the impact of others like being busy remembering and serving them. Thus, if the heart is overwhelmed by the servants rather than the master, and is preoccupied with futile knowledge, surely there will be no place for being closer to Allah, or being acquainted with His Names, Attributes and judgments.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the heart listens to trivial discourse, there will be no place for listening or understanding the words of Allah. Besides, if the heart is inclined to love others, there will be no room to love Allah, and if the heart remembers others rather than Allah, no place will be found to remember Him, and the same applies to the tongue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhary recorded that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, <strong>&#8220;It is better for any of you that the inside of his body be filled with pus which may consume his body, than it be filled with poetry&#8221;</strong>&#8216; [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Prophetic tradition explained that it is possible that the inside of one&#8217;s body may be filled with poetry, which means that it might be exposed to suspicion, doubts, illusions, uncertainties, futile knowledge, and trivial discourse. So, if the heart is filled with such things, the facts of the Quran and precious knowledge, which cause happiness and perfection in mankind, will find no room in that heart.If a heart receives advice but it is filled with what contradicts it, there will be no place in that heart to accept this advice. The advice will simply pass over this heart and not be able to settle in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Recorded by AI-Bukhary, in His Sahib, Book of AI-Adab (Good Manners and Form), Chapter on not recommending poetry, no. (6154), and recorded by Muslim in His Sahib no. (2258)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Among those who remember Allah are those who begin remembering with the tongue even if he is negligent. He continues to do so until his heart is involved too.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Others do not agree with that and do not start while in a state of negligence, but instead wait until the heart is ready. He begins with his heart and then involves his tongue in remembrance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first supplication goes from his tongue to his heart and the second from his heart to his tongue without emptying any of the contents of his heart. He just waits until he feels that the utterance is ready to be verbalized. When he feels that his heart will utter! then the heart&#8217;s utterance would pass to verbal utterance. Then he would engross himself in that until he finds that every part of his being is supplicating Allah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The best and more useful kind of supplication is what the heart and tongue are involved in, to be from among the prophetic supplications, and whoever is reciting it feels its meaning and aims.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>A Precious Gem: You are my Protector in this Life and in the Hereafter</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;">Source: Al-Fawaaid – A COLLECTION OF WISE SAYINGS – Imam Ibn AI-Qayyim,</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"> Rendered into English by: Bayan Translation Services</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Allah says that Yusuf (Joseph, peace be upon him) said, which means,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;You are my Wali (Protector, Helper, Supporter, Guardian, etc.) in this world and in the Hereafter, cause me to die as a Muslim (the one submitting to Your Will), and join me with the righteous.&#8221; </span>(Yusuf, 12: 101)</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">أَنتَ وَلِيِّي فِي الدُّنُيَا وَالآخِرَةِ تَوَفَّنِي مُسْلِمًا وَأَلْحِقْنِي بِالصَّالِحِينَ</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">Anta waliyyee fid-dunya wal-akhirati tawaffanee musliman waalhiqnee bissaliheen </span>(Yusuf, 12: 101)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This    supplication    combined    the    acknowledgment    of monotheism, submission to Allah, showing one&#8217;s need for Him, being free of taking any supporters other than Him, expressing that dying while being a Muslim is the greatest aim of any servant. This entails acknowledging that we are in the hands ofAllah and not in the hands of any servant, confessing the truth of the Resurrection, and asking to join with the righteous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The below is take from Tafseer Ibn Kathir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Yusuf begs Allah to die as A Muslim</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the invocation of Yusuf, the truthful one, to his Lord the Exalted and Most Honored. He invoked Allah after His favor was complete on him by being reunited with his parents and brothers, after He had bestowed on him prophethood and kingship. He begged his Lord the Exalted and Ever High, that as He has perfected His bounty on him in this life, to continue it until the Hereafter. He begged Him that, when he dies, he dies as a Muslim, as Ad-Dahhak said, and to join him with the ranks of the righteous, with his brethren the Prophets and Messengers, may Allah&#8217;s peace and blessings be on them all. It is possible that Yusuf, peace be upon him, said this supplication while dying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">In the Two Sahihs it is recorded that `A&#8217;ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said that while dying, the Messenger of Allah was raising his finger and said &#8211; thrice, ثَلَاثًا (<strong>O Allah to Ar-Rafiq Al-A`la</strong> ﴿the uppermost, highest company in heaven﴾.)</span> It is also possible that long before he died, Yusuf begged Allah to die as a Muslim and be joined with the ranks of the righteous.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The servant exists between hands of Allah at two times: while standing during performing prayer and standing on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever fulfills the rights of the first standing, will in fact be facilitating the second one, and whoever considers this easy and does not pay due attention to it, he will be making the other one difficult for himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Almighty says, which means,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And during night, prostrate yourself to Him (i.e.the offering of Maghrib and &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayers), and glorify Him a long night through (i.e. Tahajjud prayer). Verily! These (disbelievers) love the present life of this world, and put behind them a heavy Day (that will be hard).&#8221;</span> (AI-Insan, 76:26-27)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Faith has both apparent and hidden aspects. Its apparent aspect is when it is related by the tongue and acted upon by the body. The hidden aspect is the acknowledgment of the heart, and its submission and love. Therefore, the apparent aspect of faith will be of no use for someone who does not have the hidden aspect, though his blood is spared and his wealth and children are preserved by it. And no hidden aspect will be of any use, unless there is no fear that it will be weakened, coerced or in fear of being ruined. Therefore, the failure of apparent deeds without the existence of any real prevention, means the corruption of the hidden aspect and lack of faith. Its deficiency refers to its deficiency of faith and intensity refers to its intensity of faith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, faith is the heart and core of Islam, and certainty is the heart and core of faith.<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> Any piece of knowledge or deed that does not make faith and certainty stronger is abnormal, and any faith that does not urge one to perform good deeds is abnormal.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Source : </strong>Imam Ibn AI-Qayyim, <strong>Kitab al Fawa&#8217;id pg. 6-8</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This chapter clearly shows that Allah, the Exalted returns the same body that had obeyed or disobeyed Him in life, in  order to reward or punish it just like He rewards the soul itself, which believes in Him and punishes the one, which disbelieves in Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That does not mean that Allah, the Exalted creates another soul, which will be rewarded or punished, as some people say.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such people do not understand the nature of the  Resurrection, which the Messengers informed mankind about.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They claim that Allah, the Exalted will create another body that is different in all aspects and that Allah will reward or punish it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They also say that the soul is simply a part of the body, so Allah will create another soul other than this one and a body other than this body.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This belief is contrary to what the Messengers taught, and what the Qur&#8217;an, Sunnah, and other Books of Allah, the Exalted say. This is in fact denial of the Resurrection and adopting the belief of the disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such people find it difficult to comprehend that Allah, the Exalted will recreate the very same body and soul that had known life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They cannot imagine how the body will  become bones and dust and Allah will create it again in its original form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah quotes them as saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">أَإِذَا مِتْنَا وَكُنَّا تُرَابًا وَعِظَامًا أَإِنَّا لَمَبْعُوثُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">which means, &#8220;When we are dead and have become dust and  bones, shall we (then) verily be resurrected? (As-Saffat, 37:16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And such people also say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ذَٰلِكَ رَجْعٌ بَعِيدٌ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">which means, &#8221; That is a far return.&#8221; (Qaf, 50:3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If what they assert is true and another body other than  the one that had known in life is rewarded or punished, this will neither be Resurrection nor returning back, indeed, it would be a new creation altogether.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the following verse would be rendered meaningless. May Allah forbid!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">قَدْ عَلِمْنَا مَا تَنقُصُ الْأَرْضُ مِنْهُمْ ۖ وَعِندَنَا كِتَابٌ حَفِيظٌ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">which means, &#8220;We know that which the earth takes of them (their dead bodies). 11 (Qaf, 50:4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah answered the question that He, the Exalted will separate these pieces which had mixed with the earth and turned it into elements which are difficult to be separated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allah, the Exalted told mankind that He knows what the earth is taking from their flesh, bones, and hair and just as He knows these pieces He is capable of separating, and gathering them after being separated, and creating them again.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Exalted decides the time of Resurrection by His perfect knowledge, power, and wisdom.</p>

<div style="text-align:justify;">
<div>Source: Imam Ibn al Qayyim, AI-Fawa&#8217;id, A COLLECTION OF WISE SAYINGS , Rendered into English by: Bayan Translation Services</div>
<p>[Read <a title="A Precious and Valuable Gem: The (Religious) Scholar Whose Deeds are Inconsistent with his Knowledge" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com//2010/03/24/a-precious-and-valuable-gem-the-religious-scholar-whose-deeds-are-inconsistent-with-his-knowledge/">A Precious and Valuable Gem: The (Religious) Scholar Whose Deeds are Inconsistent with his Knowledge</a> – Imam Ibn al Qayyim ]</p>
<p>We have previously mentioned the case of the religious scholar who prefers this worldly life rather than the Hereafter. However, the mistake of the ignorant worshipper is rejecting knowledge, its verdicts, and his adherence to imagination and vain desires.</p>
<p>Sufyan bin &#8216;Uyainah and others said,</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<blockquote>
<div>&#8220;Beware of the trial of the immoral (religious) scholar and that of the ignorant worshipper, for both are apparent trials. The latter avoids knowledge out of ignorance, and the former calls for wrong doings out of immorality&#8221;.</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, sets the example of the ignorant worshiper in the Qur&#8217;anic verse by saying,which means,</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Their allies deceived them) like Shai!an (Satan), when he says to man: &#8220;Disbelieve in Allah.&#8221; But when (man) disbelieves in Allah, Shaitan (Satan) says: &#8220;I am free of you, I fear Allah, the Lord of the &#8216;Alamin (mankind, jinns and all that exists)! So the end of both will be that they will be in the Fire, abiding therein. Such is the recompense of the ZalimOn (i.e. polytheists, wrong-doers, disbelievers in Allah and in His Oneness, etc.).&#8221;</span> (AI-Hashr, 59:16-17)</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">His story is well known, for he has based his life on worshipping Allah unknowingly, so Satan seized the opportunity and seduced him causing his disbelief. So, this is the end of every ignorant worshipper who unconsciously disbelieves, and the other one is the final end of every immoral scholar who prefers this worldly life rather than the Hereafter.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The religious scholars who prefer and Love this worldly life shall surely speak other than the truth concerning their judgments and religious verdicts. Verily, the judgments of Allah usually contradict the desires of people especially the rulers and those who follow their whims, as their aims cannot be attained except by opposing the truth.</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, if the ruler and the religious scholar seek position and power and follow their desires, indeed they will not be able to fulfill their aims except by deviating from the truth, especially if there is a doubtful matter involved. The doubtful matter will agree with the desires of man, and vanity will prevail. As a result, righteousness will disappear, and truth will vanish.</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there is no doubtful matter in the truth, so how can wrong doers dare to oppose it openly, assuming that they will be able to repent afterwards. Such behavior is mentioned in a Qur&#8217;anic verse in which Allah says, which means,</p>
<div style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who have given up As-Salat (the prayers) [i.e. made their Salat (prayers) to be lost, either by not offering them or by not offering them perfectly or by not offering them at their proper fixed times, etc.] and have followed lusts.&#8221;</span> (Mariam, 19:59)</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were also mentioned in another verse, in which Allah says,which means,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Then after them succeeded an (evil) generation, which inherited the Book, but they chose (for themselves) the goods of this low life (evil pleasures of this world) saying (as an excuse): &#8220;(Everything) will be forgiven to us. And if (again) the offer of the like (evil pleasures of this world) came their way, they would (again) seize them (would commit those sins). Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them that they would not say about Allah anything but the truth? And they have studied what is in it (the Book). And the home of the Hereafter is better for those who are AI-Muttaqun (the pious). Do not you then understand?&#8217;</span>1 (Al-A&#8217;raf, 7:169)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, informs us that those wrong doers have chosen the goods of this low life (the evil pleasures of this world) despite being aware of its unlawfulness. Moreover, they say, as an excuse, &#8220;(Everything) will be forgiven to us.And if (again) the offer of the like (evil pleasures of this world) came their way, they would (again) seize them (would commit those sins), so they are insistent upon that, and that is the reason why they dare to utter falsehood against Allah, assuming that the judgment and the religion of Allah are implied therein.Either they know the fact that the religion and the judgment of Allah contradict their claims, or they do not know. The result is that sometimes they utter falsehood against Allah, or else they say what is unlawful.On the other hand, the pious know quite well that the Hereafter is better than this worldly life, so loving leadership and following one&#8217;s desires would not be a temptation to them, so they would never prefer this worldly life to the Hereafter. They have only one path, which is abiding by the Glorious Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah. Besides, they seek help in patience and prayer, think deeply about this worldly life, its transient nature and its inferiority, and they compare it with the Hereafter, its greatness and the fact that it is eternal.Following one&#8217;s desires can blind the heart in a way that makes it confused between the Sunnah and innovation in religion. Sometimes, one may be confused whether or not an action is based on the Sunnah or on an innovation in religion. In fact, when misunderstandings like this occur, it is the fault of religious scholars as they prefer this worldly life and follow the rulers, and their vain desires.They are mentioned in these verses in which Allah says,which means,</p>
<div style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And recite (O Muhammad Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam)) to them the story of him to whom We gave Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), but he threw them away, so Shaitan (Satan) followed him up, and he became of those who went astray. And had We willed, We would surely have elevated him therewith but he clung to the earth and followed his own vain desire. So his description is the description of a dog: if you drive him away, he lolls his tongue out, or it you leave him alone, he (still) lolls his tongue out&#8221;</span> (Al-A&#8217;raf, 7: 175¬176)</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this is the likeness of the devious scholar of religion whose deeds contradict his knowledge.The previous verses dispraised this behavior as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>One</strong>: He has gone astray after having been knowledgeable, and he has knowingly chosen disbelief over faith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Two</strong>: He abandoned faith entirely with no return, so, he threw away the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), like the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">serpent which throws away its skin</span>.So, if there was any remnant thereof, he could not throw it away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Three</strong>: Satan controlled him and so he tempted and seduced him, and that is why Allah says, &#8220;Satan followed him up, and He did not say, pursue him&#8221;, because following up means reaching and attaining him, which is much more eloquent than saying, &#8220;pursue him,&#8221; as far as meaning and expression are concerned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Four</strong>: He has erred after having been guided, which means that he has gone astray in knowledge and in intention, which is related to the corruption of his intention and deeds. Going astray is related to the corruption of knowledge and belief, and the corruption of one side entails the corruption of the other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Five</strong>: If Allah, the Exalted, had so willed, He could have elevated him with knowledge, which would have prevented his destruction. In other words, if he was not knowledgeable, it would have been much better for him, and would have meant a lesser torment for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Six</strong>: Allah, the Exalted, informed us about his wicked intention, mentioning that he has preferred inferiority rather than the most honorable and the most righteous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Seven</strong>: His inferior choice was not chosen because of an idea that crossed his mind, on the contrary, it was chosen due to his desire to cling  to the earth. Clinging means permanent adherence, as if it was said, &#8220;He is sticking to the earth.&#8221; The Qur&#8217;anic expression described his inclination to this worldly life by referring to his clinging to the earth, because the worldly life is the earth, and those who are living therein, and everything that can be extracted thereof, either for adornment or enjoyment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Eight</strong>: He deviated from the right path following his vain desires, so his own desire resembles a leader who should be followed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Nine</strong>: He, the Almighty compared him to a dog, which is the most low amongst creatures, because of its greed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ten</strong>: He compares his <span style="text-decoration:underline;">covetousness </span>to this worldly life and his <span style="text-decoration:underline;">impatience </span>thereto and his grief of being deprived thereof by the lolling out of the dog&#8217;s tongue, whether it is left alone or driven away. Accordingly, if that person is left alone, then he will be covetous of this worldly life, and if he is advised he will still be covetous. of this worldly life. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">He clings to covetousness like the dog with its tongue lolling out</span>. Ibn Qutaibiyah said, &#8220;Surely everyone pants because they are exhausted or thirsty, except dogs, for it is their habit to pant while lolling their tongues out in all cases, whether they are exhausted or not, and whether they are thirsty or not, and that is why the Qur&#8217;anic expression compared it to the disbeliever, asserting that he has gone astray whether he is advised or left on his own. This is like the dog whether it is left alone or driven away.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Source</strong> : Al-Fawa&#8217;id A Collection Of Wise Sayings Imam Ibn Al-Qayyim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are two kinds of meeting between friends:<br />
The first is a meeting based on sociability and spending time, in which are more disadvantages than advantage, the least of which is corruption of the heart, and wasting time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Second kind is a meeting for the sake of supporting one another, and recommending one another to the truth and to patience. This is the best kind, yet there are still three disadvantages therein,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Flattering each other.<br />
2. Being excessively talkative.<br />
3. That such meetings become a habit or routine and they fail to achieve their aims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Enjoying health, this worldly life, status, a wife or children, then surely those feelings are temporary and will eventually dissipate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are three kinds of passive feelings, which affect the heart and they are either related to the past, which causes sorrow, or related to the future so as to cause grief, of finally related to the present so as to cause distress.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the heart is not pure or honourable enough, and distance from every evil and malice, then it is unworthy to love, know and aspire to Allah. On the contrary, the lowest description of man&#8217;s heart is that he loves and aspires to this worldly life instead to Allah, the Almighty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When man&#8217;s love, knowledge and aspiration is directed in this worldly way, the heart becomes narrow and gloomy as it is distant from the source of its revival and life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Subsequently, the hearts of man can be divided into two kinds, the first of which is the heart of those, who incline to the Beneficent, which is the source of brightness, life, happiness, pleasure, delight and blessings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second one is the throne of the devil where narrowness, darkness, death, sorrow, distress and grief are settled therein. This heart is obsessed by sorrow for the past, and grief and distress for the present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In order for a place to contain something, it must be free from whatever contradicts it. This principle applies to mankind and all creation as well as to belief and desires.So, if the hearts is obsessed by belief in falsehood, there will be no place for truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, if the tongue is involved in trivial discourse, one shall be incapable of useful speech, unless falsehood is abandoned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, if the body is busy doing wrong actions, then acts of worship will be inapplicable unless these contradictory actions are abandoned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Stand firm against evil thoughts, for if you fail to do so, they will become ideas, if you do not, they will become desires, so fight against them. If you do not, they will become a form of determination and intention, if you do not resist, they will become actions, and if you do not follow them up with their opposite, they will become habits that will be hard to quit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, who did not make use of his eye, did not make use of his ear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The servant has a veil between him and Allah and another one between him and people. Whoever tore this veil between him and Allah, Allah will tear the veil between him and people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The servant has a Lord that he will stand in front of and a house that he will live in, so he must seek the pleasure of Allah before meeting Him and he should furnish his house before moving into it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Loosing time is harder than death, as loosing time keeps you away from Allah and the Hereafter, while death keeps you away from worldly life and people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The whole world from its beginning until its end is not worth an hour of sadness, so what about the sadness of whole life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What we love today will catch up with what we hate tomorrow, and what we hate today will catch up with what we love tomorrow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most precious reward during life is to busy yourself with most suitable and useful matters in their exact and suitable time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can he be rational who sells Paradise and what is in it, for one hour of passing pleasure?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The pious man will leave this worldly life while he did not obtain satisfaction in two matters: crying for himself and praising Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you are afraid of any creature, you will run away from it. When you are afraid of Allah, you will love Him and seek to be close to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If knowledge is useful without actions, Allah, the Exalted would never have dispraised the people of the book, and if actions were useful without devotions, He would never have have dispraised the hypocrite.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Piety has Three Levels</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Protecting the heart and limbs against sin and forbidden actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Protecting them against undesirable matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Protecting against curiosity and whatever is not of one&#8217;s concern.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first will grant life to the servant, the second will grant his health and power, and the third will grant him happiness and joy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sea of pleasures may drown its owner and the swimmer fears to open his eyes under water.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Passing days are like dreams, the coming ones are wishes, and the time separating them is wasted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Buy for yourself (through doing good deeds) while there is still a market and you have the ability to buy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you do not work hard and face difficulties along your way in seeking glory, you will never taste honor and relief when you attain victory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was said to one of the worshippers: You are tiring yourself so much! He said: I want to achieve comfort from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The human being was honoured with blessings of faith and good health, but he misused them, so they were justly taken away from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The truth will only be shown to perceptive people who will use the light of their minds to see the consequences of the matters they face.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The pleasures of life are similar to brides who are dressing for those who will prefer and choose; them or the brides (rewards) of the Hereafter, and whoever knows the significant difference between the two, will choose the best (the Hereafter).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Affliction are but trials by which the faithful are distinguished from the unfaithful, and if you were to succeed therein, they would be turned to supporters by which you could attain your objective.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one can indulge in unlawfulness except for two reasons, the first of which is failing to trust in Allah, despite the fact that if one obeys Him, he will surely be granted the best of lawful gains.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second reason is knowing that whoever abandons anything for the sake of Allah, surely He will grant him something better than what he has abandon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unfortunately, his vain desires surpass his patience and his inclination overpowers his mind, The first one has poor knowledge, and the second one has poor insight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can one feel secure, who has an unmerciful wife, an unforgiving son, a distrusting neighbour, a friend who gives no advice, a partner who misjudges him, an enemy whose hostility never ceases, a soul that is inclined to evil, an adorned world, vain desires, influential lusts, furious anger, the deception of Satan, and controlling weakness? If Allah rescued and guided him, all those problems would be under control, and if Allah deserted and abandoned him, leaving him on his own, all these distresses would cause his destruction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He who tastes the pleasure of good health, surely the bitterness of patience will become easy for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The aim has priority in estimation, it is the last in existence, it is the principle according to the mind, and it is the end of the journey.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">“Jihâd (striving) against the soul has four stages:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: To strive in learning guidance and the religion of truth, without which there will be no success. Indeed, there can be no true happiness, nor any delight in this world and in the Herefater, except through it.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: Striving to act upon what has been learnt, since knowledge without action will not benefit, rather it will cause harm.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>: Striving to invite others towards it and to teach those who do not know, otherwise he may be considered from those who hide what Allâh has revealed of guidance and clear explanation. Such knowledge will neither benefit, nor save a person from the punishment of Allâh.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourthly</strong>: Striving to be patient and persevering against those who oppose this <em> da’wah</em> (call) to Allâh and those who seek to cause harm &#8211; patiently bearing all these hardships for the sake of Allâh.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">When these four stages are completed then such a person is considered to be amongst the<strong><em> Rabbâniyyûn</em></strong>. The <em>Salaf</em> were agreed that a Scholar does not deserve the title of <em>Rabbânî</em> until he recognises and knows the truth, acts upon it, and teaches it to others. So whosoever has knowledge, acts upon it, and teaches this knowledge to others, is considered from the <em>Rabbâniyyûn</em>.” [<em>Zâdul-Ma’âd fi Hadî Khayril-’Ibâd</em> (pp.9-11)]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Complaint Of The Ignorant Person<br />
[From ‘al-Fawaa·id’ (p.114) of Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim -rahimahullaah]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The ignorant person complains about Allaah to the people, and this is the limit of ignorance of the One complained about and the one complained to; for if he had known his Lord he would not have complained concerning Him, and if knew the people he would not complain to them.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the Salaf saw a man complaining to another man about his poverty and need, so he said: ‘O person! By Allaah! You have not done anything more than complain about One Who is Merciful to you, to one who is not merciful to you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In that regard it has been said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘If you make a complaint to the son of Aadam, </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>then you are only complaining about the Merciful One to someone who is not merciful.’</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the one who is truly aware complains to Allaah alone; and the one who is the most aware, from those who are truly aware, is the one who makes his complaints to Allaah about himself, not about the people; so he is therefore complaining about the reasons which cause the people to overwhelm him. So he is looking to His Saying -He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#008000;">And whatever misfortune befalls you, then it is because of the sins that your hands have committed</span>.] [Sooratush-Shooraa (42):30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#008000;">Whatever good reaches you, is from Allaah; but whatever evil befalls you, then it is on account of yourself.</span>] [Sooratun-Nisaa· (4):79]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#008000;">Why is it that when a single disaster struck you, even though you had struck the enemy with one twice as great, you said: ‘From where is this?’ Say: ‘It is on account of yourselves.’</span>] [Soorah Aal `Imraan (3):165]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So the levels are three</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>the lowest/most despicable of them is that you complain about Allaah to His creation; and </strong></span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>the highest of them is that you complain about yourself to Him; and </strong></span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>al-Fawaa’id, pp 151-152, Al-Istiqaamah, No. 2</strong></p>
<div>Your life in the present moment is in between the past and the future.</div>
<div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what has preceded can be rectified by tawbah (repentance), nadam (regret) and istighfar (seeking Allaah’s forgiveness). And this is something that will neither tire you, nor cause you to toil as you would with strenuous labour. Rather it is an action of the heart.Then as regards the future (then it can be corrected) by withholding yourself from sins. And this abandonment is merely the leaving of something and to be at ease from it. This also is not action of the limbs, which requires you to strive and toil. Rather this is a firm resolve and intention of the heart – which will give rest to your body, heart and thoughts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So as for what has preceded, then you rectify it with repentance. And as for the future – then you rectify it with firm resolve and intention. Neither of these involves any hardship or exertion of the limbs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But then your attention must be directed to your life in the present &#8211; the time between two times. If you waste it, then you have wasted the opportunity to be of the fortunate and saved ones. If you look after it, having rectified the two times – what is before and after it, as we have said – then you will be successful and achieve rest, delight and ever-lasting bliss. However, looking after it is harder than that which comes before and after it, since guarding it involves keeping to that which is most befitting and beneficial for your soul, and that which will bring it success and well-being.</p>
</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Source</strong> :Class 42 from <a title="‘al-Qawl-ul- Mufeed Fee Adillatit-Tawhid’ [Beneficial Speech in Establishing the Evidences of Tawhid] – Shaykh Muhammad al-Wasabi" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/01/17/tawheed-lessons-wasabi/">Lessons on Tawhid &#8211; Approximately 50 Classes</a> &#8211; from Dar-ul-Hadith, Dammaj, Yemen new</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>These were lessons conducted on the book &#8216;al-Qawl-ul- Mufeed Fee Adillatit-Tawhid&#8217; [Beneficial Speech in Establishing the Evidences of Tawhid] written by one of the major scholars of the Sunnah in Yemen, Shaikh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhab al-Wasabi (may Allah preserve him).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Qisam al-Awwal (The First Category): </strong></p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>They do not want by this from the people a recompense or thankfulness, and nor do they seek a high position with them, and they do not seek praise and position in their heart, and they are not fleeing from their rebuke. Verily, they see the people [who are alive] in the position of the people of the grave, those who do not control for them harm or benefit, or life or death, or resurrection. So actions for the people, and seeking a position with them,and hoping in harm or benefit from them [i.e. the general people], is not from them [i.e. these category of people]. Verily, it is from those who are ignorant of the situation and ignorant of their Lord. And whoever knows the people and puts them in their proper places, and knows Allaah, is sincere in his actions and his statements and his givings and his forgivings and his love and his hatred. So no one does actions and deeds for the creation other than Allaah except that he is ignorant of Allaah and ignorant of the creation. For verily, the one who knows Allaah and knows the people prefers actions and deeds for Allaah over actions and deeds for the people.</li>
<li>So their actions, all of them, are for Allaah, and all of their statements are for Allaah, and their giving and their forgiving is for Allaah, and their love is for Allaah and their hatred is for Allaah, and their actions, both in the apparent and the hidden, are for the face of Allaah alone.</li>
<li>Those who have gathered between Ikhlaas (sincerity) and Mutaabi’ah (following the guidance of the Prophet).</li>
<li>And like this their actions, all of them, and their worship is in agreement with the command of Allaah, and with what He loves and what He is Pleased with. And Allaah does not accept from the people any action except this. And Allaah has tested His servants with life and death, so He said: Who has created death and life, that He may test you which of you is best in deed. (Al-Mulk 67:2)</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He has made that which is upon the earth as a beauty for them upon the earth so that He may test them which of them are best in actions and deeds. al-Fudayl ibn ‘Iyyaad said: A beautiful action (al-‘Amal al-Hasan) is that which is sincere (Akhlasuh) and that which is correct (Aswabuh).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: Oh Abaa ‘Alee, what is sincere and what is correct? He said: Verily, if the action is sincere (Khaalis) but it is not correct (Sawaab): it is not accepted (Lam Yuqbal), and if it is correct but it is not sincere: it is not accepted, until it is sincere and correct. And a sincere [action] is: that which is for Allaah, and a correct [action] is: that which is upon the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is mentioned in His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord. (Al-Kahf 18:110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in His (ta’aalaa) statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And who can be better in religion than one who submits his face (himself) to Allaah (i.e. follows Allaah&#8217;s Religion of Islaamic Monotheism); and he is a Muhsin (a good-doer). And follows the religion of Ibraaheem (Abraham) Haneefaa (Islaamic Monotheism &#8211; to worship none but Allaah Alone). (An-Nisaa’ 4:125)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah does not accept from the actions except that which is done sincerely seeking His Face, and that which is in agreement with His Order, and other than this is not accepted, rather it is repelled back on the person who does it at a time when he is in most need of it, and it is turned intoscattered ashes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in as-Saheehayn [i.e. al-Bukhaaree and Muslim] from the narration of ‘Aa’ishah (radiyAllaahu ‘anhaa) who narrated from the Prophet (Peace be Upon him), that he said: ((Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it will have it rejected)). And in the narration from Muslim: ((Whoever does a deed that is not ordered by us will have it rejected)).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So every action that is not in agreement [with the Sunnah], then it does not increase its doer except in distance away from Allaah, for verily Allaah (ta’aalaa) is only worshipped with what He has ordered to be worshipped with, not with opinions (Aaraa’) and desires (Ahwaa’).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Qisam ath-Thaanee (The Second Category): </strong></p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Those who have no sincerity and have no adherence to the Sunnah,so their actions and deeds are not in agreement with the legislation, and they are not sincere to the One who is worshipped.</li>
<li>They are like the ones who beautify themselvesto the people, showing-off to them with that which Allaah has not decreed and that which the Messenger has not informed the people of. And they are the evilest of creation (Shiraarul-Khalq).</li>
<li>And they are the most disliked and the most hated of people to Allaah (‘azza wa jall), and they havethe biggest portion of His (ta’aalaa) statement: Think not that those who rejoice in what they have done (or brought about), and love to be praised for what they have not done,- think not you that they are rescued from the torment, and for them is a painful torment. (Aali Imraan3:188)</li>
<li>They are happy with what they do from innovation (Bid’ah) and misguidance (Dalaalah) and association (Shirk), and they love that they be praised as they are the followers of the Sunnah and the people of sincerity – and they are not from the people of the Sunnah or sincerity (Ahlus-Sunnati wal-Ikhlaas) –</li>
<li>And this category of people are numerous, from the people who have gone astray from the ones who are alienated from the people of knowledge (‘Ilm), and poverty (Faqr), and worship (‘Ibaadah), from the Straight Path (Siraatul-Mustaqeem).</li>
<li>For verily they do actions of innovation and misguidance to show-off and to be heard-off, and they love to be praised for that which they have not done from the following of the Sunnah, and possessing sincerity and knowledge. So they are the people of hatred and misguidance (Ahlul-Ghadabi wad-Dalaal).</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Qisam ath-Thaalith (The Third Category)</strong>:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>The one who is sincere in his actions and deeds,but his actions and deeds are not in agreement with the order of Allaah.</li>
<li>And they are like the ignorant worshippers and the ones who are from the path of abstinence (Zuhud) and poverty (Faqr).</li>
<li>And they are the ones who worship Allaah with other than what He has decreed and legislated, and they believe that their worship is bringing them close to Allaah.</li>
<li>And they believe that listening to clapping and whistling is bringing them close to Allaah, and being isolated and leaving off the Jumu’ah [i.e. the Friday prayer] and the Jama’ah [i.e. the mandatory prayers] is also being close to Allaah, and continuing the fast until the night is also being close to Allaah, and fasting the two holidays (Siyaam al-‘Eedayn) of al-Islaam is also a way of being close to Allaah.</li>
<li>And they try to get close to Allaah with actions of innovation (Bid’ah) and disobedience (Ma’aasee).</li>
<li>So the sincerity of a person in this state does not benefit him because these actions that he does are from the actions of innovation. And the actions of the innovator are not accepted, and the proof being in the Hadeeth of Umm-ul-Mu’mineen ‘Aa’ishah (radiyAllaahu ‘anhaa), raised to the saying of the Prophet (Peace be upon him): ((Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it will have it rejected)). Agreed Upon [i.e. reported by al-Bukhaaree and Muslim].</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Qisam ar-Raabi’ (The Fourth Category):</strong></p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>The one whose actions are in accordance with the Sunnah, but they are for the sake of other than Allaah.</li>
<li>Such as obedience of the ones who show-off, and like the ones who fight to show-off, and because of great pride and great courageousness. And he does the Hajj so that it may be said that he has performed the Hajj.</li>
<li>And he reads the Qur’aan so that it may be said that he reads the Qur’aan.</li>
<li>And the actions of these people, from the apparent they seem righteous, but they are not righteous since they are performed for other than the sake of Allaah, so they are not accepted. Allaah (ta’aalaa) said: And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allaah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him). (Al-Baiyinah 98:5)</li>
<li>So they have not been ordered except that they worship Allaah with that which He has legislated and with sincerity to Him in all their worship.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the people of sincerity and adherence (Ahlul-Ikhlaas wal-Mutaabi’ah), they are the people of:You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything). (Al-Faatihah 1:5)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn al-Qayyim</strong> (rahimahullah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Sin may be more beneficial for a person, <strong>if</strong> it leads him to repent, than doing a lot of acts of worship. This is what is meant by the words of one of the salaf:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8216;A person may commit a sin and enter Paradise because of it, or he may do an act of worship and enter Hell because of it.&#8217;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: &#8216;How is that?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8216;He may commit a sin and continues to think about it, and when he stands or sits or walks he remembers his sin, so he feels ashamed and repents and seeks forgiveness and regrets it, so that will be the means of his salvation.<br />
And he may do a good deed and continue to think about it, and when he stands or sits or walks he remembers it and it fills him with self-admiration and pride, so it is the cause of his doom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the sin may be the factor that leads him to do acts of worship and good deeds and to change his attitude so that he fears Allah and feels shy before Him and feels humiliated before Him, hanging his head in shame and weeping with regret, seeking he forgiveness of his Lord. Each of these effects is better for a person than an act of worship that makes him feel proud and show off and look down on people. Undoubtedly this sin is better before Allah and is more likely to bring salvation than one who admires himself and looks down on others, and who thinks that he is doing Allah a favour. Even if he says words that indicate something other than that, Allah is the Witness over what is in his heart. Such a person may feel hatred towards people if they do not hold him in high esteem and humiliate themselves before him. If he were to examine himself honestly, he would see that clearly.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Most High says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And certainly we shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to As-Sabirun (the patient). Who, when afflicted with calamity, say, “Inna Lillahi Wa Inna Ilaihi raji’un (Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return).” They are those o­n whom are the Salawat ( i.e who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and ( they are those who) receive His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided o­nes.&#8221;</span> Surah Al-Baqarah 2:155-157</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he (i.e. Ibn Al- Qayyim) mentioned the <strong>Hadeeth of Al-Istirja</strong> and then he said: <strong>This expression is o­ne of the most effective and most beneficial treatments for o­ne who is afflicted by calamities</strong>, because it contains two fundamental principles, which if they are realized, the slave will be consoled thereby from his calamity.(Al- Istirja’: saying the words: “<em>Inna Lillahi Wa Inna Ilaihi raji’un</em>”) Verily, we are for Allah and to Him we shall return. This Hadeeth was narrated by Muslim and Ahmad, o­n the authority of Umm Salamah radi Allahu anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first of them is that the slave and his wealth belong to Allah and He has given it to him as a loan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second of them is that the return is to Allah and it is inevitable that he will leave the life of this world behind; so if this is his beginning and his end, then his thinking about them is o­ne of the greatest treatments for this illness and a part of his treatment is that he knows that what was ordained to afflict him cannot miss him and what was ordained to miss him cannot afflict him.And a part of it is that his Lord has set aside for him the like of that which he missed or better and He has stored up for him that which is many times better than the calamity and that if He had willed, He could have made the calamity greater than it was.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another part of his extinguishing the fire of his misfortune by the coolness of comfort and consolation, so he should look to his right and to his left (i.e. at the world around him) and he should know that the pleasures of this life are an illusion, though they may cause him to laugh a little, they will cause him to weep much.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also a part of it is the knowledge that discontent does not alleviate the misfortune; indeed , it increases it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And another part of it is the knowledge that losing the reward which Allah has guaranteed for patience and Istirja’ is greater than it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And another part of the treatment is the knowledge that discontent causes his enemy to take pleasure and grieves his friend and makes his Lord Angry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Still another part of it is the knowledge that the pleasure which follows patient perseverance and the expectation of Allah’s Reward is many times greater than that which he would have experienced from the thing which he lost, if it had remained with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another part of it is that he should sooth his heart by seeking recompense for it from Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And a part of it is the knowledge that his reaction to the calamity will determine what happens to him, for whoever accepts( Allah’s Qadr), Allah will be pleased with him and whoever is angry at it, Allah will be angry with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also a part of the treatment is the knowledge that even if he was patient sometime after the calamity struck, that being the patience of the o­ne who is resigned, that is not praiseworthy and it is not rewarded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another part of it is the knowledge that o­ne of the most effective medicines is the success granted by Allah in attaining that which He loves and which is pleasing to Him and that it is the essence of love.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another part of it is for him to compare between the greater and the lesser of the two pleasures: between the pleasure which he enjoys due to (his acceptance of) the calamity which befell him and the pleasure which he enjoys due to the reward of Allah (which he receives due to his acceptance and patient perseverance).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And a part of it is the knowledge that the o­ne who put him to trial is the Best of judges and the Most Merciful of those who show mercy and that He has not subjected him to misfortune in order to destroy him, but in order to test him and to hear entreaties and see him prostrating at His door.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another part of it is the knowledge that misfortunes are a means of preventing sickness which will cause his destruction, such as pride, arrogance, and hardness of the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Still another part of it is the knowledge that the bitterness of this life is the sweetness of the afterlife and vice versa. And if this is not apparent to you, examine the words of the truthful o­ne, whose words are believed<em>:“Paradise is surrounded by hardships and the Hell-Fire is surrounded by temptations.”</em>(Narrated Muslim, At-Tirmidihi, Ahmad and Ad-Darimi, o­n the authority of Anas Ibn Malik radi Allahu anha).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in this matter, the minds of mankind are at fault and the reality of men is made clear (i.e. that they prefer the temporary pleasures of this world to the everlasting pleasures of the Hereafter).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Al-Ibaanah Magazine Issue No.3</strong><br />
Dhul-Qa’dah 1416H / April 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“(The Âyah): <strong>“You alone do we worship.”</strong> [Sûrah al-Fâtihah 1:5] is built upon four principles:- Ascertaining what Allâh and His Messenger love and are pleased with, from [i] the sayings of the heart and [ii] of the tongue; and [iii] the actions of the heart and [iv] of the limbs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So al-’ubûdiyyah (servitude and slavery to Allâh) is a comprehensive term for all these for stages. The one who actualises them has indeed actualised: <strong>“You alone do we worship.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The saying of the heart</strong>: It is i’tiqâd (belief) in what Allâh &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; informed about His Self; concerning His Names, His Attributes, His Actions, His Angels, and all that He sent upon the tongue of His Messenger sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The saying of the tongue</strong>: It is to inform and convey (what Allâh has revealed), to call to it, defend it, to explain the false innovations which oppose it, to establish its remembrance and to convey what it orders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The action of the heart</strong>: Such as love for Him, reliance upon Him, repenting to Him, having fear and hope in Him, making the Dîn purely and sincerely for Him, having patience in what He orders and prohibits, having patience with what He decrees and being pleased with it, having allegiance and enmity for His sake, humbling oneself in front of Him and having humility in front of Him, becoming tranquil with Him and other than this from the actions of the heart which are actually connected to the action of the limbs &#8230; and actions of the limbs without the action of the heart is of little benefit, if any benefit at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The action of the limbs</strong>: Such as Prayer and Jihâd, attending the Jumu’ah and being with the Jamâ’ah, aiding those who are unable and displaying goodness and kindness to the creation, and other than this.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Madârijus-Sâlikîn (1/100-101)]</p>
<p><strong>About the Shaykh :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">He is Abû ’Abdullâh, Shamsud-Dîn Muhammad ibn Abû Bakr better known as Ibn al-Qayyim (or Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah). He was born in the year 691H in the city of Damascus. From an early age he set about acquiring knowledge and studied under many prominent teachers, the most notable of whom was Shaykhul-Islâm Ibn Taymiyyah. His students include the likes of Ibn Kathîr, adh-Dhahabî, Ibn Bajab, Ibn ’Abdul-Hâdî and others. He authored over ninety books and booklets &#8211; all of them being characterised by their touching address to the soul and the heart, as well as their accuracy, precision and depth of research. Ibn al-Qayyim died on the night of Thursday 13th Rajab at the time of the ’Ishâ <i>adhân</i> in the year 751H. Testaments about his comprehensive knowledge, firm adherence to the way of the <i>Salaf</i>; excellent manners, worship and <i>zuhd</i> have been given by Al-Hâfidh Ibn Hajar in ad-<i>Dururul-Kâminah</i>(3/400), Al-Hâfidh Ibn Rajab in <i>Dhayl Tabaqâtul-Hanâbilah</i> (2/447), ash-Shawkânî in <i>al-Badrut-Tâli’</i> (2/143-146) and also Al-Hâfidh Ibn Kathîr who said about him in <i>al-Bidâyah wan-Nihâyah</i> (14/246): “He attained great proficiency in many branches of knowledge, particularly knowledge of <i>Tafsîr</i>, Hadîth and <i>Usûl</i>. When Shaykh Taqiyyud-Dîn Ibn Taymiyyah returned from Egypt in the year 712H, he stayed with the Shaykh until he died, learning a great deal of knowledge from him; along with the knowledge which he had already occupied himself in obtaining. So he became a singular Scholar in many branches of knowledge. He also continued to seek knowledge greatly day and night and was constant in humbly calling upon his Lord. He recited well and had fine manners. He had a great deal of love and did not harbour any envy for anyone, nor harm anyone, nor seek to find fault with anyone, nor bear any malice towards anyone. I was one of those who most often kept company with him and I was one of the most beloved of people to him. I do not know anyone in the world, in this time, who is a greater worshipper than him. His <i>Salâh</i> (Prayer) used to be very lengthy, with prolonged <i>rukû’</i> (bowing) and <i>sujûd</i> (prostration). His companions would often reproach him for this, yet he never retorted back, nor did he abandon this practice &#8211; may Allâh shower His Mercy upon him.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=":1nu">
<div dir="ltr">
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;">Source: From  &#8220;al-Waabil as-Sayyib&#8221;</span></p>
<p>On the authority of Suhaib (may Allaah be pleased with him) he said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Amazing is the affair of the believer, verily all of his affair is good and this is not for no one except the believer. If something of good/happiness befalls him he is grateful and that is good for him. If something of harm befalls him he is patient and that is good for him&#8221;</em> </span>(Saheeh Muslim #2999)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this we understand that the state of affairs for the believer changes in the life of this world. Shaykhul Islaam ibn Qayyim al-Jawzeeyah (may Allaah have mercy upon him) said regarding the state of affairs for the believer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>One of them</strong> is the state of (receiving a) blessing. It&#8217;s obligatory upon him (the believer) in this state (to display) the gratitude.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second</strong>: is the state (of being) tested. It is obligatory upon him (the believer) in this state (to observe) the patience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third:</strong> is the state (of committing) a sin. It is obligatory upon him (the believer) in this state to seek the forgiveness from it (the sin).</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The servant does not go outside of the fluctuation between these three states.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of them is either a blessing or a virtue from Allaah of good health, wealth, a child to other than that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">It is obligatory upon him that he thanks Allaah for this bounty. Let the servant contemplate over the statement of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;padding-left:30px;">&#8221; ٱعۡمَلُوٓاْ ءَالَ دَاوُ ۥدَ شُكۡرً۬اۚ وَقَلِيلٌ۬ مِّنۡ عِبَادِىَ ٱلشَّكُورُ &#8221;<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Work you, O family of Dâwud (David), with thanks!&#8221; But few of My slaves are grateful.&#8221;</em> </span>(surah Sabaa: 13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">So how many of those whom Allaah has favored them:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;padding-left:30px;">&#8220;وَإِن تَعُدُّواْ نِعۡمَةَ ٱللَّهِ لَا تُحۡصُوهَآ‌ۗ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَغَفُورٌ۬ رَّحِيمٌ۬&#8221;<br />
<em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And if you would count the favours of Allâh, never could you be able to count them. Truly! Allâh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;</span> </em>(surah an-Nahl: 18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">How many show thanks to Allaah for these favours? Less than a few!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or there is a (state of being) tested.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">It is obligatory upon him in this state (to observe) the patience. Meaning that Allaah from His overwhelming wisdom He could test the believing servant from the different types of test. It&#8217;s obligatory upon him to (observe) the patience because this is from the belief in the divine decree and from submitting the the decree of Allaah. Also (the servant must know) that what has befalling him was never going to pass him by. All of that is written in the book of Allaah (al-Lawhul-Mahfooth). <span style="color:#ff6600;">Verily Allah doesn&#8217;t test him (the servant) to destroy him. He only test him in order to test his patience and servitude</span>. Verily there is for Allaah upon the servant servitude in times of hardship just as there is for Him (Allaah) upon the servant servitude in times of happiness. There also is for Him (Allaah) upon the servant servitude in that which he (the servant) dislikes just as there is for Him (Allaah) upon the servant servitude in that which he (the servant) loves. Most of the creation give the servitude in that which they love. However the matter is giving the servitude in that which there is his hardship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other state is (a state of) sin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">It is obligatory upon him (the servant) in this state to seek the forgiveness this is clear with regards to the obligation of turning to Allaah (repentance) displaying ones need for him.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Mahabbah (Love) of Allâh</strong></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn Al Qayyim</strong> &#8211; <em>rahimahullâh</em> &#8211; says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The reasons which cause mahabbah of Allâh to develop, are <strong>ten</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Firstly</em></strong>: Reciting the Qur‘ân, reflecting and understanding its meaning and its intent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Secondly</em></strong>: Drawing closer to Allâh &#8211; the Most High &#8211; through optional deeds, after fulfilling the obligatory duties.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Thirdly</em></strong>: Being continuous in the <em>dhikr</em> (remembrance) of Allâh, with the tongue, the heart and the limbs &#8211; under all circumstances. The more constant the <em>dhikr</em>, the more <em>mahabbah</em> develops and intensifies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Fourthly</em></strong>: Giving precedence to what Allâh loves over personal loves, when being overcome by desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Fifthly</em></strong>: Contemplating and deliberating over the Names and Attributes of Allâh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Sixthly</em></strong>: Recognising and remembering the favours and bounties of Allâh &#8211; both the manifest and hidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Seventhly</em></strong>: To be humble and submissive before Allâh &#8211; and this is the greatest matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Eightly</em></strong>: To be in seclusion reciting the Qur‘ân, during that time in which Allâh descends to the lowest heaven (which is the last third of every night), finishing this recitation with seeking Allâh’s forgiveness and repenting to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Ninthly</em></strong>: To sit in the gatherings of true and sincere lovers of Allâh, reaping the fruits of their speech, and not to speak except if there is benefit in it and that you know that such talk will increase you in goodness and that it will benefits others as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tenthly</strong>: To stay clear of all those causes which distances the heart from Allâh &#8211; <em>the Mighty and Majestic</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are the ten reasons which cause the person to develop true love for Allâh and to reach the rank of <em>al-muhabbah</em>, by which he reaches his Beloved.” [<em>Madârijus-Sâlikîn</em> (3/17-18).]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Shaykh ul –Islaam <strong>Ibn Al Qayyim</strong> as-Salafi <em>-Rahimullaah-</em><br />
From his book ‘Za’ad al-Ma’aad’<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p><strong>Ibn al-Qayyim</strong> said:</p>
<p>‘Every Muslim should be warned of the oppression of:  <strong>‘I – My/Mine – I Possess’</strong></p>
<p>Indeed these three words are what Iblees (Shaytan), Fir’awn and Qaroon were tried with.</p>
<ul>
<li>Iblees said: ‘<strong>I am </strong>better than him’</li>
<li>Fir’awn said: ‘Is not <strong>mine</strong> the Kingdom of Egypt,’</li>
<li>Qaroon said: ‘This has been given to me only because of knowledge <strong>I possess</strong>.’</li>
</ul>
<p>So regarding the saying of the Slave of Allaah ‘<strong>I</strong>’ – then the best that he can be described with is:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#008000;">I am a slave who sins, makes mistakes, seeks forgiveness and recognizes this</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So regarding the saying of ‘<strong>My/Mine</strong>’ – and those statements similar to that is:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#008000;">My sins, my crimes, my humbleness, my depravation and submissiveness.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>So regarding the saying of ‘<strong>I Possess</strong>’:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Forgive me for my mistakes and what I do intentionally, in jest, or in seriousness and I possess all these shortcomings.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#808080;">[Taken from ‘Za’ad al-Ma’aad’ 2/475 – By Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawzeeyah]</span></p>
