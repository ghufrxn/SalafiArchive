<p class="has-text-align-center"></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Certainly the most excellent favor and the most complete blessing for the people of paradise is seeing their Lord, The Most Greatest, The One Who Possesses, honor and beauty. This is the delight of their hearts and the comfort of their eyes, the greatest bliss and pleasure in the abode of delight.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">It was narrated by Muslim in his saheeh on the authority of Suhayb, that the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#008000;">When the people of paradise enter the paradise Allaah the Blessed and Most High will say: &#8220;Do you desire an increase in anything?&#8221; The people will say: &#8220;Have You not made our faces white? Have You not entered us into the paradise and saved us from the fire?!&#8221; He (the Prophet) said: ‘He (Allaah) will then remove the covering and they will not be given anything more beloved to them than looking at their Lord, the Mighty and Majestic.’ </span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">There is a connection between seeing Allaah and the prayer. Whoever is from the people who establish prayer, then he is much deserving of this favor. And the one who is neglectful (of the prayer) then he is worthy of being deprived (of this favor) and will be from the people of loss. Certainly, this connection is substantiated by the Book and the Sunnah. As for the Book, Allaah says:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#008000;">“Faces that Day will radiant (22) Looking towards their Lord, (23) And many faces, that day, will be gloomy, (24) Realizing that a back-breaking calamity is going to be afflicted on them. (25) Never, (you will never remain in this world forever!) When the soul (of a patient) reaches the clavicles, (26) And it is said, “Who is an enchanter (that can save him?)” (27) And he realizes that it is (the time of) departure (from the world,) (28) And one shank is intertwined with the other shank, (29) Then on that day, it is to your Lord that one has to be driven. (30) So (the denier of the Hereafter) neither believed, nor prayed, (31) But rejected the truth and turned away (from it)(32)”</span> (75:22-32)</p>



<p>So His statement:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Faces that day will be radiant&#8221;</strong> </span>(75:22)<br />Meaning; from the beauty, meaning a beautiful radiance; brightly pleased. And His statement:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Looking at their Lord&#8221;</strong> </span>(75:23)<br />Meaning: by seeing Him with their eyes, by their vision.</p>



<p>Hasan al-Basri said:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">&#8216;They have the right to be radiant while they are looking at the Creator. Then Exalted is He, mentioned another category (of people) the people whose faces will be contorted, completely gloomy. He mentioned from among their actions was abandonment of the prayer. This shows that the people of the first category are the people of radiance and are those who will see Allaah. These are from the people who establish the prayer.&#8217;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>As for (evidence from) the Sunnah</strong>, then in the two Saheeh&#8217;s, on the authority of Jareer ibn Abdillaah, who said:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">&#8220;We were sitting with the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) when he looked towards the moon on a full-moon night and said afterwards: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;Surely you will see your Lord just as you see this moon, you will not be obstructed in seeing Him. So if you are able to not be occupied and overcome by things which will distract you from the prayer before the sun rises and before it sets then do so!&#8217;</span> Meaning the Asr prayer and the Fajr. Then Jareer recited (the verse) <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And praise your Lord before the sun rise and before the sunset&#8221;</span> (20:130)</p>



<p>In this hadeeth is an indication to the connection between the prayer and seeing (Allaah).</p>



<p>Ibn Rajab (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">&#8220;It is said as it relates to the command with preserving these two prayers coming immediately after mention of the seeing (of Allaah) that the greatest (loftiest) thing in paradise is seeing Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and the most noble of actions in the life of this world are these two prayers. Therefore in guarding them it is hoped that the person will enter Paradise and will see Allaah there.&#8221;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And there is no doubt that the companions when they heard the statement of the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) : <span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;Surely you will see your Lord just as you see this moon, you will not be obstructed in seeing Him&#8217;</span>, a great yearning filled their souls and a wondering about the actions which will be the cause of obtaining this greatly sought pursuit. And from the excellence of the Prophet&#8217;s advice and completeness of his clarification, he answered it without being asked.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In this is an indication from him (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) that, seeing Allaah on the Day of Judgment will not be obtained by merely wishing. As Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;This is not a matter of your merely wishing or the wishing of the People of the Book&#8221;</span> (4:123) Rather it is a must to perform actions, be upright, strive hard and have full commitment to Allaah. For this reason the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) explained the means which will allow the servant to obtain seeing Allaah. Therefore he directed to two great prayers, namely Fajr and Asr. Many texts have been narrated in relation to the matter of these two (prayers) which point to their virtues. They are mentioned specifically for what is contained in them of great virtues and from the weightiness (of them) upon many people.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Therefore whoever elevates his concern and Allaah assists him and gives him success in preserving these two prayers then he must be much more preserving of the other prayers (as well) rather the Fajr prayer specifically, (as it ) is the commencement of the day. Whoever Allaah honors with getting up to perform this prayer and giving importance to it will be aided for the remaining prayers of that day. For how the servant acts in relation to the Fajr prayer applies (to his actions) for the rest of the day.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">As some of the Salaf would say: <strong>&#8220;Your day is like your camel; if you take hold of the beginning of it then the later part of it will follow you&#8221; </strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And the Prophet&#8217;s statement:<strong> &#8220;Do not become occupied…&#8221;</strong> Is an indication that in this life are many affairs that will distract and divert man from guarding these two prayers. And how much more are the things that divert in these days of ours! There are people whom drinking tea overcomes and diverts from these prayers which is the beauty of this worldly life. Some are distracted by petty conversation, immoral night chat, useless entertainment and evil viewings. And also from people are those whom sleep overcomes, and so on.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In this Hadeeth also is evidence that the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>correct sound belief</strong> </span>affects the actions of the slave and his ways. So the more his faith increases and his certainty strengthens, the more he increases in uprightness, diligence, (righteous) work, and observing the obedience of Allaah.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And because of this connection between the prayer and seeing Allaah our Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) used to supplicate at the end of his prayer before tasleem for this great delight and wealthy reward. Narrated by an-Nasai in his sunan on the authority of Ataa ibn as-Saaib from his father who said: &#8220;Ammaar bin Yaasir led us in prayer and he shorted it. So some of the people said to him:&#8217;you have made the prayer light or shorted it! He said: &#8216;As for that, I was supplicating with some supplications I heard from the Messenger of Allaah. So he when he stood a man from the people followed him, he was Ubay though he didn&#8217;t reveal his name and asked him about the supplication then the man came (back) and informed the people of it. (The supplication was)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O Allaah, by Your Knowledge of the unseen and by Your Power over the creation , let me live if You know that life is good for me , and let me die if You know that death is good for me . O Allaah , I ask You to grant me fear of You in private and in the open . I ask you for the word of truth in times of contentment and anger. I ask You for moderation in wealth and in poverty. I ask you for blessings never ceasing and the coolness of my eye (i.e. pleasure) that never ends. I ask You for pleasure after Your Judgment and I ask You for a life of coolness after death. I ask You for the delight of looking at Your Face and the earning of meeting You without any harmful distress and misleading trials befalling me. O Allah, dress us with the beauty of Faith, and make us guides who are upon (correct) guidance. </span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">May Allaah favor us all with guarding the prayer. We ask Allaah for the delight of looking at His Face and the yearning to meet Him without any harmful distress or misleading trial.</p>



<p>We ask Allaah to make this a benefit for us and for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: Ok, there is another question about our brothers in Bosnia …</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Al-Albāny</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: I heard that you said to some brothers who had wanted to go there to fight in the cause of Allāh with their lives: fight against yourselves (i.e. purify yourselves)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Al-Albāny</strong>: Yes, that&#8217;s true.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: This means that you don&#8217;t advise (people) to go there (for jihād)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Al-Albāny</strong>: That&#8217;s true.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: Well don&#8217;t you think that people there are in need of help?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Al-Albāny</strong>: How can I not think so? Yet is help achieved by putting more lives of Muslims to death in  vain? Where is the preparation with which we have been commanded in the Noble Qur’ān?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: What if there is a benefit?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Al-Albāny</strong>: If you believe that there is a benefit, then it (jihād) is compulsory. Do you believe so?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Al-Albāny</strong>: On what basis?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: There are weak Muslims&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Al-Albāny</strong>: Please brother, don’t tell me about the status quo; tell me what the benefit is.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: The benefit is helping them and (unclear speech) …</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Al-Albāny</strong>: May Allāh guide you! Helping them requires (the intervention) of the States not individuals. The situation needs organized army that are trained in using weapons. It needs tanks, aircrafts, etc. What individual means are you talking about? If we sent one thousand people from here and there, they would be easy targets of (the enemy) fire. What could these people do in the face of the tanks and destructive weapons (of the enemy)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: Yeah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Al-Albāny</strong>: Glory be to Allāh! I am surprised at how the youth do not look at these issues except in a very limited way. I asked you if there were a benefit. You said, “Yes.” What is this benefit? They are weak! May Allah guide you, Abu Suhaib! As if I did not know that they are weak and that they are few in number and under-armed compared to the Serbs first and their allies second and particularly the Americans who have destroyed everything. Don&#8217;t you know these facts?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: Yes</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Al-Albāny</strong>: How can you say that there is a benefit? Is there a benefit in destroying Muslims in vain and that&#8217;s exactly what happened in Afghanistan? Do you think that jihād in Bosnia and Herzegovina can be any stronger than in Afghanistan?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: No.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Al-Albāny</strong>: What was the result there? Uh? The result was that we reaped bitter melon (i.e. we suffered defeat) &#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Al-Albāny</strong>: … and we brought destruction upon ourselves because we opposed the religious teachings in many, many details, the most apparent of which, as the bad end results showed, was (differing and split). (Allāh says): ﴿</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">And be you not of Al-Mushrikun (polytheists, idolaters, disbelievers in the oneness of Allah). Of those who split up their religion and became sects, each sect rejoicing in that which is with it.</span> (30: 31-32)</p>
<p>Seven parties fighting against one party and that is the Communist party. The Communist party, which is a kafir party, vs three Muslim parties. How could this happen? Therefore, don&#8217;t forget, even though you live far away from us, the principle that the beginning should be with tasfia wat-tarbia (i.e. purification and education) …</p>
<p><strong>Questioner</strong>: Yes</p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Al-Albāny</strong>: … and then remember the saying of Allāh (Azzawa Jal):</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-42-30.png"><img class="alignnone" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-42-30.png" alt="" width="650" height="55" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much.</span>(42:30)</p>
<p>And we ask Allāh (Azzawa Jal) to grant victory to our Muslims brother in all Muslim land.<br />
Yes unfortunately as our Lord says in the Nobel Qur’ān:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-33-62.png"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-33-62.png" alt="" width="555" height="47" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">That was the Way of Allāh in the case of those who passed away of old, and you will not find any change in the Way of Allāh.</span> (33:62)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-35-43.png"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-35-43.png" alt="" width="644" height="100" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">And no turning off will you find in the Sunnah of Allāh</span>. (35:43)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-13-11.png"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-13-11.png" alt="" width="734" height="114" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, Allāh will not change the (good) condition of a people as long as they do not change their state (of goodness) themselves. But when Allāh wills a people&#8217;s punishment, there can be no turning back of it, and they will find besides Allāh no protector.</span> (13:11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, if we want to defend a nation from among the Islamic nations we must first and foremost defend Islam in our very home countries. Yet we don&#8217;t defend Islam in our countries and that&#8217;s why we have been inflicted by calamities in our home countries, and this is something we feel sorry about and we ask Allāh (Azzawa Jal) to grant Muslims His True Promise:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-40-51.png"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-40-51.png" alt="" width="756" height="64" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, We will indeed make victorious Our Messengers and those who believe (in the Oneness of Allāh Islāmic Monotheism) in this world&#8217;s life ..</span>. (40:51)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There will not cease to be a group of my Ummah, victorious upon truth and not harmed by those who oppose them until the Hour is established.” Maybe this is enough for you.</p>
<p><strong>Questioner</strong>: May Allāh reward you with good, shaykh.</p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Al-Albāny</strong>: The same to you, by Allāh&#8217;s will. Let me hear your voice soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon Allah’s Messenger, his household, his companions, and whoever followed his guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed, we do advise those concerned and occupied with memorizing the Qur’an to fear Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) and to be dutiful to Him, for He it is Who has guided them towards that goodly and blessed direction, namely memorizing the Book of Allah. This is a tremendous affair as it is the religion of Allah which He sent down as guidance to people. So memorize the Qur’an so proficiently that it is not forgotten, for this requires patience and perseverance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It takes some people only two or three readings of a Qur’anic text to memorize it, yet this is not sufficient to firmly commit the Qur’an to one’s memory. As a matter of fact, it demands great deal of repetition and long practice and perseverance, for the Qur’an is more liable to escape (from one’s memory) than a camel from its tying rope.[1a] If a person does not strongly and meticulously commit it to his memory and on top of that neglects to study it and to read it regularly, it will certainly escape from his memory faster than a camel escapes from its tying rope. So long as Allah has guided you to study and memorize the Qur’an, it behooves you to perfect that memorization.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having done with its memorization, you should then embark on learning the Sunnah of Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) . Memorize as much as you can from it, such as ‘Umdatul- Ahkam and Bulugh Al-Maram. Memorize Imam Muhammad Ibn Adbulwahhab’s Book of Tawhid, whose subject matter is the tawhid of worship; and Imam Ibn Taymia’s “Al- Aqidatul-Wasitiyah”, on the topic of tawhid pertaining to the Names and Attributes and on the topic of ‘aqidah and manhaj. These are the foundations of Islam. If you learn them strongly and accurately, all of your ‘aqidah and manhaj related matters will be rectified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, I advise you to be sincere towards Allah, the Lord of the Universe, for all these matters that I have mentioned to you, i.e. memorizing the Qur’an and memorizing these texts and books, are amongst the greatest acts of worship whereby we seek nearness to Allah. We are in need of sincerity towards Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) with regards to these acts. So cultivate yourselves upon sincerity towards Allah, the Lord of the Universe, and study the texts that encourage towards sincerity from Riyadus-Salihin and from other than it, from the Qur’an itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says: <span style="color:#008000;">And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him).</span>(Qur’an, 98:5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Say (O Muhammad): &#8220;Verily, I am commanded to worship Allah (Alone) by obeying Him and doing religious deeds sincerely for Allah&#8217;s sake only and not to show off, and not to set up rivals with Him in worship</span>. (Qur’an, 39:11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah commands the Messenger (peace be upon him) to single Him out for worship and orders him to be sincere. Similarly, He commands the Ummah and those who follow him to be sincere. No act of worship is accepted unless it is carried out with sincerity, for sincerity is a great condition from the conditions for accepting acts of worship. Any act of worship that is performed seeking nearness to Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) must fulfill two conditions: sincerity towards Allah and following the Messenger (peace be upon him) ; that is to say, your deed should emanate from the Book and the Sunnah and be established upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness, i.e. by following the Messenger (peace be upon him) , and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord.</span>(Qur’an, 18:110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is to say, neither type of shirk should enter into this worship, be it major or minor shirk such as showing off.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, sincerity is an affair that is of considerable importance, and without it acts of worship are null and void, and are of no benefit in this life as well as in the hereafter. Worse still, they should bring destruction upon the one who performs them. For the one who shows off, Allah shall make a display of him; and the one who seeks to be heard, Allah shall expose him and disgrace him on the Day of Resurrection before those who will be witnessing. So do not recite the Qur’an in order to be said about you that so-and-so is a reciter. Indeed, one of the first three people upon whom hellfire will be enflamed is such a reciter. As the noble Messenger (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the first people who will be judged on the Day of Resurrection are: a man who died as a martyr. He will be brought forth, and He (Allah) will make His favors known to him and he will acknowledge them. Allah will say: What did you do with them? He will say: I fought in Your cause until I died as a martyr. Allah will say: You have lied. Rather, you fought in order to be said that you are brave, and that was said. Then a command will be passed regarding him and he will be dragged along on his face until he is cast into Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And a man who acquired knowledge and taught it (to others), and learned the Qur’an and taught it (to others). He will be brought forth, and He (Allah) will make His favors known to him and he will acknowledge them. Allah will say: What did you do with them? He will say: I obtained knowledge and taught it and recited the Qur’an for Your sake. Allah will say: you have lied. Rather, you acquired knowledge so as to be said that you are a knowledgeable man and recited the Qur’an so as to be said that you are a reciter, and that was said. Then a command will be passed regarding him and he will be dragged along on his face until he is cast into Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And a man whom Allah increased his provision and granted every type of wealth. He will be brought forth, and He (Allah) will make His favors known to him and he will acknowledge them. Allah will say: What did you do with them? He will say: I left no way in which You like money to be spent without spending in it for Your sake. Allah will say: you have lied. Rather, you did that in order to be said that you are a generous man, and that was said. Then a command will be passed regarding him and he will be dragged along on his face until he is cast into Hellfire.[<em>Reported by Muslim (1905) from the narration of Abu Hurairah radhi Allaahu anhu</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadith causes fear in every Muslim and makes him think seriously about every action he performs, every word he utters, and every movement he makes. It makes him observe Allah in everything he does. It behooves every believer to try to be from the people of uprightness and people of sincerity and to achieve the level of Ihsan in his worship, and that is to worship Allah as if you see Him, and since you do not see Him then He sees you. Therefore, it is binding upon man to cultivate himself upon these affairs, not to be cultivated upon the love of showing off and fame or any insignificant worldly pursuits and interests that do not weigh with Allah the wing of a mosquito. So you recite the Qur’an and memorize it so as to act upon it. Hence, the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the senior companions used to read ten verses to the other companions in order to memorize them and never moved on to other verses until they had memorized them and acted upon them, so they used to acquire knowledge and action simultaneously. This is a great manner of cultivation that Muslims have become totally oblivious to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Messenger (peace be upon him) , then Allah revealed the Qur’an to him gradually in sequential parts in proportion to the events and occasions over a period of twenty-three years. All this was done in order to raise the Ummah upon understanding this Qur’an, acting upon it, and implementing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (peace be upon him) used to teach them the Qur’an part by part, ten verses in each, and explain to them its meaning so that they would learn it and implement it. They would not proceed to the next text until they have grasped its meaning and put it into action. If it were a text pertaining to ‘aqidah, they would hold as a belief what is contained therein; if it were an exhortation to fight in the cause of Allah, they would hope in fighting in the cause of Allah or would actually set off for the battleground; and if it were an exhortation to charity and a righteous act or a promise of reward or a warning, they would never surpass it until they have fully comprehended all its content.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a great cultivation indeed, yet people now are not capable of it. O young people! Bear this in your minds, for the Ummah is in need of sincere scholars who are free from whims and desires and purely devoted to Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers, nowadays desires are blowing the youth of the Ummah away (from the right salafi path) &#8212; desires pertaining to partisanship and other than it. A student of knowledge would devote himself sincerely to teaching the Qur’an, yet would be umbilically attached to parties that do not act upon that Qur’an but rather follow their own desires. So beware of this type of people, and upon you is sincerity towards Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala), seeking knowledge and acting upon the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of Allah’s Messenger. And I hope that you continue to pursue that 10 A WORD OF ADVICE FOR THOSE MEMORIZING THE BOOK OF ALLAH blessed course which started with memorizing the Qur’an until you become from the firmly established scholars whom Allah has praised and in whose favor He has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allah.</span>[Qur’an, 35:28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So much so, that some people of knowledge have stated that knowledge is fear of Allah, and this is not attainable except for scholars, scholars who have true knowledge of Allah, uphold His Names and Attributes and worship Allah therewith, and believe in Paradise as if they see it with their very eyes and believe in Hell as if they see it with their very eyes. In line with this, Handhalah ? said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr met me and said: How are you, Handhalah? I replied: Handhalah has become a munafiq (i.e. hypocrite).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: Glorified is Allah! What are you saying? I said: When we are in the company of Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him)  and he reminds us of Hell and Paradise, it is as if we can see them with our very eyes. But when we leave the company of Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) , we turn to our wives, children and properties, and so we tend to forget much (of what we heard from him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is to say, they become busy with farming and attending to their wives, etc. which he deemed to be hypocrisy. When he is in the company of Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him), he is in a different state from that when he is away from his company.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr said: By Allah! I do experience the same. So I and Abu Bakr went to Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) and entered upon him. I said: Handhalah has become a munafiq (i.e. hypocrite), O Allah’s Messenger. So Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) said: And what’s that? I replied: When we are in your company and you remind us of Hell and Paradise, it is as if we can see them with our very eyes. But when we leave your company, we turn to our wives, children and properties, and so we tend to forget much (of what we hear from you). Thereupon, Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) said: By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, if you persist upon that state which you achieve in my company and upon remembering (Allah), the Angels will shake hands with you in your beds and in your pathways; however, O Handhalah, there is time for this and time for that. He said this three times.[<em>Reported by Muslim (2750)</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet who amongst us now reaches that level?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah has commanded that this Qur’an be contemplated: <span style="color:#008000;">That they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember</span> [Qur’an, 38:29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Allah, the souls cannot rise to that high levels or come up to the same standing as that of the companions. Yet the Qur’an is the means of elevation. By Allah, souls shall never rise to high levels except through this Qur’an and this Sunnah. Through genuine commitment, sincere belief and open sensibility, souls and minds get uplifted to superior status such that this world becomes of little worth to them and their lives become just as insignificant. Hence when the companions of Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) used to sit with him, it was as if they saw Paradise with their own eyes. Due to the strength of their belief, they presented their hearts and souls as a sacrifice in the cause of Allah for they deemed them to be of no value.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now you see many Muslims thoroughly preoccupied with this worldly life, such that al-wahan has crept up on us, and that is the love for this worldly life and hatred of death. Thus with this kind of life and with the deviant cultivation they acquire at misguided schools, Muslims have become scum, as the scum on a stream of water. By Allah, were they to understand this Qur’an, to be raised upon it in the correct manner, and to found their ‘aqidah and manhaj upon it, this condition of theirs would alter completely. Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When you conduct ‘inah [1] transaction, and you follow the tails of cows, and you are content with farming, and you abandon jihad, Allah shall inflict disgrace upon you which He will not withdraw until you return to your religion.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is to say, to that Qur’an and to the Sunnah by way of understanding it, implementing it, believing in it, and recognizing its lofty status with Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala), and with His Messenger and with the believers. If they return (to their religion) with this kind of spirit, Allah will reestablish their position and status in this life. But if they did not acknowledge the status of this Qur’an and went about taking their aqidah from here and there and importing their manhaj from here and there, they would be moving from one pitfall to another until they recover their awareness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The youth need to learn the Qur’an and to get the proper cultivation (based upon it) and to recognize its lofty status. They should also display the banner of the Qur’an and the Sunnah to the Ummah by spreading and disseminating the essence of the Qur’an which will raise them to the high standing that the companion achieved, in order that the Ummah return to its genuine religion &#8212; the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger (peace be upon him) , not this party, nor that group, nor that school of thought, nor that other sect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Implementing the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger (peace be upon him) is the one and the only way out. There is no other remedy for the Ummah except that. All these distorted visions and empty slogans destroy the Ummah worse and worse. They are of no avail or use to the Ummah in any way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If memorizing and learning the Qur’an and the Sunnah is done with the purpose of ensuring victory and support for one’s party, then this is not the correct way. Today we find those who study to obtain degrees in order to promote their own parties, such that they distort and twist the religion of Allah and the speech of the scholars, all this in favor of their own parties. Some read the Qur’an as a means to promote their own party, some read the Qur’an as a means to promote their own sect, while others read the Qur’an as a means to promote their own ‘aqidah and manhaj. No! This is not the correct way. The correct way is to submit to the Qur’an and the Sunnah, not to direct them (i.e. the course of their interpretation) according to your frame of mind and desire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We want memorizers of the Qur’an who understand it and comprehend it in accordance with the understanding of the righteous salaf, not the understanding of the people of innovations and misguidance or the understanding of the deviant parties. No matter what, do not put your trust in these parties, and do not lean towards them in matters of your religion. Rather, turn to the books of the salaf, the books of ‘aqidah, the books of hadith, the likes of the two Sahihs, the four books of Sunan [3], Ahmad’s Musnad, and other Masanid [4] and Ma’ajim [5]. We advise you to turn to these books, not to nashids and movies and other nonsense that has compromised and softened the youth of this Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These people have no knowledge. Therefore, it is obligatory that the youth be warned against their nonsense and their tricks and deception. They raise the youth upon fun and amusement and upon love for that. This was not the case with the companions, the followers, nor with the Imams up to this time of ours. Now amusement has become the primary occupation and interest before anything else. While the neglectful person intends to occupy himself with seeking knowledge, these people divert him towards these means of entertainment, namely nashids, movies, music, and so on and so forth. Indeed they have caused this Ummah more calamities on top of the ones it is already suffering. They claimed to save the Ummah from the state of loss it has come to, yet they only added to its trials and tribulations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is important though is that the sole remedy lies in the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger and the way of the salaf. That is to say, how they used to cultivate themselves, how their relationship with the Qur’an was, what their occupation was and how they spent their time. To the salaf, time was more precious than gold, yet now countless hours are wasted in amusement and absolute nonsense. Therefore, be cautious, O brothers, and commit yourselves to memorizing the Book of Allah and invest your time in memorizing it and memorizing the Sunnah, then memorizing some portion of the mutun (texts) that I mentioned to you above, and then acquire knowledge from scholars and traverse this path upon that clear and noble methodology. After that you will become the men of this Ummah, and by the Will of Allah you shall direct it towards goodness by means of knowledge, proof, and evidence and the correct cultivation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah to save the Ummah by virtue of sincere men, and sincere men do not materialize except through the way part of which I elucidated above that is attained through correct cultivation upon the Qur’an and the Sunnah and holding in high esteem the manhaj of the salaf and keeping steadfast upon it and leading the Ummah to that good and to that path of guidance. We ask our Lord to accomplish that, for verily our Lord is indeed All-Hearer of invocation. And peace and blessings be upon Allah’s Messenger, his household, and his companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is The Smile On The Face Of A Dead Person An Indication Of Husn Al Khātimah (I.E. Good Ending Of One&#8217;s Worldly Life)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Muhammad Al-Wassãbi</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Husn al-khātimah has been mentioned in various hadīths. So we should rely solely on what was reported from the Messenger (peace be upon him) regarding it and should not add to it based on opinion. From the opinion-based signs of husn al-khātimah is the dead person being light. Some people consider this to be from husn al-khātimah&#8212; that his body was extremely swift and easy (when carried) over people&#8217;s shoulders. This is not a proof. It might be because his body is lean, yet knowing whether or not a person&#8217;s actions are righteous is something else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ok then what if his body were fat? Would it be said that this is from sū&#8217; al-khātimah (i.e. evil ending)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Pay no attention to this. Husn al-Khātimah is when (a Muslim) dies while fasting, performing haj, praying, doing jihaad, when he dies upon a good ending, upon a righteous deed. In this case, you say: Maashaallaah! Wishing him good but not affirming Paradise for him. Conversely, sū&#8217; al-khātimah is when one dies while not praying (i.e. abandoning prayer), (visiting) a sorcerer, while drunk, or committing robbery or any forbidden act. However, affirm for him neither Paradise nor Hell.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.5em;">All praises belong to Allaah, may prayers and salutations be upon the Messenger of Allaah, his family, companions and those who follow his guidance. As to what follows:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certainly Allaah has distinguished the ummah of Islaam over the other nations, because<strong><span style="color:#993300;"> we enjoin what is right and we forbid what is wrong</span>.</strong> Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">“You are the best nation brought out of the people (because) you enjoin what is right and you forbid what is wrong.”</span> (3:110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (may peace be upon him said): <span style="color:#008000;">“Whoever of you sees an evil then let him change it with his hand, if he is not able then with his tongue, if he is not able then with his heart and that is the weakest of faith.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Lord has imposed on us that we are from those people who establish justice. As Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">“Oh you who believe, be from those who establish justice and be witnesses for Allaah even if it is against yourselves, parents or kinfolk.”</span> (4:135)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also ordered us to cooperate upon righteousness and piety and not sin and transgression. As Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">“And cooperate upon righteousness and piety and do not cooperate upon sin and transgression, and have taqwa of Allaah; certainly Allaah is strong in punishment.”</span> (5:2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Allaah ordered us with jihad, as a means for spreading the religion and defending it</strong></span>. We were ordered to make jihad with the sword and with the tongue. We were ordered with the jihad of clarifying, (establishing) evidences, and proofs. And this is the jihad of the prophets (may peace be upon them all).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Allaah ordered (us) with truthfulness</strong></span> and what comes along with it, and forbade us from lying and what comes along with it. The Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">“Upon you is to be truthful, for truthfulness guides to goodness and goodness guides to paradise. A man will continue to be truthful and he is lead to that, until it is written with Allaah that he is truthful. And beware of lying, for lying leads to wickedness and wickedness leads to the fire. A man will continue lying and he is lead to that until it is written with Allaah that he is a liar.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (may peace be upon him)<span style="color:#993300;"><strong> warned us from false suspicion</strong></span> when he said: “Beware of suspicion, for suspicion is the worst of false tales.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">He ordered us with brotherhood</span></strong> and being diligent upon coming together as brothers. The Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">“The Muslim is a brother to another Muslim, he does not deceive him nor desert him. The Muslim’s honor, wealth and blood are sacred.”</span> (Then he said) “Piety is here,” (pointing to his chest three times) and he said, <span style="color:#008000;">“It is sufficient enough evil for a person to hold his Muslim brother in contempt.”</span> (Narrated by at-Tirmidhi who said the hadeeth is hasan)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (may peace be upon him) (also) said: “Do not envy one another, do not hate one another, do not turn away from one another, do not inflate prices on one another, but be, (oh) servants of Allaah, brothers (to one another).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>He ordered us with (giving) advice</strong></span>. He said: “The religion is advice.” So we said, “To whom, oh Messenger of Allaah?” He said: “To Allaah, to His Book, to His Messenger, to the leaders of the Muslims and to the common folk.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">He ordered us with helping the oppressed and the oppressor</span></strong>. He said: “Help your brother if he is an oppressor or oppressed.” A man then said: “Oh Messenger of Allaah, I (can see) helping him if he is being oppressed. But if I see that he is the oppressor how can I help him?!” He said: “Hold him and prevent him from oppression and this is (your) helping him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah informed us that oppression will be darkness on the Day of Judgment. Allaah says: “Indeed, Allaah does not do injustice, [even] as much as an atom&#8217;s weight; while if there is a good deed, He multiplies it and gives from Himself a great reward.” (4:4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (may peace be upon him) said (that Allaah says) in a Hadeeth al-Qudsi [1]: “Oh my servants, surely I have made oppression forbidden upon Myself and I have made it forbidden amongst you, therefore do not oppress (one another).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Allaah has made excessiveness and extremism forbidden in the religion</strong></span>. Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">“Oh People of the Scripture, do not commit excess in your religion or say about Allaah except the truth.”</span>(4:171)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">“Beware of excessiveness, for certainly the people before you were destroyed because of their excessiveness in the religion.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said: <span style="color:#008000;">“Do not exaggerate with me as the Christians exaggerated with (Jesus) the son of Mary.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>He (Allaah) made forbidden partisanship and tribalism</strong></span>, as the Messenger of Allaah (may peace be upon him) said:<span style="color:#008000;"> “Whoever is killed under the banner of a people whose cause is not clear and calls to fanatical partisanship or tribalism or supports it and is killed, he dies in a state of jaahiliyyah</span> [2].”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">It is not correct for those who educate to make the people into parties or groups and to make enmity and hatred between them. Rather they should be as brothers, cooperating upon righteousness and piety.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">As Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">“And cooperate upon righteousness and piety and do not cooperate upon sin and transgression, and have taqwa of Allaah, certainly Allaah is strong in punishment.”</span> (5:2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">It is not (correct) for anyone to take a vow to be in agreement with everything that someone wants, and to support those whom he supports and to become an enemy to those he is an enemy to. Rather whoever does this, he is from the likes of Genghis Khan [3] and those similar to him. They are the ones who make those in agreement with them their supporting friends and they make those who oppose them their hated enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">What is binding upon them and their followers is the covenant of Allaah and His Messenger (may peace be upon him). So they must obey Allaah and His Messenger and work by what Allaah and His Messenger ordered. They must make forbidden that which Allaah and His Messenger made forbidden. They must take care of the rights of those (scholars and students) who educate people as Allaah and His Messenger have ordered. So if a teacher (scholar or student) is the one being oppressed, then he aids him and if a teacher is the oppressor, then he does not aid him in his oppression, rather he prevents him from it. As what has been authentically reported is that the Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: “Help your brother if he is an oppressor or oppressed.” A man then said: “Oh Messenger of Allaah, I (can see) helping him if he is being oppressed. But if I see that he is the oppressor how can I help him?!” He said: “Hold him and prevent him from oppression and this is (your) helping him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(End of Ibn Taymiyyah’s quote)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>It is obligatory for this ummah to establish these affairs of great benefits and upright principles. And (the ummah) must have a concern for this with a true care, whether it be an individual, group, tribe, or government, and specifically the scholars and the students of knowledge. This applies more specifically to those who ascribe themselves to the people of Sunnah and the Jamaa’ah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>So if there is (any) exceeding of the limits of these affairs or anything from them, great corruption will appear in the world and the religion, and this leads to the destruction of these great guideposts. In this is a dangerous evil and great corruption.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>And from that of which there is no doubt for the one who has intellect, there has occurred great exceeding of the limits and harmful oppression for the one who speaks the truth. He is rebutted for what is with him of the truth, belittled and insulted, and this is something extremely bad. It coming from a disbeliever (is one thing) but how much more coming from a Muslim?</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Therefore it is upon the Muslim ummah, specifically the youth who are its pillars, to honor and respect the truth and magnify it. It is upon them to despise falsehood and its people, whoever they may be. Allaah will honor them, give them might and elevate their affairs because of this. The opposite of this only brings misguidance, trials, and displeasure from Allaah. This will (lead) to punishments in the life of this world. From these punishments is that the enemies will have authority over them until they return to their true religion and adhere to it.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah give us all success in what pleases Him.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Since the time of Prophet Muhammad those who disbelieved in his message have always diligently tried to put out the light of Allaah and to this day they have not ceased in trying to destroy Islam with every means, whether it be through the media, through war, occupation of Muslim countries and much more. We also witness how many Muslims fall subject to the traps of the disbelievers even at the hands of the Muslims themselves. One of the most prominent scholars of our time by the name of Shaykh Saalih bin Fawzan addresses these issues in a Friday sermon entitled; “The Response of the Muslims during trials”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He addresses how the Muslims should counter the plots and objectives of the disbelievers during these times. Recently the kuffaar have produced movies, illustrations and evil ideas about Prophet Muhammad and the religion of Islaam. They have plotted cleverly against the Muslims in ways that are not apparent to many. Along with this they continue to spread western ideologies amongst the Muslims which shaykh Fawzan may Allaah preserve him has shed light on.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">We Hope to open this meeting O virtuous Shaykh with a question from one of the brothers who says: “Shaykh Sālih with what do you direct the students of knowledge or similarly the beginning students of knowledge and those who have begun and what are the books you advise they begin with, in their quest for knowledge and what is the reward for acquiring Islāmic knowledge?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With the Name of Allāh, Ar-Rahmān Ar-Rahīm, and all praises are for Allāh the Lord of everything that exist may the salāt and salām be upon our Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم, his family and all of his Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This an important question and it is how one should seek knowledge and how the student of knowledge should begin and who knowledge should be sought from and what are the books one should begin with and what is the important type of knowledge from all the (different) studies of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I say, and with Allāh is the success, without doubt seeking knowledge is an important affair. Allāh جل وعلا says: <span style="color:#008000;">“Know! That none has the right to be worshipped except Allāh, and ask for forgiveness of your sins and for the male and female believers”</span> (47:19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imām al-Bukhārī (May Allāh have mercy on him) said in his chapter <span style="color:#008000;">“Knowledge proceeds speech and action”</span>  then he mentioned this verse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because if actions are not based upon knowledge, founded upon knowledge, then it is misguidance and tiring without benefit.Because the affair is like this it’s an obligation upon the Muslim to seek knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And this (knowledge) is categorized into two categories.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>This first category ofKnowledge:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That which the Muslims religion will not be established except by way of it and this is an individual obligation upon every Muslim, male and female.That he learns that which his religion will be established by it. His Belief, his Prayer, his Zakāt, his Fasting, his Hajj, the five pillars of Islām. It is a must that he learns them, how he performs them. What are the requirements of every action, what are the conditions for them to be accepted by Allāh سبحانه و تعالى (as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Actions are only by the intentions” Having sincere intentions “And every person will have that which he intends”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what is obligatory upon every Muslim, an individual obligation upon (every) male and female and everyone who has reached the age of puberty, it is obligatory upon him that he begins with this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Particularly with the affair of <strong>Creed</strong>, because it the <strong>foundation</strong> in which his actions are built upon. Action without knowledge is not accepted and actions (not built upon a sound) Creed are false actions and it will not benefit its doer, so if he begins with anything he begins with the Creed</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allāh says) : <span style="color:#008000;">“Know! That none has the right to be worshipped except Allāh”</span> (47:19). This is Creed (mentioned in this verse) so he starts with knowledge of Creed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then after this he learns the rulings of the prayer which are compulsory upon him day and night, five times (a day) he knows its conditions, its pillars and its obligations and how he performs it, until (it is performed) in its legislative manner, so that Allāh will accept it from him (along) with him having a sincere intention.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he learns how to perform (pay) the Zakāt what are its conditions and what type of wealth which are obligatory (to be paid) regarding it and what is the amount obligatory (to be paid) on it, who are the one who it should be distributed to until it is performed in the manner demanded, because it coupled (paired together) with the Prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he learns how he should fast during the month of Ramadhān and what the conditions of fasting are, what nullifies it and what makes it defective.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he learns how to make Hajj to the house al-Atīq and how he performs Hajj and Umrah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is a must that he learns these affairs with details even if (he learns them) small portions (at a time) because all forms of worship has its small portions (in learning them). An individual beginning in his (studies) learns (these issues) with what is easy (while) returning to the people of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>This Second category of Knowledge:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he learns (that) which will aid him, he learns the <strong><span style="color:#008000;">r</span><span style="color:#008000;">ulings of transactions</span></strong> and this is from the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>second category of knowledge</strong></span>. This is what is obligatory upon some (but not every individual).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever has the ability to learn it then he does so to benefit himself and the Muslims. Also this is what relates to the study of transactions, judgments and inheritance, wills and endowments, the book of marriage and divorce, the book of crimes and punishments, the book of qadā (etc.) All these are collective obligations, where one establishes it in what suffices himself and the Muslims, then this remains a right for the Muslims (in general) a recommended act (of seeking this knowledge) an affirmed recommended act.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is a must seek knowledge upon its known way, with the people of knowledge which Allāh has designed and His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم. So one does not seek knowledge except from its people, those known for it, he does not take knowledge from someone who claims [ المتعاال ] it or ignorant person الجاهال or the people of misguidance and deviation اهال الضالال و اننحافا but rather he takes knowledge from the people of knowledge who remain upright upon obedience (to Allāh) and worship and like this one take knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Either in schools with a system of study, or centers or colleges, or at the hands of the scholars in the Masājid. These are the places for seeking knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also he learns that which will aid him in <strong>fiqh</strong> and the remaining sciences (of knowledge) as what is called knowledge of علاء such as Arabic grammar, Arabic language, or balāgha and this is something necessary for a person to learn that which is from the sciences of Arabic language. That from grammar and the Arabic language, that which the Qur&#8217;ān al-Karīm was revealed in and this regulates his recitation of Qur&#8217;ān and he doesn’t make mistakes in (its recitation) and this is not possible except by learning (Arabic) grammar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also he learns knowledge of measuring that which is distributed from inheritance, (knowledge) of how categorize in issues and how to give everyone who has a right, his rights as Allāh legislated and this is what is called knowledge of hisāb (measuring). So he gains understanding in transactions and other than that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And this without doubt requires from the individual two affairs:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First affair:</strong> Patience upon the length (of time) in learning and patience upon the difficulties in learning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second affair:</strong> to act by what Allāh has taught him (what He has caused him to learn). There is a must that he works by what Allāh has taught him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And a third affair:</strong> that he teaches the people (as Allāh says): <span style="color:#008000;">“To obtain understanding in the religion and warn their people when they return to them that they might be cautious”</span> (9:122)  So he learns and then he teaches.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <span style="color:#ff6600;"><strong>misguided group</strong></span>, who says we are not in need of learning knowledge as it hinders you from actions, and what is intended is actions and they strive hard in worship and they leave knowledge which is its guide and guidance. These people are misguided people and their actions are misguided. And this is mentioned in surah al-Fātihah which we read in every raka’ah <span style="color:#008000;">“Guide us to the straight path &#8211; the path of those upon whom You have bestowed Your Favour, not of those who have evoked [Your] Anger or of those who went astray.”</span> (1:6-7) Those who (Allāh’s) favour has been placed upon them are those who combine between beneficial knowledge and righteous actions. They don’t just take knowledge only without action and they don’t take action without knowledge. And those who have earned (Allāh’s) anger are those who took knowledge and abandoned action as the Jews. And those who are astray are those who took action and they abandoned knowledge. Those who are acquainted with this are the Christians, those who worship Allāh upon ignorance and misguidance. In every unit of prayer you read this great ayah. <span style="color:#008000;">“Guide us to the straight path &#8211; the path of those upon whom You have bestowed Your Favour, not of those who have evoked [Your] Anger or of those who went astray.”</span> (1:6-7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So contemplate it and work by it! And do not pay attention to those who abstain from seeking knowledge and are firm upon that.Do not pay attention to those who meet knowledge with ignorance without knowing its guidelines and regulations and causes people to go astray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These affairs are from principles in seeking knowledge and it is a must that the Muslim knows them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that which is the foundation is the intention, you seek knowledge with a good intention (i.e. for Allāh only) because seeking knowledge is worship and it is a must that the worship have an intention as the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, <span style="color:#008000;">“Actions are only by the intentions and every individual will have that which he intends”</span></p>

<p>Shaykh Salih Fawzaan (hafidhahullaah):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The meaning of jealously is the hoping in the removal of the blessing from the one who is envied. When he sees his brother blessed with what Allaah has given him, then he hopes that this blessing disappears from him for no other reason except because of his hatred and when he hated him (he therefore) envied him. Jealousy is an ancient disease, and the first to envy was Satan, (May Allaah’s curse be upon him) when he envied our father Adam for the virtues that Allah gave him. He created Adam by His hands, taught him the names of everything, made the Angels prostrate to him and let him live in His Paradise&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The questioner asks O shaykh regarding at-tawassul ( a means of seeking nearness to Allaah with certain actions), it&#8217;s types and that is with the supplication of the righteous. </span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At-tawassul is of <strong>two types</strong>; the type that is legislated (allowed) and the type that is forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tawassul which is legislated is</p>
<ol>
<li>tawassul to Allaah by (using) His Names and Qualities or</li>
<li>tawassul by way of righteous actions or</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">tawassul in requesting supplication from a living person (who) is present, that he supplicates for you regarding your affairs; All this is permissible.</li>
</ol>
<p>The tawassul which is forbidden is</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">the tawassul done by the honor the creation, or by his right or by his personality or his uprightness.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the tawaasul which is forbidden. If the one who does so directs anything from worship to the one the tawaasul is made towards, then this is major shirk, just as that which the people of jaahiliyah were upon ( Allaah says) <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;they worship other than Allaah things that will not harm nor benefit them, they say these are our intercessors with Allaah&#8221;</span> (10:18) (also) Just as most of the grave worshippers are upon; those who seek nearness (to Allaah) by way of the deceased with different forms of worship and they say &#8220;these will intercede for us with Allaah&#8221; and this is major shirk!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-2zH" target="_blank">BEAUTIFICATION IN PRAYER </a></strong><br />
By: Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan</p>
<p><strong>Question: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">May Allaah treat you well. The questioner says: the imam of the masjid possesses a lot of wealth, but when he comes to the prayer; he wears a dirty Izaar (bottom waist wrap) and a dirty garment. When I say to him why doesn&#8217;t he purchase new garments for the prayer; he says whoever is humble for Allaah then he will raise him, so what is the ruling of his prayer?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p>This is not humbleness to Allaah. Allaah says;</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O children of Adam, take your adornment within every masjid&#8230;&#8221;</span> (7:31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning in every prayer, and the adornment here does not only mean covering the private area, but the adornment comprises of clothing used for beautification for the prayer; while facing the Lord of everything that exist. You are <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>standing in front of Him</strong></span>, so you beautify yourself with whatever you are able to from beautification in appreciation for the prayer and glorification of the position between yourself and your Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is something required and as mentioned in the Hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;if Allaah expands His favors upon, then display them&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the prophet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily Allaah loves that the signs of His favors are seen upon His servants&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is not from humility, yes; you should not wear extravagant boasting clothing, so you become someone who is looked at. You should wear moderate clothing which are clean and beautiful, as the prophet صلى عليه و سلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily Allaah is beautiful and He loves beauty&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>ADVICE FOR THE YOUTH IN THE BEGIN STAGES OF UPRIGHTNESS</strong></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">By: Shaykh Abdul Aziz Aali Shaykh</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Asalaamu alaikum may Allaah treat you well and the muslim benefit from your knowledge; the questioner asks: for the youth that are in the being stage of uprightness (upon the truth); what do you advise him with? And how does he know the people who are upon the sound Manhaj from those who are upon an evil Manhaj? </span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I advise him with the fear of Allaah and the praising of Allaah for saving him from misguidance and going astray and guided him to the straight path. (Also) <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>let him</strong> <strong>search for the scholars who are adhering to the legislation (of Islam)</strong></span>; and <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>let him read their books and be diligent in gaining understanding of the religion of Allaah. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Let him</span> <span style="color:#000000;">distance himself from those who don&#8217;t have ability to be apparent in front of the people</span></strong>; And their followers are only hidden and concealed. Certainly these are the things that diverts from the upright inclination. These people desire that their evil affairs be concealed; so let him distant himself from these people. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Let him search for a scholar that possesses taqwa</strong></span>; and he will give him insight and direct him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He should read much of the Quran, Sunnah and the books of creed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah that He prepares him for the possession of knowledge and that he is taken by his hand to what’s good.</p>
