</strong><strong>Whoever seeks Blessing through a tree,a Stone, or the like</strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>عن أبي واقد الليثي، قال: خرجنا مع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم إلى حنين ونحن حدثاء عهد بكفر، وللمشركين سدرة يعكفون عندها وينوطون بها أسلحتهم، يقال لها: ذات أنواط، فمررنا بسدرة فقلنا: يا رسول الله أجعل لنا ذات أنواط كما لهم ذات أنواط فقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم: (الله أكبر! إنها السنن، قلتم ـ والذي نفسي بيده ـ كما قالت بنو إسرائيل لموسى: (<span style="color:#008000;">اجعل لنا إلهاً كما لهم آلهة قال إنكم قوم تجهلون</span>)  (لتركبن سنن من كان قبلكم</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(رواه الترمذي وصححه )</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Abū Wāqid al-Laythī said: &#8220;We went with Allah&#8217;s Messenger to Ḥunayn while we had just recently left disbelief. The mushrikīn had a lote tree which they used to frequent and hang their swords upon. They called it <em>thāt al-anwāt </em></strong>(possessor of the medals of honor)<strong>. Afterward, we passed by </strong>(another)<strong> lote tree, so we said: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8216;O Messenger of Allah, make a <em>thāt al-anwāt</em> for us like their <em>thāt al-anwāt</em>.&#8217; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>«Allahu Akbar! This way that you have mentioned, by the One in whose Hand my soul is, is just like what the children of Isrā&#8217;īl asked Mūsā:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O Mūsā! Make for us an ilahān (a god) as they have āliha (gods). He said: &#8216;Verily, you are a people who are behaving ignorantly</strong></span>.&#8217;» [Sūrah al-A&#8217;rāf (7):138]</p>
<p><strong>You will follow the way of those before you.»</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadith Reported by at-Tirmithī no. 2181 and he graded it ḥasan ṣaḥīḥ. It is also recorded by others. Shaykh Al-Albānī graded it ṣaḥīḥ in Ṣaḥīḥ al-Jāmī&#8217; no. 3601.]</span></p>

<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وعن أبي سعيد الخدري رضي الله عنه عن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال: (قال موسى: يا رب، علمني شيئاً أذكرك وأدعوك به. قال: يا موسى: قل لا إله إلا الله. قال: يا رب كل عبادك يقولون هذا. قال: يا موسى، لو أن السموات السبع وعامرهن غيري، والأرضين السبع في كفة، ولا إله الله في كفة، مالت بهن لا إله الله) [رواه ابن حبان، والحاكم وصححه].</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri (<em>radi Allaahu anhu</em>) narrated that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> &#8220;Musa (Moses) (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) said: &#8216;O my Rabb, teach me something through which I can remember You and supplicate to You.&#8217; </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allah answered: &#8216;Say, O Musa, <em>La ilaha ilIa-Allah</em>&#8216;. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Musa said: &#8216;O my Rabb, all your slaves say these words&#8217;. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allah said: &#8216;O Musa, if the seven heavens and all they contain other than Me </strong></span>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">01</span>]<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> (Ghairy) and the seven earths as well, were all put in one side of a scale and <em>La ilaha ilIa-Allah</em> put in the other the latter would overweigh them.'&#8221;  </strong>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">02</span>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[This Hadith has been reported by Ibn Hibban, and Al-Hakim declared it Sahih].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">01</span>] <span style="color:#999999;">This phrase (Ghairy) is the exception from what is in the heavens. It should not be misunderstood that Allah is contained within the heavens or earth since He has described Himself in the Qur&#8217;an as the Transcendent, Most High, Above All, i.e. in 2:255, 20:5, 25:59 and many places elsewhere in His Book. Indeed the statement is another proof that Allah cannot be considered within the creation. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Translation and Footnotes [01] are taken from: Darusalam english publication]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">02</span>] This ḥadīth was recorded by Ibn Ḥib-bān, al-Ḥākim, an-Nasā&#8217;ī in al-Yawm wal-Laylah, aṭ-Ṭabarānī in ad-Du&#8217;ā and al-Bayhaqī in al-Asmā&#8217; waṣ-Ṣifāt. Al-Ḥākim graded it ṣaḥīḥ and ath-Thahabī was silent about it, usually indicating his approval. Similarly Ibn Ḥajar graded it ṣaḥīḥ in Fat.ḥ al-Bārī 11:208, it has a slightly different chain of narrators with aṭ-Ṭabarānī and Abū Ya&#8217;la about which al-Haythamī said (al-Majma&#8217;): &#8220;It is recorded by Abū Ya&#8217;la and its men are trustworthy, but among them there is some weakness.&#8221; Commenting on the chain of Ibn Ḥib-bān, &#8216;Alūsh (Tashnif al-Athān no. 927) says: &#8220;Its chain is weak, Darāj Abū Sumah is weak in his reports from Abū al-Haytham.&#8221; Ibn al-Munthir listed Darāj Abū Sumah among the narrators who the ḥadīth scholars differ over saying, &#8220;Abū Ḥātim declared him weak, as did ad-Dāraqutnī and others, Aḥmad said, &#8220;His ḥadīths are rejected,&#8221; an-Nasā&#8217;ī said, &#8220;Rejected.&#8221; Yet others considered him trustworthy like Yahyā b. Ma&#8217;īn (it seems that quotes from him are what al-Ḥākim depended upon according to al-Munthirī&#8217;s comments in at-Targhīb) and particularly at-Tirmithī in case he reports from Abū al-Haytham (as in this case)! Likewise he was quoted for support by Ibn Khuzaymah. Al-Albānī calls him the possessor and author of munākir (rejected ḥadīths) see al-Dā&#8217;īfah 1:294 and 254. Al-Albānī graded it weak in Da&#8217;īf al-Mawārid al-Zamān no. 295 , as did Muqbil b. Hādī in al-Mustadrak no. 1988.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is however a more agreed upon authentic ḥadīth with different wording that gives much of the desired meaning for the context of this point. &#8216;Abdullāh b. &#8216;Amr b. al-&#8216;Ās narrated that the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: «When death visited Allah&#8217;s Prophet Nūh (<em>alaihissalam</em>), he said to his son: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;I shall narrate to you the will. I command you with two things and I forbid you from two things: I command with <em>Lā ilāha illa Allāh</em>. Surely if the seven heavens and the seven earths were placed on a pan of a scale, and <em>Lā ilāha illa Allāh</em> was placed on the other pan of the scale, they would give in to <em>Lā ilāha illa Allāh</em>&#8230;</strong></span>» This ḥadīth was recorded by al-Bukhaaree in al-Adab al-Mufrad, Aḥmad, al-Bayhaqī in al-Asmā&#8217;, and also aṭ-Ṭabarānī according to al-Haythamī who said, &#8220;This isnād is ṣaḥīḥ.&#8221; Al-Albānī included it in aṣ-Ṣahīhah no. 134, and Shaykh Muqbil b. Hādī included Aḥmad&#8217;s ḥadīth in Ṣaḥīḥ al-Musnad minma Laysa fī aṣ-Ṣaḥīḥayn v. 1 p.544 and he said, &#8220;This ḥadīth is ṣaḥīḥ.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Pillars of <em>Eemaan</em></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قال : وأركانه ستة : أن تؤمن بالله ، وملائكته ، وكتبه ، ورسله ، واليوم الآخر ، وتؤمن بالقدر خيره وشره</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Its pillars are six: to have <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and to have <em>eemaan </em>in Pre-Decree, the good of it, and the bad of it</strong>.</span><sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">43</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">43</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p>[Note: Shaykh Fawzan covers <strong><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2016/06/18/difference-between-pillars-and-branches-of-eemaan/">Difference between Pillars and Branches of Eemaan</a></strong>  before explaining the Pillars]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying: «<strong>Its pillars are six</strong>» meaning: it supports which it is established upon, and if they are absent, then it will be absent, or if one of them is absent, then it will be absent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are six pillars, and they are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The first one: «To have <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah.»</span></strong> So, the first pillar is having <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah, and it includes the three categories of <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em>: <em>Eemaan</em> that Allaah the Perfect and Most High is One, Unique, Alone, the Perfect Lord and Master whom everything depends totally upon, Who has no Partner in His Lordship, nor in His Right to worship, nor in His Names and Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The second one: «<em>Eemaan</em> in the Angels»</span></strong> &#8216;<em>Malaa.ika</em>&#8216; (angels) is the plural of <em>malak</em> (angel). Its origin in the language is <em>mal.ak</em> (ملأك), so it was then made easier to pronounce and was said as &#8216;<em>malak</em>.&#8217; The angels are beings created by Allaah in the world of the <em><u>gh</u>ayb</em> (hidden and unseen). Allaah created them to worship Him, and to carry out His commands, He the Perfect and Most High, within His dominion. They are different types; every type has a duty which it is entrusted with and which it carries out. They do not disobey Allaah regarding that which He commands them, and they do whatever they are commanded. So, from them, there are those who are entrusted with the revelation, and he is Jibreel <em>`alaihissalaam</em>. He is the noblest one from the angels; he is <em>ar-Roo<u>h</u>ul-Ameen</em> (the Trustworthy Spirit) and he is described as <em><u>Sh</u>adeedul-Quwaa</em> (the Mighty in Strength). And from them, are those entrusted with bearing the Throne:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِينَ يَحْمِلُونَ الْعَرْشَ وَمَنْ حَوْلَهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Those who bear the Throne and those who are around it</strong></span>.» [40:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Most High said,</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَالْمَلَكُ عَلَىٰ أَرْجَائِهَا ۚ وَيَحْمِلُ عَرْشَ رَبِّكَ فَوْقَهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ ثَمَانِيَةٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the angels will be at its edges, and eight angels, will, on that Day, bear the Throne of your Lord</strong></span>.» [69:17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Throne is the most tremendous of the created things, and no one knows its greatness except for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. It will be carried by the angels &#8211; and this is a proof of the tremendous size of the angels, their great strength and their nature. He, the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ فَاطِرِ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ جَاعِلِ الْمَلَائِكَةِ رُسُلًا أُولِي أَجْنِحَةٍ مَّثْنَىٰ وَثُلَاثَ وَرُبَاعَ ۚ يَزِيدُ فِي الْخَلْقِ مَا يَشَاءُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>All praise is for Allaah, the Creator and Originator of the heavens and the earth, the One who made His angel messengers with wings, &#8211; two, three, and four. He increases in creation whatever He wishes</strong></span>.» [35:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, from them are those who have six hundred wings, such as Jibreel <em>`alaihis<u>s</u>alaatu wasalaam</em>. No one knows their tremendous size except for Allaah, the Perfect and Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ &#8211; لَا يَسْبِقُونَهُ بِالْقَوْلِ وَهُم بِأَمْرِهِ يَعْمَلُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Rather, they are honoured servants. They do not proceed Him in speaking, and they act upon His commands</strong></span>.» [21:26-27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From them are those who are entrusted with the rain-drops and the plants, and he is Mikaeel. And from them are those who are entrusted with blowing the horn, and he is Israafeel. He will blow the horn and everything will perish. He, the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَنُفِخَ فِي الصُّورِ فَصَعِقَ مَن فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَن فِي الْأَرْضِ إِلَّا مَن شَاءَ اللَّهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the horn will be blown, and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is upon the earth, will swoon</strong> (drop down dead)<strong> except whomever Allaah wishes</strong>.</span>» [39:68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then it will be blown for a second time, and the souls will return to their bodies:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> ثُمَّ نُفِخَ فِيهِ أُخْرَىٰ فَإِذَا هُمْ قِيَامٌ يَنظُرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then it will be blown again and they will be standing, looking on</strong></span>» [39:68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The souls will fly from the <em>Qarn</em>, which is the horn, back to their bodies, and they will enter into them and they will come to life by the Permission of Allaah, then they will proceed to the gathering place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them are those who are entrusted with taking of the souls at the end of their lifespans, and he is <em>Malak al-Mawt</em> (the Angel of Death). He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ يَتَوَفَّاكُم مَّلَكُ الْمَوْتِ الَّذِي وُكِّلَ بِكُمْ ثُمَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكُمْ تُرْجَعُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: The angel of death, who has been entrusted with you, will take your souls, then you will be returned to your Lord</strong>.</span>» [32:11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he has with him assistance from the angels:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">تَوَفَّتْهُ رُسُلُنَا وَهُمْ لَا يُفَرِّطُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Our Messengers </strong>(from the angels)<strong> take his soul, and they do not neglect their duty</strong>.</span>» [6:61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: they are the helpers for the angel of death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them are those who are entrusted with the foetuses in the wombs. The Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">» إن أحدكم يجمع خلقه في بطن أمه أربعين يوما نطفة ، ثم يكون علقة مثل ذلك ، ثم يكون مضغة مثل ذلك ، ثم يرسل إليه الملك «</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>The creation of each one of you is brought together in the abdomen of his mother for forty days as a sperm drop, then he will be a clinging clot of blood for the like of that, then he will be a piece of flesh for the like of that, then the angel is sent to him</strong>.»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadith Reported by al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree no. 3208 and Muslim no. 2643 from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood, <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu `anhu</em>.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them are those who are entrusted with recording the deeds of the descendents of Aadam. He, the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِنَّ عَلَيْكُمْ لَحَافِظِينَ  &#8211; كِرَامًا كَاتِبِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And there are watchers over you and there are honourable scribes writing down your deeds</strong></span>.» [82:10-11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They stay with you throughout the night and the day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">»يتعاقبون فيكم ملائكة بالليل ، وملائكة بالنهار «</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>The angels of the night and the day come to you in succession</strong>.»</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadith Reported by al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree no. 555 and Muslim no. 632 from a <em><u>h</u>adeet<u>h</u></em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu `anhu</em>.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they gather together at the <em>Fajr</em> and <em>`A<u>s</u>r</em> prayer. They bear witness for those people who pray with Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. Therefore, He, the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ قُرْآنَ الْفَجْرِ كَانَ مَشْهُودًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the recitation of the Qur`aan in the <em>Fajr</em> prayer is witnessed</strong>.</span>» [17:78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: The angels attend it, the angels of the night and the angels of the day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them are those who are entrusted with guarding the descendants of Aadam from disagreeable things; they guard them from calamities, from enemies, creatures; the wild animals, serpents or snakes, for as long as he lives, he has angels guarding him from dangerous things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He may sleep between wild animals and snakes in open desert, (so) who repels the snakes, the wild animals and creatures from him? He has angels whom Allaah, He the Most High, has placed in their service. Allaah said with regard to them:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَهُ مُعَقِّبَاتٌ مِّن بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِ يَحْفَظُونَهُ مِنْ أَمْرِ اللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There are angels guarding him in succession, from in front of him and from behind him by the Command of Allaah</strong></span>.» [13:11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: by the Command of Allaah, they guard the children of Aadam from disagreeable things and from dangers, until his lifespan draws to a close. So, when his lifespan comes to an end, they leave him. And that which Allaah has decreed to occur will occur, be it death or being stopped by something which leads to death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them are angels who are entrusted with carrying out the commands in different areas of the heavens and the earth. No one knows them except for Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From them are angels who seek out the gatherings of remembrance of Allaah and they attend them, just as Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">»ما اجتمع قوم في بيت من بيوت الله ، يتلون كتاب الله ، ويتدارسونه بينهم ، إلا نزلت  عليهم السكينة ، وغشيتهم الرحمة ، وحفتهم الملائكة«</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>No people gather in a house from the houses of Allaah, reciting the Book of Allaah and studying it amongst them, except that (<em>as-sakeenah</em>) tranquility descends upon them, and mercy covers them, and the angels encircle them with their wings</strong>.»</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadith Reported by Muslim no. 2699 from a <em><u>h</u>adeet<u>h</u></em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu `anhu</em>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are angels who travel about upon the earth, seeking out the circles of the remembrance of Allaah and attending them.</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"> [Hadith Reported by al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree no. 6408 from a <em><u>h</u>adeet<u>h</u></em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu `anh</em>.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one knows all about the angels, their types and characteristics except for Allaah. However, as for what occurs in the texts of the Qur`aan and the authentic <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>, then we affirm it, and we believe it as our <em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) ; and whatever has not been mentioned to us, then we withhold from it, and we do not delve into it, because this is from <em>`ilmul-<u>gh</u>ayb</em> (the knowledge of the hidden and the unseen) which we do not enter into, except with a proof.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, having <em>eemaan</em> in the angels is a pillar from the pillars of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever denies the angels and says: &#8220;<em>There are no angels (in existence) because we do not see them</em>,&#8221; then this person will be a disbeliever, an apostate and heretic, and Allaah&#8217;s refuge is sought. This is because he does not have <em>eemaan</em> in the <em><u>gh</u>ayb</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, the person who interprets the angels away and says: &#8220;<em>The angels are just abstract things and not bodily beings; they are just thoughts or promptings which occur to a person. If they are good promptings, then they are angels, and if they are evil promptings, then they are devils</em>,&#8221; this is a saying involving apostasy, and Allaah&#8217;s refuge is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unfortunately, this is found in <em>Tafseerul-Manaar</em>, it was quoted by Mu<u>h</u>ammad Ra<u>sh</u>eed Ridaa from his <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> Mu<u>h</u>ammad `Abdah. This is speech of the philosophers and it is <em>baa<u>t</u>il</em> (false and futile). Whoever truly holds this as his creed and belief, he is a disbeliever. However, we hope that he was just quoting it, and he did not believe it, however, he quoted it without criticism, and that is dangerous. This is false and futile speech, and it is disbelief in the angels. We ask Allaah for safety and security.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person should not enter with his own intellect and thinking into this, nor should he quote anything from the philosophers and heretics with regard to anything from the affairs of the religion and the matters of <em>`ilmul-<u>gh</u>ayb</em>. Rather, he should rely upon the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>. This is what is obligatory. And he mentions in <em>Tafseerul-Manaar</em> that he was quoting from the book <em>I<u>h</u>yaa Uloom ad-Deen</em> of al-<u>Gh</u>azaalee, and Allaah knows best. And the book <em>I<u>h</u>yaa Uloom ad-Deen</em> of al-Ghazaalee contains terrible and calamitous things, and it contains some things from good and benefits, however, it contains a great deal of matters which can cause destruction, and it contains a great deal of poison. It is a book which is mixed up, its evil is more than its good. So therefore, it is not befitting that the beginner or the common person should look into it, unless he has the knowledge and ability to distinguish between the truth and falsehood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the angels are not abstract things as is said, rather, the angels have bodies and forms, they can take on different forms which Allaah gives them the ability to take on. Therefore, Jibreel <em>`alaihis-salaam</em> came to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> in the form of a man. So, Allaah gives them the ability to take forms for the benefit of the descendants of Aadam, because the descendants of Aadam are not able to see the angels in the form upon which Allaah created them. So, he came to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> in the form of a man out of kindness to the sons of Aadam. And they are not seen in their true forms and realities, except at the time of punishment. He, the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ الْمَلَائِكَةَ لَا بُشْرَىٰ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُجْرِمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>On the Day when they will see the angels, there will be no glad tidings on that Day for the criminals</strong></span>.» [25:22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At death, the person will see them, he will see the angels of death, however, in this world and once he is alive, he does not see them because he is not able to see them. Allaah created them from light and He created the devils from Fire, just as occurs in the <em>Qur`aan</em>, and He created Aadam from earth, so Allaah has full ability over everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the disbelievers believed that the angels are the daughters of Allaah. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَجَعَلُوا الْمَلَائِكَةَ الَّذِينَ هُمْ عِبَادُ الرَّحْمَٰنِ إِنَاثًا ۚ أَشَهِدُوا خَلْقَهُمْ ۚ سَتُكْتَبُ شَهَادَتُهُمْ وَيُسْأَلُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they made the angels, who are servants of the Most Merciful, females. Did they witness their creation? Their testimony will be written and they will be questioned about it</strong>.</span>» [43:19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The third one: «<em>Eemaan</em> in his books»</span></strong> They are the Books which Allaah sent down to the Messengers for the guidance of mankind. We have <em>eemaan</em> that they are the speech of Allaah in reality, and we have <em>eemaan</em> in whatever Allaah named from them and in whatever He has not named. Allaah named to us from them the <em>Tauraat</em>, the <em>Injeel</em>, the Tremendous Qur`aan, the <em>Zaboor</em>, and the Scripture given to Ibraaheem and Moosaa. We have <em>eemaan</em> in them and we have <em>eemaan</em> in those that Allaah did not name to us from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, <em>eemaan</em> in the previous scriptures is <em>eemaan</em> in general terms, whereas <em>eemaan</em> in the Qur`aan is <em>eemaan</em> in the details of everything contained in it. This is because it is our Book and was sent down to our Prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. Whoever denies one <em>aayah</em> or one letter from its letters, then he is a <em>kaafir</em> and a <em>murtad</em> (apostate) who has left <em>Islaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, whoever believes in a part of the Qur`aan and disbelieves in a part, then he is a <em>kaafir</em>, and one who believes in some of the scriptures and disbelieves in some, then he is a <em>kaafir</em>. Whoever says: &#8220;I believe in the Qur`aan, but I do not believe in the <em>Tauraat</em> and the <em>Injeel</em>,&#8221; then he is a <em>kaafir</em>.  Or says: &#8220;I believe in the <em>Tauraat</em> and the <em>Injeel</em>, but I do not believe in the <em>Zaboor</em> which was sent to Daawood <em>`alaihissalaam</em>,&#8221; then he is a <em>kaafir</em>. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَآتَيْنَا دَاوُودَ زَبُورًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We gave the <em>Zaboor</em> to Daawood</strong>.</span>» [4:163]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or one who denies the scriptures of Ibraaheem, then he is a <em>kaafir</em>, because he has denied the truth of that which Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, said. He is denying His Messengers, so therefore, he is a <em>kaafir</em>, because he has denied a pillar from the pillars of <em>eemaan</em>.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The fourth one: «<em>Eemaan</em> in his Messengers»</span></strong> Having <em>eemaan</em> in all of the Messengers, from the first of them to the last of them, those whom Allaah has named from them and those He did not name.  We have <em>eemaan</em> in all of them, and that they are Messengers of Allaah in truth. They came with the Message and they conveyed it to their nations. So, whoever disbelieves in a single Prophet, then he is a disbeliever in all of the Messengers, because of His saying, the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَكْفُرُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَيُرِيدُونَ أَن يُفَرِّقُوا بَيْنَ اللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَيَقُولُونَ نُؤْمِنُ بِبَعْضٍ وَنَكْفُرُ بِبَعْضٍ وَيُرِيدُونَ أَن يَتَّخِذُوا بَيْنَ ذَٰلِكَ سَبِيلًا أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْكَافِرُونَ حَقًّا ۚ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَابًا مُّهِينًا  وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَلَمْ يُفَرِّقُوا بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِّنْهُمْ أُولَٰئِكَ سَوْفَ يُؤْتِيهِمْ أُجُورَهُمْ ۗ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Those who disbelieve in Allaah and His Messengers and wish to make a distinction between believing in Allaah and His Messengers. They say: &#8220;We believe in some of them and we disbelieve in some,&#8221; and they wish to take a path in between. They are the disbelievers in truth. And We have prepared a humiliating punishment for the disbelievers</strong>. <strong>And those who truly believe in Allaah and His Messengers and do not differentiate in believing in any of them</strong>, <strong>to them He will soon give their rewards</strong>. <strong>And Allaah has always been One who Forgives Extensively and Bestows Mercy</strong></span>.» [4:150-152]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore disbelieving in a single Prophet or a single Messenger is to disbelieve in all of them. He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">كَذَّبَتْ قَوْمُ نُوحٍ الْمُرْسَلِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The people of Noo<u>h</u> rejected the Messengers</strong></span>.» [26:105]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though they only rejected Nooh, their denial of Noo<u>h</u> became a denial of the rest of the Messengers. Likewise, whoever disbelieves in `Eesaa and Mu<u>h</u>ammad, such as the Jews, or whoever disbelieves in Mu<u>h</u>ammad, such as the Christians, then he is a disbeliever in all of them. There must be <em>eemaan</em> in all of the Messengers `<em>alaihumu<u>s</u>alaatu wasalaam</em>, those whom Allaah has named from them and those He has not named.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has named some of them as occurs in <em>Sooratul-An`aam</em>:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَتِلْكَ حُجَّتُنَا آتَيْنَاهَا إِبْرَاهِيمَ عَلَىٰ قَوْمِهِ ۚ نَرْفَعُ دَرَجَاتٍ مَّن نَّشَاءُ ۗ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ حَكِيمٌ عَلِيمٌ </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ إِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ ۚ كُلًّا هَدَيْنَا ۚ وَنُوحًا هَدَيْنَا مِن قَبْلُ ۖ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِهِ دَاوُودَ وَسُلَيْمَانَ وَأَيُّوبَ وَيُوسُفَ وَمُوسَىٰ وَهَارُونَ ۚ وَكَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِي الْمُحْسِنِينَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَزَكَرِيَّا وَيَحْيَىٰ وَعِيسَىٰ وَإِلْيَاسَ ۖ كُلٌّ مِّنَ الصَّالِحِينَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَالْيَسَعَ وَيُونُسَ وَلُوطًا ۚ وَكُلًّا فَضَّلْنَا عَلَى الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong style="color:#008000;">And that was Our Proof which We gave to Ibraaheem against his people. We raise in degrees whomever We wish. Indeed, your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing. And We bestowed upon him</strong> <b style="color:#008000;">Is-haaq and Yaqoob, We guided them all, and Noo</b><u style="color:#008000;font-weight:bold;">h</u><b style="color:#008000;">, We guided before, and from his </b><span style="color:#008000;"><b>descendants</b></span><b style="color:#008000;"> were Daawood, Sulayman, Ayyoob, Yusuf, Moosaa, and Haaroon. Likewise shall We reward the doers of good. And Zakariyyah, and Ya</b><u style="color:#008000;font-weight:bold;">h</u><b style="color:#008000;">yaa, and Ilyaas, all of them were from the righteous. And Ismaa`eel, and al-Yas`aa, and Yoonus and Loot, all of them We gave excellence over the people of the world</b></span>.» [6:83-86]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He mentioned a number of them together in these <em>aayahs</em> and in other <em>aayahs</em>. So, we have <em>eemaan</em> in those whom Allaah has named from them and we have <em>eemaan</em> in those whom Allaah has not named from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The fifth one: «The Last Day» <em>Eemaan</em> in the Last Day is the fifth pillar.</span></strong> The Last Day &#8211; what is meant by it is <em>Yawm al-Qiyaamah</em> (the Day of Resurrection). It is called the Last Day because it comes after the <em>Yawm al-Awal </em>(the First Day), and that is the Day of this world. This world is the First Day, and the Resurrection is the Last Day. Having <em>eemaan</em> in the Last Day is to have <em>eemaan</em> in whatever will occur after death from the punishment of the grave and its bliss and the questioning of the two Angels in the grave. Everything that will occur after the grave is a part of <em>eemaan</em> in the Last Day, likewise, <em>eemaan</em> in <em>al-Ba`<u>th</u> </em>(dead being brought to life), <em>an-Nu<u>sh</u>oor</em> (Resurrection), <em>al-Ma<u>hsh</u>ara</em> (the Gathering Place), <em>al-<u>Hi</u>saab</em> (Reckoning), <em>Waznul-A`maal</em> (Weighing of the Deeds), <em>a<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>iraat </em>(Bridge over the Hell-Fire), <em>al-Mizaan</em> (the Balance upon which the good and bad deeds will be weighed), and <em>al-Jannah</em> (Paradise) and <em>an-Naar</em> (Fire). So the details of what will occur on the Last Day, we have <em>eemaan</em> in it &#8211; in general and with the specifics &#8211; beginning with death right until the inhabitants of Paradise settle in Paradise and the inhabitants of the Fire are in the Fire. Everything which is authentic in that regard, we have <em>eemaan</em> in it. We do not have any doubt at all about anything from it. Whoever doubts about anything from it, then he is a <em>kaafir</em> and a <em>murtad</em> upon <em>Islaam</em> &#8211; everything to which the term the Last Day applies and what is contained in it.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The sixth pillar: «And to have <em>eemaan</em> in pre-decree</span></strong>, the good of it, and the bad of it.» You have <em>eemaan</em> that whatever occurs from this creation, from good or evil, from disbelief or true faith, from blessings or punishments, from ease or hardship, from sickness or health, from life or death &#8211; everything occurs in this creation is pre-decreed. It does not just occur like that. It is not just a matter which happens on its own, meaning: it just initially comes about, not being pre-decreed. So, you have <em>eemaan</em> that it all comes about with the decree and ordainment of Allaah. And you have <em>eemaan</em> that whatever befalls you would not have missed you and whatever missed you was not going to come upon you, and that this was by the ordainment of Allaah and His pre-decree. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا أَصَابَ مِن مُّصِيبَةٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا فِي أَنفُسِكُمْ إِلَّا فِي كِتَابٍ مِّن قَبْلِ أَن نَّبْرَأَهَا ۚ إِنَّ ذَٰلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>No calamity befalls on the earth nor in yourselves except that it was already written in a Book, before We created it. That is easy for Allaah</strong>.</span>» [57:22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is <em>eemaan</em> with the pre-decree.<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Eemaan</em> in pre-decree includes four levels, whoever does not have <em>eemaan</em> in all of them is not a believer in pre-decree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first level</strong>: Knowledge that Allaah has known everything, always. He knows what occurs, whatever has occurred and whatever will occur without end. So, Allaah knew it always before it was and before it occurred. He, the Perfect and Most High, knew it with His Eternal Knowledge &#8211; which is His Attribute &#8211; has always been and will be forever. This is the level of knowledge, whoever denies it is a <em>kaafir</em>.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second level</strong>: The level of writing down in the <em>Law<u>h</u> al-Ma<u>h</u>foodh</em> (the Preserved Tablet). And it is that Allaah wrote down everything in the Preserved Tablet. Nothing occurs except that it was written down in the Preserved Tablet. There is nothing that occurs and it is not written there, therefore He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا أَصَابَ مِن مُّصِيبَةٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا فِي أَنفُسِكُمْ إِلَّا فِي كِتَابٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>No calamity befalls on the earth nor in yourselves except that it was already written in a Book</strong></span>.» [57:22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: the Preserved Tablet. Allaah wrote in it the decreed measures of everything. Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">» أول ما خلق الله القلم ، قال : اكتب ، قال : وما أكتب ؟ قال : اكتب ما هو كائن إلى يوم القيامة «</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«The first thing that Allaah created was the pen.<br />
He said: &#8220;Write.&#8221;<br />
It said: &#8220;And what shall I write?&#8221;<br />
He said: &#8220;<strong>Write whatever will occur until the Day of Resurrection</strong>.&#8221;»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadith Reported by Aboo Daawood no. 3800, at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee no. 2155 from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Ubaadah ibn a<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>aamit, <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu `anhu</em>.] [Declared authentic by <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> al-Albaanee (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>)].</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, whoever denies the writing and says: &#8220;Allaah knows everything, however He did not write anything down in the Preserved Tablet,&#8221; this person is a <em>kaafir</em> and an apostate who has left the religion of <em>Islaam</em>.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third level</strong>: Allaah&#8217;s <em>Ma<u>sh</u>ee.ah</em> (Will) which is in effect. It is that Allaah, the Perfect, wishes a thing and wills it to occur. So, there is nothing that occurs except that Allaah wished and willed it to occur just as it is in the Preserved Tablet and just as He knew it, He the Perfect and Most High. He wills everything to occur at its time. He wills everything to occur at a certain time. Nothing occurs without the will of Allaah or without His wish. So, whoever says: &#8220;<em>Things occur without Allaah wishing them to or without Allaah&#8217;s willing them to</em>,&#8221; then he is a <em>kaafir</em>.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The fourth level</strong>: The level of creating and bringing it into exist. Allaah created it everything. When He wishes and wills it, He, the Perfect and Most High, creates it and brings it about. So everything is something created by Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, and it is from the creation of Allaah. It is an action done by the servants and something earned by them [meaning deeds].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these four levels, there must be <em>eemaan</em> in them, otherwise the person will not be a believer in pre-decree, the level of knowledge, writing, wish and will, and creation and the bringing into existence. It is essential to have <em>eemaan</em> in all of these. Whoever denies anything from them, then he is a <em>kaafir</em> and an apostate who has left the religion of <em>Islaam</em>, because he has denied a pillar from the pillars of <em>eemaan</em>, and it is <em>eemaan</em> in the pre-decree.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Proof for the Pillars of <em>Eemaan</em></strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">والدليل على هذه الأركان الستة قوله تعالى :</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The proof for these six pillars is His saying He, the Most High:</span></strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَّيْسَ الْبِرَّ أَن تُوَلُّوا وُجُوهَكُمْ قِبَلَ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ وَلَٰكِنَّ الْبِرَّ مَنْ آمَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ وَالْمَلَائِكَةِ وَالْكِتَابِ وَالنَّبِيِّينَ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And righteousness is not that you turn your faces towards the East or the West; but rather, righteousness is the righteousness of those who have <em>eemaan </em></strong>(truly believe<strong>) in Allaah, the Last Day, the Angels, the Books, and the Prophets</strong></span>.» [2:177]  <sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">44</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">44</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> having explained these pillars mentions the proof from the Qur`aan and <em>Sunnah</em>, because any matter from the matters of the religion, of worship, <em>`aqeedah</em> and the matters of legislated rulings, require a <em>daleel</em> (proof). If it does not have a proof, it will not be <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (correct). So, the <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> having mentioned the six pillars of <em>eemaan</em>, he mentions their proof from the Qur`aan firstly and then from the <em>Sunnah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the Qur`aan is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">.. لَّيْسَ الْبِرَّ أَن تُوَلُّوا وُجُوهَكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">« <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And righteousness is not that you turn your faces </strong></span>» [2:177]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Birr</em> (righteousness) is the doing of good which draws one closer to Allaah and leads to His Paradise. So, all actions of good are from <em>al-birr</em>. <em>Al-Birr</em> is a general word which covers all types of good and all types of acts of obedience. They all enter under the title of <em>birr</em> and under the title of <em>taqwaa</em> (dutifulness to Allaah).So, <em>al-birr</em> and <em>taqwaa</em> are comprehensive terms which gather all the characteristics of good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَّيْسَ الْبِرَّ أَن تُوَلُّوا وُجُوهَكُمْ قِبَلَ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">« <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And righteousness is not that you turn your faces towards the East or the West</strong></span>. » [2:177]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a refutation of the Jews who criticized the changing of the <em>Qiblah</em> (direction of the prayer) from Jerusalem to the honored <em>Ka`bah</em>. They criticized this and denied it along with their knowledge that they knew that it was true. However, they denied it as a case of obstinate rejection, haughtiness and envy towards the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi was allam</em> and towards this nation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says: It is not righteousness that you turn your faces in a certain direction from the directions without a command from Allaah. But rather, righteousness is obedience to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. If He commands you with a command, it is obligatory upon you to comply with it. This is righteousness. So, if He commands you to face Jerusalem, then righteousness at that time is to face the direction of Jerusalem, because it was obedience to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. Then, when He commands you to face the <em>Ka`bah</em>, righteousness is to face the <em>Ka`bah</em>. So, righteousness goes along with the command of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You are slaves. It is obligatory upon you to comply. If Allaah commands you to face a certain direction, it is obligatory upon you to comply. But as for clinging in a bigoted manner to one certain direction, saying: &#8220;<em>It is not correct except to face it,</em>&#8221; then the meaning of this is the following of desires and tribalism. Whereas the true servant goes along with the commands of Allaah wherever they go. He does not raise any objection to the command of Allaah, since facing a direction after it has been abrogated will not be obedience to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. So, acting upon that which has been abrogated and leaving that which abrogates is not obedience to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, rather it is just obedience to desires and tribalism. So, righteousness is connected to obedience to Allaah; in whichever directions He turns you, you turn in that direction if you are true in your servitude to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We have created all things in accordance with a predetermined measure</strong></span>.» [54:49]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Everything which Allaah created is predetermined in His Knowledge, His Writing, His Wish and Will, He the Perfect and Most High. It is not something which spontaneously occurs or something accidental, rather it is something preceded with the Knowledge of Allaah, written in the Preserved Tablet, and something preceded in the Wish and Will of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>

<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The proof is His saying, He the Most High:</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وهذا هو معنى لا إله إلا الله، وفي الحديثِ : « رأسُ الأمْرِ الإسلامُ وعمودُهُ الصَّلاةُ وذروةُ سنَامِهِ الجهادُ في سبيلِ اللهِ » </strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And this is the meaning of <em>‘laa ilaaha ill Allaah’</em> (none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And in the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“The head of the affair is al-Islaam, and its supporting pillar is the prayer, and its highest part is jihaad in Allaah’s cause</span>.” [1]</strong><span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>84</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">84</span>] : <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh said: “<strong>And this is the meaning of <em>laa ilaaha ill Allaah</em>…</strong>”<strong> &#8211; </strong>Meaning: rejection of at <em>Taaghoot</em> and <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Al-</strong><strong>Islaam</strong> </span>is: To submit to Allaah with tawheed and to yield to Him with obedience and to free oneself from shirk and its people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the head of the affair of the religion; the two testimonies are the head of Islaam and they are the foundation of Islaam. So a person will not enter into Islaam unless he comes with the two testimonies, uttering them and having knowledge of them and acting upon them and holding them as his creed and belief. He will not be a Muslim except with this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The religion is likened to a body which has a head and a main support and a highest part. So if the head is cut off or if there is no head, then life cannot carry on. Likewise without <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, the Religion cannot remain because it is the head which, if it is cut or passes away, then life passes away and the body is destroyed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">And its main supporting pillar which it stands upon is the Prayer.</span></strong> So without its supporting pillar, Islaam will not stand – like a dwelling made of animal hair or a tent – if it has no pillar which it can rest upon, it will not stand. So a house cannot stand except with a support. Then if the support is lost, the house will not stand. Likewise the Prayer – if it is lost, then Islaam will not stand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore the scholars have said that whoever abandons the Prayer out of laziness, he becomes a disbeliever, in the correct saying – even if he acknowledges its obligation because there is no benefit in acknowledging its obligation if he does not implement it and he does not act upon it, there will be no benefit in that. And therefore the verifiers from the people of knowledge judge that the person who abandons the Prayer deliberately, even if he acknowledges its obligation, is a disbeliever. As for if he denies its obligation, then he is a disbeliever by consensus of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“…and its highest part is <em>jihaad</em> in Allaah’s cause.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The highest part of the affair – which is the religion  &#8211; is <em>jihaad</em> in Allaah’s cause</strong></span>. So <em>jihaad</em> is a proof for the strength of Islaam; when <em>jihaad</em> in Allaah’s cause is found, then that is a proof that Islaam is in a condition of strength because <em>jihaad</em> cannot occur except as a result of strength in <em>eemaan</em> and physical strength.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> mentioned three matters for the Religion: the head, the supporting pillar and the highest part. So without the head, the Religion will not exist at all. So the person who does not establish the head – which is <em>tawheed</em> – will have no religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the person who does not pray, then the Religion will not be established for him even if he bears witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah because it requires a supporting pillar which the Religion can stand upon, and it cannot be found except through the Prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if <em>jihaad</em> is absent then the strength of Islaam will be absent and it will be an Islaam which is in a condition of weakness and the Muslims will be in a weak state. So there will be no strength for Islaam and the Muslims except through <em>jihaad</em> in Allaah’s cause, He the Mighty and Majestic. So it is a sign of strength and its absence is a sign of weakness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the manner in which the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> likened these three affairs with regards to the Religion: a head, a main support and a highest part, just as a camel which has a hump, this shows that it is strong. And if it has no hump, then this shows that it is emaciated and weak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise the Muslims today are in a state of weakness upon the Earth, and therefore there occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em>:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إذا تبايعتم بالعينة ، وأخذتم أذناب البقر، وتركتم الجهاد ، سلط الله عليكم ذلا لا يترعه منكم حتى ترجعوا إلى دينكم </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“When you engage in the <em>‘eenah</em> (usury/riba) transaction and you take hold of the tails of cows and you abandon <em>jihaad</em>, then Allaah will cause humiliation to overcome you; He will not remove it from you until you return to your religion.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadith Reported by Aboo Daawood (3462) from the hadeeth of ibn ‘Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu ‘anhumaa</em> and declared <u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> by al Albaanee]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So abandonment of <em>jihaad</em> is humiliation and weakness for the Muslims and its presence is a proof of strength and formness, just like the hump of an animal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah knows best and may Allaah extol our Prophet Muhammad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And with this, the explanation of the blessed book, the Three Fundamental Principles, is ended.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَا إِكْرَاهَ فِي الدِّينِ ۖ قَد تَّبَيَّنَ الرُّشْدُ مِنَ الْغَيِّ ۚ فَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِالطَّاغُوتِ وَيُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ فَقَدِ اسْتَمْسَكَ بِالْعُرْوَةِ الْوُثْقَىٰ لَا انفِصَامَ لَهَا ۗ وَاللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>No-one is to be compelled to enter the Religion, true guidance has been made clear and distinct from falsehood.  So whoever rejects <em>at Taaghoot</em> and truly believes in Allaah, then he has grasped the firmest handhold that will never break. And Allaah is All Hearing, All Knowing. </strong></span>[2:256]<span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>83</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">83</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Perfect and Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَا إِكْرَاهَ فِي الدِّينِ ۖ قَد تَّبَيَّنَ الرُّشْدُ مِنَ الْغَيِّ ۚ فَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِالطَّاغُوتِ وَيُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ فَقَدِ اسْتَمْسَكَ بِالْعُرْوَةِ الْوُثْقَىٰ لَا انفِصَامَ لَهَا ۗ وَاللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>No one is to be compelled to enter the Religion, true guidance has been made clear and distinct from falsehood.  So whoever rejects at <em>Taaghoot</em> and truly believes in Allaah, then he has grasped the firmest handhold that will never break. And Allaah is All Hearing, All Seeing.</strong></span>[2:256]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>No one is to be compelled to enter the Religion…</strong><strong> : </strong>Meaning – no one is to be forced to enter into Islaam against his will, because entering into Islaam must occur as a result of being convinced and from believing in the heart. And no one is to be forced into it against his will – this is not possible because no one can act with regards to the hearts except Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. No one may force anyone to enter Islaam because we do not possess and own the hearts. Rather it is just Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, He is the One who owns them and acts with regards to them. However we should call to Islaam and encourage people upon it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We strive and fight in Allaah’s Cause against whoever disbelieves, for the spread of Islaam and to provide an opportunity to whoever wants to accept Islaam, and in order to subdue the enemies of Allaah. But as for guidance, then it is in the Hand of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. No one is to be forced upon eemaan and Islaam. Rather this is something which relates back to the person himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; قَد تَّبَيَّنَ الرُّشْدُ مِنَ الْغَيِّ &#8230;</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>…true guidance has been made clear and distinct from falsehood…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Islaam, and all praise is for Allaah, does not contain anything which people have to be forced upon against their will. Rather all of it is beloved and desirable. Whereas kufr and shirk, all of it is evil and all of it is something detestable. So this has become clear from that. As <em>rushd</em> (guidance) – and it is the Truth – has become distinguished from <em>al-ghayy</em> – and it is falsehood. And a person has intellect and has the ability to think so that he can weigh and compare truth against falsehood. And his thinking, if it is sound and if it is free from desires and ulterior motives, then his sound thinking will guide him to acceptance of the truth without having to be forced. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>This is one saying</strong></span> with regards to the <em>aayah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the second saying</strong></span> is that this aayah came down with regard to the People of the Book; and that the People of the Book are not to be compelled to enter into Islaam. Rather if they want to remain upon their religion then they are to be left to do so with the condition that they hand over the <em>jizyah</em> to the Muslims and they (the People of the Book) are in a state of being humbled. And as for other than them from the disbelievers, then nothing will be accepted from them except Islaam or being killed because they have no religion; and idol worship is a false and futile religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">And the third saying</span></strong> is that this <em>aayah</em> was abrogated by the <em>aayah</em> commanding <em>jihaad</em>. So this was the case initially before <em>jihaad</em> was legislated, then <em>jihaad</em> was legislated and the <em>aayah</em> was abrogated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However the first (of the three sayings) is what is correct &#8211; that the <em>aayah</em> is not abrogated and that the religion cannot be entered into the hearts by force. Rather it can only enter through choice. However whoever does not accept the Religion, he will be dealt with in a manner that befits him, whether it be being killed or having the <em>jizyah</em> tax taken from him if he be from those regarding whom Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, has legislated that it be taken from.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; فَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِالطَّاغُوتِ وَيُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So whoever rejects <em>at-Taaghoot</em> and truly believes in Allaah…</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>At-Taaghoot</em> – what is meant is all of the <em>Taaghoots</em> in worship, in following or in obedience because the word “<em>at-Taaghoot</em>” here is left general.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rejecting the <em>Taaghoot</em> was put before having <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah (in the <em>aayah</em>) because having <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah will not benefit except after rejection of the <em>Taaghoot</em>. So whoever believes in Allaah but does not reject the <em>Taaghoot</em>, then his eemaan will not benefit him. So the person who says that he is a believer and he prays and he fasts and gives the <em>Zakaat</em> and performs the <em>Hajj</em> and he performs the acts of obedience but he does not dissociate himself from <em>shirk</em> nor from the people of <em>shirk</em> and says, “<em>They are not my business</em>” – this person will not be counted as a Muslim because he has not rejected the <em>Taaghoot</em>. So there must be rejection of the <em>Taaghoot</em> and it is to reject the <em>Taaghoot</em> and to believe as creed in its (the <em>Taaghoot’s</em>) falsehood and to distance oneself from it and from its people – this is essential. So his <em>eemaan</em> will not be correct except after rejecting the <em>Taaghoot</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the other <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولًا أَنِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُوا الطَّاغُوتَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We sent a messenger to every nation commanding, “Worship Allaah alone and avoid the <em>Taaghoot</em>!” </strong></span>[16:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the worship of Allaah will not be correct except through avoiding the <em>Taaghoot</em>. Two opposites cannot come together; <em>eemaan</em> and <em>kufr</em> cannot come together in the heart. <em>Eemaan</em> and major <em>kufr</em> cannot come together in the heart. As for the lesser <em>kufr</em> then it can come together (with <em>eemaan</em>).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">والدليل من السنة حديث جبريل المشهور:</span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>»</strong>عن عمر  رضى الله عنه قال : بينما نحن جلوس عند رسول الله  صلى الله عليه وسلم  إذ طلع علينا رجل ، شديد بياض الثياب ، شديد سواد الشعر<strong>«</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">And the proof from the <em>Sunnah</em> is the famous <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Jibreel:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">From `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu`anhu</em> who said: «<strong>Whilst we were sitting with Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>, a man came to us whose clothing was very white and whose hair was very black</strong>.»</span> <sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">48</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">48</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Speech with regard to <em>Islaam</em>, <em>eemaan</em> and <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em> has preceded and the pillars of each level. The <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) has mentioned the evidences for each level from the Qur`aan. All of that has preceded and finished.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, the <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) mentioned a proof for these levels from the <em>Sunnah</em>, the <em>Sunnah</em> of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>; so he mentioned the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Jibreel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He [Jibreel] came to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> whilst he was with his companions. He came to them in the form of a man and he sat with the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>, and asked him about <em>Islaam</em>, <em>eemaan</em>, and <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em>. Then, he asked him about the Last Hour and its signs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is called the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Jibreel or it is called the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Umar. It is a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> which occurs through a number of chains of narration from a group of the companions, so it is an authentic <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>. The <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) mentioned the narration of `Umar ibn al-<u>Kh</u>a<u>tt</u>aab [<strong>1</strong>] of this <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>. There is variations in the wordings of the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> in other narrations. However, the meaning is one and the same.</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[<strong>1</strong>] Hadith Reported in <u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> Muslim no. 8. Refer to <em>Jaami` al-Uloom wal-<u>H</u>ikam</em> of Ibn Rajab 1/93, second <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Whilst we were sitting with Allaah&#8217;s Messenger</strong> <strong><em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em></strong>» It was from their usual practice, may Allaah be pleased with them, that they would gather together in the presence of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> in the mosque, and that they would take knowledge from him and listen to his (<em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>) answers when he responded to questions. So, whilst they were like that in their normal condition, a man entered upon them through the door.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man «<strong>whose clothing was very white and whose hair was very black</strong>.» Meaning: Jibreel <em>`alaihissalaam</em>. He came in the form of this man and he did not come to them in his angelic form, because they would not have been able to look upon him in his angelic form.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">»لا يرى عليه أثر السفر ، ولا يعرفه منا أحد ، حتى جلس إلى النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم  فأسند ركبتيه إلى ركبتيه ، ووضع كفيه على فخذيه ، وقال : يا محمد أخبرني عن الإسلام «.</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>«No signs of having traveled could be seen upon him and none of us knew him until he sat with the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. He placed his knees against his knees and placed his hands upon his thighs and said:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>&#8216;O Mu<u>h</u>ammad, inform me about <em>al-Islaam</em>.&#8217;»</strong></span><sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">49</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">49</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>«No signs of having traveled could be seen upon him and none of us knew him»</strong>: Meaning: from those who were present. This was something amazing: he had not arrived from a journey so that it could be said: &#8220;He is from other than the people of al-Madeenah.&#8221; Yet, they did not recognize him. He was not from the people of the city so that they could recognize him. So, they were confused about him. He was not someone who had come from a journey nor was he someone from the people of the town. If he had arrived from a journey, then the signs of having traveled would have appeared upon him, his clothing and his color, because the effects of traveling appear upon a traveler. No one from those present recognized him, so he was not from the people of the city. Yet he had not arrived from a journey. So what could this man be? This is what they found strange.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>«He sat with the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>»</strong>: In front of him with the sitting of a student with his teacher.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>«He placed his two knees against the two knees of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam»</em></strong>: Meaning: He was very close to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>«He placed his two hands upon his thighs»</strong>: Meaning: Upon the thighs of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <strong>«</strong><strong>he said: &#8216;O Mu<u>h</u>ammad&#8217;»</strong>: He addressed him by his name and he did not say: &#8216;O Messenger of Allaah.&#8217; Perhaps he did that, <em>`alaihissalaam</em>, in order that the companions should think that he was from the people of the desert (i.e. Bedouin), because it was from the habit and custom of the people of the desert that when they used to address the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>, they would do so by his name. This is because the people of the desert have their own nature and customs. And it was also an addition in rendering it something strange and obscure so that they would not recognize him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>«He said: &#8216;O Mu<u>h</u>ammad, inform me about <em>al-Islaam</em>&#8216;»</strong>: Meaning: explain to me the meaning of <em>Al</em>&#8211;<em>Islaam</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قال» : <strong>أن</strong> <strong>تشهد</strong> <strong>أن</strong> <strong>لا</strong> <strong>إله</strong> <strong>إلا</strong> <strong>الله</strong> <strong>،</strong> <strong>وأن</strong> <strong>محمدا</strong> <strong>رسول</strong> <strong>الله</strong><strong> صلى الله عليه وسلم</strong><strong>  </strong><strong>وتقيم</strong> <strong>الصلاة</strong> <strong>،</strong> <strong>وتؤتي الزكاة</strong> <strong>،</strong> <strong>وتصوم</strong> <strong>رمضان</strong> <strong>،</strong> <strong>وتحج</strong> <strong>البيت</strong> <strong>إن</strong> <strong>استطعت</strong> <strong>إليه</strong> <strong>سبيلا</strong> <strong>،</strong> «<strong>فقال</strong><strong> : </strong><strong>صدقت</strong> <strong>،</strong> <strong>فعجبنا</strong> <strong>له</strong> <strong>يسأله</strong> <strong>ويصدقه</strong> .</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">He said: «<strong>It is that you testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u>allallaahu `alaihiwasallam</em>, and you establish the prayer, give <em>Zakaah</em>, fast <em>Ramadaan</em>, and perform Hajj (pilgrimage) to the House if are able to make your way to it</strong>.» He said: &#8216;You have spoken the truth.&#8217; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">So we were amazed at him, asking him the question and then stating that he had spoken the truth</span>.<sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">50</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">50</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong><em>Islaam</em> is that you testify</strong> <strong>that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u>allallaahu `alaihiwasallam</em>, and you establish the prayer, give <em>Zakaah</em>, fast <em>Ramadaan</em>, and perform pilgrimage to the House if are able to make your way to it</strong>» The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> mentioned to him the pillars of <em>Islaam</em> which are essential and are such that if they are implemented, <em>Islaam</em> is brought about. And whatever is extra to them from the other matters, then they are matters of completion. The Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> limited himself to an explanation of the pillars of <em>Islaam</em> since the shorter an answer is, the easier it will be for the student and the listener. It will be easy for him to memorize and preserve it. Whereas, if the answer is prolonged, it becomes difficult and confusing for those who are present, and perhaps most of them will not comprehend it. Therefore, this is a proof that a person who is questioned &#8211; it is befitting that he should strive to make an abridgement as far as he is able to and he should limit himself to that which is necessary. Otherwise, the fact is that <em>Islaam</em> is more than that. These are its pillars and its supports which it stands upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>He said:</strong> <strong>You have spoken the truth</strong>» This was a second amazing thing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: «<strong>We were amazed at him, asking him a question and then saying that he had spoken the truth</strong>» It showed that he was a person of knowledge. He was not asking in the manner of a person who is ignorant, rather he was asking and he had knowledge as is shown by the fact that he said: «<strong>You have spoken the truth</strong>.» That proves that he was a person of knowledge. Therefore, why he did ask the question?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قال : فأخبرني عن الإيمان ، قال» :<strong>أن</strong> <strong>تؤمن</strong> <strong>بالله</strong> <strong>،</strong> <strong>وملائكته</strong> <strong>،</strong> <strong>وكتبه</strong> <strong>،</strong> <strong>ورسله</strong> <strong>،</strong><strong>  </strong><strong>واليوم</strong> <strong>الآخر</strong> <strong>،</strong> <strong>وتؤمن</strong> <strong>بالقدر</strong> <strong>خيره</strong> <strong>وشره</strong> «، قال : صدقت.</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">He said: &#8216;Inform me about <em>eemaan</em>.&#8217; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">He said: «<strong>It is that you have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) in Allaah, in His Angels, in His Books, in His Messengers, in the Last Day, and you have <em>eemaan</em> in the pre-decree, the good of it and the bad of it</strong>.» </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">He said: &#8216;You have spoken the truth.&#8217;</span> <sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">51</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">51</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>«He said: &#8216;Inform me about <em>eemaan</em>.&#8217; He said:</strong> «<strong>It is that you have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) in Allaah, in His Angels, in His Books, in His Messengers, in the Last Day, and you have <em>eemaan</em> in the pre-decree, the good of it and the bad of it</strong>»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> mentioned to him the six pillars of <em>eemaan</em> after he mentioned the pillars of <em>Islaam</em>.<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Islaam</em> and <em>eemaan</em>, when they are mentioned together, <em>Islaam</em> means outward actions and <em>eemaan</em> means inward actions, the actions of the heart and what occurs in it with regard to <em>ta<u>s</u>deeq</em> (affirmation) and <em>`ilm</em> (knowledge). Both <em>Islaam</em> and <em>eemaan</em> are essential together, <em>Islaam</em> being the outward actions and <em>eemaan</em> being the inward actions, because of his saying <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">»<strong>الإسلام</strong> <strong>علانية</strong> <strong>،</strong> <strong>والإيمان</strong> <strong>في</strong> <strong>القلب</strong>«</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong><em>Islaam</em> is apparent and <em>eemaan</em> is in the heart</strong>.»<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If both are mentioned together, each one has a separate and specific meaning to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one of them is mentioned on its own, the other one enters within it. If <em>eemaan</em> is mentioned on its own, <em>Islaam</em> enters within it. If <em>Islaam</em> is mentioned on its own, <em>eemaan</em> enters into it, because <em>Islaam</em> will not be correct without <em>eemaan</em> and <em>eemaan</em> will not be correct without <em>Islaam</em>. Both are essential.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are inseparably linked, therefore they say: <em>Islaam</em> and <em>eemaan</em> are from those titles which when they come together, they separate, and when they occur singularly, they come together. Meaning: each of them enters into the other one, because they are inseparably linked and one cannot be separated from the other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, he asked him about the outward actions and about the inward actions. And he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> explained to him the pillars of both <em>Islaam</em> and <em>eemaan</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قال : أخبرني عن الإحسان ، قال» : أن تعبد الله كأنك تراه ، فإن لم تكن تراه فإنه  يراك ، «قال : فأخبرني عن الساعة ، قال» : ما المسئول عنها بأعلم من السائل.  «</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">He said: Inform me about <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em>. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">He said: «<strong>That you worship Allaah as if you were seeing Him, and even though you do not see Him, He, certainly, sees you</strong>.» </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">He said: &#8216;Inform me about the Last Hour.&#8217; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">He said: «<strong>The one who is being asked about it does not know any better than the one who is asking</strong>.»</span><sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">52</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">52</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>He said: Inform me about <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em>. He said</strong>: «<strong>That you worship Allaah</strong>&#8230;» It has already preceded that the person of <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em> is the person who worships Allaah as if He were actually seeing Him, and upon certainty as if he were seeing Allaah. Or that he worships Him upon the basis of his being observed and he knows that Allaah sees him, therefore he perfects the action, because Allaah is observing him. So, the person of <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em> worships Allaah, either seeing Him with his heart &#8211; and that is more complete &#8211; or upon the basis that he is being watched. And he knows that Allaah is seeing him in whatever place and with whatever action he is doing. This is <em>Al i<u>h</u>saan.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>He said: &#8216;You have spoken the truth. Inform me about the Last Hour</strong>.&#8217; Meaning: about the establishment of the Hour. When will it be? This question &#8211; the answer of it is not known to anyone, except to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, because the establishment of the Hour &#8211; its appointed time is not known except to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We know that the Hour will be established. We have no doubt about that. Whoever doubts that, then he is a disbeliever. We know that the Hour will be established and it will certainly occur. However, the time at which Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, will establish the Hour, He has not informed us about it and He has not explained it to us. He has kept it secret within His Knowledge. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah! With Him is the knowledge of the Hour</strong></span>.» [31:34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ السَّاعَةِ أَيَّانَ مُرْسَاهَا ۖ قُلْ إِنَّمَا عِلْمُهَا عِندَ رَبِّي ۖ لَا يُجَلِّيهَا لِوَقْتِهَا إِلَّا هُوَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They ask you about the Hour: &#8216;When will it come about?&#8217; Say: &#8216;Its knowledge is with my Lord alone. None can reveal its time but He</strong></span>.&#8217;» [7:187]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is the One who knows it, He the Perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَعِندَهُ مَفَاتِحُ الْغَيْبِ لَا يَعْلَمُهَا إِلَّا هُوَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And with Him are the keys to the hidden and unseen, none knows them but He</strong></span>.» [6:59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From it [the hidden and unseen] is the time and establishment of the Hour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said to Jibreel: «<strong>The one who is being asked about it does not know any better than the one who is asking</strong>» Meaning: I and you are the same. We do not know when the Hour will be established. Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, did not make anyone aware of that, neither the Angels, the Messengers, nor anyone. Rather, He kept it secret in His Knowledge, He the Perfect and most High.</p>

<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قال : فأخبرني عن أماراﺗﻬا ، قال» : أن تلد الأمة ربتها«</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">He said: &#8216;Then inform me about its signs.&#8217; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">He said: «<strong>That the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress</strong>.»</span><sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">53</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">53</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>He said: &#8216;Then inform me about its signs&#8217;</strong>: (الأمارات) is the plural of (أمارة). It means the sign. As for (الإمارة) with the <em>kasrah</em>, then it means <em>al-wilaayah</em> (leadership).<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8216;Inform me about its signs&#8217;</strong>: Meaning: the signs which indicate the closeness of its Establishment. Yes. The Hour has signs, and Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, has made them clear. From them are the smaller signs, from them are major signs and from them are the intermediate signs. And from them are signs which are very close to the Hour that will occur at its establishment. They will be close to its establishment. As for the other signs, then they come before that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars say: The signs for the hour are of three types: Smaller signs which come [quite some time] before it, intermediate signs, and major signs. The lesser and intermediate signs have already occurred or most of them have occurred. As for the major signs: the appearance of the <em>Dajjaal</em>, the descent of `Eesaa (<em>`alaihissalaam</em>), the emergence of the beast, and the emergence of <em>Ya&#8217;jooj</em> and <em>Ma&#8217;jooj</em>. These will occur at the actual establishment of the Hour and will quickly follow on in succession.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>He said: &#8216;Inform me about its signs&#8217;</strong>: Since its signs are known, the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> answered him and said: «<strong>That the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress</strong>.» This is from the signs of the Hour. The slave girl [meaning] one who is owned and <em>rabbataha</em> means her female-owner (mistress).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">»<strong>وأن</strong> <strong>ترى</strong> <strong>الحفاة</strong> <strong>العراة</strong> <strong>العالة</strong> <strong>رعاء</strong> <strong>الشاء</strong> <strong>يتطاولون</strong> <strong>في</strong> <strong>البنيان</strong> «.</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">«<strong>And that you will see barefoot, unclothed, destitute shepherds vying with each other in building tall buildings</strong>.»</span><sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">54</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[54] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>That the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress</strong>.» The explainer said: Its meaning, and Allaah knows best, is that towards the end of time, there will be many captives or slaves taken, meaning: there will be many occurrences of intercourse with slave-girls, meaning: the owned slave-girls. They will give birth to daughters and the slave-girl&#8217;s daughter will be a free woman and she will be a mistress to her mother and an owner of her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also said: Its meaning is that disobedience to parents will be abundant such that the daughter will act as if she is a mistress to her mother.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>And that you will see barefoot</strong>»: This is a second sign.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Barefoot</strong>»: Those who have no shoes because of poverty and destitution.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Unclothed</strong>» Those who do not have clothing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Destitute</strong>» The poor and needy people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Shepherds</strong>» (<strong>رعاء</strong>) is the plural of (راع), those who shepherd the sheep. In origin, those people are found in the desert areas, in their own dwellings and they move about from one place to another. But at the end of time, they will take residence in the cities and they will build tall palaces and towering buildings. This is from the signs of the Hour, when the desert people change and become modern and they start to vie with each other in tall buildings. They compete with each other in adorning them. This was not from their custom in any way. They will change to be rich people, having wealth and people who manifest it [i.e. what they have]. This is from the signs of the Hour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as you know, the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> did not speak from his own desires, just as you know today, how the condition of the people is. The peoples conditions have changed. The poor have turned into rich people having vast riches. The desert people have become modernized and they have competed in building tall buildings. This is in confirmation of the truth of what Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قال : فمضى ، فلبثنا مليا ، فقال» : <strong>يا</strong> <strong>عمر</strong> <strong>أتدري</strong> <strong>من</strong> <strong>السائل</strong> ؟ «قلت : الله ورسوله أعلم ، قال» : هذا جبريل أتاكم يعلمكم أمر دينكم «</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">He said: Then he went away and we remained for some time. So he said: «<strong>O&#8217; `Umar! Do you know who the questioner was?</strong>» I said: &#8216;Allaah and His Messenger know best.&#8217; He said: «<strong>This was Jibreel, he came to you to teach you the affair of your religion</strong>.»</span><sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">55</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">55</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>He said: Then he went away and we remained for some time</strong>: Meaning: for a short time.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> then said: </strong>«<strong>O `Umar! Do you know who the questioner was?</strong>» Do you [people] know who the questioner was?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one narration the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">»علي بالرجل«</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Bring the man to me</strong>.»<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, they looked for him, but could not find him.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>He said</strong>: «<strong>This was Jibreel, he came to you to teach you the affair of your religion</strong>.» The one who entered and asked these questions was Jibreel <em>`alaihissalaam</em>. He came in the form of a man, just as was described, in order to teach those present the affairs of the religion in the manner of question and answer.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>This <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> proves a number of tremendous matters: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: The religion is divided into three levels: <em>Islaam</em>, <em>eemaan</em>, and <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em>, each level being higher than the one before it. Each level has pillars: The pillar of <em>Islaam</em>, the pillars of <em>eemaan</em>, and <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em> is a single pillar.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: It shows teaching by way of questions and answers. This is a teaching method which succeeds, because it is better for arousing attention and conveying knowledge if the person is questioned. His mind is therefore made ready and he seeks the answer. So, he seeks the answer and then he gives the answer to him, and he is desiring it, so this will establish it firmly.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>: In the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> there is a proof that whoever is asked about some knowledge and he does not know, then it is upon him to say: Allaah and His Messenger know best. He should refer knowledge back to the one who knows it. He should not speak with an answer when he does not know it and he should not make a guess. This is not permissible. The Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>, when he was asked about the Hour, he said: «<strong>The one who is being asked about it does not know any better than the one who is asking</strong>.» And when he said to the Companions: «<strong>Do you know who the questioner was?</strong>» They did not know him, they said: Allaah and His Messenger know best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows that with regard to matters relating to the <em>Islaamic</em> legislation and that of the religion, it is not permissible to speak about them based upon conjecture, because this will be a case of <em>takalluf</em> (unnecessary overburdening oneself). However, whoever has knowledge should respond and whoever does not have knowledge should say: &#8216;Allaah knows best.&#8217; And whoever says: &#8216;I do not know,&#8217; has given a response.<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Imaam</em> Maalik (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) was asked forty questions and he gave an answer to six of them. With regard to the rest, he said: &#8216;I do not know.&#8217; So questioner said to him: &#8216;I have come from such-and-such place. I have traveled and tired out my riding animal and you say: &#8216;I do not know?&#8217; So he said: &#8216;Ride your animal and go back to the land which you came from and say: &#8216;I asked Maalik and he said: &#8216;I do not know.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is not a defect that when a person does not know an answer regarding matters of the <em>Islaamic</em> legislation that he should say: &#8216;I do not know.&#8217; Even if he is a scholar. The Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said: «<strong>The one who is being asked about it does not know any better than the one who is asking</strong>.»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>, when he was asked certain questions and he did not possess revelation from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, he would wait until the revelation descended from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. Do you not recite [a number of times]: &#8216;They ask you about such-and-such. They ask you about such-and-such. Then say: &#8216;Such-and-such.&#8217;</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْخَمْرِ وَالْمَيْسِرِ ۖ قُلْ فِيهِمَا إِثْمٌ كَبِيرٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They ask you about intoxicants and gambling. Say: &#8220;In them is a great sin.</span>&#8220;</strong>» [2:219]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْأَهِلَّةِ ۖ قُلْ هِيَ مَوَاقِيتُ لِلنَّاسِ وَالْحَجِّ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They ask you about the crescent moons. Say: &#8220;They are signs to mark time periods for the people and for the Hajj</strong>.</span>&#8220;» [2:189]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>, when he was asked a question and he did not have an answer, he would wait until revelation came down to him from Allaah. So that should be even more the case with anyone else besides him. He should wait until he asks someone else or until he researches the matter in the books of the people of knowledge to attain the answer. As for being hasty, then this is extremely dangerous and it contains showing bad manners towards Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, since the one who gives the answer is answering about Allaah&#8217;s legislation. He is saying: &#8216;Allaah has made such-and-such permissible,&#8217; or &#8216;He has made such-and-such forbidden,&#8217; or &#8216;He has legislated such-and-such.&#8217; So the matter is extremely dangerous.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The fourth matter</strong>: The <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> contains a proof for the manners of the student. Jibreel was the noblest one of the angels, he sat in front of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and placed his knees against the knees of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and placed his hands upon his thighs and asked with good manners. This was in order to teach the people good manners with which they should adopt towards the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a part of what the <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> indicates and it contains.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The fifth matter</strong>: It is an explanation of some of the signs of the Hour. He mentioned two signs: that the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress and some of the scholars say: its meaning «<strong>the slave-girl will birth to her mistress</strong>» is that disobedience and bad treatment towards the parents will be frequent at the end of time. So the daughter becomes as if she is one in charge of her mother, commanding her and forbidding her and being stern with her.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Types of <em>Taaghoot</em></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">والطواغيتُ كثيرونَ ورؤوسُهُمْ خمَسةٌ: إبليسُ لعنَهُ اللهُ، ومَنْ عُبِدَ وهو راض<strong> </strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The <em>taaghoots</em> are many, and their heads are five:  Iblees &#8211; may Allaah’s curse be upon him. Whoever is worshipped and is pleased with that</span></strong>.<span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>79</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">79</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying: “<strong>And the <em>taaghoots</em> are many and the heads of them are five</strong>.”<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>taaghoots</em> upon whom this definition applies are: everyone who is worshipped or followed or obeyed, and they are many but their heads are five – meaning their major ones are five.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Firstly, Iblees</strong></span>, may Allaah’s curse be upon him &#8211; meaning: may Allaah expel him and distance him away from His Mercy on account of the fact that he refused to prostrate to Aadam and he disobeyed Allaah, the Perfect and Most High and he was proud and haughty. And He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ أَنَا خَيْرٌ مِّنْهُ ۖ خَلَقْتَنِي مِن نَّارٍ وَخَلَقْتَهُ مِن طِينٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And he </strong>(Iblees)<strong> said:</strong> </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">I am better than him </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Aadam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, You created me from fire and You created him from clay.</span></strong>[38:76]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore he disobeyed the command of Allaah and was haughty; therefore Allaah cursed him and He repelled him and distanced him. And he is called <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Iblees</strong></span>, it is said, because he <span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>ablasa</em> </strong></span>(despaired) of Mercy – meaning he despaired of Mercy. So the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>mublis</em> </strong></span>is one who despairs of something.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Iblees, may Allaah’s curse be upon him, is the head of the <em>taaghoots</em> because he is the one who commands with worship of other than Allaah and he is the one who commands with following other than the Messenger of Allaah <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> and he is the one who commands obedience to other than Allaah by declaring things to be permissible or forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Iblees is the source of evil and he is the head of the <em>taaghoots</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The second category (of <em>taaghoots</em>) is:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The one who is worshipped and he is pleased with that – meaning he is worshipped and he is pleased with the people’s worship of him. So he is a <em>taaghoot</em>.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for one who is worshipped and he is not pleased with that then he does not enter into that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For ‘Eesaa <em>‘alaihissalaatu wassalaam</em> has been worshipped besides Allaah but he was not pleased with that. And his mother and ‘Uzayr and the <em>awliyaa</em> (beloved servants of Allaah) and the righteous people from the servants of Allaah, they are not pleased with that (worship of them). Rather they used to criticize this and fight against those who did it. So whoever is worshipped and he is not pleased with that, then he is not called a <em>taaghoot</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that is because when Allaah sent down His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You </strong>(people of shirk)<strong> and whatever idols you worship will be fuel for the Hellfire. You will enter it.</strong></span> [21:98]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; the people of shirk became happy and they said, “We worship the Messiah (‘Eesaa) and we worship such and such and we worship such and such. Therefore they will be with us in the Fire.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah, the Most High, sent down:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُم مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَىٰ أُولَٰئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">لَا يَسْمَعُونَ حَسِيسَهَا ۖ وَهُمْ فِي مَا اشْتَهَتْ أَنفُسُهُمْ خَالِدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those for whom Allaah has written that they shall be people of bliss, they shall be kept far away from it. They shall not hear even the slightest sound from it </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the Fire)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> but rather they shall be enjoying whatever their souls desire forever</span>. </strong>[21:101-102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the other aayah that they said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they say: are our gods better or is he?</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: ‘Eesaa <em>‘alaihissalaam</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالُوا أَآلِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هُوَ ۚ مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلَّا جَدَلًا ۚ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَاهُ مَثَلًا لِّبَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>They do not quote him as an example to you except in order to argue. Indeed they are an argumentative people; he was no more than a slave upon whom We bestowed favor and We made him an example for the Banoo Israa.eel.</b></span></span> [43:58-59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he is a slave of Allaah and he was not pleased that he should be worshipped besides Allaah. Indeed Allaah sent him to criticize that:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا قُلْتُ لَهُمْ إِلَّا مَا أَمَرْتَنِي بِهِ أَنِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ رَبِّي وَرَبَّكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(‘Eesaa will say on the Day of Resurrection)<strong>, “I did not say to them except what You commanded me to – that you should worship Allaah alone, my Lord and your Lord. </strong></span>[5:117]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore one who is worshipped and he is not pleased with that – he does not enter under this threat and he is not a <em>taaghoot</em> because he rejects and criticises that. This is because at <em>taaghoot</em> is one who is pleased with worship besides Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>

<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ومَنْ دعا الناسَ إلى عبادَةِ نفسِه</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> Whoever calls the people to the worship of himself</strong></span><strong>.</strong><span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>80</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[80]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third: “<strong>Whoever calls the people to the worship of himself</strong>”:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such as the heads of the people of shirk, those who call the people to worship them, such as Fir’awn who said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَقَالَ أَنَا رَبُّكُمُ الْأَعْلَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So he </strong>(Fir’awn)<strong> said, “I am your highest Lord.” </strong></span>[79:24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And such as Namrood and such as the extreme Soofees, those who call the people to worship them, to such an extent that they give instructions to the people to worship them after they have died, so that one of them says, “<em>When matters become very difficult for you then come to my grave</em>” – meaning: “<em>when affairs become difficult  for you, then you should come to my grave  and a few handfuls of earth cannot prevent you from me</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they counsel the people to come to their (the leaders’) graves and they promise them that they (the leaders) will carry out their needs. So whoever calls the people to worship of himself, whether whilst he is alive or dead, then he is from the heads of the <em>taaghoots</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise whoever calls the people to worship someone else besides him from the <em>taaghoots</em> and they are the callers to shirk, they are <em>taaghoots</em>, those who falsely beautify shirk for the people and they call it with other than its name, and they say, “<em>This is a case of tawassul (seeking legitimate means to Allaah) or a case of shafaa’ah (legitimate intercession)</em>.” And they are many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those are <em>taaghoots</em> because they call the people to shirk, so they call to the worship of other than Allaah and they call that (shirk) with other than its name and they falsely adorn it for the people with doubts and falsely adorned speech. They are <em>taaghoots</em>. The callers to shirk are <em>taaghoots</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And everyone who is worshipped besides Allaah and is pleased with that or calls the people to the worship of himself or calls the people to worship of other than Allaah then he is from the <em>taaghoots</em>; indeed he is from the heads of the <em>taaghoots</em> – we ask Allaah for safety and salvation.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ومَنِ ادَّعى شيئًا مِنْ عِلمِ الغيْبِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Whoever claims to possess anything from the knowledge of the affairs of the hidden and unseen (<em>al-Ghayb</em>)</span></strong><span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>81</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">81</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth one is “<strong>whoever claims to possess anything from knowledge of the hidden and unseen</strong>”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And entering into this are the sorcerers and the astrologers and the fortunetellers and the geomancers, and everyone who claims that he possesses knowledge of the <em>ghayb</em> and says to the people, “Such and such will occur for you. For you, you will receive bliss or you will receive some hardship or you will have a successful marriage or you will have an unsuccessful one. Those people claim knowledge of the hidden and the unseen. And the hidden and unseen is not known except by Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And knowledge of the <em>ghayb</em> is not known except by Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُل لَّا يَعْلَمُ مَن فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ الْغَيْبَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: No one in the Heavens or the Earth knows the <em>ghayb</em> except Allaah. </strong></span>[27:65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">عَالِمُ الْغَيْبِ فَلَا يُظْهِرُ عَلَىٰ غَيْبِهِ أَحَدًا  &#8211; إِلَّا مَنِ ارْتَضَىٰ مِن رَّسُولٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">He (Allaah) is the Knower of the <em>ghayb</em>. He does not reveal what He has kept hidden to anyone except to one whom He is pleased with whom He has sent as a Messenger</span>.</strong> [72:26-27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَعِندَهُ مَفَاتِحُ الْغَيْبِ لَا يَعْلَمُهَا إِلَّا هُوَ ۚ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِي الْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ ۚ وَمَا تَسْقُطُ مِن وَرَقَةٍ إِلَّا يَعْلَمُهَا وَلَا حَبَّةٍ فِي ظُلُمَاتِ الْأَرْضِ وَلَا رَطْبٍ وَلَا يَابِسٍ إِلَّا فِي كِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And with Allaah are the keys to the <em>ghayb</em>; no one knows it except Him. And He knows whatever is in the land and in the ocean; and no leaf falls except that He knows of it. Nor is there any grain in the darkness of the Earth nor any fresh thing nor any dry thing except that it is written in a Clear Book. </strong></span>[6:59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>no one knows it except Him…</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a limitation. So no one knows the <em>ghayb</em> except for Allaah or one from His Messengers to whom Allaah has revealed something from the ghayb for the benefit of Mankind and as miracle for the messenger. However he will not know the <em>ghayb</em> from himself. Rather he only knows from Allaah’s teaching it to him. So no one knows the ghayb except for Allaah. So whoever claims to have knowledge of the <em>ghayb</em> then he would be a sharer with Allaah with regards to something particular to Him, He the Perfect. Therefore, that person is a <em>mushrik</em> (person of <em>shirk</em>), he is a <em>taaghoot</em>, and he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever). And this is one of the greatest forms of apostasy from Islaam.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ومَنْ حكمَ بغيِر مَا أنزلَ الله</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> <span style="color:#993300;">And whoever judges by other than what Allaah sent down</span></strong>.<span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>82</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">82</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fifth one is whoever judges by other than that which Allaah sent down.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يُرِيدُونَ أَن يَتَحَاكَمُوا إِلَى الطَّاغُوتِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They wish to refer for judgment to the <em>taaghoot</em>. </strong></span>[4:60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever judges by other than that which Allaah sent down holding that to be permissible to do, then he will be a <em>taaghoot</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the person who says, “It is permissible to refer for judgment to man-made laws or to the customs of the times of <em>Jaahiliyyah</em> or to the customs of the tribes of the Bedouins and to leave behind the Legislation,” – he says, “This is lawful to do,” or he says, “This is equal to that which Allaah sent down.” And if he says, “It is better than that which Allaah sent down or equal to that which Allaah sent down,” or he says, “It is just permissible to do,” and he doesn’t even say, “It is equal or better,” – he just says, “It is permissible and allowed to do this”, then this person is a <em>taaghoot</em>. And this is by the text of the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يُرِيدُونَ أَن يَتَحَاكَمُوا إِلَى الطَّاغُوتِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They wish to refer for judgment to the <em>taaghoot</em>. </strong></span>[4:60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was called a <em>taaghoot</em> because he has gone beyond his limit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for a person who judges by other than that which Allaah has sent down whilst he affirms that that which Allaah sent down is what is obligatory to follow and is the Truth and that anything else is false and futile and that he is judging with something futile &#8211; then this person is counted as being a <em>kaafir</em> who has committed <em>al-kufr-ul-asghar</em> (lesser <em>kufr</em>) which does not take a person out of the religion. However he is upon great danger, he is upon a way which may lead to <em>kufr</em> which takes a person out of the religion if he becomes lax about this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for one who judges by other than that which Allaah sent down, without intending to do so, rather (he does so) from <em>ijtihaad</em> (personal striving and deduction) and he is a person who is rightful to be performing <em>ijtihaad</em> from the people of <em>fiqh</em>, and he performs <em>ijtihaad</em> but he does not actually attain the judgment of Allaah and he makes a mistake in his <em>ijtihaad</em>, then this is forgiven for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“When the judge judges and strives and he reaches the correct conclusion, then he will receive two rewards. And when he judges and strives and reaches the incorrect conclusion, then for him there is one reward.”</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadith Reported by al Bukhaaree (7352) and Muslim (1716 )from the hadeeth of ‘Amr ibn al ‘Aas <em>radiy Allaahu ‘anhu</em>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because he did not deliberately commit a mistake. He was intending the Truth; he was intending conformity with the judgment of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. However, he was not granted the success of attaining it. So this person is counted as being excused and one who will receive reward. But it is not permissible to follow him upon the error.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from this are the matters of <em>ijtihaad</em> of the jurists who have made a mistake in those matters or the striving of the judges in the courts when they strive to arrive at a ruling and they exert effort to reach the Truth. However they are not granted it. So their error is forgiven.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Rejecting <em>at-Taaghoot</em>, and Having <em>Eemaan</em> in Allaah</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وافترضَ اللهُ على جميعِ العبادِ الكفرَ بالطاغوتِ والإيمانَ بالله</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Allaah has made it obligatory upon all of the servants to reject <em>at-taaghoot</em>, and to have <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah</strong></span>.<span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>77</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">77</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Shaykh <em>rahimahullaah</em> said, “<strong>And Allaah has made it obligatory upon all of the servants to reject <em>at-taaghoot</em>, and to have <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah…</strong>” Then he mentioned the definition of <em>at-taaghoot</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>taaghoot</em> has been mentioned by Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, in many <em>aayaat</em>. From them is His saying, He the Most High, in Soorat-ul-Baqarah:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> فَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِالطَّاغُوتِ وَيُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ فَقَدِ اسْتَمْسَكَ بِالْعُرْوَةِ الْوُثْقَىٰ لَا انفِصَامَ لَهَا ۗ وَاللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُ وَلِيُّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا يُخْرِجُهُم مِّنَ الظُّلُمَاتِ إِلَى النُّورِ ۖ وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا أَوْلِيَاؤُهُمُ الطَّاغُوتُ يُخْرِجُونَهُم مِّنَ النُّورِ إِلَى الظُّلُمَاتِ ۗ أُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So whoever rejects <em>at-taaghoot </em></strong>(everything which is worshipped besides Allaah)<strong> and believes truly in Allaah, then he has grasped the firmest handhold that will not break. And Allaah is All Hearing, All Knowing.</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah is the Guardian Lord of those who truly believe; He brings them out from darkness into light.</strong><strong> </strong></span><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And those who disbelieve, then their supporters are <em>at-taaghoot</em>; they take them out from the light into darkness. They are the inhabitants of the Fire; they will remain in it forever. </strong></span>[2:256-257]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in Soorat-un-Nisaa His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا نَصِيبًا مِّنَ الْكِتَابِ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالْجِبْتِ وَالطَّاغُوتِ وَيَقُولُونَ لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا هَٰؤُلَاءِ أَهْدَىٰ مِنَ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا سَبِيلًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Will you not consider those who were given a portion of the Scripture? They believe in <em>al</em> <em>jibt </em></strong>(the idols, soothsayers and sorcery)<strong> and in <em>at-taaghoot</em>. And they say to those who disbelieve that they are closer to the Truth than the believers. </strong></span>[4:51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this <em>aayah</em> is with regard to the Jews.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Perfect, said with regards to the hypocrites:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ يَزْعُمُونَ أَنَّهُمْ آمَنُوا بِمَا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ وَمَا أُنزِلَ مِن قَبْلِكَ يُرِيدُونَ أَن يَتَحَاكَمُوا إِلَى الطَّاغُوتِ وَقَدْ أُمِرُوا أَن يَكْفُرُوا بِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Will you not consider those who claim that they believe in that which came down to you and in that which came down before you, wishing to refer for judgment to at taaghoot? And they were commanded to reject it.</span> </strong>[4:60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in Soorat-un-Nahl that He, the Majestic and Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولًا أَنِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُوا الطَّاغُوتَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We sent a Messenger to every nation commanding, “Worship Allaah alone and keep away from at taaghoot.”</span> </strong>[16:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>At-taaghoot</em> is derived from at <em>tughyaan</em> and it is to exceed the due limit. So it is said in the (‘Arabic) language, ‘the water has <em>taghaa’</em> when the water raises above its level.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّا لَمَّا طَغَى الْمَاءُ حَمَلْنَاكُمْ فِي الْجَارِيَةِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>When the water <em>taghaa</em> </strong>(went beyond its limits)<strong> then We carried you in the Ark. </strong></span>[69:11]</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قال ابنُ القيِّمِ رحمهُ اللهُ تعالى: معنى الطاغوت ما تجاوزَ بِهِ العبدُ حدَّهُ مِنْ معبودٍ، أو متبوعٍ، أو مطاع<strong> </strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Ibn ul Qayyim, <em>rahimahullaah ta’aala</em>, said:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“The meaning of <em>At-taaghoot</em> is anyone regarding whom the servant goes beyond the due bounds, whether it is someone <span style="text-decoration:underline;">worshipped</span> or <span style="text-decoration:underline;">followed</span> or <span style="text-decoration:underline;">obeyed</span>.”</strong></span> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>78</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">78</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the meaning of <em>at-taaghoot</em> in the Legislation, then it is just as ibn ul Qayyim <em>rahimahullaah</em> mentioned, and the author quoted him here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>At-taaghoot</em> – whoever the servant goes beyond the due limits regarding. The servant has a due limit because he is a servant; Allaah has given him bounds which it is obligatory that he should stop at. So if he goes beyond them, then he will be a <em>taaghoot</em>. So whoever goes beyond the limits set by Allaah for His servants and which He has commanded them not to exceed and not to come close to, then he is a <em>taaghoot</em>. So if he disobeys Allaah and goes beyond His limits and goes beyond the bounds, then he is called a <em>taaghoot</em> because he has gone beyond the limits and exceeded the limits laid down by Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#993300;">(<strong><em>At-Taaghoot</em></strong>) is anyone regarding whom the servant goes beyond the due bounds, whether it is someone worshipped or followed or obeyed</span>”<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the comprehensive definition for the <em>taaghoot</em> because Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, commanded that He alone be worshipped and that no partner be set up with Him. And He commanded that His Messenger <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> should be followed and He commanded that He should be obeyed and that His Messenger should be obeyed with regard to that which He declared lawful and that which He declared forbidden. So whoever goes beyond this matter then he is a <em>taaghoot</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever exceeds the limit of worship which Allaah has made obligatory and which is particular to Him and which He has negated for anyone else besides Him, then (this person) worships anything else along with Allaah, then he is a <em>taaghoot</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>mushrik</em> (person of shirk) is a <em>taaghoot</em> because he has exceeded the limit with regards to worship, and has worshipped someone else along with Allaah. He has directed worship to other than the One who deserves it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise the one who is worshipped and is pleased with that (is a <em>taaghoot</em>). The person who is worshipped by the people and he is pleased with that and he establishes himself as a chief and as a leader upon that basis – such as Fir’awn (the Pharaoh) and an-Namrood and the shaykhs of the extreme Soofee paths, those who are worshipped by their followers and they are pleased with that, or who call the people to that, i.e. to worship them, as will follow – then this a <em>taaghoot</em> with regards to worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, “<strong><span style="color:#993300;">or followed”</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, commanded the whole of creation that they should follow Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>. So it is not permissible for anyone to follow anyone else besides him <em>‘alaihissalaatu wassalaam</em>. So whoever follows other than the Messenger <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> and claims that this is permissible, then he (this person) will be a <em>taaghoot</em> because he has followed someone other than the Messenger <em>sall Allaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>, the one whom he was commanded to follow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So following is specific to the Messenger <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>. As for other than him from the scholars and the callers then they are followed when they follow the way of the Messenger <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>. So the one who is followed in truth is the Messenger <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those (other people) then they are just conveying the message, they are followed for the truth and upon whatever they conform to with regard to the following of the Messenger <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>. And wherever they are contrary to what the Messenger <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>was upon, then it is not permissible to follow him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of that is the shaykhs of the Soofee paths; their followers and their worshippers follow them upon other than obedience to the Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam)</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed they say, “<em>We have no need for the Messenger (sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) because we take from where the Messenger (sall Allaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) took from and we take knowledge directly from Allaah. The Messenger (sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) took from Allaah through an intermediary, via Jibreel whereas we take directly from Allaah.</em>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they say, “<em>You people narrate your religion from those who have died whereas we narrate our religion from Allaah, the Perfect and Most High</em>” because they claim that their shaykhs have a connection with Allaah and that they take knowledge from Allaah directly. They have reached this level of transgression – and Allaah’s refuge is sought – this is their way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that those people are the heads of the <em>taaghoots</em> – and Allaah’s refuge is sought – because there is no way to Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, except through following His Messenger <em>sallallaahu‘alaihiwasallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ إِن كُنتُمْ تُحِبُّونَ اللَّهَ فَاتَّبِعُونِي يُحْبِبْكُمُ اللَّهُ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ذُنُوبَكُمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ  &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَالرَّسُولَ ۖ فَإِن تَوَلَّوْا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ الْكَافِرِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say </strong>(O Muhammad)<strong>, “If you truly love Allaah, then follow me, then Allaah will love you and will forgive you your sins. And Allaah forgives extensively and bestows mercy.</strong><strong> </strong></span><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say, “Obey Allaah and the Messenger.” So if they turn away then Allaah does not love the disbelievers.</strong></span> [3:31-32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the person who follows other than the Messenger, this person is counted as a <em>taaghoot</em>. And likewise the person who calls people to follow him and says to the people, “<em>I will bring you orders directly from Allaah</em>” – this is the greatest one of the <em>taaghoots</em> in existence in the world. And Allaah’s refuge is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>one who is obeyed…</strong></span>”<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Obedience is to be for Allaah and for His Messenger regarding what he declares to be lawful and what he declares to be forbidden. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ وَأُولِي الْأَمْرِ مِنكُمْ ۖ فَإِن تَنَازَعْتُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ فَرُدُّوهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَالرَّسُولِ إِن كُنتُمْ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَحْسَنُ تَأْوِيلًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger and those in authority from amongst you. And if you dispute about anything, then refer it back to Allaah and to the Messenger, if you truly believe in Allaah and in the Last Day. </strong><strong>That is what is best for you and is what is best in its consequences.</strong></span> [4:59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is lawful is that which Allaah has made lawful; and that which is forbidden is that which Allaah has made forbidden. And it is not for anyone to share with Allaah in making things lawful or forbidden. And therefore Allaah passed the ruling upon those who declare things lawful or declare things forbidden or obeys one who does that – that such a person is a <em>mushrik</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Perfect and Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَكُلُوا مِمَّا ذُكِرَ اسْمُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ إِن كُنتُم بِآيَاتِهِ مُؤْمِنِينَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا لَكُمْ أَلَّا تَأْكُلُوا مِمَّا ذُكِرَ اسْمُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ وَقَدْ فَصَّلَ لَكُم مَّا حَرَّمَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِلَّا مَا اضْطُرِرْتُمْ إِلَيْهِ ۗ وَإِنَّ كَثِيرًا لَّيُضِلُّونَ بِأَهْوَائِهِم بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ ۗ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِالْمُعْتَدِينَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَذَرُوا ظَاهِرَ الْإِثْمِ وَبَاطِنَهُ ۚ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَكْسِبُونَ الْإِثْمَ سَيُجْزَوْنَ بِمَا كَانُوا يَقْتَرِفُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا مِمَّا لَمْ يُذْكَرِ اسْمُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ وَإِنَّهُ لَفِسْقٌ ۗ وَإِنَّ الشَّيَاطِينَ لَيُوحُونَ إِلَىٰ أَوْلِيَائِهِمْ لِيُجَادِلُوكُمْ ۖ وَإِنْ أَطَعْتُمُوهُمْ إِنَّكُمْ لَمُشْرِكُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Eat from that which Allaah’s Name has been mentioned upon, if you truly believe in His Signs. And why would you not eat from that which Allaah’s Name been mentioned upon when He has made clear to you whatever has been made forbidden for you – except for that which you have a dire need of.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>And there are many who misguide with their desires without knowledge. Indeed your Lord knows best those who exceed the limits.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>And leave off outward and inward sins. Those who earn sin shall be recompensed for what they earned.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>And do not eat from that which Allaah’s Name is not mentioned upon, and it is sin.</strong><strong>And the devils inspire their followers to dispute with you. And were you to obey them, then you would be people of shirk. </strong></span>[6:118-121]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because the people of <em>Jaahiliyyah</em> said, “<em>Dead meat is lawful because Allaah, He is the One who slaughtered it. So it has more right to be lawful than that which you people sacrifice and slaughter</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says (in these <em>aayaat</em> from Soorah al An’aam) (for us) do not eat except for that which has been slaughtered in the legislated manner and He made forbidden for you dead meat. Whereas those people say, “No, dead meat is permissible; it has more right to be lawful than that which has been slaughtered because it is you people who have slaughtered it whereas an animal which has died, then Allaah is the One who has slaughtered it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore He refuted the people of <em>shirk</em> and He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا مِمَّا لَمْ يُذْكَرِ اسْمُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ وَإِنَّهُ لَفِسْقٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do not eat from that which Allaah’s Name has not been mentioned upon. And it is sin…</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: it is to exit from obedience to Allaah, the Perfect, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said after it:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; وَإِنَّ الشَّيَاطِينَ لَيُوحُونَ إِلَىٰ أَوْلِيَائِهِمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the devils inspire their allies&#8230;</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say, “<em>Dead meat, it was slaughtered by Allaah whereas the animals that you people slaughter, you have slaughtered them. So how can you hold it as lawful that which you people sacrifice and you do not regard as lawful that which Allaah has sacrificed?!</em>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a false and futile argument.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِنْ أَطَعْتُمُوهُمْ إِنَّكُمْ لَمُشْرِكُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if you were to obey them, then you would be people of <em>shirk</em>.</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because this is <em>shirk</em> with regards to obedience. Declaring something lawful and declaring something forbidden is the right of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not permissible for anyone to declare lawful or to declare forbidden from his own self, or to obey someone in declaring something lawful or something forbidden from his own self. And whoever does that then he is a <em>taaghoot</em> and he is obeying the <em>taaghoots</em>, those who declare things lawful and declare things forbidden besides Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the meaning of his saying: “Or one who is obeyed…” Meaning: obeyed in declaring things lawful and forbidden because declaring things lawful and declaring things forbidden is the right of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High; and the Messenger <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> was one who conveyed from Allaah that which He made lawful and that which He made forbidden.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Belief in the Messengers</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah sent all of the messengers as bringers of good tidings and as warners, and the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">رُّسُلًا مُّبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنذِرِينَ لِئَلَّا يَكُونَ لِلنَّاسِ عَلَى اللَّهِ حُجَّةٌ بَعْدَ الرُّسُلِ ۚ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَزِيزًا حَكِيمًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Messengers were sent as bringers of glad tidings and as warners so that the people should have no excuse with Allaah after the sending of the messengers. And Allaah is ever All Mighty, All Wise.</span> </strong>[4:165] <sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">74</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">74</span>]:<strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Eemaan</em> in the Messengers is one of the six pillars of <em>eemaan</em>; he <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said:<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“</strong><strong><em>Eemaan</em></strong><strong> is that you truly believe in Allaah and in His Angels and in His Books and in His Messengers&#8230;”</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadeeth reported by al Bukhaaree (50) and Muslim (8,9 &amp; 10) from the hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>i Allaahu‘ anhu</em>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So having eemaan in the Messengers is one of the pillars of eemaan; so it is essential to have eemaan in all of the messengers, from the first of them to the last of them. So whoever denies a single messenger, then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) in all of them, just as He, the Most High, said:<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَكْفُرُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَيُرِيدُونَ أَن يُفَرِّقُوا بَيْنَ اللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَيَقُولُونَ نُؤْمِنُ بِبَعْضٍ وَنَكْفُرُ بِبَعْضٍ وَيُرِيدُونَ أَن يَتَّخِذُوا بَيْنَ ذَٰلِكَ سَبِيلًا &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْكَافِرُونَ حَقًّا ۚ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَابًا مُّهِينًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Those who disbelieve in Allaah and in His Messengers want to make a distinction between believing in Allaah and in His Messengers and they say, “We believe in some of them and we disbelieve in some.”</strong></span><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they wish to take a path in between that. They are the disbelievers in truth and We have prepared a humiliating punishment for the disbelievers. </strong></span>[4:150-151]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there must be <em>eemaan</em> in all of the Messengers from the first of them to the last of them, those whom Allaah has named from them in His Book, and those He has not named. For the Messengers are many; and therefore there occurs in the hadeeth that they number:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“One hundred and twenty four thousand (prophets) and the messengers from them were three hundred and fifteen all together.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadeeth reported by Ahmad in his <em>Musnad</em> from the hadeeth of Aboo Umaamah al Baahilee <em>ra<u>d</u>i Allaahu ‘anhu</em> and declared to be <em>saheeh</em> by al Albaanee in as Saheehah (2668)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there were many messengers; from them were those whom Allaah named in His Book and from them were those He did not name. So it is obligatory upon us to have eemaan in all of them, from the first of them to the last of them.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">: وأولُهُمْ نوحٌ عليهِ السلامُ، وآخِرُهُم محمدٌ صلى الله عليه وسلم وهو خاتِمُ النَّبيينَ والدليلُ على أنَّ أوَّلُهُم نوح قوله تعالى</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And the first of them was Nooh, ‘<em>alaihissalaam</em>, and the last of them was Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>; and the proof that the first of them was Nooh, ‘<em>alaihissalaam</em>, is His saying, He the Most High:</span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّا أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ كَمَا أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَىٰ نُوحٍ وَالنَّبِيِّينَ مِن بَعْدِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We have sent you </strong>(O Muhammad), <strong>with Revelation, just as We sent Revelation to Nooh and to the prophets who came after him </strong></span>[4:163] <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>75</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">75</span>]:<strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof that the first of them was Nooh is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; إِنَّا أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We sent revelation to you…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was an address to the Prophet <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> كَمَا أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَىٰ نُوحٍ وَالنَّبِيِّينَ مِن بَعْدِهِ ۚ وَأَوْحَيْنَا إِلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَالْأَسْبَاطِ وَعِيسَىٰ وَأَيُّوبَ وَيُونُسَ وَهَارُونَ وَسُلَيْمَانَ ۚ وَآتَيْنَا دَاوُودَ زَبُورًا </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>… just as We sent revelation to Nooh and the prophets who came after him; and We sent revelation to Ibraaheem and Isma’eel and Is-haaq and Ya’qoob and to the tribes </strong>(of Banu Israeel)<strong> and to ‘Eesaa and Ayyoob and Yoonus and Haaroon and Sulaymaan; and We gave the Zaboor to Daawud. </strong></span>[4:163]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah mentioned a number of their names together in this aayah, just as He mentioned a number of their names together in the aayah from Soorah al An’aam:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِهِ دَاوُودَ وَسُلَيْمَانَ وَأَيُّوبَ وَيُوسُفَ وَمُوسَىٰ وَهَارُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And from his descendants were Daawood and Sulaymaan and Ayyoob and Yoosuf and Moosaa and Haaroon…</span> </strong>[6:84]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">to the end of the aayaat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the first of them was Nooh  &#8211; <em>‘alaihissalaatu wassalaam</em> – as proven by His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> .. وَالنَّبِيِّينَ مِن بَعْدِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the prophets who came after him…</strong></span> [4:163]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah sent him (Nooh) to his people when they went beyond the limits (<em>ghuloo</em>) concerning the righteous people after the people had been upon the religion of <em>Tawheed</em> from the time of Aadam <em>‘alaihissalaam</em> for ten generations and they were upon <em>Tawheed</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when the people of Nooh came, there were amongst (those people) righteous men. Then when those righteous men died, the people grieved severely for them. So Satan seized the opportunity and said to them, “<em>Make images of those righteous people and set them up in the places where you sit in order that when you see these images, you will remember their condition and you will gain enthusiasm upon worship</em>.” So therefore they made images of those dead people and they set them up in the sitting places but they (these images) were not worshipped to begin with because of the presence of scholars who used to explain <em>Tawheed</em> to the people and used to criticize shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then when the people of knowledge died and the first generation passed away, a later generation came &#8211; and the scholars had died – Satan came and said to them, “<em>Your forefathers only erected these images in order to worship them and they used to seek rain near them (these images)</em>.” So he made worship of them seem to be good, so they worshipped them besides Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in this way, shirk came about upon the Earth; so Allaah therefore sent His Prophet Nooh  &#8211; <em>‘alaihissalaatu wassalaam</em> – calling them to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and seeking to return them to <em>Tawheed</em>, which was the religion of their forefather Aadam – ‘alaihissalaam.  However they (Nooh’s people) were obstinate and haughty:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالُوا لَا تَذَرُنَّ آلِهَتَكُمْ وَلَا تَذَرُنَّ وَدًّا وَلَا سُوَاعًا وَلَا يَغُوثَ وَيَعُوقَ وَنَسْرًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they said, “Do not forsake those objects that you worship! Do not forsake Wadd nor Suwaa’ nor Yaghooth nor Ya’ooq nor Nasr.</span> </strong>[71:23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Abbaas said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« هذه أسماء رجال صالحين ، صوروا صورهم ونصبوها على مجالسهم فآل ﺑﻬم الأمر إلى أن عبدوها من دون الله »</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“These were the names of righteous men; they made images of them and they set them up in their sitting places, and this eventually led them to worshipping them besides Allaah.”</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadith Reported by al Bukhaaree as narration 4920]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when Nooh – <em>‘alaihissalaatu wassalaam</em> &#8211; came to them and forbade them from worshipping them and he commanded them to worship Allaah, they said, “<em>Do not abandon those objects that you worship; do not obey Nooh but rather continue upon your kufr and transgression and obstinacy!</em>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the first shirk that occurred upon the Earth and its cause was the images. And therefore the Prophet <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« إن أشد الناس عذابا عند الله يوم القيامة المصورون »</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The people who will receive the severest punishment on the Day of Resurrection will be those who make images.”</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadith Reported by al Bukhaaree (5950) and Muslim (2109) from hadeeth of ‘Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood <em>ra<u>d</u>i Allaahu ‘anhu</em>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« إن الذين يصنعون هذه الصور يعذبون يوم القيامة ، يقال لهم : أحيوا ما خلقتم »</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Those people who make these images will be punished on the Day of Resurrection. It will be said to them, “Give life to that which you have created.”</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadith Reported by al Bukhaaree (5951) and Muslim  (2108) from hadeeth of ‘Abdullaah ibn ‘Umar  <em>ra<u>d</u>i Allaahu‘ anhumaa </em>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will be commanded to breathe the spirit of life into these images; and this will be a case of <em>ta’jeez</em> (giving them a command to show their inability) and as a punishment for them, and Allaah’s refuge is sought. This is because making images is a route from the routes which lead to shirk, just as happened with the people of Nooh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the first of the Messengers was Nooh. And as for the seal of the Messengers and the last of them, then he was Muhammad <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَّا كَانَ مُحَمَّدٌ أَبَا أَحَدٍ مِّن رِّجَالِكُمْ وَلَٰكِن رَّسُولَ اللَّهِ وَخَاتَمَ النَّبِيِّينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Muhammad is not the father of any of your men but rather he is the Messenger of Allaah and the final one of the prophets</span>. </strong>[33:40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« وأنا خاتم النبيين لا نبي بعدي »</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>I am the seal of the Prophets; there will be no prophet after me.</strong><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadith Reported by Aboo Daawud (4252) and at Tirmidhee from hadeeth of Thawbaan <em>ra<u>d</u>i Allaahu ‘anhu</em> and declared <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> by al Albaanee]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So through him, the Heavenly Messages were concluded. So no prophet will be raised and sent after him until the Hour is established. However his <em>Sharee’ah</em> (Revealed Law) will remain until the Hour is established and his religion will remain until the Hour is established, as has preceded.  So whoever claims Prophethood after Muhammad <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> then he is a disbeliever; and whoever believes (this false claimant to Prophethood) then he (too) is a disbeliever in Allaah, because there will be no prophet after him <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And many people have claimed Prophethood after him; and Allaah has exposed them and has made their falsehood apparent. And from the last of them – in what we know – was al Qaadiyaanee, Ghulaam Ahmad al Qaadiyaanee, the Indian; the one who in the beginning claimed to be upon knowledge and worship, then he claimed that he was ‘Eesaa ibn Maryam, then he claimed Prophethood. And he now has followers who call themselves the Qaadiyaanees. And the Muslims have declared them to be disbelievers and they have shunned them and counted them as being a disbelieving sect  outside of Islaam. And they are a people who are shunned and banished – and all praise is for Allaah – from the lands of the Muslims. And they (the Qaadiyaanees) are active (in dawah). However their activities end in failure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, in summary, there will be no prophet after the Messenger of Allaah <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. Whoever claims prophet hood after him, then he is a great liar, just as he <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« لا تقوم الساعة حتى يبعث دجالون كذابون ، قريبا من ثلاثين كلهم يزعم أنه رسول الله »</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The Hour will not be established until <em>dajjaals</em> (great tricksters), great liars are sent, close to thirty, each one of them claiming that he is a messenger of Allaah.”</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadith Reported by al Bukhaaree (3609) and Muslim after the narration 2923 in the Book of Trials and Tribulations from the hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>i Allaahu ‘anhu</em>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who claim falsely to be prophets are many but Allaah exposes their affair and uncovers them and shows how debased they are to the people. And whoever believes them, then he is a disbeliever because he is denying the Truth of what has been said by Allaah and His Messenger <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and the consensus of the Muslims upon the fact that Prophethood was concluded with Muhammad <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And Allaah sent a Messenger to every nation, from Nooh until Muhammad, commanding them to worship Allaah alone, and forbidding them from the worship of <em>at-taaghoot</em> and the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولًا أَنِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُوا الطَّاغُوتَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We certainly sent a messenger to every nation ordering them that they should worship Allaah </strong>(alone)<strong> and they should shun the</strong> <strong><em>Taaghoot</em></strong> </span>[16:36] <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>76</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">76</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying: “<strong>Allaah sent a messenger to every nation</strong>…”, Meaning: Allaah sent a messenger to every nation of mankind in order to establish the proof upon them so that they would not be able to say, “<em>No bringer of good tidings nor any warner came to us!</em>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And because of His saying, He the Most High:<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا كُنَّا مُعَذِّبِينَ حَتَّىٰ نَبْعَثَ رَسُولًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We do not punish until We have sent a messenger. </strong></span>[17:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah sent a messenger to every nation from the previous nations, just as He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِن مِّنْ أُمَّةٍ إِلَّا خَلَا فِيهَا نَذِيرٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There was not a previous nation except that Allaah sent a warner to them.</strong></span> [35:24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However it is obligatory that we are aware of what was the call of the Messengers? The call of all the messengers, from the first of them to the last of them, was the call to tawheed as per His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولًا أَنِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُوا الطَّاغُوتَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We certainly sent a messenger to every nation ordering them that they should worship Allaah </strong>(alone)<strong> and they should shun the <em>taaghoot</em>.</strong> </span>[16:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So everything that is worshipped besides Allaah is <em>Taaghoot</em>, as will follow with regards to the types of the <em>Taaghoots</em> – that from their types is that which is worshipped besides Allaah whilst he is pleased with that, as will follow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the meaning of His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> .. وَاجْتَنِبُوا الطَّاغُوتَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And shun the Taaghoot…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">means to keep away from worshipping the false objects of worship and the idols and the graves and the tombs; these are <em>taaghoots</em>. So the noble <em>aayah</em> proves that the call of the Messengers, all of them, was concentrated upon <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> from the first of them to the last of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as He, the Perfect and Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلَّا نُوحِي إِلَيْهِ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا أَنَا فَاعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We did not send any messenger before you except that We revealed to him that none has the right to be worshipped except Me so worship Me alone.</strong></span> [21:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يُنَزِّلُ الْمَلَائِكَةَ بِالرُّوحِ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ عَلَىٰ مَن يَشَاءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ أَنْ أَنذِرُوا أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا أَنَا فَاتَّقُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He (Allaah) sends down the angels with the Revelation from His Command to whomever He wishes from His servants ordering them, “Warn the people that none has the right to be worshipped except Me, so therefore fear and be dutiful to Me.” </strong></span>[16:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the call of the Messengers, all of them, was to <em>tawheed</em> and to singling out Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, with worship and to forbidding shirk. This was the call of the Messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then after <em>tawheed</em> comes the Revealed Laws with regards to the <em>halaal</em> (permissible) and the <em>haraam</em> (forbidden). And the details of the Revealed Laws varied in accordance with the variation between the nations and the needs of the nations. And Allaah abrogated from them whatever He wished, and then all of them were abrogated through the Revealed Law of Islaam &#8211; the <em>halaal</em> and the <em>haraam</em>, the rulings and the acts of worship and the commands and the prohibitions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the foundation (of the Revealed Laws) then it was <em>tawheed</em>; then this did not vary and it was not abrogated. This was a single religion; the religion of all the Messengers from the first of them to the last of them was one religion (in this respect) – just as He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لِكُلٍّ جَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ شِرْعَةً وَمِنْهَاجًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And for each people We laid down a prescribed law and a detailed way to follow.</span> </strong>[5:48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the religion of <em>tawheed</em> is the worship of Allaah with that which He legislated at each time in accordance with its particular circumstances. So if a Revealed Law was abrogated then the people moved onto the new abrogating Law.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever insists and remains upon that which has been abrogated, and avoids that which is abrogating, then he will be a disbeliever in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic because the religion which has been abrogated will not be a religion after its being abrogated. Rather it will only be religion before it was abrogated. So when it has been abrogated, then it will not be religion. The religion will be that which comes later (abrogates). Therefore the Revealed Law of Islaam abrogated whatever came before it from the Revealed religious laws.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever remains upon Judaism or Christianity after the sending of Muhammad <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) because he is acting upon a religion which has been abrogated, whose time has come to an end.</p>

<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whoever denies the Resurrection is a disbeliever, and the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">زَعَمَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا أَن لَّن يُبْعَثُوا ۚ قُلْ بَلَىٰ وَرَبِّي لَتُبْعَثُنَّ ثُمَّ لَتُنَبَّؤُنَّ بِمَا عَمِلْتُمْ ۚ وَذَٰلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Those who disbelieve claim that they will not be resurrected. Say </strong>(O Muhammad)<strong>, ‘Yes, by my Lord you will certainly be resurrected and then you will certainly be informed of the deeds which you did. And that is easy for</strong><strong> Allaah. </strong></span>[64:7] <sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">73</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">73</span>]:<strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying: “<strong>Whoever denies the Resurrection is a disbeliever</strong>…” &#8211; because he has denied a pillar from the pillars of eemaan and because he is denying Allaah and to His Messengers and to His Books because Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, informed about the Resurrection and the Messengers informed about the Resurrection and the Books informed about the Resurrection. So whoever denies it then he is a disbeliever. And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">.. زَعَمَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Those who disbelieve <em>za’ama </em>claim…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Az –za’m</em> means “a lie” ( a false claim)</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَن لَّن يُبْعَثُوا ..</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">…that they will not be resurrected.</span> </strong>[64:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the aayah proves that denying the Resurrection is <em>kufr</em> (disbelief). They say, “there is no resurrection after death” &#8211; the people of <em>shirk</em> and the worshippers of idols in the time of the Prophet <em>sall Allaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> used to dispute about the Resurrection.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَإِذَا كُنَّا عِظَامًا نَّخِرَةً  &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">قَالُوا تِلْكَ إِذًا كَرَّةٌ خَاسِرَةٌ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“How can that occur when we have become crumbled bones?” They said, “That would be a return resulting in loss.” </strong></span>[79:11-12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَن يُحْيِي الْعِظَامَ وَهِيَ رَمِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Who can give life to the bones when they have crumbled to dust?” </strong></span>[36:78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from their disputing was:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَيَعِدُكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ إِذَا مِتُّمْ وَكُنتُمْ تُرَابًا وَعِظَامًا أَنَّكُم مُّخْرَجُونَ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">هَيْهَاتَ هَيْهَاتَ لِمَا تُوعَدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Does he </strong>(the Prophet Saalih) <strong>promise you that when you have become dust and bones that you will then be brought out anew from your graves? How far fetched, how far fetched is what you are being promised.” </strong></span>[23:35-36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; to the rest of the sayings of the disbelievers from the previous nations and from the people of shirk in the time of the Prophet<em> sall Allaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>. So whoever denies the Resurrection then he will be along with those disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one denies the Resurrection except for a disbeliever. And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, has commanded His Prophet <em>sall Allaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> to swear an oath by Him upon the Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> قُلْ </span><span style="color:#000000;">بَلَىٰ وَرَبِّي </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say,&#8221;Yes, by my Lord…&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an oath.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> لَتُبْعَثُنَّ ثُمَّ لَتُنَبَّؤُنَّ بِمَا عَمِلْتُمْ ..</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;…you will certainly be resurrected </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(from your graves)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, and then you will certainly be informed of the deeds which you did </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in the world)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">.&#8221; </span></strong>[64:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This aayah is one of the three <em>aayaat</em> in which Allaah commanded His Prophet to swear an oath upon the Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first aayah is from Soorah Yoonus:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَيَسْتَنبِئُونَكَ أَحَقٌّ هُوَ ۖ <span style="color:#0000ff;">قُلْ إِي وَرَبِّي</span> إِنَّهُ لَحَقٌّ ۖ وَمَا أَنتُم بِمُعْجِزِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they question you, “Is is true?” Say, “Yes, by my Lord, it is indeed true and you cannot render Allaah incapable.” </strong></span>[10:53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second is in Soorah Saba’:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لَا تَأْتِينَا السَّاعَةُ ۖ <span style="color:#0000ff;">قُلْ بَلَىٰ وَرَبِّي</span> لَتَأْتِيَنَّكُمْ عَالِمِ الْغَيْبِ ۖ لَا يَعْزُبُ عَنْهُ مِثْقَالُ ذَرَّةٍ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَلَا فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا أَصْغَرُ مِن ذَٰلِكَ وَلَا أَكْبَرُ إِلَّا فِي كِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ لِّيَجْزِيَ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَرِزْقٌ كَرِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And those who disbelieve say, “The Hour will not come upon us.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say, “Yes, by my Lord, the Knower of the hidden and the unseen, it shall certainly come upon you. Not even the amount of the tiniest ant in the Heavens or the Earth escapes Him – nor anything smaller nor anything greater  &#8211; except that it is confirmed in a Clear Book.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">In order that He should reward those who believe and do righteous deeds. For them there will be forgiveness and generous provision.</span></strong> [34:3-4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah commanded His Prophet to swear by Him upon the Resurrection and upon the establishment of the Hour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the third aayah is that which is with us from Soorah at Taghaabun:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">زَعَمَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا أَن لَّن يُبْعَثُوا ۚ <span style="color:#0000ff;">قُلْ بَلَىٰ وَرَبِّي</span> لَتُبْعَثُنَّ ثُمَّ لَتُنَبَّؤُنَّ بِمَا عَمِلْتُمْ ۚ وَذَٰلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Those who disbelieve claim that Allaah will not resurrect them after death.  </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(O Muhammad)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, ‘Yes, by my Lord you will certainly be resurrected (from your graves), and then you will certainly be informed of the deeds which you did (in the world).  And that is easy for Allaah.</span></strong>[64:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Wisdom behind the Resurrection is recompensing the servants for their deeds. And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>…then you will certainly be informed…</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning – that you will be informed of your deeds and recompensed for them.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The <em>Hisaab </em>(Account) and The<em> Meezaan (</em>the Balance)</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the Resurrection the people will be brought to <em>hisaab </em>(account) and will be rewarded or punished for their actions.  And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلِلَّهِ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ لِيَجْزِيَ الَّذِينَ أَسَاءُوا بِمَا عَمِلُوا وَيَجْزِيَ الَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُوا بِالْحُسْنَى</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth,So that He may recompense those who did evil for what they did; and that He may reward those who did good with the best reward of Paradise</span>. </strong>[53:31]<strong><sup>[</sup></strong><span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>72</sup></span><strong><sup>]</sup></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">72</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the actions that will occur on the Day of Resurrection is <em>al hisaab</em> (the Reckoning) and<em> al meezaan</em> (the Balance). The <em>hisaab</em> has the meaning of <em>munaaqashah</em> (interrogation) of the people of sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So the Muslims will be of three categories on the Day of Resurrection:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The first category</strong></span> from them are those who will have no <em>hisaab</em> (reckoning) and will enter Paradise without any reckoning and without any punishment, just as occurs in the hadeeth of the seventy thousand who will enter Paradise without any reckoning and without any punishment.[1]</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[1] Hadeeth reported by al Bukhaaree (5705) and Muslim from the hadeeth of ‘Imraan ibn Husayn <em>radi Allaahu ‘anhu</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The second category</strong> </span>of the people are those who will be given a light reckoning, and it is <em>al-‘ar<u>d</u></em> (presentation of the record) only. He is not taken to account with the reckoning of interrogation but rather will be reckoned such that the record is just presented to him. And this person is also (as well as the first category) one of the people of bliss. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ بِيَمِينِهِ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">فَسَوْفَ يُحَاسَبُ حِسَابًا يَسِيرًا &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَيَنقَلِبُ إِلَىٰ أَهْلِهِ مَسْرُورًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So as for the one who is given his record of deeds in his right hand, then he will soon receive a light reckoning and he will return to his family joyful. </strong></span>[84:7-9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The third category:</strong></span> those who will receive a reckoning involving interrogation and this person is in great danger, because of his <em>sall Allaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Whoever has his record closely examined will be punished.</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Reported by al Bukhaaree (103) and Muslim (2876) from the hadeeth of ‘Aaishah <em>ra<u>d</u>iAllaahu‘anhaa</em>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>As for the <em>kuffaar</em> (disbelievers)</strong></span> then the scholars disagree regarding them: will they receive a reckoning or will they not receive a reckoning? So from the scholars are those who say that the disbelievers will not receive a reckoning because they (the disbelievers) do not have any good deeds. Rather they will be taken straight to the Fire because they have no good deeds. And from the scholars are those who say (that) they will receive a reckoning with a <em>hisaab</em> (reckoning) of <em>taqreer</em> (confession), meaning a (confession) of their deeds, their <em>kufr</em> (disbelief) and their apostasy. Then they will be taken to the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>meezaan</em> (the Balance) means the apparatus upon which the deeds of the people will be weighed. The good deeds will be placed on one scale and the evil deeds on one scale.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَمَن ثَقُلَتْ مَوَازِينُهُ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ </span>&#8211; <span style="color:#000000;">وَمَنْ خَفَّتْ مَوَازِينُهُ فَأُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ خَسِرُوا أَنفُسَهُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So whoever’s balance of good deeds is heavy, then they will be the successful ones. And whoever’s balance of good deeds is light then they are the ones who have caused their own souls to be in loss</span>. </strong>[23:102-103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the evil deeds outweigh, then the person will lose; and if the good deeds outweigh, then the person will succeed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Balance is a balance for the deeds; and likewise, the person who is given the record in his right hand, then his reckoning will be easy. And whoever is given his record in his left hand, then his reckoning will be difficult and he will see the terrors and the huge dangers and he will go on from one danger to the next in the different stages of the Resurrection, and the Reckoning, and Gathering. These are terrifying matters if we reflect upon them.</p>

<hr />
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Belief in the Resurrection</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And after they have died, the people will be resurrected, and the proof is His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مِنْهَا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ وَفِيهَا نُعِيدُكُمْ وَمِنْهَا نُخْرِجُكُمْ تَارَةً أُخْرَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>From the Earth We created you </strong>(O Mankind)<strong>, and to it We shall return you </strong>(after death)<strong> and from it We shall raise you to life again. </strong></span>[20:55]<sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">70</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">70</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He moved on, to another fundamental principle, which is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>eemaan (true faith) in <em>al-ba’th</em> (the Resurrection)</strong></span> – meaning that death alone is not what is wanted. We know and everyone knows &#8211; even the disbelievers and the atheists and the evil heretics &#8211; all of them know that death will certainly occur. No one denies death, because it is something which is experienced. However the important matter is the Resurrection after death; this is the point of disagreement between the believers and the disbelievers, the Resurrection after death. And it (the Resurrection) is the restoration of the bodies which have rotted away and become decayed bones and dust and which have separated in the Earth. They will be restored and rebuilt just as they were before, because the One who created them in the first place is fully able to bring them back again.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the souls will be blown into them, then they will move and proceed from the graves to the <em>Mahshar</em> (GatheringPlace) because of His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَوْمَ يَخْرُجُونَ مِنَ الْأَجْدَاثِ سِرَاعًا كَأَنَّهُمْ إِلَىٰ نُصُبٍ يُوفِضُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>On the Day when they will come out from the graves, they will be as if they are racing to a finishing post. </strong></span>[70:43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَخْرُجُونَ مِنَ الْأَجْدَاثِ كَأَنَّهُمْ جَرَادٌ مُّنتَشِرٌ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">مُّهْطِعِينَ إِلَى الدَّاعِ ۖ يَقُولُ الْكَافِرُونَ هَٰذَا يَوْمٌ عَسِرٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They will come forth from the graves as if they are scattered locusts, rushing towards the caller. </strong></span>[54:7-8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one will stay back. So this Resurrection is true, there is no doubt about it. And whoever denies it is a disbeliever in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. And having eemaan in the Resurrection is one of the six pillars of eemaan about which the Prophet <em>sall Allaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“(Eemaan) is that you truly believe in Allaah and in His Angels and in His Books and in His Messengers and in the Last Day  and that you truly believe in Pre-decree, the good of it and the bad of it.”</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Reported by al Bukhaaree (50) and Muslim from the hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>i Allaahu ‘anhu </em>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever does not truly believe in the Resurrection and in the Last Day, then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (a disbeliever) in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, even if he bears witness to ‘<em>laa ilaaha ill Allaah</em>’ and that ‘Muhammad <em>rasool ullaah</em>’ and even if he prays and fasts and performs Hajj and gives the <em>Zakaat</em> and does the actions of obedience. If he denies the Resurrection or doubts about it, then he will be a disbeliever in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proofs for the Resurrection are many; from them is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">.. مِنْهَا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>From it We created you…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: the Earth, when He created Aadam ‘alaihissalaam, the father of mankind.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">.. وَفِيهَا نُعِيدُكُمْ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And to it We shall return you…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning; after death, in the graves.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِنْهَا نُخْرِجُكُمْ تَارَةً أُخْرَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And from it We shall bring you out again.</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this aayah includes the beginning and the final return:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مِنْهَا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ وَفِيهَا نُعِيدُكُمْ وَمِنْهَا نُخْرِجُكُمْ تَارَةً أُخْرَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>From it We created you and to it We shall return you and from it We shall bring you out again. </strong></span>[20:55]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also the saying of Allaah, the Most High:<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاللَّهُ أَنبَتَكُم مِّنَ الْأَرْضِ نَبَاتًا &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ يُعِيدُكُمْ فِيهَا وَيُخْرِجُكُمْ إِخْرَاجًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And Allaah created you from the (dust of) the Earth, then He will cause you to return (to being dust) within the Earth, then He will bring you forth and restore you to</strong><strong> life. </strong></span>[71:17-18] <sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">71</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">71</span>]  <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">.. وَاللَّهُ أَنبَتَكُم مِّنَ الْأَرْضِ نَبَاتًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah created you from the </strong>(dust of)<strong> the Earth…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When He created Aadam ‘<em>alaihissalaam</em> from it.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">.. </span><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ يُعِيدُكُمْ فِيهَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then He will return you to it…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Through death and the graves.<em> </em></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَيُخْرِجُكُمْ إِخْرَاجًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He will bring you out from it. </strong></span>[71:17-18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Resurrection. They will come out from the graves and they will proceed to the <em>Ma<u>h</u>-shar</em> (the Gathering Place).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ فِيهَا تَحْيَوْنَ وَفِيهَا تَمُوتُونَ وَمِنْهَا تُخْرَجُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He said, &#8220;Upon the Earth you will live and upon it you will die and from it you will be brought out.&#8221; </strong></span>[7:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: you will live upon its surface and you will die upon it and you will come out from it for the Resurrection on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are proofs from the Qur&#8217;aan for the Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also to be found an intellectual proof from the Qur&#8217;aan itself and it is that the One who is able to bring the creation about initially is able to restore the creation even more so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَهُوَ الَّذِي يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ وَهُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ ۚ وَلَهُ الْمَثَلُ الْأَعْلَىٰ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۚ وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He</strong> (<strong>Allaah</strong>)<strong> is the One who created the creation to begin with, then He restores it and that is even easier for Him. And for Him is the highest description in the Heavens and the Earth. And He is the All Mighty, the All Wise. </strong></span>[30:27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The One who was able to bring the people into existence from non existence is able to restore them after death even more so. This is a proof which is textual and intellectual.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the proofs for the Resurrection is that which occurs to the Earth with regards to its being brought to life with plants. So you can see the Earth being dead, having no plants upon it, being barren. Then Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, sends down rain upon it, then He causes plants to grow which were dead stubble previously. Likewise the bodies which are within the Earth; they were stored within the Earth and Allaah will send down rain upon them and then the bodies will grow and become complete. And then the souls will be breathed into them. So indeed you see the Earth, how it can be dry and arid, but then it comes to life with that (vegetation) which grows from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Majestic and Most High – He is the One who gives life to the Earth after its death:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ أَنَّكَ تَرَى الْأَرْضَ خَاشِعَةً فَإِذَا أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهَا الْمَاءَ اهْتَزَّتْ وَرَبَتْ ۚ إِنَّ الَّذِي أَحْيَاهَا لَمُحْيِي الْمَوْتَىٰ ۚ إِنَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And from His signs is that you see the Earth dry and barren. Then when We send down water upon it, it rises and stirs to life with vegetation. The One who gives life to it will certainly give life to the dead. Indeed He has full ability over everything</span>. </strong>[41:39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the One who has ability over giving life to the Earth after its death is able to give life to the bodies after their death because both are cases of coming to life after death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the proofs for the Resurrection is that if were to be no Resurrection then that would necessitate that the creation of Mankind was meaningless because they (the people) live  &#8211;  the obedient, dutiful, believer in Allaah and His Messengers live;  and the disbeliever, the atheist, the evil heretic, the wicked tyrant, the arrogant one, the sinner live – all of them live and then they die, without this believer receiving anything from his reward or without this disbeliever and this evil heretic and this atheist and this tyrannical oppressor of the people receiving any of his recompense whatsoever?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So does this befit Allaah that He would leave the people in this manner without rewarding the people of eemaan for their eemaan, and the people who did good for their good, and the people of crimes and disbelief for their crimes and <em>kufr</em>? This would not befit the Wisdom of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, and therefore He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلِلَّهِ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ لِيَجْزِيَ الَّذِينَ أَسَاءُوا بِمَا عَمِلُوا وَيَجْزِيَ الَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُوا بِالْحُسْنَى</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And to Allaah belongs whatever is in the Heavens and in the Earth, so that He will recompense those who did evil for what they did and He will reward those who did good with the best reward. </strong></span>[53:31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this will not occur except on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise in His saying, He the Perfect:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْ حَسِبَ الَّذِينَ اجْتَرَحُوا السَّيِّئَاتِ أَن نَّجْعَلَهُمْ كَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ سَوَاءً مَّحْيَاهُمْ وَمَمَاتُهُمْ ۚ سَاءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And do those who commit evil deeds think that We will treat them just the same as those who believe and do righteous deeds in their life and in their death? Evil is the judgment that they make. </strong></span>[45:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And, He the Perfect and Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْ نَجْعَلُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ كَالْمُفْسِدِينَ فِي الْأَرْضِ أَمْ نَجْعَلُ الْمُتَّقِينَ كَالْفُجَّارِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Shall We make those who truly believe and who do righteous deeds just like those who cause corruption upon the Earth? Or shall We make those who are dutiful to Allaah just the same as the wicked evil doers? </strong></span>[38:28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Perfect and Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَفَحَسِبْتُمْ أَنَّمَا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ عَبَثًا وَأَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْنَا لَا تُرْجَعُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do you think that We created you without purpose and that you will not be returned to Us? </strong></span>[23:115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَيَحْسَبُ الْإِنسَانُ أَن يُتْرَكَ سُدًى &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَمْ يَكُ نُطْفَةً مِّن مَّنِيٍّ يُمْنَىٰ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ كَانَ عَلَقَةً فَخَلَقَ فَسَوَّىٰ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">فَجَعَلَ مِنْهُ الزَّوْجَيْنِ الذَّكَرَ وَالْأُنثَىٰ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَيْسَ ذَٰلِكَ بِقَادِرٍ عَلَىٰ أَن يُحْيِيَ الْمَوْتَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Does man think that he will be left without having duties placed upon him? Was he not a drop of sperm emitted? Then he was a clot of blood and Allaah created him and fully formed him? And produced from him offspring, male and female? Is the One who did that not able to give life to the dead?</span> </strong>[75:36-40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He rebutted the disbeliever who said,</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَن يُحْيِي الْعِظَامَ وَهِيَ رَمِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Who will give life to the bones when they are decayed away? </strong></span>[36:78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ يُحْيِيهَا الَّذِي أَنشَأَهَا أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ ۖ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ خَلْقٍ عَلِيمٌ  &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُم مِّنَ الشَّجَرِ الْأَخْضَرِ نَارًا فَإِذَا أَنتُم مِّنْهُ تُوقِدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “He who created him in the first place will give life to him; and He has full knowledge of every created thing. He who produces fire for you from the green tree, then you use it to light your own fires</span>. </strong>[36:78-80]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The One who is able to bring out fire which burns from a fresh green tree &#8211; is He not able to give life to the dead?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the evidences for the Resurrection is using as evidence the creation of the Heavens and the Earth. So the One who created these tremendously huge and awesome created things is fully able to restore man to life because the One who is able to do something tremendous will be able to do something less, even more so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَوَلَيْسَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِقَادِرٍ عَلَىٰ أَن يَخْلُقَ مِثْلَهُم ۚ بَلَىٰ وَهُوَ الْخَلَّاقُ الْعَلِيمُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Is the One who created the Heavens and the Earth not able to create the like of them? Yes, indeed! And He is the All Knowing Creator who creates again and again.</strong></span> [36:81]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَخَلْقُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ أَكْبَرُ مِنْ خَلْقِ النَّاسِ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The creation of the Heavens and the Earth is greater than the creation of mankind. However most of mankind do not know.</strong></span> [40:57]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are the evidences for the Resurrection which confirm that Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, will resurrect those who are in the graves and that He will recompense every doer of deeds in accordance with his deeds; if good, then with good and if evil, then with evil. So let the disbeliever disbelieve and let the wicked person and the evil heretic and the apostate be upon evil – because in front of him there lies the Resurrection and the Rising from death and the Recompensing and the Reckoning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the believer, the one who is dutiful to Allaah, who worships Allaah and seeks to draw closer to Allaah, then his deeds will never be lost. For there is an appointment where Allaah will recompense him for his deeds and will give him multiplied reward and will give him things that he did not think of or expect.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Settling in al-Madeenah and the Coming Down of the Rest of the Religious Duties and the Completion of the Religion</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فلما استقر بالمدينة أمر ببقية شرائع الإسلام ، مثل الزكاة والصوم والحج والجهاد ، والأذان ، والأمر بالمعروف والنهي عن المنكر ، وغير ذلك من شرائع الإسلام ، أخذ على هذا عشر سنين ، وبعدها توفي صلوات الله وسلامه عليه ، ودينه باق وهذا دينه ، لا خير إلا دل الأمة عليه ، ولا شر إلا حذرها منه ، والخير الذي دلها عليه التوحيد وجميع ما يحبه الله ويرضاه ، والشر الذي حذر منه الشرك وجميع ما يكرهه الله ويأباه ، بعثه الله إلى الناس كافة ، وافترض الله طاعته على جميع الثقلين الجن والإنس </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">When he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> settled in al-Madeenah, he was ordered with the rest of the prescribed duties of <em>Islaam</em>, such as the <em>zakaat</em>; fasting (<em><u>S</u>awm</em>); <em>Hajj</em>; <em>Jihaad</em>; the <em>adhaan</em>; commanding good and forbidding evil; and the rest of the prescribed duties of <em>Islaam</em>.  He spent ten years establishing that, after which he passed away, may Allaah extol and send blessings of peace upon him. His religion remains and this is his religion.  There is no good except that he directed his nation to it and there is no evil except that he warned them against it.  The good that he guided them to is <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, and all that Allaah loves and is pleased with. The evil which he warned against was <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and everything that Allaah hates and rejects.  Allaah sent him as a prophet to the whole of mankind, and Allaah made it obligatory upon all of the jinn and mankind to obey him.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنِّي رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ جَمِيعًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof is His saying, the Most High: «<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: O people! I am the Messenger of Allaah to you all</strong></span>.» [7:158]<sup> [<span style="color:#ff0000;">67</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">67</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This, as has already been explained, means that the <em><u>sh</u>aree`ah</em> came down in stages until it was completed &#8211; and all praise is for Allaah &#8211; before the death of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and before Allaah sent down to him:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ الْإِسْلَامَ دِينًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This day, I have completed your religion for you, perfected My blessings upon you, and am pleased with Islaam as your Religion</strong></span>.» [5:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A short period after this <em>aayah</em> came down, the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> passed away; and his religion remains until the establishment of the Hour.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah completed the religion through him and the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ الْإِسْلَامَ دِينًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This day, I have completed your religion for you, perfected My blessings upon you, and am pleased with <em>Islaam</em> as your Religion</strong></span>.» [5:3]<sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">68</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">68</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> did not pass away until after Allaah had completed the religion and the favour through him and had sent down to him His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ الْإِسْلَامَ دِينًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This day, I have completed your religion for you, perfected My blessings upon you, and am pleased with <em>Islaam</em> as your Religion</strong></span>.» [5:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>aayah</em> came down to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> whilst he was performing the standing in <em>`Arafah</em> during the Farewell Hajj on the Day of <em>Jumu`ah</em>. And he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> lived after it for a short time and then moved on to the highest company (of angels).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he left his nation upon <strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>al-ma<u>h</u>ajjah al-baydaa</em></span></strong> (the clear white path) whose night is the same as its day; no one deviates from it except that he is destroyed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>aayah</em> contains a testimony from Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, that this religion has been completed and that it covers everything of benefit to the servants and that it contains a solution for all of their issues and problems until the Establishment of the Hour. And that is suitable for every time and place; they do not need any other legislation after it or any other book to come down or any other messenger to be sent after the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>.<strong>            </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, there is no matter to be found and there is no event that will occur until the Day of Resurrection except that in the Legislation revealed to Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> there is a solution for it and the ruling concerning it. However, the matter relates back to who is competent to extract evidence and to derive proof, rulings and issues. If there are to be found <em>ahlul-`ilm</em> (people of knowledge) and people qualified to make <em>ijtihaad</em> (personal deductions in rulings) who fulfill the conditions of <em>ijtihaad</em>, then indeed, this legislation is complete and contains a solution for all problems. Deficiency only comes about from us from the aspect of deficiency in (our) knowledge and inability to fully understand what Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, has sent down &#8211; or from the aspect of desires, that there occurs a case of following of desires which diverts a person away from the Truth. Otherwise this religion is fully suitable and comprehensive and complete. Allaah has sufficed the <em>Islaamic</em> nation with it until the establishment of the hour if it acts upon it (the religion) correctly and refers back to it in its affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَإِن تَنَازَعْتُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ فَرُدُّوهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَالرَّسُولِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So if you disagree about anything then refer it back to Allaah and the Messenger</strong></span>.» [4:59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Referring back to Allaah is to refer back to the Book of Allaah, and referring back to the Messenger after his passing away is to refer back to his <em>Sunnah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا اخْتَلَفْتُمْ فِيهِ مِن شَيْءٍ فَحُكْمُهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">« <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whatever you disagree about then its judgment is to be referred to Allaah</strong></span>.» [42:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>aayah</em> (from <em>Soorah al-Maa.idah</em>) contains a refutation of those who make accusations against the <em>Islaamic</em> Legislation of its having shortcomings or of its being deficient, (these accusations coming) from the atheists and the evil heretics, or from the “semi students” whose understanding falls short in being able to understand the hidden wisdoms of the <em>Islaamic</em> Legislation. Therefore, these (foolish people) ascribe deficiency to the <em>Islaamic</em> Legislation and they do not know that the deficiency is with themselves alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it (this <em>aayah</em>) contains a refutation against those who accuse the <em>Islaamic</em> Legislation of deficiency and that it does not cover all needs of the servants and all matters of welfare of the servants until the Establishment of the Hour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or those who say: &#8220;It was specific to a certain olden times,&#8221; &#8211; because there are many ignorant people who, when it is said to them, &#8220;This is the <em>Islaamic</em> ruling,&#8221; they say, &#8220;That was in the time of the Messenger and the initial time. As for now, conditions have changed and the matters have altered; and the legislated rulings were for people who have now passed away and for problems that have come to an end.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say this, and this is disbelief in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and it is a denial of His Saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This day, I have completed your religion for you</strong></span>.» [5:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah completed the religion for this nation until the Hour is established for every time and place and for every generation of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also contains a refutation of the innovators, those who introduce worship from themselves and ascribe it to the religion, when it has no proof from the Book of Allaah and the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. Rather they just introduce it in accordance with what they deem to be good or based upon blindly following others whom they have good thoughts about from the people of false ideas and people with their own goals and desires. So therefore, they introduce worship into the religion, which Allaah has sent down no proof for. He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">» <strong>من أحدث في أمرنا هذا ما ليس منه فهو رد </strong>«</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it, then it is rejected</strong></span>.»</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Reported by al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree no. 2697 and Muslim no. 1718 from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Aa.ishah, <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu `anhaa</em>.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasallaam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">» <strong>وإياكم ومحدثات الأمور فإن كل محدثة بدعة وكل بدعة ضلالة </strong>«</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And beware of newly introduced matters, for every newly introduced matter is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance</strong>.</span>»</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Reported by Aboo Daawood, A<u>h</u>mad, at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee, and Ibn Maajah from the famous <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Irbaad ibn Saariyyah, <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu `anhu</em>. (al-Albaanee declared it <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em>) ].</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever introduces acts of worship which have no proof from the Book of Allaah nor from the <em>Sunnah</em> of the Messenger of Allaah, then he is accusing this religion of not being complete and he wishes to complete the religion himself. He is not actually acknowledging the fact that Allaah has completed it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whatever was not religion in the time of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> will never be religion after him. So this contains a refutation of these groups: The group who say that <em>Islaam</em> is not suitable for every time, or those who innovate newly invented innovations which have no proof from the Book of Allaah nor the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger, and who ascribe them to the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>aayah</em> (from <em>Soorah al-Maa.idah</em>) contains a refutation of them because the religion was completed by Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. So there is no scope for addition in it nor for reduction from it. And there is no scope for raising doubts nor seeking to obscure the issue by saying that it is not suitable for the people in these later times.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This day, I have completed your religion for you</strong>.</span>» [5:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Speech of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. He is the Most Truthful One of those who speak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ الْإِسْلَامَ دِينًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And I perfected My blessings upon you, and am pleased with <em>Islaam</em> as your Religion</strong></span>.» [5:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the last of that which came down to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and it is a testimony from the Lord of the whole of the Creation for this religion that it is complete, comprehensive, and fully suitable for every time and place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying (in this <em>aayah</em>) is an address to this nation, from the first of it to the last of it, and it is not just an address to the first generation alone. Rather it is an address to the whole of the nation until the Hour is established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <em>ijmaa`</em> (consensus), then the whole nation are agreed in consensus that he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> passed away. No one disagrees about this except the people of false beliefs, those who say that the Messenger did not die. They negate death from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. This is baseless speech and speech which is clearly rejected. It is refuted by what has been experienced and what is clearly the case, for the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> indeed passed away amongst his Companions. He was bathed, shrouded, had the funeral prayer prayed over him and he was buried. Can these actions be carried out on a person who is still alive?  He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> was treated as one who had died. He was washed and shrouded and prayed over and then he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> was buried in his grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the way of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, with regards to His Creation. And then where are the Messengers who came before him? What occurred to him occurred to the Messengers who came before him. They died. And he is one of them, so he died. This is by consensus of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah</em>. No one disagrees about this except the people of false beliefs, those who seek to attach themselves to the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and seek deliverance through him besides Allaah, and say: &#8220;He is still alive.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof that he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam </em>died is His saying, the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّكَ مَيِّتٌ وَإِنَّهُم مَّيِّتُونَ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ إِنَّكُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ عِندَ رَبِّكُمْ تَخْتَصِمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O </strong>(Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>)<strong>! You will certainly die and they will certainly die. Then on the Day of Resurrection you will all dispute before your Lord</strong>.</span>» [39:30-31]<sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">69</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">69</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>, when Allaah completed the religion through him and perfected His Favour through him, caused him to die, as is the way of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, with His creation:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">كُلُّ نَفْسٍ ذَائِقَةُ الْمَوْتِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Every soul shall taste death</strong>.</span>» [3:185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophets and the Messengers enter within this generality:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">كُلُّ نَفْسٍ ذَائِقَةُ الْمَوْتِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Every soul shall taste death</strong></span>.» [3:185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam </em>passed away and moved on from this world to his Lord, He the Mighty and Majestic. This is established by the text, by consensus, and by analogy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the textual (proof), then it is His statement, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّكَ مَيِّتٌ وَإِنَّهُم مَّيِّتُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You will certainly die and they will certainly die</strong></span>.» [39:30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is information from Allaah to His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam </em>that he will soon die.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: You are going to die.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is said to a person who is going to die: &#8220;This is a <em>mayyit</em> (person who is going to die).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the person who has actually already died, then it is said about him: &#8216;<em>mayt</em>,&#8217; with a <em>sukoon</em> (on the letter <em>yaa</em> in the middle of the word), because of His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَوَمَن كَانَ مَيْتًا فَأَحْيَيْنَاهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Or one who was <em>mayt </em>(dead) and We gave life to him</strong></span>.» [6:122]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the <em>mayt</em> is the one whose soul has left his body. As for <em>al-mayyit</em>, then he is the one who will die in future.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>Hijrah</em></strong><strong> to al-Madeenah</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وبعدها أمر بالهجرة إلى المدينة</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">After that, he was commanded to perform <em>hijrah</em> to al-Madeenah.</span></strong><sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">62</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">62</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>): «<strong>After that, he was commanded to perform <em>hijrah</em> to al-Madeenah</strong>»: When the harm from the Quray<u>sh</u> became severe and their evil increased on account of their blocking (people) from Allaah’s path, persecuting the Muslims and torturing those who had no group of people to defend them from the Muslims, who were in a state of weakness – then Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, gave permission for the Muslims to make <em>hijrah</em> to Abyssinia &#8211; the first <em>hijrah</em>, because there was a king with whom no one would be oppressed. He was a Christian, however he was just, so a large group of them migrated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Quray<u>sh</u> came to know of their migration to Abyssinia, they sent two representatives from the wise men of Quray<u>sh</u> to seek (that they be brought back). One of them was `Amr ibn al-`Aas. They had with them gifts for an-Najaa<u>sh</u>ee (the ruler of Abyssinia). They said: &#8220;These people have run away from us and they are relatives of ours. We want them to return to us &#8211; and they are evil doers – so that they do not cause corruption in your land,&#8221; to the end (of what they said). They gave him the gifts that they had with them in order to change his mind, however, he (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) called the <em>muhaajireen</em> and listened to what they had to say and he gave them a choice, so they chose to remain in Abyssinia. Therefore, the two representatives went back frustrated. And the <em>muhaajiroon</em> in Abyssinia remained there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, Allaah favoured an-Najaa<u>sh</u>ee and he accepted <em>Islaam</em> and made his <em>Islaam</em> good. When he died, the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and his Companions prayed the funeral prayer for him with the prayer of one whose body is absent. So in migrating to him there was good for him as well; by means of them, Allaah guided him, so he entered into <em>Islaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> met a group from the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em> (the Muslims from al-Madeenah) in <em>Minaa</em> during the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em>; and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi was allam</em> used to present himself to the tribes during the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em>. He would go to the different camping places of the Arabs in <em>Minaa</em> and call them to Allaah. And it happened that he met some men from the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em>, so he called them to Allaah and he explained his call to them. They accepted the call from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and gave him a pledge upon <em>Islaam</em>. They went back to their people from the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> and called them to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. Then in the next pilgrimage, a larger number came than those who were in the first. Some men from the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em> came and gave the pledge to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi was allam</em>, the second pledge of <em>al-`Aqabah</em>, meaning: at the stoning place of <em>al-`Aqabah</em>. They gave a pledge upon the basis of <em>Islaam</em> and upon the basis of aiding him if he made the migration to them and that they would defend him just as they defended themselves and their (own) children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then, after this &#8211; meaning, after this blessed pledge &#8211; the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> commanded those Muslims who were in Makkah to perform <em>hijrah</em> (migration) to al-Madeenah; and whoever migrated, migrated to al-Madeenah. And the Messenger and some of his Companions remained. Then Allaah permitted His Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> to migrate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Quray<u>sh</u> became aware of the migration of his Companions to al-Madeenah and they knew of the pledge that had occurred between him and the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em>, they feared that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> would join up with his Companions in al-Madeenah and would therefore, attain power and gain strength.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On this night, when the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> wanted to depart to make <em>hijrah</em>, they came and surrounded his house. They stood outside the door with their weapons, intending to attack Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. So, Allaah informed His Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> (and) the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> commanded `Alee to sleep upon his bed so that the people of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> could see him and think that he was the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. So `Alee <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu `anhu</em> slept upon the bed of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and covered himself with the blanket of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the <em>mu<u>sh</u>riks</em> were waiting for him to come out, thinking that he was the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> when in actuality, the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> had already come out between them and they were unaware. Allaah blinded their sight from him, and he took some dust and scattered it upon their heads, and departed from amongst them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He went to Aboo Bakr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu `anhu</em> and the two of them departed and went to the Cave of <u>Th</u>awr and hid there for three days. The Quray<u>sh</u> were asking the people to catch him by whatever means; alive or dead. So, when they despaired of finding him after looking and searching, they offered rewards for whoever could bring him <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> alive or dead. When they had totally despaired, Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and his Companion left the cave and rode their riding camels and went to al-Madeenah.<em> </em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">والهجرة : الانتقال من بلد الشرك إلى بلد الإسلام </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Hijrah</em> is to move from the land of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> to the land of <em>Islaam</em></strong></span>.<sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">63</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">63</span>] :<strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>al-Hijrah</em> in the (Arabic) language means &#8220;<strong>to abandon something</strong>.&#8221; As for <em>hijrah</em> in the legislation, then it is just as the <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> defined it: &#8220;<strong>to depart from the land of <em>kufr</em> and go to the land of <em>Islaam</em></strong>.&#8221; This is <em>hijrah</em> in the legislation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>hijrah</em> is a tremendous deed; Allaah has joined it along with <em>jihaad</em> in many <em>aayaat</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> made the <em>hijrah</em> to al-Madeenah, the <em>Muhaajiroon</em>, who had been in Abyssinia, then came to al-Madeenah and the Muslims gathered in al-Madeenah &#8211; and all praise is for Allaah. A state was formed for the Muslims in al-Madeenah, comprising the <em>muhaajiroon</em> and the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em>; and whoever had accepted Islaam would come to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, Allaah legislated the remaining duties of the religion, so He made the fasting obligatory upon His Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>, and the <em>Zakaat</em> in the second year after the <em>hijrah</em> and He made obligatory upon him the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> in the ninth year after the <em>Hijrah</em> according the correct saying. With that, the pillars of <em>Islaam</em> were completed, the first of them being the two testimonies and the last of them being the <em>Hajj</em> to Allaah’s Sacred House.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in summary, we know from this that <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> is the first requirement in calling to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and that the caller begins with it before he begins with the prayer, the fasting, the <em>zakaat</em> or the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em>, because the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> remained for ten years calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and forbidding <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>. He was not commanded with prayer and he was not commanded with <em>zakaat</em> nor pilgrimage nor fasting. Rather these obligatory duties were made obligatory after <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> was established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when he would send out callers, the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> would command them to call the people with the first thing they would call to being <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, just as occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Mu`aadh:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">» إنك تأتي قوما من أهل الكتاب ، فليكن أول ما تدعوهم إليه  شهادة أن لا إله إلا الله وأن محمدا رسول الله ، فإن هم أجابوا لذلك فأعلمهم أن الله افترض عليهم خمس صلوات «<strong> </strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>You are going to a people from the People of the Book. So let the first thing that you call them to be the testimony that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah. If they accept that from you, then inform them that Allaah has made five prayers obligatory upon them&#8230;» </strong>to the end of the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>.</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Reported by al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree no. 1395 and Muslim no. 19 from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Abdullaah ibn `Abbaas, <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu `anhumaa</em>.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this proves that a person is not commanded with the prayer nor with the <em>zakaat</em> nor with fasting until <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> is established and <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> is present – and that whoever begins with other than <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, then his call will fail and his methodology is contrary to the methodology of the Messengers, all of them <em>`alaihumassalaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of the Messengers began by calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and to the correction of <em>`aqeedah</em>. It is important for those who proceed to be aware of this methodology, for there are many people today, who confuse this methodology and change this methodology and choose a different methodology for themselves from their own ideas or from other people who are ignorant. There must be a return to the methodology of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. This is the benefit of having awareness of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and his <em>seerah</em> and of making this one of the three fundamental principles. You know how he called the people and what was his <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> methodology in calling them, so you can proceed upon it because he <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam</em> is the example to be followed.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Time Period of the Call in Makkah</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أخذ على هذا عشر سنين يدعو إلى التوحيد</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>He carried this out for ten years calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em></strong></span>. <sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">60</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">60</span>] :<strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His statement: «<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He carried this out for ten years calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em></strong></span>» meaning: He called the people to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and warned against <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> for ten years in Makkah. He was calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and forbidding <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>, because they used to direct worship to the idols.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the wisdom in Allaah&#8217;s sending him as a prophet in Makkah was that Makkah is <em>Umm al-Quraa</em> (the mother of all the cities), that to which all the cities relate back to. Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا كَانَ رَبُّكَ مُهْلِكَ الْقُرَىٰ حَتَّىٰ يَبْعَثَ فِي أُمِّهَا رَسُولًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And your Lord would not destroy the townships until He sent a Messenger in their original one</strong></span>.» [28:59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The &#8216;<em>Umm</em>&#8216; is the source to which something relates back to and the foundation which it relates back to; this is the <em>Umm</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">هُنَّ أُمُّ الْكِتَابِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They are the foundation of the Book</strong>.</span>» [3:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: The source to which the <em>aayaat</em> which are <em>muta<u>sh</u>aabihah</em> (unclear) are referred back to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise Makkah has been honored by Allaah, in that it is the original place to which the whole of the people of the Earth resort back, and Muslims in the different regions of the Earth return to Makkah. So it is <em>Umm al-Quraa</em> with the meaning that it is the place of return. Allaah sent His Prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> in Makkah because it is <em>Umm al-Quraa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He remained in it for thirteen years forbidding the people of Makkah from <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and commanding them with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, because the people of Makkah are the example for others besides them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is binding that Makkah should remain, until the establishment of the Hour, as an abode of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and a beacon for the call to Allaah, and everything which conflicts with that must be kept away from it. So, <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>, innovations, and false superstitions must be kept away from it, because the people always look towards it. What is done in it is propagated around the world. So, if what is done in it is good, then good will spread about and if the opposite is the case, then evil will spread.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory that Makkah be kept pure always and for this reason, He, the Majestic and Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَعَهِدْنَا إِلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ أَن طَهِّرَا بَيْتِيَ لِلطَّائِفِينَ وَالْعَاكِفِينَ وَالرُّكَّعِ السُّجُودِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We enjoined Ibraaheem and Ismaa`eel that they should purify My House for those people who make <em>tawwaaf</em>, and those who stay there for worship and those who bow and prostrate</strong>.</span>» [2:125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory that Makkah be purified from everything that conflicts with <em>Islaam</em>, so that the religion can emanate from it and the call to the East and Western parts of the Earth, because Allaah sent His Prophet in it and he began his call <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> remained in Makkah for thirteen years; from them were ten years in which he called to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and forbade from <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> (only) and he was not commanded with anything other than that. He was not commanded with the prayer nor with the <em>zakaat</em> nor with fasting nor with <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> (the Pilgrimage). Rather his call was restricted to warning against <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and to commanding <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would say to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>Say that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, you will be successful!</strong>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they would say:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَجَعَلَ الْآلِهَةَ إِلَٰهًا وَاحِدًا ۖ إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَشَيْءٌ عُجَابٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Does he make all the objects of worship a single object of worship? Indeed this is something very strange!</strong></span>» [38:5]</p>

<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>He lived for sixty-three years: forty before Prophet-hood and twenty-three as a Prophet and Messenger. He was sent as a Prophet through </strong>[the revelation of]<strong> &#8220;<em>Iqra</em>&#8220;</strong></span>  <sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">58</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">58</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was born in Makkah <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam </em>and breastfed amongst the tribe of Banoo Sa`d with <strong><u>H</u>aleemah as-Sa`diyyah</strong>. His father, `<strong>Abdullaah</strong>, died whilst he was still in the womb and his mother died a short time after his birth. So he was taken care of by <strong>Umm Ayman al-<u>H</u>abashiyyah</strong> whom he inherited from his father. He came to be under the guardianship of his grandfather, `<strong>Abdul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib</strong>, then `Abdul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib died and his guardianship moved to his paternal uncle, <strong>Aboo <u>T</u>aalib</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam </em>lived for forty years before prophet-hood being well-known for trustworthiness, truthfulness, generosity, for avoiding the worship of idols and avoiding the drinking of <em><u>kh</u>amar</em> (alcohol). He had not used to do what the people of the day of ignorance did, rather he<em> `alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam </em>used to go out to the cave of <u>H</u>iraa and worship in it for days at a time. He would worship Allaah upon the religious way of Ibraaheem upon <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>. Then, when he reached the age of forty  <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam</em>, the revelation came down upon him such that Jibreel came to him whilst he was in the cave of <u>H</u>iraa, and said to him: &#8220;Recite!&#8221; He said: &#8220;I cannot recite,&#8221; &#8211; meaning: I am not able to read. So he pressed him very tightly and then released him and said: &#8220;Recite!&#8221; He said: &#8220;I am not able to recite!&#8221; Then, he pressed him a second time and released him and said: &#8220;Recite!&#8221; He said: &#8220;I cannot recite!&#8221; So, he pressed for third time and  said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">اقْرَأْ بِاسْمِ رَبِّكَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ &#8211; خَلَقَ الْإِنسَانَ مِنْ عَلَقٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Recite! In the Name of your Lord Who created, who created man from a clot of blood</strong>.</span>» [96: 1-2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was his <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam </em>prophet-hood. Allaah made him a prophet through [the <em>aayah</em>] &#8220;<em>Iqra</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, he went to his house shaking from fear, because he had encountered something which he had not known before, an extremely frightening matter. So, he found his wife <u>Kh</u>adijah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu`anha</em>, and she covered him up and calmed him down. She said to him: &#8220;<strong>Know! By Allaah! Allaah will not humiliate you for indeed you maintain the ties of kinship, you show hospitality to the guest, you look after the orphans, and you help people who have been struck by calamities</strong>.&#8221; So, she prepared him and took him to her paternal uncle, Waraqah ibn Nawfal. He was a man who devoted himself to worship and who read the previous scriptures and who worshipped Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. When he informed him of what he had seen, he said: &#8220;This was the spirit who used to descend to Moosaa,&#8221; meaning: Jibreel <em>`alaihisalaam</em>.<strong> </strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Coming Down of the Revelation to him (<em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>)</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>He was sent as a Messenger with <em>al-Mudda<u>th</u>ir</em>. His land was Makkah and he made migration to al-Madeenah. Allaah sent him to warn against <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and to call to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>. The proof is His saying:</strong></span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الْمُدَّثِّرُ &#8211; قُمْ فَأَنذِرْ &#8211; وَرَبَّكَ فَكَبِّرْ &#8211; وَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ &#8211; وَالرُّجْزَ فَاهْجُرْ  &#8211; وَلَا تَمْنُن تَسْتَكْثِرُ &#8211; وَلِرَبِّكَ فَاصْبِرْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">«<strong>O you wrapped </strong>(in garments)<strong>! Arise and warn! And exalt your Lord! And purify your garments! And shun the idols! And do not give anything in order to receive more in return! And patiently persevere for the sake of your Lord!</strong>»</span> [74:1-7] <sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">59</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">59</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There came down to him, His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الْمُدَّثِّرُ &#8211; قُمْ فَأَنذِرْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you wrapped </strong>(in garments)<strong>! Arise and warn!</strong></span>» [74:1-2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was him being sent as a Messenger and this is the meaning of the saying of the <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>He was sent as a Prophet through [the revelation of] <em>Iqra</em>. and he was sent as a Messenger with <em>al-Mudda<u>th</u>ir</em></strong>.»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The difference between a prophet and a Messenger is that a prophet (<em>nabiyy</em>) is one to whom Allaah has revealed way, but he was not commanded to convey it, whereas a <em>rasool</em> (Messenger) is one to whom a revealed way was sent and he was commanded to convey it. The clarification of that is that the Messenger is one to whom a revealed law comes down and a book, so he (<em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>) was sent as a prophet through <em>Iqra.</em> and he was sent as a messenger through <em>al-Mudda<u>th</u>ir</em> at the age of forty. This was the case with the prophets. A prophet is sent with a revealed law and book from before him and he is entrusted with certain duties like the prophets of Banoo Israa`eel who came after Moosaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>al-Mudda<u>th</u>ir</em></strong></span>» means the one who is wrapped up, because he <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam </em>was struck by alarm, so he said: &#8220;Cover me up with garments! Cover me up with garments!&#8221; Meaning: Cover me up. Therefore, Allaah sent down to him:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الْمُدَّثِّرُ &#8211; قُمْ فَأَنذِرْ &#8211; وَرَبَّكَ فَكَبِّرْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you wrapped (in garments)! Arise and warn! And exalt your Lord!</strong></span>» [74:1-3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong>Meaning: Exalt and venerate Him.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And purify your garments!</strong></span>» [74:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Purify your deeds from <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>, because a person&#8217;s actions are garments. Allaah, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَىٰ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the clothing of dutifulness to Allaah, that is better</strong></span>.» [7:26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dutifulness is called clothing.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَالرُّجْزَ فَاهْجُرْ </span></h3>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>«And keep away from <em>Ar-Rujz</em> (the idols)! »</strong></span>[74:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>ar-Rujz</em></strong></span>» <em>ar-Rujz</em> (filth) means the idols.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Shun </strong>[the idols]</span>» meaning: abandon and keep well away from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah raised him as a Prophet at the age of forty and he remained in Makkah for thirteen years, calling the people to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and to the abandonment of the worship of idols. There were many discussions which he had with the people of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>. He suffered harm upon himself and upon those who believed in him and his followers. The people of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> caused many difficulties throughout the thirteen years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Three years before the migration, he was taken on the Night Journey to Jerusalem. He was taken up through the heavens and the five daily prayers were made obligatory upon him. So, he prayed in Makkah for three years. Then, the Quray<u>sh</u> plotted to kill and attack him, so Allaah permitted him to migrate to al-Madeenah. So, he migrated to al-Madeenah after he had met with the An<u>s</u>aar in the first and second pledge of al-`Aqabah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He migrated to al-Madeenah and remained there for ten years. So, altogether, it was twenty-three years [of prophet-hood]. After the prophet-hood, he <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam </em>lived twenty-three years, thirteen years in Makkah laying the foundations of the call to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, and for ten years in al-Madeenah. Then, Allaah took his soul at the age of sixty-three years. So, his life-span in Messenger-ship was twenty-three years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This blessing which Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, sent down upon him, this abundant knowledge, this <em>jihaad</em>, and this establishment which He granted him upon the earth was all in this short time of twenty-three years. This is one of the signs of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, and from the blessings given to the prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>, the blessings of his call and the blessings of the revelation which was sent down to him. And before all of this, it came about through the aid of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. He is the One who helped him. He is the One who defended him and aided him until he conveyed His call to the East and the West. All praise is for Allaah, the Lord of the whole of creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying: «<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allaah sent him to warn against <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and to call to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em></strong></span>» This is his call <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>, warning against <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>. And this is what is obligatory for the <em>du`aat</em> (callers) to precede upon in their call, that they should focus upon warning against <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> before everything, otherwise their call will not be upon the <em>manhaj</em> (methodology) of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah sent the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> with warning against <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, so it is essential to lay this foundation down first of all. After that, the person can direct his attention to the rest of the matters, since matters will not be correct and sound except with the presence of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>. If all of the people were to abandon <em>zinaa</em> (fornication), intoxicants, stealing, and they took on every virtuous quality from deeds and behavior, but did not abandon <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>, there would be no benefit in these matters and it will not benefit them. Whereas, if the people were to remain free of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>, but had major sins less than <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>, then there is hope for such a person that Allaah will either forgive him or punish him in accordance with the level of his sins. But his final destination will be to Paradise because he is a person of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>.<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> is the fundamental basis and foundation. There is no salvation except with the presence of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> firstly. Therefore, it is obligatory to concentrate and always give attention to it and to call the people to it and to teach it to the people and to explain it to them, what is the meaning of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and what is the meaning of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>. The Muslim must be aware of this matter and attain certainty concerning it. He should check himself so that he does not fall into anything from <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> or infringe <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>. This matter is essential and the <em>da`wah</em> must proceed upon this basis.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The meaning of «<strong>Arise and warn</strong>!» is to warn against <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and call to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>. «<strong>And exalt your Lord</strong>!» meaning: venerate Him with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>. «<strong>And purify your garments</strong>!» meaning: purify your deeds from <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>. «<strong>And shun <em>ar-rujz</em></strong>» <em>ar-rujz</em> means the idols and «<strong>shunning</strong>» meaning: abandoning them and disassociating from them and their people.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Third Fundamental Principle:<br />
Knowledge About Our Prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad &#8211;<em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam<br />
</em><strong>His Name, His Lineage, and His Early Life </strong></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الأصل الثالث : معرفة نبيكم محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The third fundamental principle: Knowledge about your Prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em></span></strong>.<sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">56</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">56</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying: «<strong>The third fundamental principle</strong>» meaning: from the three fundamental principles, because the <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) has mentioned at the start of the treatise that it is obligatory upon every Muslim male and female to have knowledge of these three fundamental principles, and they are: knowledge of Allaah, knowledge of the religion of <em>Islaam</em>, and knowledge about His Prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> with the evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the first and second fundamental principles, then a clarification of them has preceded and an explanation of their evidences.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third fundamental principle</strong>: It is knowledge about the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>, because of the fact that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> is an intermediary between Allaah and His creation with regard to conveying His Religion and His Message. Therefore, it is obligatory to know about him, <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam</em>.  Otherwise, how could you follow a person whom you do not know of?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, you must know about him with regard to his name, the land he was born and grew up in, the land to which he migrated and that you know the extent of his lifespan <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam</em>. And the phases of his life, <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam</em> and the phases of the time period which he was sent in this world. That you also know what occurred before Prophet-hood and after it and before the migration, and after it. That you know how the revelation first came to him, <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam</em> and when the revelation began, and what is the <em>aayah</em> which proves his Prophet-hood and the <em>aayah</em> which proves His Messenger-ship. That you can quote the <em>aayahs </em>which prove His Prophet-hood and the <em>aayahs </em>which prove His Messenger-ship. You must know this; that you know his lineage and which tribe he was from, because the Arabs are made of tribes and he was an Arab without any doubt. So, knowledge of these matters is essential about the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> through studying the <em>aayahs</em> and the <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> which are connected to these matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you look into the life of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alayhi wa sallam</em> and his call, in order that you should know these matters about your Prophet whom you are commanded to follow and take as an example.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">This is his name and lineage. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>His name is Mu<u>h</u>ammad</strong> </span><em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam</em>. He has other names besides Mu<u>h</u>ammad. However, the most famous one of his names is Mu<u>h</u>ammad and Allaah mentioned that in the Qur.aan in a number of <em>aayahs</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah</strong></span>» [48:29]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And Mu<u>h</u>ammad is not except a Messenger, Messengers have passed away before him</strong></span>.» [3:144]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَّا كَانَ مُحَمَّدٌ أَبَا أَحَدٍ مِّن رِّجَالِكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Mu<u>h</u>ammad is not the father of any of your men</strong></span>.» [33:40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And those who have <em>eemaan </em></strong>(truly believe)<strong> and perform righteous deeds, and believe in that which was sent down upon Mu<u>h</u>ammad </strong>(<em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>)<strong>, for it is the truth from their Lord</strong></span>.» [40:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah mentioned his name Mu<u>h</u>ammad in a number of <em>aayaahs</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">From his names is A<u>h</u>mad</span></strong>. Allaah mentioned in His saying regarding the glad tidings given by al-Masee<u>h</u> <em>`alaihissalaam</em>:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِذْ قَالَ عِيسَى ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ يَا بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ إِنِّي رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُم مُّصَدِّقًا لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيَّ مِنَ التَّوْرَاةِ وَمُبَشِّرًا بِرَسُولٍ يَأْتِي مِن بَعْدِي اسْمُهُ أَحْمَدُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And remember when `Eesaa ibn Maryam, said: &#8220;O Children of Israa.eel! I am Allaah&#8217;s Messenger to you confirming what came before me from the <em>Tauraat</em>, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger who will come after me, whose name will be A<u>h</u>mad</strong></span>.» [61:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, he is Mu<u>h</u>ammad and A<u>h</u>mad. The meaning of that is one abundant in praise, `<em>alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wa salaam</em>, and abundant in attributes for which he is to be praised.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>From his names are: the Prophet of Mercy (نبي الرحمة), the Prophet of Great War (نبي الملحمة)</strong></span> &#8211; meaning <em>jihaad</em> in Allaah&#8217;s Cause &#8211; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>the one after whom the people will be resurrected (الحاشر)</strong></span>, and <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>the final Prophet (والعاقب)</strong></span>, <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam</em>. The one who is such that the people will be resurrected after his being sent as a Prophet, because he is the last of the Messengers, <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. So, there is nothing after him except for the establishment of the Hour. After his Messenger-ship, the Hour will be established and the people will be resurrected for recompensing and accounting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever wants to get knowledge of these matters (Names and Meanings) , let him refer back to the Book <em>Jalaa.ul-Afhaam fee a<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>alaati was-Salaam `alaa <u>Kh</u>ayril-Anaam</em> of the <em>Imaam</em> Ibnul-Qayyim (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As for his lineage:</strong></span> He is Mu<u>h</u>ammad, the son of `Abdullaah, the son of `Abdul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib, the son of Haa<u>sh</u>im, the son of `Abdul-Manaaf, the son of Qusay, the son of Kilaab.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was from the tribe of Quray<u>sh</u> which is the noblest of the tribes, and Quray<u>sh</u> are from the descendants of Ismaa`eel <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabs are of two categories upon the most famous saying:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The original Arabs: They were the descendants of <strong>Qah<u>t</u>aan</strong>.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The assimilated Arabs: They were the descendants of `<strong>Adnaan</strong> from the descendants of Ismaa`eel `<em>alaihissalaam</em>, the son of Ibraaheem, <em>al-<u>Kh</u>aleel</em>,<em> `alaihissalaam</em>. They were called <em>al-Musta`rabah</em> (the assimilated Arabs) because they learned the Arabic language from the original Arabs.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the tribe of <em>Jurhum</em> came and settled in Makkah beside Haajir, the mother of Ismaa`eel and her son Ismaa`eel whilst he was young &#8211; when they found the well of <em>Zamzam</em>, they settled there and made an agreement with Haajir that they should settle beside her and that she should permit them to take water from the well. Ismaa`eel <em>`alaihissalaam </em>was a suckling infant at that time, then he grew older and took the Arabic language from the tribe of Jurhum, and they were from the original Arabs. He married from the tribe of Jurhum and descendants came from him who learnt the Arabic language. They grew up with the Arabs and became Arabs themselves by assimilation. They are the descendants of `Adnaan. As for the original Arabs, then they are the descendants of Qah<u>t</u>aan whose origin was from Yemen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the scholars said: The original Arabs themselves were of two categories: Arabs who became extinct and Arabs who remained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabs who became extinct were the ones who were destroyed. They were the people of Noo<u>h</u>, `Aad, and <u>Th</u>amood, and <u>Sh</u>u`ayb.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the remaining Arabs, then they are those who are divided into the original Arabs and the assimilated Arabs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> was from the descendants of Haa<u>sh</u>im (the tribe of Haa<u>sh</u>im), and Haa<u>sh</u>im was from the descendants of Ismaa`eel, <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wa salaam</em>. His name was Mu<u>h</u>ammad, the son of `Abdullaah, the son of `Abdul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And [regarding] `Abdul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib, this was not his name, his name was <u>Sh</u>aybah. However, he was called `Abdul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib because his paternal uncle, al-Mu<u>tt</u>alib, the son of Manaaf, brought him from al-Madeenah whilst he was little from his maternal uncles, Banoo an-Najaar. So, when the people saw him being dark from travelling, they thought he was a slave owned by al-Mu<u>tt</u>alib. So, they said: `Abdul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib (the slave of Mu<u>tt</u>alib), the son of Haa<u>sh</u>im, the son of `Abdul-Manaaf. `Abdul-Manaaf had four sons: Haa<u>sh</u>im who was the grandfather of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>, al-Mu<u>tt</u>alib, `Abd-<u>Sh</u>ams, and Nawfal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Banoo Haa<u>sh</u>im are called the <em>Haa<u>sh</u>imiyyoon</em> and Banoo Mu<u>tt</u>alib are called the <em>Mu<u>tt</u>allibiyyoon</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for  `Abd-<u> Sh</u>ams, then from them was `U<u>th</u>maan &#8211;<em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu `anh</em> and Banoo `Umay-yah. They were all from `Abd-<u> Sh</u>ams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Nawfal, he had descendents, from them: Jubayr bin Mut`im and <u>H</u>akeem ibn <u>H</u>izaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibraaheem <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam </em>had Ismaa`eel and he was the eldest. He is the grandfather of the Arab descendants of `Adnaan. And Is<u>h</u>aaq is the grandfather of the children of Israa.eel, and all of the Prophets were from the descendants of Is<u>h</u>aaq, except for our Prophet <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam</em>, he was from the descendants of Ismaa`eel, he was the final prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As for his birth:</strong> </span>He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> was born in the year of the elephant. It is the year when Abrahah, the King of Yemen came towards Makkah. He was sent on a mission by the (christian) King of the Abyssinians to demolish the <em>Ka`bah</em>. With him, there was a very large elephant, so when he reached the place which is called <em>al-Mu<u>gh</u>amas</em>, nothing remained except for him to enter Makkah and demolish the <em>Ka`bah</em>. The people of Makkah had already separated and climbed into the mountains because they had no strength to oppose him. So, he wanted to go on to the <em>Ka`bah</em>, but the elephant was held back and it refused to get up from the ground. Allaah held it back. When he turned it in the direction other than the direction of Makkah, it would get up and trod. And when he pointed it in the direction of Makkah, it was prevented and unable to walk, and whilst they were in that condition, they saw two flocks of birds coming from the direction of the ocean and they had with them stones. Each bird had two stones with it, a stone in its beak and a stone between its feet. They threw these little stones down and they would strike the head of the man and it would come out from his anus and split him in two halves. So, Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, destroyed him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah sent down, with regard to that, reminding the Quray<u>sh</u>, <em>Sooratul-Feel</em>:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَمْ تَرَ كَيْفَ فَعَلَ رَبُّكَ بِأَصْحَابِ الْفِيلِ &#8211; أَلَمْ يَجْعَلْ كَيْدَهُمْ فِي تَضْلِيلٍ &#8211; وَأَرْسَلَ عَلَيْهِمْ طَيْرًا أَبَابِيلَ &#8211; تَرْمِيهِم بِحِجَارَةٍ مِّن سِجِّيلٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do you not see how your Lord dealt with the Companions of the Elephant? Did He not make their plan go astray? And He sent against them birds, in flocks, striking them with stones of clay</strong></span>.» [105:1-4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[The stones were] from Hell, and Allaah&#8217;s refuge is sought.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَجَعَلَهُمْ كَعَصْفٍ مَّأْكُولٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So He made them like straws of corn devoured</strong>.</span>» [105:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They became like dry straw which have been eaten by animals and excreted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the story of the elephant, so Allaah defended His Sacred House and destroyed this tyrant Abrahah, and in this year, Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> was born. There appeared along with his birth signs; light appeared along with him which caused the castles of <u>Sh</u>aam to shine. In the night of his birth, the idols shook. The throne room of <em>Kisraa</em> (the emperor of Persians) shook and some balconies from it fell down in the night the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> was born. These were signs of the descending of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> as a Prophet. The devils were thrown into commotion in that tremendous night.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was born in the mountain-pass of `Alee, he was born in Makkah (close to the Ka&#8217;bah) . However, the precise location of the house is not confirmed.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Third Level is <em>al-I<u>h</u>saan</em></strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Definition of <em>I<u>h</u>saan</em></strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">:المرتبة الثالثة : الإحسان ، ركن واحد ، وهو </span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">&#8221; <span style="color:#993300;">أن تعبد الله كأنك تراه ، فإن لم تكن تراه فإنه يراك</span>&#8220;</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The third level is <em>al-i<u>h</u>saan</em>. It is a single pillar and it is: «That you worship Allaah as if you were seeing Him, and even though you do not see Him, He certainly sees you.»</strong></span><span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>46</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">46</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-I<u>h</u>saan</em> in the language means to <strong>perfect</strong> something and <strong>complete</strong> it. It is derived from <span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>al-<u>h</u>usun</em></strong></span> which means <span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>al-jamaal</em> </strong></span>(beauty), the opposite of ugliness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is divided into (three) <strong><span style="color:#993300;">categories</span></strong>:<strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Firstly</strong>: <em>Al-I<u>h</u>saan (</em>Perfection) of what lies between the servant and his Lord. This is what is meant (in this book here).<strong> </strong></li>
<li><strong>Secondly</strong>: <em>Al-I<u>h</u>saan </em>(Perfection) of what is between the servant and the rest of the people.<strong> </strong></li>
<li><strong>Thirdly</strong>: Doing well and perfecting what you do. When a person makes something or does an action, then it is obligatory upon him that he perfects it and does it completely.<strong> </strong></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong><span style="color:#993300;">[1] I<u>h</u>saan (perfection) of what lies between the servant and his Lord</span></strong></h3>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first type</strong> is <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em> (perfection) of what lies between the servant and his Lord. The Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> explained it when Jibreel asked him in the presence of the companions as will follow. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">«<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>I<u>h</u>saan </em>is that you worship Allaah as if you were seeing Him,<br />
and even though you do not see Him, He certainly sees you</strong></span>.»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em> between the servant and his Lord is his perfecting the action which Allaah has made a duty upon him, that he does it correctly, purely and sincerely for the Face of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, an action in which there is <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em> between the servant and his Lord is that which is done sincerely for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and done with the following of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Al- i<u>h</u>saan is of two levels :</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> made clear that <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em> is of two levels, one of them being higher than the other:<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The first level</strong></span> is that you worship Allaah as if you were seeing Him such that your certainty and <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah reaches such a level that it is as if you are actually seeing Allaah with your eyes. You have no hesitancy or doubt, rather it is as if Allaah is in front of you, He the Perfect and Most High, and you are seeing Him openly. Whoever reaches this level has reached the limit of <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em>. You worship Allaah as if you are seeing Him on account of the completeness of certainty and sincerity, which is as if you are seeing Allaah with your eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, will not be seen in this world, rather He will only be seen in the Hereafter. However, you see Him with your heart to the extent that it is as if you are seeing Him with your eyes. Therefore, He will reward the people of <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em> in the Hereafter that they will see Him, He the Perfect and Most High. This is since they used to worship Him as if they were seeing Him in this world. So, Allaah rewards them by giving them the opportunity to see Him with their eyes in the abode of bliss. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُوا الْحُسْنَىٰ وَزِيَادَةٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>For the people of <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em> there will be the best reward of Paradise and something extra</strong></span>.» [10:26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Something extra is looking upon the Face of Allaah. The reason is that they perfected their deeds in this world, so Allaah gave them the best reward which is Paradise. And He will give them an increase which is seeing Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. So therefore, you worship Allaah as if you are actually witnessing Him, upon love and longing to meet Him, He the Perfect and Most High. You feel delight in obedience to Him and you feel calm and obedience to Him, He the Perfect and Most High. You eagerly desire obedience to Him. This is the path of the people of <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em>.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The second level</strong>:</span> If you do not reach this tremendous level (first level), then you worship Him upon the path of <span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>al-muraqabah</em></strong></span> (watchfulness) such that you know that Allaah sees you, knows your condition, and knows what lies within yourself. Therefore, it is not befitting that you should disobey Him and contradict His command when He sees and observes you. This is a good state, however, it is less than the first one. So, as long as you know that He sees you, then you therefore perfect your worship of Him and you do it well, because you know that Allaah is seeing you. And for Allaah is the Highest example. If you were in front of a created being who had status and he commanded you with a command, and you were carrying this matter out in front of him and he was looking at you, would it be befitting that you be negligent in the performance of this action?<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So in summary, <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em> is of two levels</strong>:<strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The level of witnessing with the heart</strong>: It is that you worship Allaah as if you are seeing Him from the strength of certainty and <em>eemaan</em>. It is as you are seeing Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, with your eyes.<strong> </strong></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second level</strong>: It is that you worship Allaah knowing that He sees you and observes you, therefore, you do not disobey Him and contradict His command, He the Perfect and Most High.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the level of <em>al-i<u>h</u>saan</em> and it is highest of the levels of the religion. Whoever reaches it has reached the highest of the levels of the religion. Before it is the level of <em>eemaan</em>, and before that is the level of <em>al-Islaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The <em>deen</em> has a number of domains</strong>:<strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first domain</strong>: <em>al-Islaam</em>. It is wide to such an extent that the hypocrite enters within it and is called a Muslim and is treated like a Muslim, because he has submitted to <em>Islaam</em> outwardly. So therefore, he enters within the domain of <em>Islaam</em>. And the person who is weak in <em>eemaan</em> [enters the domain of <em>Islaam</em>], but he has nothing from <em>eemaan</em> except a mustard seed of it.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second domain</strong>: It is more restricted and more specific &#8211; the domain of <em>al-eemaan</em>. The hypocrite in belief does not enter into it whatsoever. Rather, only the people of <em>eemaan</em> enter into it, and they are two categories: those who are complete in <em>eemaan</em> and those who are deficient in <em>eemaan</em>. So, the sinful believer and dutiful believer both enter into it.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third domain</strong>: It is more restricted than the second one &#8211; the domain of <em>al-i<u>h</u>saan</em>. It just as the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> made clear. No one will enter into it except the people of complete <em>eemaan</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Evidence for <em>al-I<u>h</u>saan</em></strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ مَعَ الَّذِينَ اتَّقَوا وَّالَّذِينَ هُم مُّحْسِنُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah is with those who fear Him and are dutiful to Him; and He is with those who are people of <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em></strong></span>.» [16:128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى الْعَزِيزِ الرَّحِيمِ </span><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِي يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَتَقَلُّبَكَ فِي السَّاجِدِينَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And place your reliance upon the All-Mighty, the Bestower of Mercy. He who sees you when you stand to pray. And who sees your movements along with those who pray along with you. Indeed! He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing</strong></span>.» [26:217-220]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا تَكُونُ فِي شَأْنٍ وَمَا تَتْلُو مِنْهُ مِن قُرْآنٍ وَلَا تَعْمَلُونَ مِنْ عَمَلٍ إِلَّا كُنَّا عَلَيْكُمْ شُهُودًا إِذْ تُفِيضُونَ فِيهِ ۚ وَمَا يَعْزُبُ عَن رَّبِّكَ مِن مِّثْقَالِ ذَرَّةٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا فِي السَّمَاءِ وَلَا أَصْغَرَ مِن ذَٰلِكَ وَلَا أَكْبَرَ إِلَّا فِي كِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">«<strong>And you are not </strong>(O Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>)<strong> engaged in any matter nor do you recite the Book of Allaah, &#8211; nor do you do any action </strong>(O people)<strong>, except that We are witness in your deeds when you do them. And not even that which is of the weight of the tiniest ant is hidden from your Lord on the earth or in the heavens. Nor is there anything smaller than that or greater than it except that it is written in a Clear Book</strong>.»</span> [10:61] <sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">47</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">47</span>] : <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan’s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the proof for the first level of <em>al-i<u>h</u>saan</em>:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ مَعَ الَّذِينَ اتَّقَوا وَّالَّذِينَ هُم مُّحْسِنُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah is with those who fear Him and are dutiful to Him, and He is with those who are people of <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em></strong></span>.» [16:128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>aayah</em> proves that Allaah is with the people of <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em>. They are those who worship Allaah as if they were seeing Him, so Allaah is with them in a specific sense of <em>Ma`iyyah</em> (Allah being with creation) &#8211; the <em>Ma`iyyah</em> with regard to aiding, helping, and <em>tawfeeq</em> (guiding them to and granting them attainment of correctness).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى الْعَزِيزِ الرَّحِيمِ </span><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِي يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَتَقَلُّبَكَ فِي السَّاجِدِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And place your reliance upon the All-Mighty, the Bestower of Mercy. He who sees you when you stand to pray. And who sees your movements along with those who pray along with you</strong>.</span>» [26:217-219]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a proof for the second level. This is a proof for his saying [<em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>]: «<strong>Then, He certainly sees you</strong>.»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>And place your reliance</strong>» Meaning: trust your affairs «<strong>to the All-Mighty, the Bestower of Mercy</strong>» He is Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>When you stand to pray</strong>» You stand for worship and the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>And who sees your movements along with those who pray along with you</strong>» He sees you whilst you are performing your <em>rukoo`</em> (bowing) and whilst you are performing your <em>sajdah</em> (prostration). He sees you in all the states of worship; standing, bowing, and prostrating. He, the Perfect and Most High, sees you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Indeed! He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing</strong>» The One who hears your sayings. The One who knows your sayings, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا تَكُونُ فِي شَأْنٍ وَمَا تَتْلُو مِنْهُ مِن قُرْآنٍ وَلَا تَعْمَلُونَ مِنْ عَمَلٍ إِلَّا كُنَّا عَلَيْكُمْ شُهُودًا إِذْ تُفِيضُونَ فِيهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And you </strong>(O Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>) <strong>are not </strong><strong>engaged in any matter nor do you recite the Book of Allaah, &#8211; nor do you do any action </strong>(O people)<strong>, except that We are witness in your deeds when you do them</strong></span>.» [10:61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a proof for the second level.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>And you </strong>(O Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>)<strong> are not </strong><strong>engaged in any matter</strong>» This is an address to the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>. In any affair from your affairs, from the affairs of worship or other than it &#8211; all of your actions and your movements &#8211; you will not be engaged in any affair at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Nor do you recite from it</strong> (i.e. Book of Allaah)» Meaning: from Allaah, because the Qur`aan is from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. Or the pronoun could refer back to the affair, so the meaning would be: From the affairs which you are engaged in is recitation of the Qur`aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Nor do you do </strong>(O people)» This is [an address] for all of the nation, for the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and other than him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Any action</strong>» Meaning: Any action from the actions, whether good or bad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Except that We are witness </strong>[in your deeds]» We are seeing you, observing you, and witnessing you. This is a proof for his saying <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>: «<strong>Then indeed, He sees you</strong>.»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>When you do them</strong>» You are carrying it out and you are doing it. So, this gives a proof for the second level from the levels of <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em>, in that He, the Majestic and Most High, witnesses the action of every doer of an action. He, the Perfect and Most High, sees him, knows him, and observes him. Nothing is hidden from him.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَخْفَىٰ عَلَيْهِ شَيْءٌ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا فِي السَّمَاءِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Nothing whatsoever in the earth or in the heavens is hidden from Allaah</strong></span>.» [3:5]</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong><span style="color:#993300;">[2] Ihsaan between the person and rest of the creation</span></strong></h3>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em> between the servant and the creation, then its meaning is: doing good to them and withholding from harming them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such that you feed the hungry person, cloth the person without clothing, assist the needy person with your position, and that you intercede for the one who needs to be interceded for. You do that which is good with all the different aspects of good. You are hospitable to the guest and you are generous towards the neighbor. Nothing but good emanates from you towards the neighbor, and you withhold harming him. So, no harm comes from you towards him or towards anyone else.</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">From the people, there are who are such that nothing but harm comes from them, and</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">From the people there are those whom harm and good comes. And</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">From the people, there are those whom nothing but good comes from them. <strong>This is the highest of the levels</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Doing good towards the people and withholding harm from them is <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em> (good and fine treatment) towards the people:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَحْسِنُوا ۛ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُحْسِنِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do good. Allaah loves <em>al-Mu<u>h</u>sineen </em></strong>(the doers of good)</span>.» [2:195]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even towards the animals, it is obligatory that you treat them well and make available for them whatever they need and that you withhold harming them and that you are gentle with them. This is from <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em> towards the animals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even a person who is going to be rightfully executed, you should not torture him, rather, you should execute him in a fine and tranquil manner. A person who is obligatory to execute, and someone it is obligatory to carry a <em><u>h</u>add</em> (prescribed punishment) upon, then it is carried out upon him with gentleness. There is to be no mutilation, no torture, and no beating to death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">»إن الله كتب الإحسان على كل شيء ، فإذا قتلتم فأحسنوا القتلة ، وإذا ذبحتم فأحسنوا الذبح«</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Allaah has obligated <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em> with regard to everything. So, when you kill, then kill in a fine manner. And when you slaughter an animal, then slaughter in a good manner</strong>.»</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Reported by Muslim no. 1955 as a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of <u>Sh</u>addaad bin Aws, <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu `anhu</em>.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, [the principle of <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em> applies] to execution or other than it from that which necessitates prescribed punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>When you slaughter</strong>» Meaning: when you slaughter animals which are to be eaten, then slaughter in a fine manner:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">» وليحد  أحدكم شفرته ، وليرح ذبيحته «</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Let one of you sharpen his knife and give relief to the animal which he is slaughtering</strong>.»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, you are to treat with <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em> even the animals. Allaah forgave the prostitute woman from the People of Israaeel on account that she gave a drink of water to a dog which had its tongue hanging out from thirst. So, she gave it water to drink and Allaah thanked her for that and forgave her, her sin.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> This is a tremendous sin and it is prostitution, meaning: <em>zinaa</em> (fornication). But Allaah forgave her on account of that &#8211; because she treated the thirsty animal in a fine manner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how about something other than a dog? If you were to treat a hungry person from the Muslims with <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em>, or from the descendants of Aadam, even if he is a disbeliever &#8211; if you were to treat him well, then Allaah, the Majestic and Most High will thank you for that fine treatment. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَحْسِنُوا ۛ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُحْسِنِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do good. Allaah loves <em>al-Mu<u>h</u>sineen </em></strong>(the doers of good).</span>» [2:195]</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong><span style="color:#993300;">[3] Ihsaan (Perfection) of the Action</span></strong></h3>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third type</strong>: It is perfection of the action. Whatever action you do, it is obligatory that you perfect it and not so that it should be said: &#8220;So-and-so has done such-and-such very well.&#8221; There occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">» إن الله يحب إذا عمل أحدكم عملا أن يتقنه «</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Allaah loves that one when one of you does an action that he perfects it</strong>.»</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Reported by al-Bayhaqee in <em><u>Sh</u>u`ab al-Eemaan</em> 4/334 no. 5313 and no. 5314 from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Aa.i<u>sh</u>ah, <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu `anha</em>. [Declared <em><u>h</u>asan</em> (good) by <em><u>Sh</u>ai<u>kh</u></em> al-Albaanee in <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> <em>al-Jaami`</em>. He spoke about it in <em>Silsilatul-A<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u> a<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> no. 1113].</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second Level is <em>Eemaan</em> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">المرتبة الثانية : الإيمان : وهو بضع وسبعون شعبة ، فأعلاها قول : لا إله إلا الله ، وأدناها إماطة الأذى عن الطريق ، والحياء شعبة من الإيمان </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second level is <em>al-Eemaan </em></strong>(true faith)<strong> and it has seventy and odd branches, its highest of them is the saying of &#8220;<em>Laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>&#8221; and the lowest of them is removal of that which is harmful from the path; and <em>al-<u>h</u>ayaa</em></strong> (a sense of shame)<strong> is a branch of <em>eemaan</em></strong></span>.<sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">42</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">42</span>] : <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Eemaan</em> is more inclusive than Islaam, so every believer is a Muslim, but not every Muslim is a believer. So <em>eemaan</em> is more inclusive with respect to itself, and it is more specific with regard to its people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Eemaan</em> in the language is <strong><em>at-tasdeeq</em></strong> (to believe, to attest with the heart).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High, said upon the tongue of the brothers of Yoosuf:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> وَمَا أَنتَ بِمُؤْمِنٍ لَّنَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>you won&#8217;t believe us.</strong></span> (12:17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for [the meaning of] <em>eemaan</em> in the legislation, then it is as explained by the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> and <em>Jamaa`ah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Speech of the tongue, belief of the heart, and action of the limbs.<br />
It increases with obedience, and it decreases through sin.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is with this explanation, a reality relating to the legislation, because realities are three: a reality which relates to the language, a reality with regards to the legislation, and a reality relating to people&#8217;s custom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the explanation of <em>eemaan</em> with this explanation is a reality relating to the legislation. So, <em>eemaan</em> moves from the meaning in language to the meaning in Islaamic legislation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, <em>eemaan</em> is: speech upon the tongue &#8211; there has to be speech and acknowledgment with the tongue. And it is belief in the heart, when a person speaks upon his tongue, he must be believing it in his heart, otherwise he will be just like the hypocrites, those who:<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> يَقُولُونَ بِأَلْسِنَتِهِم مَّا لَيْسَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They say with their tongues that which is not in their hearts. </strong></span>[48:11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And speech upon the tongue, and belief in the heart will not suffice, rather there must be action on the limbs also, and carrying out the obligatory duties is essential, and avoiding the prohibitions. So the person does the acts of obedience and he avoids the forbidden acts, all of this is from <em>eemaan</em>. <strong>With this definition, it comprises the whole of the religion</strong>. However, these acts of obedience and these many legislated duties, some of them are a part of the reality of <em>eemaan</em>, and some of them are things which are a completion of <em>eemaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>Eemaan</em> has pillars and branches</strong></span>, and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> explained them in two <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>. He explained the <em>arkaan</em> (pillars) of <em>eemaan</em> in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Jibreel, and he explained the branches of <em>eemaan</em> in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of «<strong><em>Eemaan</em> is seventy and odd branches</strong>». This will follow <em>in shaa&#8217; Allaah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Eemaan</em> and <em>Islaam</em>, if they are mentioned together, then each of them has its own meaning. When only one of them is mentioned, then it enters along with the other. If they are mentioned together, then Islaam is explained to be the outward actions, and they are the five pillars of Islaam, and e<em>emaan</em> is explained to be the inward actions which are the six pillars, and their places are in the heart. All of these must be found together in a Muslim. The Muslim must be one who has <em>eemaan</em> and who establishes the pillars of Islaam and the pillars of <em>eemaan</em> &#8211; he must gather all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">»الإيمان بضع وسبعون شعبة ، أو بضع وستون شعبة«</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong><em>Eemaan</em> is of seventy and odd branches, or sixty and odd branches</strong>.» There are two narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[Reported by al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree (9) with the wording «sixty and odd» and Muslim (35) with both wordings from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>i Allaahu `anhu</em>.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying «<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>odd</strong></span>»: it is a number between three and nine. So if it is said: «ten and odd,» then it means a number between thirteen until nineteen, and if it is said «odd» on its own, then it means something between three and nine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying «<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>branches</strong></span>»: a branch is a part of the thing, meaning that the pillars have seventy and odd parts or sections.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying «<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>the highest one of them</strong></span>»: meaning: the highest of the branches is the saying <em>Laa ilaaha illaAllaah</em>.  It is the head of Islaam and it is the head of <em>eemaan</em>, it is the first pillar, and it is the entry point of the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying «<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>the lowest one of them</strong></span>»: meaning: the last of them and the least one of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying «<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>removing that which is harmful from the path</strong></span>»: meaning: removing that which is harmful from the path which is walked upon. And «<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>that which is harmful</strong></span>» is everything which causes harm to the people, whether it be thorns, rocks, filthy things or refuse, everything which causes harm to people upon their path. And placing that which is harmful upon their path is forbidden, because the path is for those who wish to precede upon it, and harm impedes those who want to proceed, or puts them in danger, such as stopping his car upon the road, this is from causing harm &#8211; and letting water flow out from the house unto the path, this is from harm &#8211; and putting rubbish upon the pathway, this is from causing harm, whether it be upon the road, the town, or in the countryside &#8211; placing a rock, pieces of timber, iron upon the pathways of the people, digging holes in the roads of the people &#8211; all of this is from causing harm. So if a Muslim comes and removes this harm, and clears the path of it, then this is a proof for his <em>eemaan</em>. So, placing that which is harmful upon the path is from the branches of <em>kufr</em>, and removing harm from the path is from the branches of <em>eemaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying «<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>al-<u>h</u>ayaa</em> (true sense of shame is a branch of <em>eemaan</em>)</strong></span>»: <em>al-<u>h</u>ayaa</em> is a characteristic which Allaah places in a person which leads him to carry out whatever will beautify and adorn him; and which prevents him from things which will contaminate and disfigure him. And <em>al-<u>h</u>ayaa</em> which leads a person to perform that which is good, and to withhold from that which is evil is praiseworthy. As for shame or shyness which prevents a person from doing something good, from seeking knowledge, and from asking about things which are a problem to his understanding, then this is blameworthy shyness. This is because it is blameworthy embarrassment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the pillars of <em>eemaan</em> are many as you have come to know there are seventy and odd. <em>Al-Imaam</em> al-Bayhaqee wrote a large work in which he mentioned the branches of <em>eemaan</em>, it has an abridgment which has been printed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the proofs of the scholars that <em>eemaan</em> is speech upon the tongue, belief in the heart and action on the limbs is his saying <em><u>s</u>allallaahu `alaihi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">» أعلاها لا إله إلا الله «</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">« <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The highest of them is none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah</strong></span>. » This is a proof for sayings. And his saying <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">» أدناها إماطة الأذى عن الطريق «</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">« <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And removal of that which is harmful from the path </strong></span>» is an action. It proves that actions are from <em>eemaan</em>. And his saying <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">» الحياء شعبة من الإيمان «</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">« <span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>al-<u>h</u>ayaa</em> is a branch from <em>eemaan </em></strong></span>.» This is something in the heart, <em>al-<u>h</u>ayaa</em> is in the heart. This is a proof that <em>eemaan</em> is sayings upon the tongue, belief in the heart, and actions upon the limbs.</p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Proof for the testification that &#8216;Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah&#8217; is His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ عَزِيزٌ عَلَيْهِ مَا عَنِتُّمْ حَرِيصٌ عَلَيْكُم بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There has indeed come to you a Messenger from Allaah from amongst yourselves; it grieves him that you undergo suffering. He is eager and anxious for your guidance and he is full of compassion and mercy for the believers. </strong></span>[9:128]<strong> </strong><span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>37</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">37</span>] : <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first pillar of the pillars of Islaam is composed of two matters:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first:</strong> The testification <em>Laa ilaaha illaAllaah</em> (none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah).</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second: </strong>The testification &#8216;<em>Mu<u>h</u>ammadan rasoolullaah</em>&#8216; (Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah).</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these two are a single pillar. The first part means making ones worship purely and sincerely. And the second part means following the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof for the testification that &#8216;Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah&#8217; is His saying: <em> </em></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ عَزِيزٌ عَلَيْهِ مَا عَنِتُّمْ حَرِيصٌ عَلَيْكُم بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There has indeed come to you a Messenger from Allaah from amongst yourselves; it grieves him that you undergo suffering. He is eager and anxious for your guidance and he is full of compassion and mercy for the believers. </strong></span>[9:128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proofs for the testification that &#8216;Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah&#8217; are many in the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, as well as the amazing miracles which prove his <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>&#8216;s Messenger-ship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the Book is this <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ عَزِيزٌ عَلَيْهِ مَا عَنِتُّمْ حَرِيصٌ عَلَيْكُم بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There has indeed come to you a Messenger from Allaah from amongst yourselves; it grieves him that you undergo suffering. He is eager and anxious for your guidance and he is full of compassion and mercy for the believers. </strong></span>[9:128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a witness from Allaah for this Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>, for his Messenger-ship and it is an description of his characteristics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There has indeed come to you.</span> </strong>[9:128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>&#8216;Laam&#8217;</em> is a <em>Laam</em> to indicate an oath. So therefore, it carries along with it an oath which is understood (in the meaning) and is taken to be <em>wallaahi</em> (by Allaah) &#8216;there has certainly come to you.&#8217;</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قَدْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">is a particle for confirmation and emphasis.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">جَاءَكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He has come to you.</strong></span> [9:128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Mankind! This is an address to the whole of mankind, because his <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>&#8216;s Messenger-ship was general to all of the <em>thaqalayn</em> (two species), mankind and <em>jinn</em>.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">رَسُولٌ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">A Messenger</span>. </strong>[9:128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was one who had a revealed law sent to him by revelation and he was commanded to convey it. He was called a Messenger because he was <em>mursal</em> (sent) with a Message by Allaah the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>From your own selves. </strong></span>[9:128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From your own species and your own type, from human-kind. He was not an angel from the angels. And this was the Way of Allaah the Perfect and Most High &#8211; that He would send to mankind, Messengers from them, in order to make their affair clear and in order for them to speak with them and because they would know them. If He had sent, as a Messenger to them, an angel, they would have not been able to speak with him because he would have not been from their type of being. Also, they would have not be able to see the angel, because he would have not been from their type of being. So from His Mercy, He the Perfect and Most High, is that He sent as a Messenger to mankind a Messenger from their own type. Indeed he was from the Arabs, and from the most noble of the houses of the Arabs in lineage, from the tribe of Baanee Haashim, who are the most honorable in lineage of Quraysh, and Quraysh are the most honorable of the Arabs in lineage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, he was the specially chosen from the best of people. They knew him and they knew of his personality, his lineage, tribe, and his town. If they had not known him, then how could they attest to his truthfulness? And if he came with other than their language, then how could they understand his speech?</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">عَزِيزٌ عَلَيْهِ مَا عَنِتُّمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">It grieves him greatly that you should suffer</span>. </strong>[9:128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">عَزِيزٌ عَلَيْهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: It troubled him <em><u>s</u>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam</em>.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا عَنِتُّمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Whatever troubles you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Inconvenience and hardship. The Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam</em> was troubled by whatever caused trouble to his nation. He had not used to want hardship for them. Rather, he wanted ease and easiness. And therefore, his revealed law <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>came as something easy and easy-going.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>, said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">بعثت بالحنيفية السمحة</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>I was sent with the Straight and true religion; the religion of ease.</strong>[<span style="color:#999999;">1] [2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[1] Ahmad (5/266). </span><span style="color:#999999;">[2] Reported by Ahmad 23/623 (22291) from the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of Abu Umaamah Al-Baahilee, <em>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>. [Shaikh Al-Albaanee declared this <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> as strong in <em>As-Sa<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah </em>no. 2924]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِي الدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And He did not place upon you any hardship in the religion</span>. </strong>[22:78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ لِيَجْعَلَ عَلَيْكُم مِّنْ حَرَجٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah does not wish to place any hardship upon you</span>. </strong>[5:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His revealed Way is easy, it goes along with the capability of the people and with what those given duties, are able to do, and it does not burden them with things they are not capable of. Therefore, the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> used to love to make things easy for them. He was never given a choice between two matters except that he chose the easiest one of the two as long as it was not sinful. He used to love to perform an action but he would leave it out of compassion for his Nation. He would leave the action even though he loved it, from the righteous deeds in order that he should not put difficulty upon his nation. These were from his characteristics, that whatever caused difficulty for his nation was a difficulty he felt himself, and he would become pleased with whatever was pleasing to them, and he would be joyful with whatever caused them to be joyful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever has these as his characteristics, then there is no doubt that he will not bring except that which is <em>khayr</em> (good) and <em>Ra<u>h</u>mah</em> (mercy), <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">حَرِيصٌ عَلَيْكُم</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">He is eager and anxious for you</span>. </strong>[9:128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: For your guidance and that you are taken out from the darkness into the light. Therefore, he himself bore difficulty in calling the people, seeking that they should be guided, and seeking to take them out from darkness into light to such an extent that Allaah said to him:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَعَلَّكَ بَاخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ أَلَّا يَكُونُوا مُؤْمِنِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Perhaps you will destroy yourself with grief that they are not believing. </strong></span>[26:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Perhaps you would bring about your own destruction that they do not believe, because of grief. So do not grieve for them. And this was from the completeness of his sincerity, <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em>.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">He was compassionate and merciful towards the believers.</span> </strong>[9:128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: <em>ra’oof </em>is from<em> ra&#8217;fah</em> (compassion), and it means tenderness and kindness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: He described him with <em>Ra<u>h</u>mah</em> (mercy), so he was not harsh.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَبِمَا رَحْمَةٍ مِّنَ اللَّهِ لِنتَ لَهُمْ ۖ وَلَوْ كُنتَ فَظًّا غَلِيظَ الْقَلْبِ لَانفَضُّوا مِنْ حَوْلِكَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So by mercy from Allaah you were gentle with them, and if you had been severe and hard-hearted, they would have dispersed from around you</span>. </strong>[3:159]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He  <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> was humble and gentle with the believers, he would lower his wing in gentleness, and he would meet them with a smiling face, and love, affection, and fine treatment. These were from his  <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> characteristics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah mentioned five attributes for this Messenger  <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: He was from amongst you.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: He was troubled by whatever troubled you.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: He was eager and anxious for you.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth</strong>: He was compassionate towards the believers.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifth</strong>: He was merciful.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Five characteristics from the characteristics of this Prophet  <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em>. And compassion and mercy were mentioned specifically for the believers since he  <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em><em> </em>was stern upon the people of <em>shirk</em> and the obstinate and willful rejecters of the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would become angry for that which angered Allaah the Perfect and Most High, just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ جَاهِدِ الْكُفَّارَ وَالْمُنَافِقِينَ وَاغْلُظْ عَلَيْهِمْ ۚ وَمَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ ۖ وَبِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O Prophet! Strive against the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and be stern against them. And their dwelling place will be the Hell-Fire, what an evil destination! </strong></span>[9:73]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The mercy and compassion was specific for the believers. Likewise the believers are to be the same with each other.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مُّحَمَّدٌ رَّسُولُ اللَّهِ ۚ وَالَّذِينَ مَعَهُ أَشِدَّاءُ عَلَى الْكُفَّارِ رُحَمَاءُ بَيْنَهُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah and those who are with him are stern against the unbelievers, merciful amongst themselves</span>. </strong>[48:29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These were his <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> characteristics.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ومعناها لا معبودَ بحقٍّ إلا اللهُ وحده؛ (لا إله) نافيًا جميعَ مَا يُعْبدُ مِنْ دونِ اللهِ (إلا الله) مُثْبِتًا العبادةَ له وحدَهُ لا شريكَ لهُ في عبادتِهِ، كما أنَّه ليس له شريك في مُلْكِه</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And its meaning is none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah; <em>laa ilaaha</em> </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(nothing has the right to be worshipped)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> is a negation of everything which is worshipped besides Allaah. <em>Illallaah</em> </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(except Allaah) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">affirms worship for Allaah Alone, and that none is given any share of worship along with Him, just as He has no sharer in His Sovereignty</span>.</strong><span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>34</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">34</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong><span style="color:#000000;">And its meaning is none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah</span></strong>”: the meaning of <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> is not as is said by the people of falsehood: “there is no creator and there is no provider except Allaah”, because this is <em>taw<u>h</u>eed-ur-Ruboobiyyah</em> (<em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of Lordship), the people of <em>shirk</em> agreed to that, but they would not say <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا إِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ </span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَيَقُولُونَ أَئِنَّا لَتَارِكُو آلِهَتِنَا لِشَاعِرٍ مَّجْنُونٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>When it was said to them, “<em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>” </strong>(none has the right to be worshipped but Allaah)<strong>, they became proud, and they say, “are we to abandon worshipping our gods for a crazy poet?”</strong></span> [37:35-36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“Aalihatinaa”</em> means: those things which we worship.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> لِشَاعِرٍ مَّجْنُونٍ ..</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>… in favour of a crazy poet?” </strong></span>[37:35-36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They meant the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam, </em>they described him with poetry and madness, because he had said to them, “Say: <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>”, and he forbade them from the worship of idols.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when he said to them, “Say: <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>”, they said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَجَعَلَ الْآلِهَةَ إِلَٰهًا وَاحِدًا ۖ إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَشَيْءٌ عُجَابٌ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Has he made all of the objects of worship a single One to be worshipped? This is something very strange </strong></span>[38:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They thought that there were many gods to be worshipped.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore this shows that its meaning is – nothing truly deserves worship except Allaah. Whereas if its meaning were – there is no creator and there is provider except Allaah – then they agreed to that, and they did not question it. So if that were its meaning they would not have refused to say <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>, because they used to say when they were asked, “Who created the heavens and the earth?”, they used to say, “Allaah”. And when they were asked, “Who creates? Who gives provision? Who gives life and gives death and who controls the earth?”, they used to say , “Allaah”. They acknowledged this. So if that were the meaning of <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah </em>then they would have consented to it. However its meaning is, “None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you were to say, “<strong>Nothing is worshipped except Allaah</strong>”, this would be a great error, because then all the objects of worship would be Allaah, High and Exalted is Allaah above this. Rather if you restrict it and you say, “<strong><em>bihaqq</em></strong>” (nothing is deservedly worshipped), then all the objects of worship are negated except Allaah the Perfect and Most High. You must therefore say, None has the right to be worshipped truly, meaning none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah. Then he explained that in accordance with the wording of the saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>laa ilaaha</em></strong>: is a negation, it negates the right to worship from everything besides Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>illAllaah</em></strong>: this is affirmation of worship for Allaah alone with no partner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> includes negation and affirmation, and <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> has to have negation and affirmation both. Affirmation alone will not suffice; and negation would not suffice on its own. There must be negation and affirmation, just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِالطَّاغُوتِ وَيُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So whoever rejects the false objects of worship, and truly believes in and worships Allaah</span> </strong>[2:256]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And worship Allaah and do not associate anything in worship along with Him </strong></span>[4:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you say, “Allaah is One who deserves worship”, this will not suffice, because <em>Al-Laat</em> is one who was worshipped, and <em>Al-‘Uzza</em> is one who was worshipped, and <em>Manaat</em> was an object of worship, all of the idols were called gods, or objects of worship. So therefore you must say, “<em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>”, none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah – there must be combination between negation and affirmation so that therefore <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> is actualized and <em>shirk</em> is negated.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">: وتفسيرها الذي يوضحها قوله تعالى</span></h3>
<p>And its explanation which will make it clear is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ لِأَبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ إِنَّنِي بَرَاءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِلَّا الَّذِي فَطَرَنِي فَإِنَّهُ سَيَهْدِينِ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَاقِيَةً فِي عَقِبِهِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And remember when Ibraaheem said to his father and to his people &#8220;I am totally free of everything that you worship except for the One who created me, for He will guide me&#8221;. And Allaah made it a saying to persist amongst his progeny so that they might remember and return to obedience to their Lord.</strong></span> [43:26-28] <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>35</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">35</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The best thing to explain the Qur&#8217;aan is the Qur&#8217;aan. So <em>la</em><em>a ilaaha illAllaah</em> has been explained by Allaah in the Qur&#8217;aan, and that is in the saying of His <em>Khaleel</em>, His specially chosen One (Ibraheem <em>&#8216;alaihi</em><em><u>s</u></em><em>alaatu wassalaam</em>), in that which Allaah mentioned from him:<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> إِنَّنِي بَرَاءٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>I am totally free </strong></span>[43:26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is negation; it has the same meaning of <em>laa ilaaha</em> (none has the right to be worshipped):<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِلَّا الَّذِي فَطَرَنِي</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Except for the One who created me </strong></span>[43:27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: except for Allaah. This is affirmation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this <em>aayah</em> is a complete and full explanation of the meaning of <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ يَا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ تَعَالَوْا إِلَىٰ كَلِمَةٍ سَوَاءٍ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمْ أَلَّا نَعْبُدَ إِلَّا اللَّهَ وَلَا نُشْرِكَ بِهِ شَيْئًا وَلَا يَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُنَا بَعْضًا أَرْبَابًا مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ ۚ فَإِن تَوَلَّوْا فَقُولُوا اشْهَدُوا بِأَنَّا مُسْلِمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say : O people of the Scripture, come to a word of justice between us that we will single out Allaah with all worship and will not worship anything else besides Him, nor will we take one another as lords besides Allaah. Then if they turn away then say bear witness that we are Muslims submitting to Allaah and making our worship purely and sincerely for him.</span> </strong>[3:64]<strong> </strong><span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>36</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">36</span>]  <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ يَا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ تَعَالَوْا إِلَىٰ كَلِمَةٍ سَوَاءٍ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمْ أَلَّا نَعْبُدَ إِلَّا اللَّهَ وَلَا نُشْرِكَ بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say: O people of the Scripture, come to a word of justice between us that we will single out Allaah with all worship and will not worship anything else besides Him.</span> </strong>[3:64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>aayah</em> from <em>Soorah Aal-i-&#8216;Imraan</em> came down with regard to the deputation of Najraan, the Christians who came to the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> and debated him and asked him questions, and a long conversation occurred between them and him. They were Christians from the Christians of the Arabs. And in the end, the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> requested from them <em>Al-Mubaahala</em> (calling down Allaah’s curses upon whoever was lying):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> فَقُلْ تَعَالَوْا نَدْعُ أَبْنَاءَنَا وَأَبْنَاءَكُمْ وَنِسَاءَنَا وَنِسَاءَكُمْ وَأَنفُسَنَا وَأَنفُسَكُمْ ثُمَّ نَبْتَهِلْ فَنَجْعَل لَّعْنَتَ اللَّهِ عَلَى الْكَاذِبِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then say: Come, let us call our children and your children, our womenfolk and your womenfolk, ourselves and yourselves &#8211; then let us invoke and call down Allaah&#8217;s Curse upon the liars. </strong></span>[3:61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when he requested <em>al-Mubaahalah</em> (calling down curses upon the liars), they feared and they did not engage in calling down the curses along with him, <em>&#8216;alaihi</em><em><u>s</u></em><em>alaatu wassalaam</em>. Rather, they handed over the <em>Jizyah</em> because they knew that they were upon falsehood, and that he was the Messenger of Allaah, <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">نبتهل</span>:</strong> Meaning, let us call the curse down upon the liar from us. They knew that they were the ones who were the liars, and if they had engaged in calling down curses, fire would have descended upon them and consumed them in their places. Therefore they said no, we won&#8217;t do so &#8211; rather, we will hand over the <em>Jizyah</em> (special tax) and we will not engage in calling Allaah&#8217;s curses down upon the liars. So the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> accepted the payment of <em>Jizyah </em>from them.  And it had become clear to them that Allaah had indeed commanded him with what was contained in this <em>aayah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>aayah</em> contains the meaning of <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> (none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah). His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> أَلَّا نَعْبُدَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>That we will not worship </strong></span>[3:64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a negation. And His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> إِلَّا اللَّهَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Except Allaah</span>. </strong>[3:62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is affirmation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is the <em>&#8216;Adl</em> (justice) for which the heavens and the earth are established. So the heavens and the earth are established upon <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> (singling out Allaah with all worship) and upon <em>al-&#8216;Adl</em>. So we do not associate anything in worship along with Him, neither with the Messiah, whom they claim is a lord and whom they worship besides Allaah, nor anyone besides the Messiah, not even Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em>&#8216;alaihi</em><em><u>s</u></em><em>alaatu wassalaam</em>, and not any one from the Prophets, not anyone from the righteous, nor anyone from the <em>awliyaa</em> (beloved servants of Allaah):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَّا نَعْبُدَ إِلَّا اللَّهَ وَلَا نُشْرِكَ بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>That we will not worship except Allaah, and we will not associate anything at all with Him. </strong></span>[3:64]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَا يَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُنَا بَعْضًا أَرْبَابًا مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And we will not take one another as lords besides Allaah.</span> </strong>[3:64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Just as you (i.e. the people of the Book) have taken the Rabbis and monks as lords besides Allaah the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">اتَّخَذُوا أَحْبَارَهُمْ وَرُهْبَانَهُمْ أَرْبَابًا مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ وَالْمَسِيحَ ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ وَمَا أُمِرُوا إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُوا إِلَٰهًا وَاحِدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They took their rabbis and their monks as lords besides Allaah and </strong>(they)<strong> also </strong>(took as their Lord)<strong> the Messiah, son of Maryam, and they were not commanded except that they should worship a single God. </strong></span>[9:31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The taking of rabbis and monks as lords besides Allaah is something which Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> explained as being their obedience to them in declaring lawful that which Allaah has made forbidden and making forbidden that which Allaah had made lawful.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> This is the meaning of their taking them as lords besides Allaah, since they used to declare lawful that which Allaah has made forbidden, and  declare forbidden which Allaah has made lawful. So the people obeying them upon that is taking them as Lords. This is because the One who legislates for the people and declares things to be lawful and forbidden for the people is Allaah the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَإِن تَوَلَّوْا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So, if they turn away. </strong></span>[3:64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: (They) do not accept the call to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَقُولُوا اشْهَدُوا بِأَنَّا مُسْلِمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then say: Bear witness that we are Muslims </strong>(obedient to Allaah, worshiping Him alone)<strong>. </strong></span>[3:64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They call them to bear witness that they were <em>muwa</em><em><u>h</u></em><em>iduun</em> (people of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>) and that they were <em>kuffaar</em> (unbelievers).  So they made clear to them the falsity of what they were upon. And this <em>aayah</em> shows <em>Al-Baraa&#8217;a</em> (freeing oneself) from the religion of the people of <em>shirk</em> and it clearly states &#8220;(We) bear witness that we are Muslims.&#8221; This contains the obligation of clearly announcing the falsity of what the people of <em>shirk</em> are upon and not remaining silent about it, and of clearly announcing the falsity of <em>shirk</em> and of refuting its people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">In summary:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> (none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah) has<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> two pillars</strong></span>, and they are:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>An-Nafee</em></strong></span> (negation) and</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Al-Ithbaat</em> </span></strong>(affirmation).</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if it is said to you: What are the pillars of <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>? Then say, negation and affirmation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Its conditions are seven</strong></span>, and it (saying the <em>shahadah</em>) will not benefit except with these conditions; someone has written them in a line of poetry and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Knowledge, certainty, purity and sincerity and your being truthful </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>                             Along with love, compliance, and acceptance of them</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>1.Knowledge</strong></span>: Its opposite is ignorance, so the person who says <em>Laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> with his tongue, but is ignorant of its meaning, then <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> will not benefit him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">2.Certainty</span></strong>: Such that he does not have any doubt. This is because some people may know its meaning, however, they have a doubt about it, so his knowledge is not correct. He must have certainty of <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> and that it is true.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">3.Purity and Sincerity:</span></strong> Its opposite is <em>ash-Shirk</em>. Some people say <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>, but they do not abandon <em>shirk</em> as is presently the case today with the worshippers of the graves. Those people will not be benefited by (saying) <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> because from its conditions is abandoning <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">4.Being truthful:</span></strong> Its opposite is falsehood and lying. This is because the <em>munaafiquun</em> say <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>, but they are liars in their hearts; they do not believe its meaning. Allaah the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا جَاءَكَ الْمُنَافِقُونَ قَالُوا نَشْهَدُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُ اللَّهِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُهُ وَاللَّهُ يَشْهَدُ إِنَّ الْمُنَافِقِينَ لَكَاذِبُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">اتَّخَذُوا أَيْمَانَهُمْ جُنَّةً</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>When the hypocrites come to you, they say: &#8220;We bear witness that you are the Messenger of Allaah indeed.&#8221; But Allaah knows that you are indeed His Messenger, and Allaah bears witness that the hypocrites are liars. They take their oaths as a shield to screen them. </strong></span>[63:1-2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>5.Love</strong></span>: That the person loves this saying and is an ally to its people. As for the person who does not love it or does not love its people, then it will not benefit him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>6.Compliance</strong></span>: It is the opposite of turning away from it and abandoning it, and it is complying with what it (this saying) indicates with regard to worshipping Allaah Alone and not associating anything with Him, and it is complying with His commands. Since you have acknowledged and have borne witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah Alone, then it becomes binding upon you to comply with His rulings and His religion. As for your saying <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>, and you do not comply with His legislations, then <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> will not benefit you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">7.Acceptance</span></strong>: Acceptance which negates <em>Ar-Rad</em> (rejection) &#8211; such that you do not reject anything from the rights of <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> and whatever it indicates. Rather, you accept everything which <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> indicates and you accept it correctly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And an eighth condition is added:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>And the eighth is added; rejecting whatever things are </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>worshipped besides the One who is truly worshipped</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">8</span></strong>.<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Freeing oneself from </strong></span><em><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>shirk</strong></span>.</em> So a person will not be a <em>muwa</em><em><u>h</u></em><em>id</em> (a person of <em>taw</em><em><u>h</u></em><em>eed</em>) until he frees himself from <em>shirk</em>.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ لِأَبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ إِنَّنِي بَرَاءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And when Ibraaheem said to his father and his people: I am totally free of whatever you worship</span>.</strong> [43:26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the conditions of <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> &#8211; eight conditions.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Refer to the <u>h</u>adeeth of &#8216;Alee ibn Haatim <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu</em> that was reported by At-Tirmidhee (3095). In it Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;They did not used to directly worship them, but rather, when they </strong>(priests or monks)<strong> declared something lawful for them, they </strong>(the people) <strong>would then declare it lawful. And when they declared something forbidden for them, they would take it as being forbidden.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Shaikh Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> declared this <u>h</u>adeeth as <em><u>h</u>asan</em> (good)].</p>

<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>



<p>So the proof for the <em>shahaadah</em> (testification) is:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;">شَهِدَ اللَّهُ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ وَأُولُو الْعِلْمِ قَائِمًا بِالْقِسْطِ ۚ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ</span></h3>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah bears witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Him; and likewise the Angels and the people of knowledge bear witness. He Who maintains justice, none has the right to be worshipped but Him, the All-Mighty the All-Wise </strong></span>[3:18]<span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>33</sup></span></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">33</span>]:<strong>&nbsp;Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">His saying, He the Most High, &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He testified</strong></span>&#8220;: meaning He judged and He decreed and He informed and He made clear and He made it binding.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">So bearing witness from Allaah revolves around these five meanings: judging and decreeing and and informing and clarifying and making binding. So the meaning of, &#8220;He testified&#8221;, is He the Perfect and Most High decreed it upon His servants and He calls them to know of it and He informed them and He made it binding upon them that none has the right to be worshipped except Him.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">“<strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>laa ilaaha</em></span></strong>”, (none had the right to be worshipped): this is a negating ‘<em>laa’</em> which negates everything which is worshipped besides Allaah</p>



<p>“<strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>illaahu</em></span></strong>”, (except for Him): this affirms worship for Allaah alone.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And the meaning of, &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>annahu laailaaha illaahu</em></strong></span>”, (none has the right to be worshipped but him): it means there is nothing that is worshipped rightfully except&nbsp; Allaah the Perfect and Most High. As for those who are worshipped besides Allaah, then worship of it is false because of His saying He the Most High:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;">ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْحَقُّ وَأَنَّ مَا يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ هُوَ الْبَاطِلُ وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْكَبِيرُ</span></h3>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>That is because Allaah, He is the true God deserving all worship and those whom they call upon besides Him are futile and false and Allaah He is the Most High the Most Great </strong></span>[22:62]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">He the Perfect and Most High testifies to His unity and the right to all worship and He is the most truthful One Who speaks and His bearing witness He the Perfect and Most High is the truest testification there can be because it comes from One Who is All-Wise, All-Aware, All-Knowing, he knows everything so therefore it is a testification which is true.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the Angels</strong></span>&#8220;: they testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Him and they are a species of beings whom Allaah created to worship Him. They are honourable Angels, honoured servants, Allaah created them to worship Him. They declare His perfection night and day, and they never slacken. And also Allaah created them to carry out His commands in the creation, He entrusted them with implementing whatever He commanded, He the Perfect and Most High, from the affairs of the creation. So every Angel from them is entrusted with a duty. And their testification is a true testification, because they are people of knowledge, and of ‘<em>ibaadah</em> (worship) and of <em>ma‘rifah</em> (awareness) of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. And they are from the most excellent of the creation, along with the point of disagreement which is are the righteous humans more excellent than the Angels, or are the Angels more excellent than the righteous humans there being disagreement about that point.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the people of knowledge</strong></span>”: they are of two categories: the Angels, and the second category are the Possessors of Knowledge from mankind. And the Possessors of Knowledge do not testify except with something that is true, contrary to the case with those who are ignorant people, for their testification is not counted. And every species from the creation of Allaah bears witness for Allaah of His Unity and that none has the right to be worshipped but Him. And this is a case of showing the honour and nobility of the people of knowledge since Allaah joined their testification along with His testification, He the Perfect and Most High, and with the testification of His Angels. He counted the testification of the people of knowledge from the creation, and this shows their excellence and their nobility and their status, and they are testifying to the greatest matter that can be testified to, and it is <em>at-Taw<u>h</u>eed</em>.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And what is meant by the Possessors of Knowledge – are the people of knowledge of the Legislation (i.e. Islamic knowledge), not as is said by some people that people of knowledge means the people of industry and agriculture, so those people, it is not said about them that they are People of Knowledge unrestrictedly, because their knowledge is limited in scope and is restricted, rather it is to be said, “this person is knowledgeable about arithmetic, this person is knowledgeable about engineering, this person is knowledgeable about medicine”, but it is not said about them that they are the People of Knowledge unrestrictedly. Because this term is not used unrestrictedly except for the people who have Islamic knowledge. And also most of those people are people who have only worldly knowledge, and amongst them are atheists whose knowledge mostly only increases them in ignorance concerning Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and in self delusion and in atheism as you can see today in the disbelieving nations, that they are advanced with regards to industries and with regards to agriculture, however they are disbelievers. So how could it be said that they are the People of Knowledge, those whom Allaah has mentioned in His saying, “and the Possessors of Knowledge”. This is not at all feasible.</p>



<p>And likewise His saying:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّمَا يَخْشَى اللَّهَ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ الْعُلَمَاءُ</span></h3>



<p><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>It is only those who have Knowledge amongst His slaves that fear Allaah </strong></span>[35:28]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">What is meant is the scholars of Islamic knowledge, those who truly know Allaah and who truly worship Him and who fear Him. As for those people, then most of them do not fear Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. Rather they disbelieve in Allaah and deny Him, and they claim that the world has no Lord and that rather nature brought it about and controls it, as is the case with the communists – they reject the Lord, the Perfect and Most High, even though they have worldly knowledge. So how then could we say – those people, they are the People of Knowledge? This is an error. So the term ‘Knowledge’ is not applied unrestrictedly except to its true people, and it is a noble title which cannot be applied to atheists and disbelievers, such that it is said, “they are the people of Knowledge”.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">So the Angels and the possessors of Knowledge, they bear witness to Allaah’s Unity and sole right to worship. Therefore the saying of others besides them from the atheists and the people of <em>shirk</em> and the Sabeans, those who disbelieve in Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, is not counted. Those people, they are not counted, neither they nor their saying, because it is something contrary to the testification of Allaah and the testification of His Angels and the testification of those possessing knowledge from His Creation.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And His saying,<strong><span style="color:#000000;"> “<em>Qaa’imam bil-Qis<u>t</u></em>”</span></strong>, (maintaining justice): this phrase is in the accusative case indicating a state along with, ‘He bore witness’ – meaning whilst establishing justice, He the Perfect and Most High. And the word, “<em>al-Qis<u>t</u></em>”, means <em>al-‘adl</em> (justice) – meaning Allaah the Perfect and Most High establishes justice in everything, and <em>al-‘adl</em> (justice) is the opposite of <em>al-jawr</em> (injustice), and He the Perfect and Most High is a just judge, nothing but justice comes from Him in everything.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">“<strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Laa ilaaha illahu</em></span></strong>”, (none has the right to be worshipped but Him): this emphasizes the first sentence.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">“<strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Al-‘Azeez-ul-<u>H</u>akeem</em></span></strong>”, (the Almighty the All-Wise): these are two Names of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, comprising two Attributes from His Attributes, and they are <em>al-‘Izzah</em> (Might) and <em>al-<u>H</u>ikmah</em> (Wisdom).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second Fundamental Principle: Knowledge of the Religion of Islaam</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Definition of the Religion (Ad-Deen)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الأصلُ الثَّاني: معرفةُ دينِ الإسلامِ بالأدلةِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second fundamental principle: knowledge of the religion of Islaam with its proofs.</strong></span><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><sup>27</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">27</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh, having finished explaining knowledge of the first fundamental principle, which was knowledge of Allaah the Perfect and Most High, with the evidences, he now moves on to explaining the second fundamental principle, and it is knowledge of the religion of Islaam with the proofs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore he said, “<strong>The second fundamental principle: knowledge and awareness of the religion of Islaam with the proofs</strong>.” Then he mentioned its definition and he explained its meaning and then he mentioned its levels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, “<strong><span style="color:#000000;">knowledge of the <em>Deen</em> of Islaam</span></strong>”. <em>Ad-Deen</em> – it means obedience, for it is said about a person, <em>daana lahu</em>, when he obeys him with regard to what he commanded, and he abandons what he forbade.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the word <em>Ad-Deen</em> is used to mean <em>al-<u>H</u>isaab </em>(bringing to account or reckoning), just as occurs in His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Sovereign Owner of the Day of Reckoning </strong></span>[1:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is said, “daanahu”, meaning he brought him to account, just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الدِّينِ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ مَا أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الدِّينِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And what will cause you to understand what is the Day of the Reckoning? Then what will cause you to understand what is the Day of the Reckoning? </strong></span>[82:17-18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: the Day of the Reckoning.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَوْمَ لَا تَمْلِكُ نَفْسٌ لِّنَفْسٍ شَيْئًا ۖ وَالْأَمْرُ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">On the Day when no soul will possess any benefit for any other soul, and the whole affair on that Day will be for Allaah.</span> </strong>[82:19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>with the proofs</strong></span>”, meaning: knowledge of the religion of Islaam cannot be by way of blind following, or by way of conjecture from the person. The religion must be based upon proofs from the Book and the Sunnah. As for the person who does not know his religion, rather he just blindly follows the rest of the people and he is just a follower of whatever the rest of the people do, then this person does not know his religion as he should, and it is quite appropriate that when he is asked in the grave, that he should say:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">هاه ، هاه ، لا أدري ، سمعت الناس يقولون شي ئا فقلته</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Haa, Haa, I do not know. I heard the people saying something, so I said it.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[Reported by al-Bukhaaree (1338) and by Muslim (2870) in abridged form from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Anas <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaah ‘anhu</em>. The full version of the <u>h</u>adeeth is reported by Aboo Daawood (4753) from a <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/10/17/punishment-of-the-grave-the-hadeeth-of-al-baraa-bin-aazib/"><u>h</u>adeeth of al-Baraa’ ibn ‘Aazib </a><em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaah‘ anhu.</em>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory on a person that he should gain knowledge and awareness of his religion with the proofs from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>, and he will not know this except through learning.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وهو الاستسلامُ له بالتوحيدِ، والانقيادِ له بالطاعةِ، والبراءةُُ مِنَ الشِّركِ وأهلِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And it is to submit to Him with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and to yield to Him with obedience and to free oneself from <em>shirk</em> and its people</strong></span>.<span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>28</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">28</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Islaam is derived from, “<strong><em>aslama lish-shay</em></strong>”, meaning he submitted to it. As it is said in the language, “<em>aslama nafsahu lilqatl</em>”, (he submitted himself to being killed)”, meaning that he submitted to being killed. So a person did <em>islaam</em> of himself, means that he submitted to that thing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore Islaam is submitting one&#8217;s face and one&#8217;s purpose and resolve and one&#8217;s intention to Him, he the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ دِينًا مِّمَّنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لِلَّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ وَاتَّبَعَ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And who is better in religion than one who submits his face to Allaah and he is the doer of the good which Allaah legislated and he follows the religious way of Ibraaheem, upright and upon his way, turning away from shirk </strong></span>[4:125]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">بَلَىٰ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لِلَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Rather whoever submits his face to Allaah </strong></span>[2:112]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: he makes his deeds purely and sincerely for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and he yields to Allaah obediently and by choice and with desire and out of love.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Submitting to Allaah with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em></strong></span>”: and it is to single out Allaah the majestic and most high with worship, and this is the meaning of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>. So whoever worships Allaah alone without attributing a partner to Him, then he has indeed submitted to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong><span style="color:#000000;">And yielding to Him, He the Perfect with obedience</span></strong>&#8220;: regarding whatever He has commanded you with and whatever He has forbidden you from. So whatever He commanded you with then you do it and whatever He forbids you from then you avoid it, in obedience to Allaah the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>and freeing oneself from <em>shirk</em> and its people</strong></span>&#8220;: freeing oneself means cutting off from and separating from and being far removed from <em>shirk</em> and from the people of <em>shirk</em>, such that you believe the falsity of <em>shirk</em> and keep away from it. And you believe in the obligation of having enmity towards the people of <em>shirk</em> because they are enemies to Allaah, the mighty and majestic, so therefore you do not take them as beloved friends and allies, rather you take them as enemies because they are enemies to Allaah and to his Messenger and to His religion so therefore you do not have love for them and you do not have love and alliance with them rather you cut off from them with regard to the religion and you distance yourself from them and you believe in the falseness of what they are upon so therefore you do not love then with your heart and you do not aid them with your sayings and your actions, because they are enemies to your Lord, and enemies to your religion so how can you have love and alliance with them when they are enemies of Islaam?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not sufficient that you submit to Allaah and yield to him with obedience but do not free yourself from <em>shirk</em> and nor from the people of <em>shirk</em>, this will not suffice, you will not be counted as being a Muslim until you have these characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Firstly:</strong> submitting to Allaah with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>.</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Secondly:</strong> yielding to him with obedience</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Thirdly:</strong> freeing oneself from that which opposes <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and that which opposes obedience and it is <em>shirk</em>.</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Fourthly:</strong> freeing oneself from the people of <em>shirk</em>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By actualizing these characteristics you will be a Muslim, as for if you miss out on a single characteristic from them then you will not be a Muslim. So in these three words the Shaikh summarized the definition of Islaam and how many a person does not know the meaning of Islaam because he has not learned this thing, and if it were said to him, &#8220;<strong>What is Islaam?</strong>&#8220;, he will not give you a correct response.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Levels of the Religion</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وهو ثلاثُ مراتبَ: الإسلامُ، والإيمانُ، والإحسانُ<strong> </strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And it is of three levels: <em>Al-Islaam</em></strong>,</span><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>29</sup> </span><span style="color:#993300;"><em>Al-Eemaan</em> and </span></strong><em><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Al-I<u>h</u>saan</strong></span> </em><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><sup>30</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">29</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of levels is ascending levels because we have said Islaam is of three levels, some of them being higher than others. The first level from the levels of the religion is Islaam, then after it comes <em>eemaan</em>, then after it comes <em>i<u>h</u>saan. </em>So therefore Islaam is broader, and <em>eemaan</em> is something more restricted than Islaam, and <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em> is more restricted than <em>eemaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the sphere of Islaam is wide, the hypocrites, they enter within it if they outwardly comply with Islaam and they outwardly display it and they outwardly adhere to it. If they pray along with the Muslims and they give the <em>zakaat </em>and they do the outward actions, then they are called Muslims and the rulings of the Muslims apply upon them in this world, so they have whatever the Muslims have and upon them will be whatever is upon the Muslims. However in the Hereafter they will be in the lowest depths of the fire because they do not have <em>eemaan</em> rather they just have outward apparent Islaam only.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">30</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, &#8220;<em>Al-Eemaan</em>&#8220;: this is the second level, and the people who have <em>eemaan</em> they vary in their levels so from them are <strong><em>Al-Muqarraboon</em></strong> (those who draw especially close through good deeds), and from them are <strong><em>Al-Abraar</em> </strong>(the righteous ones). <em>Al-Muqarraboon</em> &#8211; they are the people of the highest of the levels, and <em>Al-Abraar</em> are lesser than them, and from them there are those who are the person who is one who wronged himself, and he is the one who commits major sins which are less than <em>shirk</em>. Then he is a sinful believer or he is a believer who is deficient in <em>eemaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ أَوْرَثْنَا الْكِتَابَ الَّذِينَ اصْطَفَيْنَا مِنْ عِبَادِنَا ۖ فَمِنْهُمْ ظَالِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِ وَمِنْهُم مُّقْتَصِدٌ وَمِنْهُمْ سَابِقٌ بِالْخَيْرَاتِ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ هُوَ الْفَضْلُ الْكَبِيرُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then we gave the Scripture as inheritance to those whom we chose from our servants. So from them are those who wrong themselves and from them are those who take a middle course and from them are those who are foremost upon good deeds by the permission of Allaah, and that is the great bounty </strong></span>[35:32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong><em>Al-I<u>h</u>saan</em></strong>”: this is the third level and it is <em>Al-I<u>h</u>saan, </em>and it is that the servant does well with regards to what is between him and Allaah, he does well in the worship of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> mentioned <em>Al-I<u>h</u>saan</em>:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;">الإحسان أن تعبد الله كأنك تراه ، فإن لم تكن تراه فإنه يراك</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“Al-I<u>h</u>saan </em></strong><strong>is that you worship Allaah as if you are seeing him and even though you do not see him then he certainly sees you&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[A part of the long hadeeth reported by al-Bukhaaree (50) and by Muslim (9 and 10) from a hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu</em>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: you have certain knowledge that Allaah sees you wherever you may be.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وكلُّ مرتبةٍ لها أركانٌ</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And every level has pillars.</span><span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>31</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">31</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#000000;">and every level has pillar</span>s</strong>&#8220;: pillars is the plural of a pillar, and it is that which something stands upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the pillars of something are its aspects which it stands upon, and it cannot stand without them, and they are within the thing itself, contrary to conditions, for they are outside the thing. For example the conditions of the prayer then they are outside the prayer and come before it. And as for the pillars of the prayer, then they are inside it such as the initial <em>takbeer </em>of the prayer and the recitation of al-Faati<u>h</u>ah, so if anything from them is missing, then the prayer will not be correct, just as if there was something missing from the pillars which hold up a building then it will not stand and will not be supported.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The pillars of Islaam</strong></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فأركانُ الإسلامِ خمسةٌ: شهادةُ أنْ لا إله إلاّ اللهُ، وأنَّ محمدًا رسولُ اللهِ، وإقامُ الصلاةِ، وإيتاءُ الزكاةِ، وصومُ رمضانَ، وحجُّ بيتِ اللهِ الحرامِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">So the pillars of Islaam are five, the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and establishing the prayer, and giving the zakaat and fasting Rama<u>d</u>aan and performing <u>H</u>ajj to Allaah’s sacred house</span></strong> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><sup>32</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">32</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islaam will not stand except with these pillars, if they are missing than Islaam will not be upright and the rest of the acts of obedience are matters of completion for these pillars. All the actions of obedience and all good deeds are all actions of completion of these pillars and therefore when Jibreel <em>‘alaihissalaam</em> asked Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam </em>in the presence of the Companions saying:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أخبرني عن الإسلام ، قال : الإسلام أن تشهد أن لا إله إلا الله وأن محمدا رسول الله ، وتقيم الصلاة ، وتؤتي الزكاة ، وتصوم رمضان ، وتحج البيت إن استطعت إليه سبيلا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Inform me about Islaam. He replied: Islaam is that you bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and that you establish the prayer and that you give the <em>zakaat</em> and that you fast Rama<u>d</u>aan and that you perform <u>H</u>ajj to the house if you are able to make your way to it&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he explained Islaam to be these five pillars, however the <u>h</u>adeeth of Ibn ‘Umar makes it clear that these five are the foundations of Islaam so he <em><u>s</u>allaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam </em>said:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>An-Nadhr</em></strong><strong> (Vows) and their Evidence</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof for vows:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يُوفُونَ بِالنَّذْرِ وَيَخَافُونَ يَوْمًا كَانَ شَرُّهُ مُسْتَطِيرًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>They fulfill their vows and they fear a Day whose evil will be widespread</b></span> [76:7] <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>26</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">26</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>An-Nadhr </em>(making a vow): it is that a person makes something binding upon himself which was not originally binding upon him in the legislation, such as his making a vow that he will perform a fast, or his making a vow that he will give such and such in charity – then it becomes binding upon him to carry out his vow, because of the saying of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">من نذر أن يطيع الله فليطعه</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<span style="color:#000000;">Whoever makes a vow that he will obey Allaah, then let him obey Him</span>”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[Reported by al-Bukhaaree (6696 &amp; 6700) from a <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of Aa’ishah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhaa</em>.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And making a vow is a type from the types of worship, it is not permissible to do it except for Allaah. So whoever makes a vow for a grave or for an idol or for other than that, then he has committed <em>shirk</em> with Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and it will be a vow of sin and shirk. And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ومن نذر أن يعصي الله فلا يعصه</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<span style="color:#000000;">And whoever makes a vow that he will commit an act of disobedience to Allaah, then let him not disobey Him</span>”.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof for sacrificing is His saying He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ إِنَّ صَلَاتِي وَنُسُكِي وَمَحْيَايَ وَمَمَاتِي لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: My prayer and my sacrificing and my living and my dying are all for Allaah alone, the Lord of the whole of creation </strong></span>[6:162]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the sunnah:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَعَنَ اللهُ مَنْ ذَبَحَ لِغَيْرِ الله</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah has cursed the one who sacrifices for other than Allaah.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>  <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>25</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">25</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>adh-Dhab<u>h</u></em> (sacrificing or slaughtering) is of four types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Firstly</span>:</strong> sacrificing which is done to seek closeness and to honour and venerate someone, and this is not permissible except for Allaah the Perfect and Most High, because it is an act of worship involving wealth. So therefore it is not permissible to sacrifice for the <em>jinn</em> nor for the devils nor for the kings nor for the leaders in order to show honour and veneration of them, because this is worship – it is not permissible except for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So those people who sacrifice for the jinn in order to gain safety from their evil, or in order for a sick person to be cured, as is done by the soothsayers and by the astrologers, those who claim to be able to heal or cure, and who say to the people, “if you sacrifice such and such in order to cure your sick person and do not mention the Name of Allaah upon it” – this is major shirk which takes a person outside of the religion and this is what Allaah the Most High has said in warning against doing it for other than Allaah:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ إِنَّ صَلَاتِي وَنُسُكِي وَمَحْيَايَ وَمَمَاتِي لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: My prayer and my sacrificing and my living and my dying are all for Allaah alone, the Lord of the whole of creation </strong></span>[6:162]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَصَلِّ لِرَبِّكَ وَانْحَرْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So pray for your Lord and sacrifice to Him</span> </strong>[108:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: make sacrifice for your Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The second type of sacrifice is: </strong></span>slaughtering an animal in order to obtain meat to eat. This, there is no harm in it, because it is not something slaughtered to draw closer to anyone or to venerate anyone, it is just being sacrificed for a need, and eating is from that; so this, there is no harm in it, because it is not a type of worship, and it can be slaughtered in order to sell the meat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The third type of sacrifice is: </strong></span>sacrificing which is done at times of joy and happiness, on the occasion of a marriage or on the occasion of settling in a new home or someone returning after an absence, or the like of that, by gathering one’s relatives and then performing a sacrifice in order to show one’s happiness and joy at what has occurred. This, there is no harm in it, because it does not contain veneration of anyone, and it is not seeking to draw closer to anyone, rather it is just a case of joy and happiness at something that has occurred.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Fourthly</span>:</strong> sacrificing in order to give meat away in charity for the poor people and the needy and the destitute, this is counted as being a sunnah, and it enters into worship.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Muslim (1978) from a <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of Alee ibn Abee Taalib <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu. </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Alee (<em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em>) said: Allaah’s Messenger (<em>salallaahu `alaihi wassallam</em>) narrated to me four words, saying:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah curses whoever slaughters to other than Allaah. </strong></span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Allaah curses whoever curses his parents. </strong></span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Allaah curses the one who shelters an innovator or wrongdoer. </strong></span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Allaah curses the one who alters the boundaries of a land.”</strong></span></li>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Proof for <em>al-Istighaathah</em> (seeking rescue and deliverance):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِذْ تَسْتَغِيثُونَ رَبَّكُمْ فَاسْتَجَابَ لَكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>Remember when you sought the aid and deliverance of your Lord, and He responded to you </b></span>[8:9]<b> </b><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>24</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">24</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Istighaathah </em>is a type of the types of worship, and it is seeking <span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>al-Ghauth</em></strong></span> (deliverance or rescue), and it does not occur except at times of adversity or great difficulty, when a person comes to be in a situation of adversity, then he seeks deliverance and rescue from Allaah and he seeks salvation from this adversity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And <em>al-Istighaathah </em>(seeking rescue and deliverance) is of two types:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first type is:</strong> <em>al-Istighaathah</em> (seeking rescue) from a created being, with regard to something that no-one is able to do except Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and this is <em>shirk</em>. So whoever seeks rescue and deliverance from other than Allaah, whether it be from a <em>jinn</em> or a human or those people who are absent or from the dead, then this is <em>shirk</em> along with Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. <span style="color:#ff0000;">So seeking rescue and deliverance through the dead and those who are absent from the devils and the <em>jinn</em>, this is <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>shirk</em></strong></span> along with Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second type is: </strong>seeking aid and rescue from a created being who is present and who is alive with regard to something he is able to do – this is permissible. He the Most High said in the story of Moosaa:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> فَاسْتَغَاثَهُ الَّذِي مِن شِيعَتِهِ عَلَى الَّذِي مِنْ عَدُوِّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So the man who was upon his religion</strong> (i.e. the religion of Moosaa)<strong> he called to him for assistance and rescue against the one who was an enemy </strong></span>[28:15]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Al-Isti‘aadhah</em></strong><strong> (Seeking Refuge) and its Proof</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof for <em>Al-Isti‘aadhah</em> (seeking refuge) is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ الْفَلَقِ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of the Dawn </strong></span>[113:1]<strong> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>22</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">22</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>Al-Isti‘aadhah</em>:</strong></span> means seeking refuge with someone who can defend you against something disagreeable which you fear in order that he should repel from you this thing. This is<em> al-Isti‘aadhah.</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>al-Isti‘aadhah</em> is a type from the types of worship. It is not permissible for you to seek refuge in other than Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. So whoever seeks refuge with a grave or with an idol, or with anything besides Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, then he will be a <em>mushrik</em>, who has committed major <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنَّهُ كَانَ رِجَالٌ مِّنَ الْإِنسِ يَعُوذُونَ بِرِجَالٍ مِّنَ الْجِنِّ فَزَادُوهُمْ رَهَقًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And there used to be men from mankind who would seek refuge in men from the <em>jinn</em>, and they only increased them in transgression</span>. </strong>[72:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabs in the days of ignorance, when they stopped off at a place on the earth, one of them used to say, “I seek refuge in the chief of this valley”: meaning the chief one from the <em>jinn</em>; he would seek refuge from the evil of the foolish ones of his people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>said refuting that and making clear what is legislated in place of it:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever stops off at a place and he says, “<span style="color:#808000;">I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allaah from the evil of whatever He has created</span>”, then nothing will harm him until he travels on from that stopping place of his.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the correct replacement, seeking refuge in the perfect words of Allaah instead of seeking refuge in the <em>jinn</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ الْفَلَقِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say, &#8220;I seek refuge in the Lord of the Dawn&#8221; </strong></span>[113:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<em>Al-Falaq</em>”, is the dawn, and the Lord of the dawn, He is Allaah the Perfect and Most High, just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَالِقُ الْإِصْبَاحِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah is the One Who causes the dawns to break </strong></span>[6:96]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: the One Who brings out the light of the day into the darkness of the night. Who is able to do that except Allaah the Perfect and Most High?</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ الْفَلَقِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>I seek refuge in the Lord of the Daybreak </strong></span>[113:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the Lord of dawn when it breaks, the Sovereign Owner, the One who controls it, the One having full ability over it.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مِن شَرِّ مَا خَلَقَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>From the evil of that which He created </strong></span>[113:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This covers the evil of all of the created beings, he seeks refuge in Allaah from the evil of all of the created beings. This will suffice you for every seeking refuge and every seeking protection which the people do.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِن شَرِّ غَاسِقٍ إِذَا وَقَبَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And from the evil of the <em>Ghaasiq </em></strong>(darkening night)<strong> as it comes with its darkness </strong>(or the moon as it sets or goes away)</span> [113:3]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>Al-Ghaasiq</em></strong></span>”, is the darkness of the night; since in the darkness wild animals and wild beasts come out so then you are in danger, so you seek refuge in Allaah from the evil of this darkness and whatever is beneath it from these harmful things.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِن شَرِّ النَّفَّاثَاتِ فِي الْعُقَدِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And from the evil of those who blow upon knots </strong></span>[113:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they are the sorcerers, you seek refuge in Allaah from sorcery / magic and its people, because sorcery / magic is tremendous evil.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِن شَرِّ حَاسِدٍ إِذَا حَسَدَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And from the evil of the envier when he envies </strong></span>[113:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>Al-<u>H</u>aasid</em>”</strong></span>, the envier, he is the one who hopes and wishes for favours to pass away from other people; when he sees someone having a favour then he becomes furious, and he wishes for this blessing to pass away out of envy and out of transgression and Allaah’s refuge is sought. And it is one of the worst of blameworthy qualities, because it involves raising objections against Allaah, and it involves evil towards the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And entering into it is the person who gives the<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> evil eye</strong></span>, the one who causes harm with his look, because striking with the evil eye is a type of envy, so you should seek refuge in Allaah from these evils.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this indicates that <em>al-Isti‘aadhah</em> (seeking refuge) is worship, it is not permissible to be directed to other than Allaah, so you do not seek refuge in a created being, and whoever seeks refuge in a created being then he has committed shirk with Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> said to ‘Abdullaah ibn ‘Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhumaa</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And if you seek aid then seek the aid of Allaah”<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"></a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ النَّاسِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of Mankind</span>. </strong>[114:1]<strong> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>23</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>23</strong></span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ النَّاسِ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">مَلِكِ النَّاسِ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">إِلَٰهِ النَّاسِ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">مِن شَرِّ الْوَسْوَاسِ الْخَنَّاسِ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِي يُوَسْوِسُ فِي صُدُورِ النَّاسِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of Mankind. The King of mankind. The One Who is rightfully worshipped by mankind. From the evil of the whisperer, who whispers and then withdraws. The one who whispers into the hearts of mankind. From <em>jinn</em> and from men. </strong></span>[114:1-6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah the Mighty and Majestic commands seeking refuge in the Lord of mankind, the King of mankind, the One Who is rightfully worshipped by mankind – these are all Names and Attributes of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and it contains the three types of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>: <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed-ur-Ruboobiyyah</em> (<em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of Lordship), <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed-ul-Uloohiyyah</em> (<em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of worship) and <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed-ul-Asmaa wa<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>ifaat</em> (<em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of Allaah’s Names and Attributes).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Seek refuge in Allaah and in these Names and Attributes, seek refuge in Allaah from the evil of <em>al-Waswaas</em> (the whisperer) – and he is Satan. As for <em>Wiswaas</em> (a whispering) then that is a verbal noun from the verb <em>waswasa yuwaswisu</em>. As for <em>al-Waswaas</em> then it is a name from the names of Satan, because he whispers to mankind and gives him false ideas, and he pre-occupies him in order to cast terror into his heart and uncertainty and confusion in his affairs, particularly with regard to the affair of worship, because Satan whispers to man in acts of worship until he confuses him regarding his prayer or his act of worship, and then finally the person comes out from his prayer believing that it was null and void. Or he prays and then he believes that he was not upon <em>wudhoo’</em>, or that he did not stand up for such and such, or that he did not perform such and such, the person comes to suffer from whispers and he is not calm in his worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah the Majestic and Most High has given us the remedy for this dangerous matter, and that is that you seek refuge in Allaah from the evil of this whisperer who is <em>al-Khannaas.</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>al-Khannaas</em></span>:</strong> meaning the one who departs and moves away, so he whispers when you are negligent of the remembrance of Allaah, and he withdraws – meaning he falls back when you remember Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. So he whispers when the person is inattentive, and he is one who withdraws and moves away when one remembers Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مِن شَرِّ الْوَسْوَاسِ الْخَنَّاسِ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِي يُوَسْوِسُ فِي صُدُورِ النَّاسِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The one who whispers into the hearts of mankind. From <em>jinn</em> and from mankind </strong></span>[114:5-6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is as if the meaning – and Allaah knows best – that there are those who whisper from the <em>jinn</em> and from mankind as well – those who whisper things to the people; they come to the people and they cause them to have doubts, so just as there are devils from the <em>jinn</em> who whisper evil, then likewise there are devils from mankind who whisper also, so you should seek refuge in Allaah from the evil of the two tribes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“No-one seeking refuge has sought refuge by means of the like of these two” </strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: these two soorahs (Soorat-ul-Falaq and Soorat-un-Naas). So it is befitting for the Muslim that he should read these two after the prayers and that he should repeat them again and again, and that he should recite these two when he goes to sleep along with Aayat-ul-Kursee and Soorat-ul-Ikhlaa<u>s</u>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He should recite <em>Aayat-ul-Kursee</em> and <em>Soorat-ul-Ikhlaa<u>s</u></em> and the two <em>soorahs</em> for seeking refuge, he should recite them after every prayer, and repeat them three times after maghrib and after fajr, and likewise recite these two when you go to sleep in order that Satan should move away from him and not disturb his sleep for him and not trouble him with nightmares.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The witness from these two <em>soorahs</em> is that Allaah has commanded seeking refuge in Him alone, so this proves that seeking refuge in other than him, whether it be jinn or mankind or any created thing, that that is not permissible because it is a type from the types of worship.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Al-Isti‘aanah</em></strong><strong> (Appealing for Aid and Assistance) and its Proof</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof for <em>Al-Isti‘aanah</em> (appealing for aid and assistance) is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You alone do we worship and to You alone do we appeal for aid </strong></span>[1:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“If you seek aid, then seek the aid of Allaah”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><sup>, <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>12</strong></span></sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">12</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Isti‘aanah: </em>means seeking aid and assistance, and it is of two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first type </strong><span style="color:#993300;">(which is worship)</span><strong>:</strong> is seeking assistance upon something which no-one but Allaah is able to do; then directing this to other than Allaah is <em>shirk</em>, whoever seeks aid and assistance of other than Allaah with regard to something which only Allaah can carry out, then he has committed shirk, because he has directed a type from the types of worship to other than Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second type</strong> <span style="color:#993300;">(which is not worship)</span><strong>: </strong>seeking aid upon something which someone from the creation is able to carry our, so you may seek someone’s help to build a wall along with you or to carry some luggage along with you or to help you to do something which is permissible which you wish to do, just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> وَتَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَىٰ ۖ وَلَا تَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And help one another upon righteousness and dutifulness towards Allaah, and do not help one another upon sin and transgression </strong></span>[5:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>al-Isti‘aanah </em>(seeking aid and assistance) with regard to everyday matters which the people are able to do, there is no harm in this, because it is co-operation upon righteousness and dutifulness to Allaah. And He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And Allaah continues to aid the servant for as long as the servant is aiding his brother”</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Reported by Muslim (2699) from a hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu</em>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">As for seeking aid and assistance from someone from the creation with regard to something which no-one can carry out except Allaah, for example bringing about provision and repelling harm, then this cannot be except for Allaah; such as seeking the aid of the dead and seeking the aid of the <em>jinn</em> and the devils, and seeking the aid of people who are absent and they cannot hear your calling out their names – this is <strong>major</strong> <strong><em>shirk</em></strong>, because you are seeking aid from those who are not able to aid you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You Alone do we worship and Your aid Alone do we seek </strong></span>[1:5]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Iyyaka na‘budu</em></span></strong>”, (You Alone do we worship): this is a case of putting the governed word before the operative word. The governed word, “You”, is in the accusative case and, “We worship” is the governing word which caused, “<em>Iyyaka</em>” to be in the accusative case. And putting the governed word before the operative word indicates restriction. So the meaning of, “<em>Iyyaka Na‘budu</em>”, is – we do not worship anyone else besides You. So worship is restricted (to only be) for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>Wa Iyaaka nasta‘een</em></strong></span>”, (and Your aid Alone do we seek): this is a restriction of seeking aid (to only be) from Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and that is with regard to those affairs which no-one is able to carry out except Allaah the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in His saying, “<em>Iyaaka nasta‘een</em>”, (Your aid Alone do we seek): it shows freeing onself from, “<strong><em><u>H</u>awl</em></strong>” and “<strong><em>Quwwah</em></strong>” – from any claim to having the ability to change things and from having power, and that a person has no power except with Allaah’s aid, and that no-one is able to do anything except with the aid of Allaah the Mighty and Majetic, and this is the utmost worship and servitude to Allaah, when a person frees himself from shirk, and he frees himself from, <em><u>H</u>awl </em>&#8211; from any claim to being able to bring about change, and from having <em>Quwwah </em>&#8211; from himself having power. So this is the utmost worship and servitude to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by At-Tirmidhee as a <u>h</u>adeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhumaa (</em>part of <u>h</u>adeeth 19 in An-Nawawee’s 40 <u>h</u>adeeth)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Al-Inaabah</em></strong><strong> (Turning Repentantly and Obediently) and its Proof</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof for <em>al-Inaabah </em>(turning repentantly and obediently) is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنِيبُوا إِلَىٰ رَبِّكُمْ وَأَسْلِمُوا لَهُ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So turn in repentance and obedience to your Lord and submit to Him </strong></span>[39:54]<strong> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>20</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>20</strong></span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Inaabah: </em>it means returning and it has the meaning of <em>at-Tawbah</em> (repenting), and repenting and <em>al-Inaabah </em>have one and the same meaning. However some of the scholars have said <em>al-Inaabah </em>is more specific than <em>at-Tawbah</em> (repenting), meaning it is more emphasized because it, <em>Inaabah</em> is <em>Tawbah</em> (repenting) but along with turning to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, meaning it is a specific repentance, and a person may repent and leave the sin and not return to it, and he may regret it, however his turning to Allaah may be a weak turning. Whereas <em>al-Inaabah </em>then indeed it means <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>turning towards to Allaah</strong></span> the Mighty and Majestic. And therefore He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">.. وَأَنِيبُوا إِلَىٰ رَبِّكُمْ وَأَسْلِمُوا لَهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So turn in repentance and obedience to your Lord and submit to Him …</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning turn back to Him and turn fully to Him, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مِن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَكُمُ الْعَذَابُ ثُمَّ لَا تُنصَرُونَ ..</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>… before the punishment comes to you and then you will not be helped</strong> </span>[39:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the punishment which destroys and annihilates comes, then repentance will not be accepted from those who repent at that time.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَلَوْلَا كَانَتْ قَرْيَةٌ آمَنَتْ فَنَفَعَهَا إِيمَانُهَا إِلَّا قَوْمَ يُونُسَ لَمَّا آمَنُوا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمْ عَذَابَ الْخِزْيِ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Except for the people of Yunus when they believed, then we took away from them the humiliating punishment </strong></span>[10:98]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was an exception, otherwise when the punishment which destroys descends, then repentance is not accepted, and therefore He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مِن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَكُمُ الْعَذَابُ ثُمَّ لَا تُنصَرُونَ ..</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">.. before the punishment comes to you and then you will not be helped</span> </strong>[39:54]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>at-Tawbah</em> (repenting) and <em>al-Inaabah</em> (turning repentantly and obediently), they have an appointed time and they have a limit, so repentance will not be accepted from the person who is experiencing the death rattle, or someone to whom death comes, and the repentance will not be accepted from one whom the punishment which destroys and annihilates descends upon. And repentance will not be accepted when the sun comes out from its place of setting before the establishment of the Hour. Repentance will not be accepted then. So therefore Allaah encourages the servant upon <em>at-Tawbah</em> (repenting) and <em>al-Inaabah</em> (turning repentantly and obediently) before the time limit comes to its end.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مِن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَكُمُ الْعَذَابُ ثُمَّ لَا تُنصَرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Before the punishment comes to you and then you will not be helped </strong></span>[39:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the witness is His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنِيبُوا إِلَىٰ رَبِّكُمْ وَأَسْلِمُوا لَهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Turn to your Lord repentantly and obediently</span> </strong>[39:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that <em>al-Inaabah</em> (turning repentantly and obediently) is a type from the types of worship because He said, “to your Lord”. So this shows that it is a type from the types of worship.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Al-Khashyah</em></strong><strong> (Fear and Awe) and its Proof</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p>The proof for <em>al-Khashyah</em> (awe) is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> فَلَا تَخْشَوْهُمْ </span></h3>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So do not have <em>Khashyah</em> </strong>(awe)<strong> of them </strong></span>[2:150] <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>19</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">19</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Khashyah</em> (awe) is a type of <em>Khawf</em> (fear), and it is more specific than just fear. And it is said <em>al-Khashyah</em> (awe) is fear which is mixed with <strong>veneration</strong>. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> فَلَا تَخْشَوْهُمْ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So do not have <em>Khashyah</em> </strong>(awe)<strong> of them </strong></span>[2:150]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah the Perfect and Most High commanded having <em>Khashyah</em> (awe) of Him alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said in the <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَلَا تَخْشَوْهُمْ وَاخْشَوْنِي وَلِأُتِمَّ نِعْمَتِي عَلَيْكُمْ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So do not have <em>Khashyah</em> </strong>(awe)<strong> of them, but rather have <em>Khashyah</em> </strong>(awe)<strong> of Me, and so that I may complete My favour upon you and so that you may be guided. </strong></span>[2:150]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He commanded having <em>Khashyah</em> (awe) of Him, He the Perfect and Most High, and He said in description of those who pray <em><u>s</u>alaah</em>:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَالَّذِينَ هُم مِّنْ عَذَابِ رَبِّهِم مُّشْفِقُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And those who have fear of the punishment of their Lord </strong></span>[70:27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning they have fear, they are the elite ones from the creation, they have fear of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. And He said about the Angels:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَخَافُونَ رَبَّهُم مِّن فَوْقِهِمْ وَيَفْعَلُونَ مَا يُؤْمَرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They have fear of their Lord from above them, and they do whatever they are commanded</span> </strong>[16:50]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The elite of the creation from the Angels and the Messengers and the beloved and the obedient servants and the righteous ones, they have the utmost <em>Khashyah</em> (awe) of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and <em>Khawf</em> (fear) of Him, He the Perfect and Most High and <em>Rahbah</em> (dread) of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>ar-Rahbah</em> (dread) and <em>al-Khawf</em> (fear) and <em>al-Khashyah</em> (awe), all of them have a single meaning, even though some of them are more specific than others. However they all share in being <em>Khawf</em> (fear) of Allaah the Perfect and Most High. And these are from the characteristics of the Prophets and the righteous servants of Allaah, and they are tremendous types of worship and they are from the actions of the hearts which are not known except to Allaah the Perfect and Most High.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof for <em>Ar-Raghbah</em> (fervent desire) and <em>Ar-Rahbah</em> (dread) and <em>al-Khushoo‘</em> (reverence and humility), is His saying, He the Most High:<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا يُسَارِعُونَ فِي الْخَيْرَاتِ وَيَدْعُونَنَا رَغَبًا وَرَهَبًا ۖ وَكَانُوا لَنَا خَاشِعِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They used to hasten to perform acts of devotion to Allaah, and they used to worship Us <em>raghaban</em> (upon love and desire), and <em>rahaban</em> (upon fear), and they were were reverent and humble before Allaah </span></strong>[21:90]<strong> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>18</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>18</strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Ar-Raghbah</em> (fervent desire): it means seeking something which is praiseworthy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Ar-Rahbah</em> (dread): is fear of something which is dreaded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> وَإِيَّايَ فَارْهَبُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And have dread of Me </strong></span>[2:40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is a type of <em>Khawf</em> (fear);</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>ar-Rahbah</em> (dread) and <em>al-Khawf</em> (fear) have one and the same meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>al-Khushoo‘</em> (reverence and humility): it is a type of humbling oneself to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. And humbly submitting and humbling onself before Him, He the Perfect and Most High – it is from the greatest of levels of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High, “<em>Innahum</em>”, (they): this pronoun refers back to the Prophets, since in <em>Soorat-ul-Anbiyaa</em> Allaah has mentioned the stories of the Prophets, and then He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا يُسَارِعُونَ فِي الْخَيْرَاتِ وَيَدْعُونَنَا رَغَبًا وَرَهَبًا ۖ وَكَانُوا لَنَا خَاشِعِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They used to hasten to perform acts of devotion to Allaah, and they used to worship Us <em>raghaban</em> (upon love and desire), and <em>rahaban</em> (upon fear), and they were were reverent and humble before Allaah</strong></span> [21:90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا يُسَارِعُونَ فِي الْخَيْرَاتِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They used to hasten upon doing acts of good </strong></span>[21:90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: they would race to them, and they would hasten to them. This is the characteristic of the Prophets <em>‘alaihimu<u>ss</u>aalatu wassalaam, </em>they would not be lazy and they would not behave as if they were powerless, rather they hastened to doing good deeds, and they raced towards them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> وَيَدْعُونَنَا رَغَبًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they invoked and worshipped us with <em>Raghbah</em> </strong></span>[21:90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: desiring what lies with Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, desiring attainment of what they wished for.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> وَرَهَبًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High, <strong>“<em>wa rahaban</em>”, (with dread)</strong>: meaning with fear of Us, so they called upon Allaah to have mercy upon them, and they called upon Him not to punish them, and not to bring them to account and not to seize them with punishment. So they had hope for the mercy of Allaah, and they feared His punishment, just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ يَبْتَغُونَ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمُ الْوَسِيلَةَ أَيُّهُمْ أَقْرَبُ وَيَرْجُونَ رَحْمَتَهُ وَيَخَافُونَ عَذَابَهُ ۚ إِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ كَانَ مَحْذُورًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Those whom they call upon, themselves seek a means of nearness to draw themselves closer to their Lord, to see which of them can draw closest to Him. They hope for His mercy and they fear His punishment</strong></span> [17:57]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they call upon Allaah having fear of Him, and they worship and call upon Him desiring what lies with Him (from reward), they call upon Allaah so that He should ordain good for them and repel evil from them.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَكَانُوا لَنَا خَاشِعِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they were reverent and humble towards Us</strong></span> [21:90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: they were reverential, humbly submitting, humble before Allaah, the Mighty ad Majestic. So they gathered between three characteristics: <em>Ar-Raghbah</em> (fervent desire) and <em>Ar-Rahbah</em> (dread) and <em>al-Khushoo‘</em> (reverence and humility). These are the characteristics of the Prophets <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihim was allam</em> and these three types are from the types of worship of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it contains a refutation of <em>Soofees</em>, those who say, “We do not worship Allaah out of desire for His reward, nor out of fear of His punishment, we only worship Him out of love of Him alone”. This is false and futile speech, because the Prophets called upon and worshipped Allaah, <em>raghaban wa rahaban</em> (with fear and with hope) and they were the most complete of the creation.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>at-Tawakkul </em></strong><strong>(Trust and Reliance) and its Proof</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof for <em>at-Tawakkul</em> (trust and reliance) is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَعَلَى اللَّهِ فَتَوَكَّلُوا إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And place your reliance and trust in Allaah if you are true believers </strong></span>[5:23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whoever places his trust and reliance in Allaah, then He will suffice him </strong></span>[65:3]<strong> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>17</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">17</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>at-Tawakkul</em> is to entrust your affairs and to place reliance in Allaah the Perfect and Most High, and to entrust affairs to Him, He the Perfect and Most High – this is <em>at-Tawakkul </em>(trust and reliance). And it is from the greatest of the types of worship, and therefore He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَعَلَى اللَّهِ فَتَوَكَّلُوا إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And place your reliance and trust in Allaah if you are true believers </strong></span>[5:23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The preposition and the word with it are put before the governing word, to indicate restriction.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">.. وَعَلَى اللَّهِ فَتَوَكَّلُوا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And upon Allaah place your reliance and trust …</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning upon Him and not upon anyone else besides Him, then He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ ..</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>… if you are people of <em>eemaan</em> </strong></span>[5:23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He made it a condition of <em>eemaan</em> to have trust and reliance upon Allaah the Perfect and Most High. And this shows that whoever does not place his trust and reliance upon Allaah, then he is not a believer. So therefore <em>at-Tawakkul</em> (trust and reliance) is a tremendous act of worship. So therefore the believer always places his trust and reliance upon Allaah and depends upon Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, from His Names is <span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Al-Wakeel</em> </strong></span>(the Trustworthy Disposer of Affairs) meaning: the One to Whom the affairs of His servants are entrusted, He the Perfect and Most High. So <em>at-Tawakkul</em> (placing trust and reliance) cannot be except upon Allaah, and it is not permissible to say, “I place my reliance in so-and-so”, because <em>at-Tawakkul</em> (trust and reliance) is worship, and worship cannot be except for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for when you delegate someone from the creation to carry something out for you, then this is not called <em>tawakkul</em> (trusting in them), it is called <strong><em>tawkeel</em> </strong>(entrusting), and <strong><em>al-wikaalah</em></strong> (authorising or entrusting), this is something well-known, that you entrust and authorise someone to carry out some need for you. And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu </em><em>‘alaihi wa sallam</em>, he delegated some people to deputise for him in carrying out certain duties. So <em>at-tawkeel</em> (entrusting or delegating) is something other than <em>at-Tawakkul</em> (having trust and reliance). So <em>at-Tawakkul</em> is worship, and it cannot be except for Allaah, and it is not permissible for you to say, “I placed my trust and reliance in so-and-so”. Rather you should say, “I have entrusted someone with something”. And along with this, you entrust and authorize someone, but you do not place your trust and reliance in him, rather you place your trust and reliance in Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. So notice the difference between the two matters and <em>at-Tawakkul </em>and <em>at-tawkeel</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the characteristics of the believers is that which Allaah the Most High mentioned with His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّمَا الْمُؤْمِنُونَ الَّذِينَ إِذَا ذُكِرَ اللَّهُ وَجِلَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَإِذَا تُلِيَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتُهُ زَادَتْهُمْ إِيمَانًا وَعَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b style="color:#008000;">That the </b><span style="color:#008000;"><b>believers</b></span><b style="color:#008000;"> are only those who when Allaah is mentioned, their hearts tremble and when His Signs are recited to them it increases them in </b><em style="color:#008000;font-weight:bold;">eemaan</em><b style="color:#008000;">, and they place their trust and reliance upon their Lord. </b></span>[8:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are from the attributes of the believers, so therefore trust and reliance is a tremendous act of worship, it cannot be except for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, because He is <strong><em>al-Qaadir</em></strong> (the One Fully Able to do everything), and He is <strong><em>al-Maalik </em></strong>(the Owner) of everything, and He is fully able to bring about for you whatever you desire. As for the created being, then he might not be able to bring about something for you that you desire, so you may entrust him with carrying something out. However trust and reliance is to be upon Allaah with regard to attainment of that thing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then you should know that <em>at-Tawakkul</em> (trust and reliance) does not negate and contradict <strong>using the means to an end</strong>. So the Muslim gathers between having reliance and trust in Allaah and utilizing the means, and there is no contradiction between them. So you carry out the means which you have been commanded to do. However you do not place your trust and reliance upon the means, rather you place your trust and reliance upon Allaah. You, you plant the seeds for crops in the earth – this is a means. However, you do nor place reliance upon the planting and your own action, rather you have reliance upon Allaah with regard to the growth of this plant, and with regard to its producing fruit and with regard to its being kept safe, and with regard to its being good and suitable, and therefore He says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَفَرَأَيْتُم مَّا تَحْرُثُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَأَنتُمْ تَزْرَعُونَهُ أَمْ نَحْنُ الزَّارِعُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do you see the seed which you sow? Do you make it grow or are We the One Who causes it to grow? </strong></span>[56:63-64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the One Who causes it to grow in reality, He is Allaah, but as for you, then you have just carried out the means only. It may produce this plant and grow or it may not produce it. And if it grows, it may be good and fitting, and it may not be good. It may be struck by some calamity, and will pass away.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High, “<strong><em>man kaana yarjoo</em></strong>”: meaning he has hope for the reward of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and in seeing Him openly on the Day of Resurrection, whoever has hope in seeing Allaah openly with his eyes on the day of resurrection, then let him perform righteous deeds, he should carry out the means which will enable him to attain this goal, which is the reward of entry into Paradise and of being saved from the Fire and of looking upon the Face of Allaah – this necessarily follows on, because whoever enters Paradise, then he will see Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَمَن كَانَ يَرْجُو لِقَاءَ رَبِّهِ فَلْيَعْمَلْ عَمَلًا صَالِحًا وَلَا يُشْرِكْ بِعِبَادَةِ رَبِّهِ أَحَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So whoever has hope in the meeting with his Lord and in His reward then let him perform righteous actions</span> </strong>[18:110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows that hope alone is not sufficient, rather there must be action, as for your just having hope in Allaah, but you do not act, then this is to abandon the use of the means. So praiseworthy hope is that which occurs along with righteous action. As for hoping which is not praiseworthy, then it hope which does not have righteous action along with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And righteous action is that which fulfills <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>two conditions</strong></span>:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first</strong>: is that it is done purely and sincerely for Him, the Mighty and Majestic.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second</strong>: is that it is done following the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So an action will not be righteous unless it fulfills these two conditions: that it is done purely and sincerely seeking the Face of Allaah, it does not contain any <em>shirk</em>, and that it should be a correct action, done upon the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>, not containing innovation. So if the two conditions are met then it will be a righteous action, and if any condition is missing, then it will be a corrupt action, it will not benefit the person who does it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So action which contains shirk will be rejected for the person, and likewise action which contains innovation, it will be rejected for the person. He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<span style="color:#808000;">Whoever does an action which is not in accordance with our affair, then it will be rejected</span>” </strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this aayah contains <em>ar-Rajaa’</em> (hope and longing), and that it is an act of worship to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. And it shows that hope will not be correct except along with righteous action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree in disconnected form straight after <u>h</u>adeeth 7350, and reported by Muslim as <u>h</u>adeeth 1718/17 from a <u>h</u>adeeth of ‘Aa’ishah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhaa. </em>And also reported by al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree in connected form as <u>h</u>adeeth 2697 and Muslim as <u>h</u>adeeth 1718/17 from ‘Aa’ishah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhaa, </em>that she said, Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu’ alaihi wa sallam </em>said, “Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it will have it rejected”.</p>

<p><strong><em>Al-Khawf</em></strong><strong> (fear), its Types and its Proof</strong></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof for <em>Al-Khawf</em> (fear) is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّمَا ذَٰلِكُمُ الشَّيْطَانُ يُخَوِّفُ أَوْلِيَاءَهُ فَلَا تَخَافُوهُمْ وَخَافُونِ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>That is just Satan, he incites you to fear his allies. So do not fear them, but rather fear Me if you are truly believers </strong></span>[3:175]<strong> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>15</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>15</strong></span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Khawf</em> (fear) is a type from the types of worship, and it is an act of worship of the heart, just the same as is the case with <em>al-Khawf</em> (fear) and <em>al-Khashyah</em> (awe) and <em>ar-Raghbah</em> (fervent desire) and <em>ar-Rahbah</em> (dread) and <em>ar-Rajaa’</em> (hope and longing) and <em>at-Tawakkul</em> (trust and reliance) – all of these are acts of worship of the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Khawf</em> (fear) is apprehension of something unpleasant, and it is of two types:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Khawf-ul-‘Ibaadah</em> (fear which is worship)</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Khawf-u<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abee‘ee</em> (natural fear).</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first type: <span style="color:#000000;"><em>Khawf-ul-‘Ibaadah</em> (fear which is worship)</span></strong>, directing this to other than Allaah is <em>shirk</em>, and that is that a person fears someone other than Allaah with regard to something which no-one besides Allaah is able to do, such as his fearing someone being able to cause him to become ill, or being able to take his soul, or to cause his child to die, as is done by many of the ignorant people. They fear regarding their wives’ pregnancies and for their children, from the <em>jinn</em>, they fear sorcerers, they fear the dead, and so therefore they do actions involving <em>shirk</em> to free themselves from this fear. So this is something which no-one is able to do but Allaah, illnesses and death and bringing provision and cutting off life-span, these matters, no-one is able to do them except Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and likewise sending down blessings or other than that. These matters cannot come about except from Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, so if he fears anyone with regards to anything which only Allaah can carry out, then this is major <em>shirk</em>, because it is diverting a type of worship to other than Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. Like those who fear the graves and of the tombs and of the <em>jinn</em> and of the devils that they can strike them with evil or cause some harm to descend upon them, and so therefore they go and perform actions of nearness to these things to repel their harm, or out of fear of them – this is major <em>shirk</em>. He says, “I fear, if I don’t make a sacrifice for him, that he will afflict me with something, or afflict my children or my wealth, or the like of that, just as was said by the people of Hood:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِن نَّقُولُ إِلَّا اعْتَرَاكَ بَعْضُ آلِهَتِنَا بِسُوءٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>All that we say is that some of our gods have struck you with evil </strong></span>[11:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They threatened him with their gods and they tried to make him fear their objects of worship.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ إِنِّي أُشْهِدُ اللَّهَ وَاشْهَدُوا أَنِّي بَرِيءٌ مِّمَّا تُشْرِكُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مِن دُونِهِ ۖ فَكِيدُونِي جَمِيعًا ثُمَّ لَا تُنظِرُونِ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنِّي تَوَكَّلْتُ عَلَى اللَّهِ رَبِّي وَرَبِّكُم</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He said, “I call Allaah to witness, and you should bear witness, that I am free of whatever you associate in worship along with Him. So plot all of you against me and don’t give me any respite. I have placed my reliance upon Allaah, my Lord and your Lord.” </strong></span>[11:54-56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, he challenges them, all of them, them and their idols.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So then all of you plot against me, and then don’t give me any respite </strong></span>[11:55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Don’t give me some time, rather plot against me from this moment, and they were not able to do anything against him, rather Allaah aided him against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the person who fears other than Allaah with regard to things that only Allaah can do, then he has committed major <em>shirk</em>, and this is called the fear which is worship, and the fear which is <em>shirk</em>. Many people have fear of the graves, or of the <em>awliyaa’ </em>(the beloved and obedient servants of Allaah), they fear Satan, they fear the <em>jinn</em>, and therefore they do acts of devotion, putting forward offerings to them, putting forward sacrifices for them, and making vows and giving foods, and other than that, such as throwing money upon their tombs in order to be saved from their evil, or to attain something of their good. Then this is <em>khawf-ul-‘ibaadah</em> (fear which is worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second type</strong>: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>al-Khawf-u<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abee‘ee</em> (natural fear)</strong></span>: and it is that you fear something which is clear and apparent which is able to do that which you fear from it, such as your fearing a snake or a scorpion or an enemy, these are matters which are clear and visible and are well-known matters, so fearing them is not called <em>shirk</em>, this is natural fear of something which is apparent and known, because you are fearing a means which is clear and apparent, and something which it is desirable for you to protect yourself from and take precaution against, so therefore you take up weapons, you take up a stick to kill a snake or a scorpion, and to kill a wild animal, because these are matters which are felt by the senses, and they contain well-known harm. So if you fear them, then this is not called <em>shirk</em>, rather it is called natural fear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore Allaah said with regard to <strong>Moosaa</strong> <em>‘alaihissalaam</em>:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَخَرَجَ مِنْهَا خَائِفًا يَتَرَقَّبُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So he departed from it in a state of fear </strong></span>[28:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning from the city</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Fearful, looking about </strong></span>[28:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having fear of his enemies, because he had killed one of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> fled to Madyan, and he was on the lookout, and he was fearing that they would catch him, so this is natural fear. However, a person needs to learn to seek shelter and protection in Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and to take hold of the means through which he can repel harm, and he relies upon Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and has reliance upon Allaah. He the most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> فَلَا تَخَافُوهُمْ وَخَافُونِ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So do not fear them </strong>(the allies of Satan)<strong> but rather fear Me if you are truly believers </strong></span>[3:175]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This aayah is in the soorah Aal-i-‘Imraan in the story of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> along with the people of <em>shirk</em> on the day of U<u>h</u>ud, when the people of shirk threatened them and said, “We will return to them and wipe then out.” So therefore Allaah the Majestic and Most High says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّمَا ذَٰلِكُمُ الشَّيْطَانُ يُخَوِّفُ أَوْلِيَاءَهُ فَلَا تَخَافُوهُمْ وَخَافُونِ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>That is just Satan, he incites you to fear his allies. So do not fear them, but rather fear Me if you are truly believers</strong></span> [3:175]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This warning and this threat was just from Satan, meaning he tries to cause you to fear his allies, or to cause whoever will submit to him to fear, from the people and to fear him. Then he will gain ascendancy over them.</p>

<p><strong>Islaam and <em>Eemaan</em> and <em>I<u>h</u>saan</em> and the Proof for Each</strong></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وأنواعُ العبادةِ التي أَمَرَ اللهُ بها: مثلُ الإسلامِ، والإيمانِ، والإحسان</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And all the types of worship which Allaah has commanded such as <em>Al-Islaam</em>, and <em>Al-Eemaan</em> and </span></strong><em><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Al-I<u>h</u>saan</span></strong> </em><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">11</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Shaikh, <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, he quoted some examples for worship, as a case of quoting examples, not as a case of restriction because they are more than what he mentioned. And it would not be possible to mention them all in a brief treatise. However he mentioned some examples.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Shaikh-ul-Islaam (Ibn Taymiyyah) has a separate treatise which is called <strong><em>Al-‘Uboodiyyah</em> (worship and servitude)</strong>, which researches the matter of worship and the types of worship and an explanation of the deviations which occurred from the <em>Soofees</em> and others with regards to worship, and it is a valuable treatise which the student of knowledge needs to read.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, “<strong>such as <em>Islaam</em>, and <em>Eemaan</em> and <em>I<u>h</u>saan</em></strong>”: these three types are the greatest of the types of worship, and an explanation of them will follow in the speech of the Shaikh <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> with regard to the second fundamental principle. And he mentioned them here because they are from the types of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>Islaam</em> with its five pillars, the two testifications of faith, and establishment of the prayer and giving the <em>zakaat</em> and fasting <em>Rama<u>d</u>aan</em> and making <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> to the sacred House of Allaah – these are all acts of worship which are <em>maaliyyah</em> (relating to wealth) and <em>badaniyyah</em> (relating to the body).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise <em>Eemaan</em> with its six pillars, it is from the actions of the heart, <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah and in His Angels and in His Books and in His Messengers and in the Last Day and eemaan in <em>Al-Qadr</em> (pre-decree), the good of it and the bad of it, this is worship of the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise <em>al-I<u>h</u>saan</em> which is a single pillar, and it is that you worship Allaah as if you are seeing Him, and even though you do not see him, then He certainly sees you. This is the highest of the types of worship, because <em>al-I<u>h</u>saan </em>is the highest of all the types of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And these are called the levels of the religion, since together they are the religion, because Jibreel when he asked the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> in the presence of his Companions, and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> responded to the question about <em>Islaam</em> and <em>Eemaan</em> and <em>I<u>h</u>saan</em>, he then said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">هذا جبريل أتاكم يعلمكم أمر دينكم</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“This was Jibreel, he came to you to teach you the affair of your religion”</strong></span></p>
<p>[<span style="color:#999999;">Reported by al-Bukhaaree (4777) and reported by Muslim (8, 9 and 10) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu</em>.</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong>So he called these three the religion.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Ad-Du ‘aa (Supplication) its Categories and its Proof.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ومنهُ الدعاءُ، والخوفُ، والرجاءُ، والتوكلُ، والرغبةُ، والرهبةُ، والخشوعُ، والخَشيةُ، والإنابةُ، والاستعانةُ، والاستعاذةُ، والاستغاثةُ، والذَّبْحُ، والنذرُ، وغيرُ ذلك من أنواع العبادةِ التي أَمرَ اللهُ بها كلُّها لله تعالى</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And from it is <em>ad-Du‘aa</em> (supplication)</strong> and <em>al-Khawf</em> (fear) and <em>ar-Rajaa’</em> (hope and longing) and <em>at-Tawakkul</em> (trust and reliance) and <em>ar-Raghbah</em> (fervent desire) and <em>ar-Rahbah</em> (dread) and <em>al-Khushoo‘</em> (reverence and humility) and <em>al-Khashyah</em> (awe) and <em>al-Inaabah</em> (turning repentantly) and <em>al-Isti‘aanah</em> (appealing for aid and assistance) and <em>al-Isti‘aadhah</em> (seeking refuge) and <em>al-Istighaathah</em> (seeking deliverence and rescue) and <em>adh-Dhab<u>h</u></em> (sacrificing) and <em>an-Nadhr</em> (making vows), and other than that from the types of worship which Allaah has commanded, all of them are to be done exclusively for Allaah the Most High</span>. <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">12</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>and from it is <em>ad-Du‘aa</em> (supplication)</strong>”: meaning and from the types of worship is <em>ad-Du‘aa</em> (supplication); he began with it because it is the greatest of the types of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>ad-Du‘aa</em> (supplication) is of two categories: <em>Du‘aa</em> of worship and <em>Du‘aa</em> of making request:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Du‘aa-ul-‘Ibaadah</em></strong> </span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(<em>Du‘aa</em> of worship)</span>:</strong> is to praise and extol Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, just as occurs at the beginning of Al-Faati<u>h</u>ah:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>All Praise is for Allaah the Lord of the whole of creation, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy, the Sovereign Owner of the Day of Recompensing, You Alone do we worship, and Your Aid alone do we seek </strong></span>[1:2-5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of that is <em>Du‘aa</em> of worship.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">اهْدِنَا الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Guide us upon the straight path </strong></span>[1:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">to the end of the <em>soorah, </em>this is <em>Du‘aa</em> of request.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Du‘aa-ul-Mas’alah </em></strong></span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(<em>Du‘aa</em> of making request)</span>: </strong>it is to request something from Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, such as requesting guidance and requesting provision and requesting knowledge from Allaah, and requesting for <em>at-Tawfeeq</em> (the granting of success in attaining what is correct).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنَّ الْمَسَاجِدَ لِلَّهِ فَلَا تَدْعُوا مَعَ اللَّهِ أَحَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And that the places of prayer are to be for Allaah alone, so do not invoke or call upon anyone along with Allaah </strong></span>[72:18] <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>13</sup> </span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">13</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><em>Al-Masaajid</em></strong>”: this word is used to mean the places where prostration is made, and those places where the prayer is performed, and they are the most beloved place to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and there occurs an encouragement with regard to building them and preparing them, so he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">من بنى مسجدا لله كمفحص قطاة أو أصغر بنى الله له بيتا في الجنة</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Whoever builds a mosque for Allaah like the nesting-place of a sand grouse or even smaller, then Allaah will build for him a house in Paradise”</span> </strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّمَا يَعْمُرُ مَسَاجِدَ اللَّهِ مَنْ آمَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>That the mosques of Allaah are to be maintained only by those people who truly believe in Allaah and in the Last Day </strong></span>[9:18]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Maintaining means physical maintenance and spiritual maintenance, maintaining them by clay, and whatever it needs so that it can shelter those who pray, and can shade them from the heat, and can shelter them from the cold and maintaining them through worship, by the prayer and the recitation of the Qur’aan and the remembrance of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this word <em>masaajid</em> is also used to mean the seven parts of the body which prostrate, and they are: the forehead and the nose, and the two hands and the two knees and the tips of the two feet, because they perform prostration to Allaah. And the <em>aayah</em> covers both meanings. “And the <em>Masaajid</em>”: meaning the places where prayer is performed, and the parts of the body which perform prostration for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَلَا تَدْعُوا مَعَ اللَّهِ أَحَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So do not invoke or call upon anyone along with Allaah </strong></span>[72:18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not make these places of prayer, and these places, a place for <em>shirk</em> and for calling upon other than Allaah. Rather it is obligatory that the mosques be purified from any <em>shirk</em>, so there can be no graves in them, and there can be no calling upon other than Allaah in them, and there can be no innovations in them and no newly introduced affairs and no innovated <em>soofee</em> circles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory that the mosques are purified from innovations and from <em>shirk</em> and from sins because they are for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic alone, so there cannot be in them except that which is pleasing to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, so do not call upon anyone besides Allaah in these mosques, or utilise the parts of your body in prostrating to other than Allaah the Mighty and Majestic – because this is major <em>shirk</em> just like the person who prostrates to an idol or to a grave or who prostrates to some false object of worship – this is prostrating to something other than Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the witness is in His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَلَا تَدْعُوا مَعَ اللَّهِ أَحَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So do not invoke or call upon anyone along with Allaah </strong></span>[72:18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a command so make supplication purely for Him alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, “<strong><em>a<u>h</u>adan</em> (anyone)</strong>”: this is general and it covers everything which is called upon besides Allaah, whether it be an Angel or a Prophet or a <em>walee</em> (beloved righteous servant) or a tree or a rock – it covers everything which is called upon besides Allaah the Mighty and Majestic – then this will be major <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever directs anything from them to other than Allaah, then he is a <em>mushrik</em> (person of <em>shirk</em>), a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever), and the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يَدْعُ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَٰهًا آخَرَ لَا بُرْهَانَ لَهُ بِهِ فَإِنَّمَا حِسَابُهُ عِندَ رَبِّهِ ۚ إِنَّهُ لَا يُفْلِحُ الْكَافِرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whoever worships any other object of worship along with Allaah, which he has no proof for, then his reckoning will be with his Lord, indeed the disbelievers will not prosper </strong></span>[23:117]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the <u>h</u>adeeth there occurs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Supplication is the core of worship”</span> </strong><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالَ رَبُّكُمُ ادْعُونِي أَسْتَجِبْ لَكُمْ ۚ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِي سَيَدْخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَاخِرِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord said, “Call upon Me, I will respond to you. Those who are too haughty and proud to worship Me will enter Hell-fire in disgrace.”</span> </strong>[40:60]<strong> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>14</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">14</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">.. وَقَالَ رَبُّكُمُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And your Lord has said …</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, your Lord has commanded you and said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">ادْعُونِي أَسْتَجِبْ لَكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Invoke and call upon Me, and I will respond to you</strong></span> [40:60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He has commanded making <em>du‘aa</em> (supplication) to Him, He the Perfect, and He has promised to respond, and this is from His generosity, He the Perfect and Most High, because of He has no need at all of our supplication, rather we need to make supplication to Him, He the Perfect and Most High. So He is commanding us with something which we need and which will be to our welfare. And He the Perfect becomes angry if you abandon making request of Him, whereas with regards to the creation, the creation becomes angry if you make request of him – therefore the poet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><em>Allaah becomes angry if you abandon asking Him<br />
But the children of Aadam, when you ask, he becomes angry.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="text-align:justify;">And another one said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><em>So if you were to ask the people only for some soil, they would almost<br />
When it was said, “Give it”, become irritated and withhold it</em></span></p>
<p><span style="text-align:justify;">So the people are of three categories:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first</strong>: are those who do not make <em>du‘aa</em> to Allaah at all, so he is too proud and haughty to worship Allaah.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second</strong>: is the one who makes <em>du‘aa</em> to Allaah, however, he makes supplication to other than Him also, so he is a <em>mushrik</em> (a person of <em>shirk</em>).</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third</strong>: is one who makes <em>du‘aa</em> to Allaah, making <em>du‘aa</em> purely and sincerely for Him, so he is a <em>muwa<u>hh</u>id</em> (a person of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>).</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the hadeeth that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الدعاء مخ العبادة</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“<em>Du‘aa</em> is the core of worship”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in one narration:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الدعاء هو العبادة</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“<em>Du‘aa</em> is worship”</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this shows the tremendousness of <em>du‘aa</em> and that it is the greatest of the types of worship because the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; مخ العبادة</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“… it is the core of worship”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in one narration:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الدعاء هو العبادة</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<em>Du‘aa</em> is worship”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the second narration is more authentic than the narration: الدعاء مخ العبادة  “<em>Du‘aa</em> is the core of worship”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the meaning is one and the same.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the <u>h</u>adeeth with its two narrations clearly shows how tremendous <em>du‘aa</em> is, and that it is the greatest of the types of worship. Just as he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الحج عرفة</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> is ‘Arafah”</strong><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning that the standing in ‘Arafah in <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> is the greatest pillar from the pillars of the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em>. It doesn’t mean that the whole of the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> is just ‘Arafah, but rather that the standing in ‘Arafah is the greatest of the pillars of the Hajj and likewise, worship is not restricted to just being <em>du‘aa</em>, but rather supplication is the greatest of its types. Therefore he said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الدعاء هو العبادة</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<em>Du‘aa</em> is worship”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To show the greatness of supplication, and to clearly show its status.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then the Shaikh <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> mentioned the proofs for the different types of worship which he mentioned, and they are <em>al-Khawf</em> (fear) and <em>ar-Rajaa’</em> (hope and longing) and <em>at-Tawakkul</em> (trust and reliance) and <em>ar-Raghbah</em> (fervent desire) and <em>ar-Rahbah</em> (dread) and <em>al-Khushoo‘</em> (reverence and humility) and <em>al-Khashyah</em> (awe) and <em>al-Inaabah</em> (turning repentantly) and <em>al-Isti‘aanah</em> (appealing for aid and assistance) and <em>al-Isti‘aadhah</em> (seeking refuge) and <em>al-Istighaathah</em> (seeking deliverence and rescue) and <em>adh-Dhab<u>h</u></em> (sacrificing) and <em>an-Nadhr</em> (making vows), and other than that from the types of worship which Allaah has commanded, all of them are to be done exclusively for Allaah.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by A<u>h</u>mad from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhumaa </em>and reported by Ibn Maajah and Ibn Khuzaimah from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Jaabir ibn ‘Abdillaah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhumaa</em>, and was declared <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> </em>by Shaikh Al-Albaanee</p>

<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ رَبَّكُمُ اللَّهُ الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ فِي سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ ثُمَّ اسْتَوَىٰ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ يُغْشِي اللَّيْلَ النَّهَارَ يَطْلُبُهُ حَثِيثًا وَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ وَالنُّجُومَ مُسَخَّرَاتٍ بِأَمْرِهِ ۗ أَلَا لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالْأَمْرُ ۗ تَبَارَكَ اللَّهُ رَبُّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed your Lord is Allaah, Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then He ascended upon the Throne. He causes the night to cover the day, it follows it swiftly, and the sun and the moon and the stars are subservient to His command. Certainly creation and commandment are His alone. Exalted is Allaah, the Lord of the whole of the creation.</span> [7:54] <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>8</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">8</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><em>Inna</em></strong>”: this is a particle for emphasis and it brings about the accusative case, and it is an introduction for an oath. An oath is to be understood as coming before it, which is taken to be, “By Allaah!”. “<strong><em>Inna Rabbakum</em></strong>”, (indeed your Lord): so this is the complement of the understood oath. “<em>Inna Rabbakum</em>”: meaning, your Creator and the One Who nurtured you with favours.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>… is Allaah</strong>”: not anyone else besides Him, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then He mentioned the proof for that saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The One Who created the heavens and the earth</span> </strong>[7:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the clear proof for the Lordship of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, that He created the heavens and the earth. No-one else created anything from either of them, and no-one helped Him, He the Perfect and Most High upon that. Rather He is alone in creating.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">He created the heavens and the earth</span> </strong>[7:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Does anyone from the people of shirk or the atheists oppose this and say, “Allaah did not create the heavens and the earth, rather the one who created them was so-and-so”, or, “I created them”, or “Such-and-such idol created them”? Has anyone from the creation said this in previous times or lately, even though this <em>aayah</em> is recited night and day, and no-one can oppose it, and nor will anyone ever be able to oppose it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> فِي سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ &#8211; </span></strong>“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>In six days</strong></span>”: these awe-inspiring and tremendous created things were created by Allaah in six days, and He was able to create them in a single moment, however He created them in six days for a wise purpose which is known to Him, He the Perfect and Most High. And the six days, the first of them was Sunday and the last of them was the day of Friday. So on the day of Friday the creation was completed, and therefore this day became the greatest of the days of the week. And it is the noblest one of the days, and it is the <em>‘Eed</em> of the week and it is the most excellent of the days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallaam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">خير يوم طلعت فيه الشمس يوم الجمعة</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The best day on which the sun has arisen, is the day of Friday”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Muslim and Aboo Daawood and At-Tirmidhee and An-Nasaa’ee from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because the creation of the creation was completed on it, and on it Aadam was created, and he was entered into paradise and he was sent down from it and on it the Last Hour will be established, all of that will be on the day of Friday, so it is the most excellent of the days, and it was the last of the days of the creation of the heavens and the earth and whatever they contain.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> ثُمَّ اسْتَوَىٰ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Then He ascended upon the Throne</span> </strong>[7:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This (i.e. <strong><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ  </span></strong>“<em>thumma</em>”) is a particle which joins and which indicates sequence, meaning that His Ascending upon the Throne came after the creation of the heavens and the earth because it is from the Attributes which are actions which Allaah does whenever He wishes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the meaning of <em>Istawaa’ </em>(He ascended upon) is: He ascended and was High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Al-‘Arsh</em></strong>: it is the ceiling of the created things. And it is in the language: <strong><em>as-Sareer</em> (</strong>a throne), and it is a Throne which has supports and is carried by the Angels and it is the greatest and most tremendous of the created things, and the highest one of the created things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Al-Istiwaa’</em> </strong>(ascending): is an Attribute from the Attributes of Allaah which are actions, as befits His Majesty, He the Perfect and Most High. It is not like the mounting of one created being upon another created object, and He has no need of the Throne since He is the One Who holds and maintains the Throne and other than it:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُمْسِكُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ أَن تَزُولَا ۚ وَلَئِن زَالَتَا إِنْ أَمْسَكَهُمَا مِنْ أَحَدٍ مِّن بَعْدِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah holds the heavens and the earth lest they should move away from their places, and if they were to move away from their places, then no-one else besides Him could hold them</span>. </strong>[35:41]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Throne is in need of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, since it is something created, and Allaah has no need of the Throne or anything else. However, He ascended upon it for a wise purpose which is known to Him, He the Perfect and Most High. And <strong><em>Al-Istiwaa’</em> </strong>(Ascending) is a type of <strong><em>Al-‘Uloow</em></strong> (being High and Exalted), however <em>Al-‘Uloow</em> is an Attribute of His Self. As for <em>Al-Istiwaa’</em> then it is an Attribute which is an action which He does whenever He wishes He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> يُغْشِي اللَّيْلَ النَّهَارَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He causes the night to cover the day </strong></span>[7:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He causes the night to be covered over with the day, and He causes the day to be covered over with the night so you see the creation being in light and then the night covers it over and it becomes dark, and the night is covered over by the day so it becomes bright.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> يَطْلُبُهُ حَثِيثًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>It pursues it swiftly </strong></span>[7:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This one comes after that one immediately and is not delayed. So when the night departs the day comes, and when they day departs the night comes right away, this one is not delayed after this one. And this is from the completeness of His Ability, He the Perfect and Most High, that this one does not lag behind that one. And the sun is the tremendous star which is well-known, and the moon is likewise a celestial body from the seven major celestial bodies which orbit around each one of them floats and orbits around the earth, and the earth is fixed and still, He made it settled – meaning settled and firm for the welfare of the servants, and the sun and the rest of the celestial bodies orbit around it, not as is said by the people of conjecture who now say, those who claim to have knowledge, they say that the sun is fixed and the earth orbits around it, this is the opposite of what occurs in the Qur’aan.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَالشَّمْسُ تَجْرِي لِمُسْتَقَرٍّ لَّهَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the sun runs on its fixed course to its appointed term </strong></span>[36:38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas they say the sun is fixed, O how Perfect is Allaah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the stars</strong></span>”: they are the stars, <strong>“they are subservient to His command</strong>”: they are subservient in their moving around and their orbiting continually and not slackening, and this a refutation of those who worship the sun and the moon and the stars, because they are subservient to the command of Allaah, they are under command. Allaah is the One Who causes them to move, and it is Allaah who can cause them to stop if He wishes, He the Perfect and Most High. So they are subservient, under control, they have no control at all over the affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He the Perfect commands them, so they proceed, and they orbit and they give off light in accordance with His creational command, He the Perfect and Most High. This one rises and this one sets, and they follow each other in  succession.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Ash-Shams</em> (the sun), and <em>Al-Qamar</em> (the moon) and <em>An-Nujoom</em> (the stars) are in the accusative case because of being conjoined, because <em>As-Samaawaat</em> (the heavens) was in the accusative case, because it was the object of the verb, and the sign that it is in the accusative case is that it has a <em>kasrah </em>upon it in place of the <em>fat-<u>h</u>ah, </em>because it is a sound feminine plural. And <em>Al-Ar<u>d</u></em> (the earth) is in the accusative case as is shown by the <em>fat-<u>h</u>ah, </em>then He said, “and the sun and the moon” &#8211; they are joined grammatically to something <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> which is in the accusative case and what is joined to something in the accusative case is itself in the accusative case.</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a>  i.e. they are ‘joined’ to the heavens grammatically.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>Musakhkharaatin</em></strong></span>”, (they are subservient): is the accusative case because it is the accusative of state or condition, meaning their condition is that they are subservient. And the sign that it is in the accusative case is a <em>kasrah</em> in place of a <em>fat-<u>h</u>ah</em>, because it is joined to a sound feminine plural.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَا لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالْأَمْرُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Certainly creation and commandment are His alone </strong></span>[7:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><em>Alaa</em></strong>”: is a term to draw attention and to affirm something.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“For Him”: meaning He the Perfect and Most High, not for anyone else besides Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Creation”: it is to bring something into existence, so He is the One Who is Fully Able to create whenever He wants to, He the Perfect and Most High, He creates whatever He wishes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And the command”: His command, He the Perfect and Most High, and it is His speech, He the Perfect and Most High, His creational command and His legislational command.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>His Creational Command:</strong> that which He has commanded the created beings with and they obey Him in it and respond to Him, such as His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَقَالَ لَهَا وَلِلْأَرْضِ ائْتِيَا طَوْعًا أَوْ كَرْهًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So He said to it </strong>(the heavens)<strong> and to the earth, come about both of you willingly or unwillingly </strong></span>[41:11]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He commanded the two of them He the Perfect, and this was a creational command which He commanded the heavens and the earth with, so they came into being.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّمَا أَمْرُهُ إِذَا أَرَادَ شَيْئًا أَن يَقُولَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>His command is just that when He wants something He says to it “Be!”, and it is.</strong></span> [36:82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is Allaah’s Creational Command.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As for His Legislational Command: </strong>then it is His revelation which was sent down by which He commands His servants. He commands them to worship Him, He commands them with the prayer, He commands them with the <em>Zakaat</em>, He commands them with dutifulness to the parents, this is His Legislational Command. Entering into it are His commands and prohibitions which are in the honourable Qur’aan and in the Prophetic <em>Sunnah</em>. This is from the command of Allaah the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And since creation and commandment are for Him, then what remains for other than Him, He the Perfect and Most High? And therefore Ibn ‘Umar said when he recited this <em>aayah</em>, “Whoever has  something then let him seek after it”. And the <em>aayah</em> proves the difference between creating and commanding, so it contains a refutation of those who say that the Qur’aan is created, because the Qur’aan is from the command, and Allaah’s command is not a created thing, since Allaah made a difference between creating and between commanding. So He made them two separate things, and the Qur’aan enters into His command, so it is not something created.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is what Imaam Ahmad used to overcome the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> in argument when they requested from him that he should say that the Qur’aan was something created. He said, “Is the Qur’aan from the creation or from the command?” They responded, “<strong>The Qur’aan is from His command</strong>.” He said, “The command is something different to the creation. Allaah made a difference between this and between the creation. So He made the creation one thing and His command something else.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The command is His speech, and as for the creation then it is His bringing into existance and making something. There is a difference between them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>Tabaarak Allaah</em></strong></span>”: means: tremendously great is the One whose actions are these, He the Perfect and Most High. And whose Ability is such and these are the things which He has created, He the Exalted and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“<em>Tabaarak</em>”</strong></span>: is a verb which is used specifically for Him, He the Perfect, so it cannot be applied to anyone besides Him. And <em>al-Barakah</em> (blessing) it means abundance of good and its increase, and the blessings which come from Allaah the Majestic and Most High do not end. As for a created being, it cannot be said about him, “<em>tabaarak</em>”. Rather it can be said to him, “<em>mubaarak</em>” meaning, “May you receive blessing”, meaning may Allaah put blessing into him and make him blessed. And all blessing is from Allaah the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>The Lord of the whole of creation</strong>”: just as preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this <em>aayah</em> contains affirmation of <em>at-Taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of Allaah’s Lordship and <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of Allaah’s right to worship, as has preceded.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Proof for His Lordship and His Divinity and Right to All Worship, He the Perfect and Most High</strong></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ اللَّيْلُ وَالنَّهَارُ وَالشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ ۚ لَا تَسْجُدُوا لِلشَّمْسِ وَلَا لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُوا لِلَّهِ الَّذِي خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And from His signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate to the sun nor to the moon, but rather prostrate to Allaah, the One Who created them if you truly worship Him.</span> </strong>[41:37] <sup>7</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a proof for His <em>Ruboobiyyah</em> (Lordship) and <em>Ilaahiyyah</em> (Divinity and Right to Worship), He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ اللَّيْلُ وَالنَّهَارُ وَالشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And from His signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon </strong></span>[41:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sun and the moon: the sun is the tremedous star which gives light to the creation, as a lamp burning and shining, just as Allaah the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَجَعَلْنَا سِرَاجًا وَهَّاجًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We have made it</strong></span> <span style="color:#008000;">(the sun)<strong> a lamp, burning and shining.</strong></span> [78:13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the moon is a light which brightens the night-time and gives light to the pathway of the people. And from their benefits also is the well-being of the creation through its trees and its fruits and oceans. So if the sun were hidden away from the creation, then the creation would suffer harm, and many of the means of livelihood and their welfare would be corrupted and if the moon were hidden away, then likewise. The moon also brings about benefit for their fruits and their trees, along with what it contains also from awareness of reckoning (of time periods). He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">هُوَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ الشَّمْسَ ضِيَاءً وَالْقَمَرَ نُورًا وَقَدَّرَهُ مَنَازِلَ لِتَعْلَمُوا عَدَدَ السِّنِينَ وَالْحِسَابَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We made the moon a light and appointed set phases for it so that you should know the number of years and the reckoning of the months days and hours. </strong></span>[10:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْأَهِلَّةِ ۖ قُلْ هِيَ مَوَاقِيتُ لِلنَّاسِ وَالْحَجِّ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They ask you about the crescent moons, then say: They are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the Hajj </strong></span>[2:189]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the crescent moons bring benefit for awareness of time-periods and deadlines, deadlines for debts and deadlines for the waiting periods of the women, and the set times for acts of worship and fasting and Hajj, all of them are known by reckoning based upon these two lights, the sun and the moon. So the solar reckoning and the lunar reckoning contain many benefits for all of the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from those things which He has created are the seven heavens. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُ الَّذِي خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَاوَاتٍ وَمِنَ الْأَرْضِ مِثْلَهُنَّ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah is the One Who created seven heavens, and their like from the earth. </strong></span>[65:12]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِي خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَاوَاتٍ طِبَاقًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah the One Who created seven heavens in levels </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(one above the other)</span> [67:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Each being above the other, the lowest heaven, then the one which follows it up until the seventh one. And above them all is the Throne of the Most Merciful, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the earths are seven just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> الْأَرْضِ مِثْلَهُنَّ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And their like from the earth </strong></span>[65:12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they are seven levels or layers also, and every level from the levels of the seven heavens and the earths have inhabitants and occupants. And whatever planets and stars are in the heavens the sun and the moon and whatever is in the earth from created things from animals with their different types and from mountains and trees and rocks and minerals and oceans. These are from the signs of Allaah the Perfect and Most High, the creational signs, which are seen and witnessed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said: and the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ اللَّيْلُ وَالنَّهَارُ وَالشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ ۚ لَا تَسْجُدُوا لِلشَّمْسِ وَلَا لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُوا لِلَّهِ الَّذِي خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And from His signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate to the sun nor to the moon, but rather prostrate to Allaah, the One Who created them if you truly worship Him.</span> </strong>[41:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from His signs is the night: meaning from His signs which prove Lordship and His Ability and His sole right to worship to the exclusion of all else besides Him, is the night which brings darkness, and the daytime which brings light to the whole of the creation. This is from the amazing signs of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So who can make the whole of the creation dark, all at once, and then make the whole of the creation bright, all at once? He is Allaah the Perfect and Most High. If all of the creation were to gather together to make one part of the earth bright, they would not be able except to make a restricted area bright, if they brought all the electrical generators which are in the world, all of them, they could not make bright except a restricted portion of the earth. As for the sun and the moon then they bring light to the whole of the earth, the night and the day follow each other in succession, and the sun and the moon likewise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَا تَسْجُدُوا لِلشَّمْسِ وَلَا لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُوا لِلَّهِ الَّذِي خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do not prostrate to the sun nor to the moon, but rather prostrate to Allaah, the One Who created them, if it is He that you truly worship. </strong></span>[41:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a nullification of <em>shirk</em>: Do not prostrate to created things. Since from the greatest of the created things are the sun and the moon, and because the people of shirk, they used to worship the sun and prostrate to it, and from them were those who used to worship the moon and the stars, such as the people of Ibraaheem, they would build for them temples in the form of the stars and they would worship them. So His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَا تَسْجُدُوا لِلشَّمْسِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do not prostrate to the sun</span> </strong>[41:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>As-Sujood</em> means placing the forehead upon the ground in humble submission to the one who is worshipped, and it is the greatest of the types of worship, and Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallaam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أقرب ما يكون العبد من ربه وهو ساجد</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The closest that the servant comes to his Lord is whilst he is in prostration” </strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a>  Reported by Muslim (482) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu</em>. [And the narration of Muslim has a completion at the end, “So therefore make plentiful supplication.”]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the greatest of the types of worship is prostration upon the ground, since your face is the thing which you cherish the most, you have placed it for Allaah upon the ground, as an act of worship for Allaah and in submission before Him, He the Perfect and Most High. This is true prostration, and it is not befitting to perform it as worship except for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for prostrating to the sun and the moon, then it is prostration to a created thing, which does not have the right to be prostrated to. So it is not permissible to prostrate to created things, but rather prostration is only for the Creator of the created things. As for the created things, then they are just like you, something created, something managed and controlled. Would you prostrate to a created being who is incapable, just the same as you? This is not permissible. Where have the intellects gone?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prostration is only deserved by the Creator, He the Perfect and Most High, who is not rendered incapable by anything. So prostration is the right of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, it is not the right of the creation, no matter how great and large the created being is, it is still a created being who is weak and managed and controlled.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَا تَسْجُدُوا لِلشَّمْسِ وَلَا لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُوا لِلَّهِ الَّذِي خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do not prostrate to the sun nor to the moon, but rather prostrate to Allaah, the One Who created them, if it is He that you truly worship.</strong></span> [41:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is obligatory is that we do not worship except Allaah. So if you make prostration to Him and you also prostrate to other than Him, then you are not worshippers of Allaah with correct worship. Rather you are worshipping Him along with <em>shirk</em>, and <em>shirk</em> corrupts and destroys worship.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فإذَا قيلَ لكَ بما عرفْتَ ربَّك؟ فقُل بآياتِه ومخلوقاتِه</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So if it is said to you, “How did you come to know of your Lord”, then say, “through His Signs and those things which He has created” </strong></span><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">5</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have said, “<strong>My Lord is Allaah</strong>”, or, “<strong>My Lord is Allaah Who nurtured me with His favours</strong>”. So what is the proof that Allaah is your Lord who nurtured you with His favours? So the Shaikh brought proofs from the revelation and from the intellect as will follow. So if it is said to you, “<strong>How did you come to know of your Lord?”</strong>, because whoever claims something, then he must establish proof upon his claim:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>And claims if the people do not establish proof</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em> For them, then their people are mere claimants</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everyone who makes a claim must establish the proof for his claim, otherwise his claim will not be correct. You have said, “<strong>My Lord is Allaah who nurtured me and nurtured the whole of the creation through His favours</strong>”. What is the proof? Then say, “<strong>The proof is His Signs and those things which He has created</strong>”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Aayaat</em> is the plural of <em>aayah </em>and the word <em>aayah</em> in the language is a sign showing something and indicating something, just as he <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">آية المنافق ثلاث</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The <em>aayah</em> (sign) of the hypocrite is in three”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by al-Bukhaaree (33) and by Muslim (59) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning his sign.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>through His Signs</strong></span>”: meaning the Signs and the proofs which indicate Him, He the Perfect and Most High. So all of these created beings which you see, all of them were non-existent, and then Allaah produced them and created them by His Ability, He the Perfect and Most High. And from them are created beings which are constantly renewed such as plants and the newborn, and things which were not present and then they came about, and you look upon them – who is the one who created them? He is Allaah the Perfect and Most High. Do they create themselves?, did anyone from mankind create them? No-one can claim this, and no-one is able to claim it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْ خُلِقُوا مِنْ غَيْرِ شَيْءٍ أَمْ هُمُ الْخَالِقُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْ خَلَقُوا السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ ۚ بَل لَّا يُوقِنُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Or were they created without any creator, or are they themselves the creators, or did they create the heavens and the earth? Rather they do not have certain faith </strong></span>[52:35-36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These things did not produce themselves, nor were they produced by others from the created beings at all, and no-one can ever create a tree or a gnat or a fly:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ لَن يَخْلُقُوا ذُبَابًا وَلَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا لَهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those whom you call upon besides Allaah, they can never create even a fly, even if they gathered together to do it</span> </strong>[22:73]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this creation proves the Creator, He the Perfect and Most High, and therefore, <span style="color:#333399;">when it was said unexpectedly to the bedouin man, “How did you come to know about your Lord?”. He responded, “The piece of camel dung proves that there is a camel, and the footprint proves that there is a man who is travelling. Does not this creation prove, the One Who is Subtle and Kind, the One Who is All-Aware?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when you see a footprint upon the ground, does it not prove to you that someone has walked upon this ground, if you see a piece of camel dung does it not prove to you that there are camels upon this land or that a camel has passed by? A piece of camel dung proves that there has been a camel, and a footprint prove that somebody has passed by.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ومِنْ آياتِه الليلُ والنهارُ والشمسُ والقمرُ، ومِنْ مخلوقاتِه السمواتُ السَّبْعُ والأَرْضُونَ السَّبع ومَا فيهنَّ وما بينهما</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And from His Signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon, and from that which He has created are the seven heavens and the seven earths and whatever is within them and whatever is between them.</strong></span><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">6</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And from His Signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon</strong>”: so the <em>aayaat</em> (Signs) are of two categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first category: <span style="color:#000000;"><em>Ayaatun Kawniyyah</em></span></strong>, His Signs within the creation which we can see, such as the heavens and the earth and the stars and the sun and the moon and the mountains and the trees and the oceans. They are called Signs because they contain signs proving their Creator, He the Perfect and Most High, and therefore poet Abul-Ataahiyah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>So how strange, how can the One deserving worship be disobeyed</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Or how can the one who denies deny Him?</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em> </em><em>When everything contains a Sign for Him</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em> Proving that He is One</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>And there is a witness for Allaah in every movement</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em> And every stillness of the creation</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can anyone deny Allaah the Majestic and Most High and saying there is no Lord for this whole creation, and that these created beings came about without any creator. And if they did come about through a creator, then who is this creator besides Allaah the Majestic and Most High, explain to me. You will not find a creator besides Allaah the Perfect and Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْ جَعَلُوا لِلَّهِ شُرَكَاءَ خَلَقُوا كَخَلْقِهِ فَتَشَابَهَ الْخَلْقُ عَلَيْهِمْ ۚ قُلِ اللَّهُ خَالِقُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَهُوَ الْوَاحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Or do they set up partners for Allaah who create with the like of His creation so that the creation is obscured for them. Say: Allaah is the Creator of everything and He is the One, the Overwhelming Subduer </strong></span>[13:16]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second category: <span style="color:#000000;"><em>al-Aayaat-ul-Qur’aaniyyah</em></span></strong>, <em>aayahs</em> of the Qur’aan which are recited from the revelation which has been sent down to the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam, </em>all of these prove the existence of the Lord, the Perfect and Most High, and His Perfection and His Attributes and His Names, and that He is the One deserving of worship, He alone with no partner, all of them prove that, the creational Signs and the <em>aayahs</em> of the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The creational Signs prove their Creator, and the One Who brought them into existence and the One Who controls them. And the <em>aayahs</em> of the Qur’aan contain the command to worship Allaah and they contain affirmation of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of Lordship and using it as a proof for <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of worship. And the command to worship Allaah the Perfect and Most High, all of the Qur’aan is concentrated upon this meaning and it was sent down for this meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from His Signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon, these are from the greatest Signs of Allaah the Perfect and Most High, the dark night which covers this creation, and the bright day which brings light to this creation, so that they can go about for their work. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِن جَعَلَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمُ اللَّيْلَ سَرْمَدًا إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ مَنْ إِلَٰهٌ غَيْرُ اللَّهِ يَأْتِيكُم بِضِيَاءٍ ۖ أَفَلَا تَسْمَعُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِن جَعَلَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمُ النَّهَارَ سَرْمَدًا إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ مَنْ إِلَٰهٌ غَيْرُ اللَّهِ يَأْتِيكُم بِلَيْلٍ تَسْكُنُونَ فِيهِ ۖ أَفَلَا تُبْصِرُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِن رَّحْمَتِهِ جَعَلَ لَكُمُ اللَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ لِتَسْكُنُوا فِيهِ وَلِتَبْتَغُوا مِن فَضْلِهِ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: Do you see if Allaah made the night continuous upon you until the Day of Resurrection, what deity besides Allaah could bring you light? Will you not then listen? </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: Do you see if Allaah made the day continuous upon you until the Day of Resurrection, what deity besides Allaah could bring you night-time in which you could rest? Will you not see? </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And from His Mercy upon you is that He has made the night and the day so that you may rest therein and seek of His bounty and that you should be thankful. </strong></span>[28:71-73]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is from the greatest of the Signs of Allaah, this night and this day. The whole time is not night and the whole of time is not day, because if that were the case then the welfare of the people would be lost and they would become fatigued.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah made the night and the day to follow each other in succession for them and then the night and the day are ordered, neither of them clashes nor do they alter, upon a single ordered system which proves the wisdom of the All-Wise One, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The actions of the servants and that which they make end in destruction, and they clash with each other whatever they may be and they stop working.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the things created by Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, then they do not become destroyed, except at the time when Allaah permits their destruction. So the night and the day continue, neither of them ceases working, whereas things made by the creation stop working and come to destruction and perish no matter how strong they are and how large they are.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how many abandoned cars do you see and planes and ships even though they were strong and had been taken care of, yet they end in destruction and they stop working. Does the night-time stop working or does the day-time stop working? No, because its maker has full Ability and is All-Wise, He the Majestic and Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">صُنْعَ اللَّهِ الَّذِي أَتْقَنَ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The creation of Allaah who has made everything firmly and precisely. </strong></span>[27:88]</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وكلُّ ما سِوَى اللهِ عالََمٌ وأنا واحدٌ من ذلكَ العالَمِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And everything besides Allaah is a created being, and I am one of those created beings.</strong></span><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Shaikh <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullah</em>, explained the manner in which this <em>aayah</em> is used as an evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his saying, “<strong>And everything besides Allaah is a created being, and I am one of those created beings</strong>.”: so therefore Allaah is my Lord, because Allaah is the Lord of all of the created beings and I am one of the created beings. So no-one is able to say, “I have a lord besides the Lord of the creation”, neither an unbeliever nor a Muslim. This will not be possible ever and no person with intellect will say it. This is a proof for the <em>Ruboobiyyah</em> (Lordship) of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and since He is the Lord of the whole of the creation, then therefore He is the One deserving worship, and this nullifies the worship of others besides Him, He the Perfect and Most High, and therefore after it He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You alone do we worship and Your aid alone do we seek. </strong></span>[1:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates restriction, because the fact that the governed word is brought forward, “<em>Iyyaaka</em>”, and the governing verb <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>نَعْبُدُ</strong> </span>is put back, indicates restriction. So, “You, we worship”, is different to, “we worship you”, because saying, “we worship”, this is merely affirmation. However, “You, we worship”, this includes negation and affirmation, meaning, “we do not worship anyone else besides you”. And worship will not be correct except with negation and affirmation, and it is the meaning of <em>Laa ilaaha illallaah</em>, for it contains negation and affirmation, a negation for the right to be worshipped from everything else besides Allaah, and affirmation of it for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>

<p>Previous Class: <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/04/23/three-fundamental-principles-which-must-be-known/">These Three Fundamental Principles have Tremendous Importance</a></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فإذا قيلَ لكَ: مَنْ رَبُّكَ؟ فقلْ ربي اللهُ الذي ربّاني ورَبَّى جميعَ العالمينَ بنعمِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>So if it is said to you, “Who is your Lord?”, then say, “My Lord is Allaah who nurtured me and all of the creation with His favours.”</b></span></span><b> </b><strong><sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> having explained the three fundamental principles in general terms, wanted to explain them in detail one by one, with their evidences from the Book and the Sunnah, and from Allaah’s signs within the creation, and from the intellectual evidences. And it is likewise obligatory to base creed and belief upon proofs from the Book and the Sunnah, and upon examination of the signs which Allaah has placed within the creation so that it should be firmly grounded and firmly established in the heart and so that all doubts are removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for creed and beliefs based upon <em>shubuhaat</em> (incorrect suspicions) and upon doubts and upon sayings of the people and upon blind-following, then these will be beliefs which are short-lived and will not remain firmly established, and they will be open to being disproven and they will be open to being totally refuted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So creed and belief and the rest of the rulings of the legislation are not established except with proofs of the Book and the Sunnah and with accepted intellectual proofs. And therefore the Shaikh <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> he quoted many proofs for these three fundamental principles, so no principle from them occurs except that he has support it with evidences and proofs about which there is certainty which repel doubts and false desires and which firmly implant the creed and belief in the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, “<strong>So if it is said to you</strong>”: meaning if you are asked about your Lord, and this is a question which will occur, you will be indeed asked about it in this world and in the hereafter, so it is essential that you have knowledge of your Lord the Mighty and Majestic, and that you respond with the correct response based upon <strong>certainty</strong> and <strong>clear proof</strong>. So then say, “<strong>My Lord is Allaah</strong>”, this is the answer, “<strong>the One Who nurtured me and nurtured the whole of the creation with His favours</strong>.” This is using an intellectual proof.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <strong><em>Ar-Rabb</em></strong>, the Lord the Majestic and Most High, He is the One who nurtures all of His servants with His favours and nourishes them with the provision which He gives. He creates them after they were previously nothing mentioned, they were in the wombs of their mothers, in one form of creation after another within three depths of darkness. And He causes provision to reach them, even in the wombs of their mothers, and therefore the body of the fetus develops in the womb of the mother and grows larger, because the provision from Allaah the Perfect and Most High reaches it and nourishment reaches it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the soul is breathed into it so it moves and it comes to life, by the permission of Allaah. This is <em>tarbiyyah</em> (nurturing) in the womb. Then when it comes out, then Allaah the Perfect nurtures it with His favours giving it health and well-being and He causes the milk of its mother to flow for it, so it is nourished until it can eat food and can do without milk. Then little by little its intellect grows and its hearing and seeing develops, it develops little by little until it reaches puberty then it develops further until it reaches its full strength, until it reaches forty years old and it is at the limit of its strength.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So who is it that nourishes it from the day when He created it in the womb of its mother until it dies, who is it who nourishes it, then who is it who causes this food and this drink to be digested and absorbed in its body so that it reaches every cell and every muscle and every place in its body, who is it who makes food and drink appetizing for it, who is it who causes that to pass through and who removes what is harmful from it, who is it who does this and nurtures this human being, is it not Allaah the Perfect and Most High? This is the Lord the Perfect and Most High, the one who nurtures, He is the one who nurtured me and nurtured all of the created beings by His favours.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everything upon the face of the earth from the realms of humans and animals and the realm of the land and the sea, from the greatest created thing to the smallest created thing upon the land and the sea, all of them are nourished by His favours and His provision. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمَّنْ هَٰذَا الَّذِي يَرْزُقُكُمْ إِنْ أَمْسَكَ رِزْقَهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Or who is it that could give you provision if your Lord were to withold the provision which He gives to you?</span> </strong>[67:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا مِن دَابَّةٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ إِلَّا عَلَى اللَّهِ رِزْقُهَا وَيَعْلَمُ مُسْتَقَرَّهَا وَمُسْتَوْدَعَهَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And there is no creature upon the earth except that its provision is dependent upon Allaah and He knows its dwelling place and its resting place.</span> </strong>[11:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَكَأَيِّن مِّن دَابَّةٍ لَّا تَحْمِلُ رِزْقَهَا اللَّهُ يَرْزُقُهَا وَإِيَّاكُمْ ۚ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And how many a creature there is which does not carry its own provision. Allaah provides for it and for you. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.</span> </strong>[29:60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Lord, the One free of all imperfections:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">ذَٰلِكُمُ اللَّهُ رَبُّكُمْ فَاعْبُدُوهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">That is Allaah your Lord so worship Him alone.</span> </strong>[10:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for other than Allaah the Majestic and Most High, then it does not possess and have ability over anything from that, neither the idols nor anything else, no-one else possesses and has ability over granting provision, rather it is one who is provided for, it is a created being like yourself.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And He is the One Whom I worship and there is no other whom I worship besides Him, and the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</span></strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">All praise is for Allaah the Lord of the whole of creation</span> </strong>[1:2]<strong> <sup>3</sup></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And He is the One Whom I worship</strong>”: the Lord, the One who is like this He is the One who deserves worship from me and from other than me. Then the Shaikh also draws attention to the fact that it is not sufficient to affirm <em>Ruboobiyyah</em> (Allaah’s Lordship), it is not sufficient that you say, “My Lord is Allaah who nurtured me with His favours.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is not sufficient, you must acknowledge His right to all worship, and you must make all worship purely and sincerely for Him. And this is the difference between the person of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and the person of <em>shirk</em>. So the person of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> affirms the Lordship of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and he affirms His sole right to worship, He alone with no partner, whereas the person of <em>shirk, </em>he affirms the Lordship of Allaah, however he is one who associates others along with Him in his worship of Him. He associates along with Him those who do not create and do not provide provision and do not possess anything. This is the difference between the person of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and the person of <em>shirk</em>. The person of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> says, “My Lord is Allaah and He is the One Whom I worship, and I have no other one whom I worship besides Him.”, whereas the person of <em>shirk</em>, he says, “My Lord is Allaah.” However worship with him is not solely for Allaah, so he worships along with Allaah, trees and rocks and beloved servants of Allaah and righteous people and graves. So he becomes a person of <em>shirk</em>, and the affirmation of Lordship does not benefit him, and it does not enter him into Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his saying, “<strong>And He is the One Whom I worship</strong>”: meaning the Deity Whom I worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, “<strong>And I have no other whom I worship besides Him</strong>”: neither from the Angels nor from the Messengers nor from the righteous people nor from trees nor rocks nor anything else, I have nothing which I worship besides Him, He the Perfect and Most High. This is affirmation of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> with the proof, and this is an intellectual proof, and then he mentioned the textual proof the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">All Praise is for Allaah, the Lord and Nurturer of the whole of the creation.</span> </strong>[1:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This aayah is the start of the Qur’aan in the <em>Mus-haf </em>(written copy of the Qur’aan), there is nothing before it except for, “In the Name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.” And it is the conclusion of the speech of the people of Paradise, He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَآخِرُ دَعْوَاهُمْ أَنِ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the conclusion of their call will be that all Praise is for Allaah, the Lord of the whole of creation</span> </strong>[10:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Majestic and Most High began this creation with this phrase.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ وَجَعَلَ الظُّلُمَاتِ وَالنُّورَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">All praise is for Allaah He Who created the heavens and the earth and made the darkness and the light.</span> </strong>[6:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He will conclude the creation with it. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَقُضِيَ بَيْنَهُم بِالْحَقِّ وَقِيلَ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And judgement will be passed upon them all with justice, and judgement will be concluded by its being said that all praise is for Allaah the Lord of creation</span> </strong>[39:75]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He began the creation with it and He concluded with it, so it is a tremendous saying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying He the Most High, “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>Al-<u>H</u>amd</em>”</strong></span>: it is praise of the One Who is being praised along with love of Him and veneration of Him. And the, “<em>Al-</em>”, in, “<em>Al-<u>H</u>amd</em>”, is to make it totally comprehensive, meaning all praise is for Allaah, it belongs to Him and He is deserving of it, so He is the One Who deserves total and unrestricted praise. As for other than him, then he can be praised in accordance with the level of the fine and good things which he does. As for total and unrestricted and complete praise then it is for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, because favours, all of them are from Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And even the created being if he does something good to you, then it is from Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, He is the One Who caused this created being to do something useful for you, and He is the One Who enabled him to do good for you, so indeed praise returns to Allaah the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, “<strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Lillaah</em></span></strong>”: the <em>jaar</em> and the <em>majroor</em> are connected to something left unmentioned which is the predicate for the subject. So the phrase means: praise exists or is confirmed for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And, “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allaah</strong></span>”: means, the One possessing Divinity and the right to be worshipped over the whole of His creation. And this Name, no-one else besides Him, He the Perfect can be called it, no-one can be called Allaah. Even the Pharoah, he did not say, “I am Allaah”, rather he said, “I am your Lord”. So this Name is particular to Allaah, no-one can ever be called it, and no-one has the audacity to say, “I am Allaah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Rabbi</em></span></strong>”: this is a qualifying noun for Allaah’s Name, and it is in the genitive case and it is a governing noun.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Al-‘Aalameen</em></span></strong>”: is a governed noun in the genitive case, and the sign that it is in the genitive case is the, “<em>yaa</em>”. Because it it joined to the sound masculine plural.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is clear that praise, all of it, and extolling, all of it, is for Allaah the Lord of the whole of creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the world of the Angels and the world of inanimate objects and of birds and the world of beasts of prey and the world of animals and the world of insects and of ants and the many worlds or realms of creation that there are upon the land and in the sea, they are not known except to Allaah, and no-one can enumerate them except Allaah. All of them, Allaah is their Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Rabb-ul-‘Aalameen</em></span></strong>”, (the Lord of all of the creation): this cannot be applied except to Allaah the Perfect the Mighty and Majestic. It is not possible for anyone to be called, “<em>Rabb-ul-‘Aalameen</em>”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if it said, “<strong><em>Ar-Rabb</em></strong>”, (<em>The</em> Lord): then this cannot be used except for Allaah the Majestic and Most High, it cannot be used except for Him. As for a created being, then the term can be used restrictedly so that it is said, <em>Rabb-ad-Daar</em> “the master of the house”, or, “the owner of the animal”, meaning its owner and its master.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fourth Treatise: The Three Fundamental Principles Which it is Obligatory to Have Knowledge of.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Fundamental Principle: Knowledge and Awareness of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَإِذَا قِيلَ لَكَ مَا هي الأُصُولُ الثلاثةُ التي تجبُ معرفتُها؟ فقُلْ معرِفةُ العبدِ رَبَّهُ، ودينَهُ، ونبيَّهُ محمدًا صلى الله عليه وسلم</span><strong> </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So if it is said to you, “What are the three fundamental principles which must be known?”, then say, “The servant’s knowledge of his Lord, and his Religion, and his Prophet Muhammad</strong> <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>.</span> <strong><sup>1</sup> </strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong>[1]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong><em>al-U<u>s</u>ool </em>(fundamental principles)</strong>”, this is the plural of <em>a<u>s</u>l </em>which is that which something else is built upon. And the word <em>far’ </em>(branch or detail) is that which is built upon something else. Therefore these (matters) are called <em>u<u>s</u>ool </em>because other matters from the religion are built upon them. Therefore they are called <em>u<u>s</u>ool </em>because the matter of the religion is built upon them. And the whole of the religion pivots upon these three fundamentals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#000000;">معرِفةُ العبدِ رَبَّهُ </span>“The servant’s knowledge of his Lord”</strong>: <em>Rabbahu </em>(his Lord) is in the accusative case because it is the object of <em>ma’rifah </em>(knowledge) because the verbal noun <em>ma’rifah </em>(knowledge) is attached to the active particle <em>‘abd </em>(servant). And the verbal noun, if attached to something, acts in the manner of its verb according to the scholars of the Arabic grammar. So the verbal noun here is attached and acts in the manner of the verb.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And his Religion and his Prophet”</strong>: This is joined – meaning: to the <em>man<u>s</u>oob </em>(accusative). These are the fundamentals of the religion in general, and their details will follow in the speech of the Shaykh <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah </em>if Allaah wishes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why are these three fundamental principles specifically mentioned? Because they are the foundations of the religion of Islaam and because they are the matters about which the servant will be asked when he is placed in his grave. (This is) because the servant when he is placed in his grave and earth has been laid over him and the people have departed from him returning to their families, then two angels will come to him in the grave and his soul will be returned to his body and he will be given the life of the <em>barzakh</em> (transitional period between this life and the Hereafter); it is not a life like the life of this world. It is a life which Allaah knows best about. So they will make him sit up in his grave and they will say to him, “Who is your Lord and what is your religion and who is your prophet?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the believer will say, “My Lord is Allaah and my religion is Islaam and Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> is my prophet.” So it will be said to him, “How did you know that?” So he will say, “I read the Book of Allaah so I understood it and I knew.” So then a caller will call out, “My servant has spoken the Truth.” So they will lay out for him a bed from Paradise and there will open for him a door to Paradise and his grave will be extended for him as far as the eye can see and the fragrance of Paradise and its gentle breeze will come upon him. So he will look to his living place in Paradise and he will say, “O my Lord, establish the Hour so that I can return to my family and my wealth.”<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the doubter who lived upon misgivings and doubt and lack of certainty even if he claimed to be upon Islaam, if he had doubts and misgivings about the Religion of Allaah like the <em>munaafiq </em>(hypocrite) he will stutter. So when they say to him, “Who is your Lord?” He will say, “I don’t know.” And when they say, “What is your Religion?” He will say, “I don’t know.” And when it is said: “Who is your Prophet?” He will say, “I don’t know. Haah, haah, I don’t know, I heard the people saying something so I said it.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by al Bukhaaree in abridged from the <u>h</u>adeeth of Anas (1338) and Muslim (2870).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: that in the <em>dunyaa </em>(world) he would just say whatever the people said, without having <em>eemaan </em> &#8211; and Allaah’s refuge is sought. This hypocrite who outwardly displayed Islaam, whilst he did not believe it in his heart; rather he outwardly showed it to gain worldly benefits, so he said in the world, “My Lord is Allaah”, but he did not truly believe it; his heart denied it, and Allaah’s refuge is sought. He used to say, “My religion is Islaam”, but he did not have <em>eemaan </em>in Islaam; his heart denied it! He used to say, “My prophet is Mu<u>h</u>ammad<em> <u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>”, but he did not truly believe in the messengership of Mu<u>h</u>ammad in his heart! Rather he said it upon his tongue only  &#8211; this is the <em>munaafiq </em>(hypocrite). So it will be said to him: “You did not know and you did not read!” So he will be struck with an iron sledgehammer which will cause him to scream in such a manner that if men and jinn were to hear it, they would drop down dead. It will be heard by everything except for mankind; if he were to hear it he would drop down dead – meaning, he would die from terror. He will be crushed in his grave until his ribs cross over and a gate to the Fire will be opened for him and its fierce and poisonous wind will come upon him and its heat. And he will say, “O my Lord, do not establish the Hour!” This will be his life and his condition in the grave &#8211; and Allaah’s refuge is sought – because he did not give the correct answer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore a caller will call out, “My servant has lied”. So they will lay out for him a bed from the Fire and they will open for him a door to the Fire  &#8211; and Allaah’s refuge is sought. So since these matters are this important it is obligatory upon us to learn them and to hold them as our creed and belief. And it is not sufficient just to learn them alone; rather we learn them and we hold them as our creed, and we have <em>eemaan </em>in them and we act upon them for as long as we live, hoping that Allaah makes us firm at the questioning in the grave. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يُثَبِّتُ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا بِالْقَوْلِ الثَّابِتِ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَفِي الْآخِرَةِ ۖ وَيُضِلُّ اللَّهُ الظَّالِمِينَ ۚ وَيَفْعَلُ اللَّهُ مَا يَشَاءُ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah makes firm those who truly believe with the firm saying in the life of this world and in the Hereafter. And Allaah misguides the disbelieving wrongdoers. And Allaah does whatever He wishes. </strong></span>[14:27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these three fundamental principles have tremendous importance, and therefore the Shaykh focused upon them in this treatise and he clarified them so that we should study them and carefully examine them and so that we should hold them as our creed and belief and act upon them hoping that Allaah should make us and you firm with the firm saying in the life of this world and in the Hereafter.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>And the most serious thing which He forbade is <em>shirk</em></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وهو دعوةُ غيرهِ معهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And it is to call upon other than Him along with Him.</span></strong><sup>19</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan’s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the definition of <em>shirk</em>: it is to call upon other than Him along with Him – meaning that something from <em>‘ibaadah </em>(worship) is directed to other than Allaah, whether it be (to) an angel from the angels or a prophet from the prophets or a righteous person from the righteous people or a building from the buildings or other than that from all the created beings. So whoever directs anything from worship to other than Allaah, then this is the greatest thing that Allaah has forbidden. This is <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So know the explanation of <em>tawheed </em>and the explanation of <em>shirk </em>because there are from the people those who explain <em>tawheed </em>with other than its true explanation and those who explain <em>shirk </em>with other than its true explanation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the people are those who say, “<em>Shirk </em>is<em> shirk </em>with regards to <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/01/17/haakimiyyahalbaani/"><em><u>H</u>aakimiyyah </em>(judgement and legislation)</a>”. And this has appeared now unfortunately. <em>Al-<u>H</u>ukm bi ghayri ma anzal Allaah  </em>(judging by other than that which Allaah sent down) is a type from the types of <em>shirk </em>called <em>shirk-ut-<u>T</u>aa‘ah </em>(<em>shirk </em>of obedience). There is no doubt that obeying a created being in declaring lawful that which Allaah has made forbidden or in declaring forbidden that which Allaah has made lawful, <em>this</em> is a type of <em>shirk </em> &#8211; however there is that which is more serious than it and it is worshipping other than Allaah by slaughtering and making vows and performing <em>tawaaf</em> (circumambulation) and calling for rescue. So what is obligatory is to warn against all <em>shirk</em>, not to take up something from it and to leave aside that which is worse and more dangerous than it. So <em>shirk </em>is not to be explained as being only <em>shirk-ul-<u>H</u>aakimiyyah </em>or <em>shirk </em>in political affairs. And (these people) say: “Shirk of the graves, this is just simple shirk”, meaning it is something easy. This is insolence towards Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. <em>Shirk </em>is the worst thing that Allaah has forbidden and it is to call upon something else besides Him along with Him. This is <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them are those who say that, “<em>Shirk </em>is to have love of the<em> dunyaa </em>(worldly life) and to have love of wealth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wealth is something which Allaah has made beloved (to people) with their natural love.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَتُحِبُّونَ الْمَالَ حُبًّا جَمًّا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And you love wealth with immense love.</span> </strong>[89:20]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِنَّهُ لِحُبِّ الْخَيْرِ لَشَدِيدٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And indeed he</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (man)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> is certainly fervent in love of </span><em><span style="color:#008000;">khayr</span> </em></strong>[100:8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: (of) wealth.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ إِن كَانَ آبَاؤُكُمْ وَأَبْنَاؤُكُمْ وَإِخْوَانُكُمْ وَأَزْوَاجُكُمْ وَعَشِيرَتُكُمْ وَأَمْوَالٌ اقْتَرَفْتُمُوهَا وَتِجَارَةٌ تَخْشَوْنَ كَسَادَهَا وَمَسَاكِنُ تَرْضَوْنَهَا أَحَبَّ إِلَيْكُم مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَجِهَادٍ فِي سَبِيلِهِ فَتَرَبَّصُوا حَتَّىٰ يَأْتِيَ اللَّهُ بِأَمْرِهِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ لَا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الْفَاسِقِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: If your fathers and your children…</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Up to His statement:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">.. أَحَبَّ إِلَيْكُم</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">are more beloved to you.</span> </strong>[9:24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: <strong>‘are more beloved to you’</strong>, and He did not criticize them for loving them (their fathers, their children, etc). Rather He criticized them for giving precedence to love of them over the love of Allaah. Love of wealth is not <em>shirk </em>because it is a natural love. The people have need of wealth and they love it; love of wealth is not <em>shirk </em>because it is (a case) of love of things which are beneficial through which the people derive benefit. However those people who say these sayings  (that shirk is love of wealth) &#8211; either they are ignorant people who do not know <em>taw<u>h</u>eed </em>and <em>shirk</em> – or otherwise they are people who deliberately turn away, wishing to turn the people away from these realities towards things which they want and purposes which they desire . And Allaah knows best about people’s intentions and goals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is important is that this is not <em>shirk; shirk </em>is to call upon other than Allaah along with Him or to direct anything from the types of worship to other than Allaah  &#8211; such as sacrifice, and making vows, and supplicating and calling for rescue and seeking aid and turning for refuge and fear and hope and other than that &#8211; this is <em>shirk </em>which is the greatest of sins, calling upon other than Him along with Him, He the Perfect and Most High, because <em>ad-Du‘aa </em>(supplication) is the greatest type of worship, just as He, the One free of all imperfections, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَهُ دَعْوَةُ الْحَقِّ ۖ وَالَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ لَا يَسْتَجِيبُونَ لَهُم بِشَيْءٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The True Call is that which is for Allaah; and those whom they call upon besides Him cannot respond to them with anything</strong>.</span> [13:14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَادْعُوا اللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ الْكَافِرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So call upon Allaah, making the religion purely and sincerely for Him even though the disbelievers detest it. </strong></span>[40:14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So supplicating to other than Allaah is the <em>shirk </em>which Allaah and His Messenger made forbidden. As for these lesser matters which they declare <em>shirk </em>to be then that is not the case. However it is to be said: some of them are a part of <em>shirk; </em>however there is that which is more dangerous than it and more important than it because shirk is of levels, some of them are worse than others. And Allaah’s refuge is sought.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And worship Allaah, and do not associate anything along with Him</span></strong> [4:36] <sup>20</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20]:  <strong>Shaykh Fawzan’s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “And the proof is His saying, the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And worship Allaah, and do not associate anything along with Him.</span> </strong>[4:36]”:<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have said that the proof that the greatest thing that Allaah has commanded is <em>taw<u>h</u>eed </em>is His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And worship Allaah, and do not associate anything along with Him.</span> </strong>[4:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he mentioned the rest of the rights (in the rest of the above ayah). So the fact that He began with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and with the prohibition of <em>shirk</em>, this is a proof that <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> is the greatest thing which Allaah has commanded because He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And worship Allaah..</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He followed it with His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">and do not associate anything along with Him.</span> </strong>[4:36]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a prohibition. He began with the command for <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and the prohibition from <em>shirk</em>. So this proves that the greatest thing that Allaah has commanded is <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and the worst thing that He has forbidden is <em>shirk</em>, because Allaah began with that. And He, the Perfect, does not begin except with the most important thing and then what is next in importance. This is the way in which the <em>aayah </em>is a proof.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>The Most Serious Thing Which Allaah Forbade is <em>Shirk</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">وأعظمُ ما نهى عنه الشركُ<strong> </strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And the most serious thing which He forbade is <em>shirk </em></strong></span><sup>18</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan’s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying – <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah </em>– “And the most serious thing which Allaah forbade is <em>shirk</em>”: This is a tremendous point of benefit because some people believe that there are things which are the worst crimes and the worst thing which Allaah has forbidden, saying, “Ribaa (usury) is the most serious of the forbidden things! Fornication is the greatest of forbidden things!” And therefore they focus upon forbidding ribaa and upon fornication and corruption of manners and behaviour. However they do not give importance to the matter of <em>shirk</em> and they do not warn against it and (yet) they see the people falling into it. So this is a case of tremendous ignorance of the <em>Sharee‘ah</em> (revealed law) of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the most serious thing which Allaah forbade is <em>shirk</em>, so it is more serious than usury and it is more serious than drinking alcohol and more serious than stealing and more serious than falsely devouring the wealth of the people and more serious than betting  and gambling; it is the most serious of the forbidden things. And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ تَعَالَوْا أَتْلُ مَا حَرَّمَ رَبُّكُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ ۖ أَلَّا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا ۖ وَبِالْوَالِدَيْنِ إِحْسَانًا ۖ وَلَا تَقْتُلُوا أَوْلَادَكُم مِّنْ إِمْلَاقٍ ۖ نَّحْنُ نَرْزُقُكُمْ وَإِيَّاهُمْ ۖ وَلَا تَقْرَبُوا الْفَوَاحِشَ مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا وَمَا بَطَنَ ۖ وَلَا تَقْتُلُوا النَّفْسَ الَّتِي حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ إِلَّا بِالْحَقِّ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ وَصَّاكُم بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَا تَقْرَبُوا مَالَ الْيَتِيمِ إِلَّا بِالَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ أَشُدَّهُ ۖ وَأَوْفُوا الْكَيْلَ وَالْمِيزَانَ بِالْقِسْطِ ۖ لَا نُكَلِّفُ نَفْسًا إِلَّا وُسْعَهَا ۖ وَإِذَا قُلْتُمْ فَاعْدِلُوا وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَىٰ ۖ وَبِعَهْدِ اللَّهِ أَوْفُوا ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ وَصَّاكُم بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَذَكَّرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: Come, I will recite to you what my Lord has truly forbidden for you: Do not associate anything along with Allaah, and treat the parents well, and do not kill your children for fear of poverty; We shall provide for you and for them. And do not approach shameful sins, whether apparent or hidden, and do not kill the soul which Allaah has forbidden, except by right. This is what He has commanded you with so that you may understand. And do not approach the wealth of the orphan except in a manner which is best .. [6:151-152]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">.. to the end of the aayaat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And these <em>aayaat</em> are called the <span style="color:#ff0000;">ten commandments</span>.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ تَعَالَوْا أَتْلُ مَا حَرَّمَ رَبُّكُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: Come, I will recite to you what my Lord has truly forbidden for you…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Up to His statement:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">ذَٰلِكُمْ وَصَّاكُم بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>That is what He has enjoined you with so that you may understand.</strong></span> [6:151-152]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These forbidden acts – Allaah began them with His statement:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَّا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do not associate anything along with Allaah&#8230; </strong></span>[6:151]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this proves that <em>shirk</em> is the most serious thing which Allaah has forbidden.<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in <em>Soorat-ul-Israa</em> – Allaah, the Most High,said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَّا تَجْعَلْ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَٰهًا آخَرَ فَتَقْعُدَ مَذْمُومًا مَّخْذُولًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do not set up another object of worship along with Allaah and so become one who is blameworthy and forsaken! </strong></span>[17:22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He began with a prohibition of <em>shirk </em>and He concluded it with a forbiddance of <em>shirk</em>:<em> </em></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">ذَٰلِكَ مِمَّا أَوْحَىٰ إِلَيْكَ رَبُّكَ مِنَ الْحِكْمَةِ ۗ وَلَا تَجْعَلْ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَٰهًا آخَرَ فَتُلْقَىٰ فِي جَهَنَّمَ مَلُومًا مَّدْحُورًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And do not set up another object of worship along with Allaah so that you are cast into Hellfire rebuked and banished! </strong></span>[17:39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this proves that it is the most serious thing that Allaah has forbidden. This proves the saying of the Shaykh, “and the greatest thing that Allaah forbade is shirk.”<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the authentic <u>h</u>adeeth that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><b>‘Which sin is greatest?’</b> </span><b><span style="color:#000000;">He said, “That you set up a rival for Allaah and (yet) it is He who created you.” It was said, ‘Then which (sin)?’ He said, “That you kill your child for fear that he will consume food along with you.” It was said: ‘Then which (sin)?’ He said, “That you commit adultery with the wife of your neighbour.”</span> </b><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by al-Bukhaaree (6861) and Muslim (86) from the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of ‘Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu ‘anhu</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah sent down the confirmation of that in His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَالَّذِينَ لَا يَدْعُونَ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَٰهًا آخَرَ وَلَا يَقْتُلُونَ النَّفْسَ الَّتِي حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ إِلَّا بِالْحَقِّ وَلَا يَزْنُونَ ۚ وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذَٰلِكَ يَلْقَ أَثَامًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the servants of </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em>ar-Ra<u>h</u>maan</em></span><span style="color:#008000;"> are)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> those who do not call upon another deity along with Allaah and they do not kill the soul which Allaah has made forbidden except by right, and they do not commit fornication. And whoever does </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(these things) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">will receive punishment.</span> </strong>[25:68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he began with <em>shirk</em> in his saying, “<strong>That you set up a rival for Allaah”, </strong>meaning: a partner, “<strong>and (yet) it is He who created you.”</strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said that this is the greatest of sins because he was asked “which sin is greatest?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he began with <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Keep away from the seven destructive sins.” So it was said, ‘What are they, O Messenger of Allaah?’ So he said, “Committing shirk with Allaah, and sorcery and killing the soul which Allaah has made forbidden, except with right.”</span></strong>.. to the end of the hadeeth.<em> <strong> </strong></em><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Reported by al Bukhaaree (2766) and Muslim (89) from the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iallaahu ‘anhu</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He began it with <em>shirk </em>so this shows that <em>shirk </em>is the greatest of all sins and that is because the person of <em>shirk</em> will never enter Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهُ مَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدْ حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ الْجَنَّةَ وَمَأْوَاهُ النَّارُ ۖ وَمَا لِلظَّالِمِينَ مِنْ أَنصَارٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Whoever makes <em>shirk  </em>with Allaah, then Allaah has made Paradise forbidden for him; and his abode will be the Hellfire. And the disbelieving wrongdoers will have no helper. </strong></span>[5:72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah will not forgive the <em>mushrik</em>:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاءُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah does not forgive that <em>shirk </em>be committed with Him and He forgives whatever is less than that to whomsoever He wishes. </strong></span>[4:48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this proves that Paradise is forbidden for the person of <em>shirk </em>and that Allaah will not forgive him and it proves that <em>shirk</em> is the greatest of all sins since all sins &#8211;  except for <em>shirk</em> – can be met with forgiveness:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاءُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah does not forgive that <em>shirk </em>be committed with Him and He forgives whatever is less than that to whomsoever He wishes.</span> </strong>[4:48]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So fornication and theft and drinking alcohol and taking usury  &#8211; all of it enters under <em>al-mashee’ah </em>(Allaah’s Wish and Will)  &#8211; if Allaah wishes, He will forgive its person and if He wishes, He will punish him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <em>shirk</em>, then it will not be forgiven. Allaah has passed judgement that He will not forgive it. And likewise the person of sin &#8211; even if he has committed major sins which are less than <em>shirk</em> then Paradise will not be forbidden for him. His final destination will be Paradise.  Either Allaah will forgive him straightaway and enter him into Paradise or else he will come out of the Fire after having been punished in it and he will (then) enter into Paradise. No matter what evil and sins which are less than <em>shirk</em> occur from the believer then he will not despair of the Mercy of Allaah and he will not be forbidden from Paradise, and he enters under the forgiveness (of Allaah) by the Wish and Will of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the person of <em>shirk </em>then he will be deprived and forbidden of all of that  &#8211; and Allaah’s refuge is sought – then this proves that <em>shirk</em> is the greatest of all sins. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الشِّرْكَ لَظُلْمٌ عَظِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong><em>Shirk</em></strong></span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> is the greatest <em><u>z</u>ulm (</em>wrongdoing)</span>. </strong>[31:13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Perfect, said:<strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاءُ ۚ وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدِ افْتَرَىٰ إِثْمًا عَظِيمًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whoever commits <em>shirk </em>with Allaah then he has invented a tremendous sin! </strong></span>[4:48]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَالًا بَعِيدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whoever commits <em>shirk </em>with Allaah then he has indeed strayed far away from the True Path! </strong></span>[4:116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this proves that <em>shirk</em> is the greatest of sins and since <em>shirk</em> is the greatest of sins then it is obligatory upon the scholars and the educated people to forbid it and to warn against it and that they do not remain silent from warning against <em>shirk</em>. And it is obligatory to fight <em>jihaad</em> against the people of <em>shirk</em> along with ability just as Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>fought <em>jihaad</em> against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَاقْتُلُوا الْمُشْرِكِينَ حَيْثُ وَجَدتُّمُوهُمْ وَخُذُوهُمْ وَاحْصُرُوهُمْ وَاقْعُدُوا لَهُمْ كُلَّ مَرْصَدٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then kill the people of <em>shirk</em> wherever you find them and seize them and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush.</strong></span> [9:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is therefore obligatory to warn against <em>shirk</em> and to clarify it to the people so that they avoid it; this is what is obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for remaining silent about <em>shirk</em> and leaving the people passionately involved in worshipping other than Allaah whilst they claim to be upon Islaam – and there is no one forbidding them and no one warning them – then the matter is very serious. There are some people who turn their attention to forbidding usury and fornication and corruption of manners; these are forbidden matters and contain corruption however <em>shirk</em> is more serious. So why is attention not given to forbidding <em>shirk</em> and warning against <em>shirk</em> and explaining what many people have fallen into with regards to major <em>shirk</em> whilst they claim to be upon Islaam?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why is there laxity with regards to the matter of <em>shirk</em> and disregard of it and leaving the people to fall into it and (yet) the people of knowledge are present? Indeed they live along with those people and (yet) they remain silent with them. What is obligatory is to turn attention firstly to forbidding this tremendous danger (of <em>shirk</em>) which has devastated the Muslim nation. Every sin is less than it and what is obligatory is to begin with what is most important, then with what is next in importance.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>The Greatest Matter Commanded by Allaah is <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed.</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وأعظمُ ما أَمرَ اللهُ به التوحيدَ وهو إفرادُ اللهِ بالعبادة</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And the greatest of all that Allaah has commanded is <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, and it is to single out Allaah with all worship</span></strong>. <sup>17</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan’s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, “The greatest of all that Allaah has commanded is <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em>”: this is very important, that <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> is the greatest thing that Allaah has commanded. All the commands that Allaah has commanded, all of them, come after tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof that the greatest thing that Allaah has commanded is <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And worship Allaah alone, and do not associate anything with Him </strong></span>[4:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To the end of the <em>aayah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>aayah</em> contains <strong>ten rights</strong>, and therefore it is called the <strong><em>aayah</em> of the ten rights</strong>. The first of these rights is the right of Allaah the Perfect:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And worship Allaah alone, and do not associate anything with Him </strong></span>[4:36]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> وَبِالْوَالِدَيْنِ إِحْسَانًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And treat the parents well </strong></span>[4:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the second right.<strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَبِذِي الْقُرْبَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the close relatives </strong></span>[4:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the third right, and the close relatives, they are those people to whom you are closely related through your father or mother, such as fathers and grandfathers, and paternal uncles and paternal aunts, maternal uncles and maternal aunts, and brothers and sisters, and children of brothers and sisters, and children of paternal uncles and paternal aunts, those people are the close relatives, they have the right of <em>al-Qaraabah</em> (of being your close relative).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<em>Wal-yataamaa</em>” (and the orphans), – the orphans from the Muslims, and they are everyone whose father has died whilst he was young and he had not attained the age of puberty, and therefore he needs someone to take the place of his father in taking care of this child, bringing him up, spending upon him and seeing to his welfare, and removing whatever will harm him, because he has no father to protect him and spend upon him and defend him, so he has a need of someone to help him because he has lost his father and his family, and he has a right in Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is important is that Allaah began it with His right, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And do not associate anything along with Him</strong></span> [4:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He did not restrict Himself to saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And worship Allaah</span> </strong>[4:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because worship will not be correct along with <em>shirk</em> and it will not benefit, and it will not be called worship unless it is made purely and sincerely for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. If it has <em>shirk</em> along with it, then it will not be worship, no matter how much the person exerts himself in its performance. So He joined the matter of worship with the prohibition of <em>shirk</em>, since worship will not be correct with the presence of <em>shirk</em> at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a proof for the saying of the Shaikh, “The greatest thing that Allaah commanded is <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>”, since Allaah began many <em>aayahs</em> with it, from them is this aayah, and from them is His saying He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَضَىٰ رَبُّكَ أَلَّا تَعْبُدُوا إِلَّا إِيَّاهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And your Lord has commanded that you should not worship except Him </strong></span>[17:23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He the Perfect and Most High began with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, and this proves that it is the greatest thing that Allaah has commanded.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ تَعَالَوْا أَتْلُ مَا حَرَّمَ رَبُّكُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ ۖ أَلَّا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا ۖ وَبِالْوَالِدَيْنِ إِحْسَانًا ۖ وَلَا تَقْتُلُوا أَوْلَادَكُم مِّنْ إِمْلَاقٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: Come I will recite to you that which your Lord has truly forbidden for you: do not associate anything in worship with Him, and treat the parents well, and do not kill your children on account of poverty </strong></span>[6:151]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a proof for what will follow, that the greatest thing that Allaah has forbidden is <em>shirk</em>. So since the greatest thing that Allaah has commanded is <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, then it is obligatory that the person begins by learning <em>‘aqeedah</em> (correct belief) before everything. Correct creed and belief is the foundation, so it is obligatory that the person begins with it in learning and teaching and that he is constant upon teaching it and explaining it to the people, because it is the greatest thing that Allaah has commanded, so it is not befitting that you make it the last of all things or give no great attention to it, because now there are actually callers who renounce the teaching of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and <em>‘aqeedah</em>, there are people who are afflicted with this. And because any deficiencies with regard to it will be a deficiency in the whole of the religion so it is obligatory to give careful attention to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what is <em>tawheed </em>? Is it that you affirm that Allaah is the Creator, the Provider, the Giver of life, the Giver of death? No. <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed </em>is: to single out Allaah with worship, because Allaah said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me</span>. </strong>[51:56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the people of <em>tafseer </em>said: <strong>Worship Me – </strong>meaning single Me out (with all worship). So they explained <em>taw<u>h</u>eed </em>as <em>‘ibaadah </em>(worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, <em>taw<u>h</u>eed </em>is to single out Allaah with worship and it is not to affirm that Allaah is the Creator, the Provider, the Giver of life, the Giver of death, the One in control of affairs because this is present in people’s <em>fi<u>t</u>rah </em>(inborn nature). It is present in the intellects of those who possess intellect. There is not a person of intellect in the world who truly believes that anyone created the Heavens and the Earth besides Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. There is not in the whole world anyone – and that includes the unbelievers and the atheists &#8211; who truly believes that there is anyone from mankind who created mankind.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And if you were to ask them (the people of <em>shirk</em>) who created them, they would certainly say, “Allaah!”</span> </strong>[43:87]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is not a person with intellect in the whole world who believes truly that a human can create a human being who walks upon the Earth and speaks and eats and drinks. Is there a person with intellect who believes this?</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْ خُلِقُوا مِنْ غَيْرِ شَيْءٍ أَمْ هُمُ الْخَالِقُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْ خَلَقُوا السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ ۚ بَل لَّا يُوقِنُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Were they created without any Creator having brought them into existence? Or are they the creators? Or did they create the Heavens and the Earth? Rather they do not have certainty. </strong></span>[52:35-36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Taw<u>h</u>eed-ur-ruboobiyyah</em> (<em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of Allaah’s Lordship) is something found in the inborn natures and in their intellects; however it will not suffice without <em>taw<u>h</u>eed-ul-‘ibaadah</em> (<em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of worship) – and it is to single out Allaah with all worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore the Shaykh said: <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> is to single out Allaah with worship and it is not to single out Allaah with respect to creating and providing and giving life and giving death because this is something which is known and <em>taw<u>h</u>eed-ur-ruboobiyyah</em> (<em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of Allaah’s Lordship) will not suffice with regard to the definition of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[15]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan’s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And that is what Allaah commanded</strong>”: the indication refers to his saying, “That you worship Allaah making the religion purely and sincerely for Him”. And Allaah commanded the whole of the creation with the worship of Allaah making the whole of the religion purely and sincerely for Him, Allaah commanded the whole of mankind the Arabs from them and the non-Arabs, the white and the black from them, all of mankind from the time of Aadam until the last of mankind in the world, Allaah commanded all of them to worship Him, along with making the worship purely and solely for Him. Allaah the most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اعْبُدُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الْأَرْضَ فِرَاشًا وَالسَّمَاءَ بِنَاءً وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً فَأَخْرَجَ بِهِ مِنَ الثَّمَرَاتِ رِزْقًا لَّكُمْ ۖ فَلَا تَجْعَلُوا لِلَّهِ أَندَادًا وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O mankind single out your Lord with all worship, He Who created you and all those who came before you so that you may be from those who fear and are dutiful to Allaah </strong>(who avoid His punishment)<strong>. He Who made the earth a resting-place for you and made the sky a ceiling and He sent down from the clouds rain and He brought out with it from the earth crops and fruits as provision for you. So do not set up rivals to Allaah whilst you know. </strong></span>[2:21-22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That there is no rival for Him and there is no-one resembling Him, and there is no-one like Him, and there is no equal for Him. So this is a prohibition of major <em>shirk</em> and lesser <em>shirk</em>. Allaah commanded all of mankind with that from the first of them to the last of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “And He created them for it”: meaning to worship Him alone associating no partners with Him, He the one free of all imperfections, they were created for that purpose, that is just as occurs in His saying He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And I did not create the <em>Jinn</em> and mankind except so that they should worship Me alone.</span> </strong>[51:56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they were commanded with that in His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اعْبُدُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O mankind single out your Lord with all worship, the one who created you</span> </strong>[2:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the meaning of the saying of the Shaikh, ‘He created them for it, and He commanded them with it’, he combined the two matters in his saying, “And Allaah commanded the whole of mankind with that and He created them for it”, just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And I did not create the <em>Jinn</em> and mankind except so that they should worship Me alone</span>. </strong>[51:56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">.. وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And I did not create the <em>Jinn</em> and mankind .. </span></strong>[51:56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah, He is the Creator, He is the one who created all things, and from that is that He created the <em>Jinn</em> and mankind, and He gave them intellect, and He gave them the duty of worshipping Him alone and not associating anything along with Him. He particularized them with the command to worship Him because Allaah gave them intellects, and He gave them that by means of which they can they can distinguish between what is harmful and what is of benefit, and between the truth and falsehood, and He created all things for their welfare and benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَسَخَّرَ لَكُم مَّا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا مِّنْهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He has made subservient for you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is upon the earth all of it is a favour from Him. </strong></span>[45:13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everything has been made subservient for the descendants of Aadam in order that they should use it as an aid upon that which they were created for, and it is the worship of Allaah the Perfect and Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And I did not create the <em>Jinn</em> and mankind except so that they should worship Me alone.</span> </strong>[51:56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Jinn</em> are a species of beings from the realms of the hidden and unseen, we do not see them, and they have the duty of performing worship and they are forbidden from committing <em>shirk </em>and from sin, just like the descendents of Aadam. However they differ from the descendents of Aadam in their created form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for with regard to commands and prohibitions, then they are just like the descendants of Aadam, they are bound by commands and prohibitions, and the <em>Jinn</em> are a species of beings from the world of the hidden and unseen, we do not see them, however they are present. And mankind, they are the descendants of Aadam. They are called <em>Al-Ins</em> because they are sociable with each other, they come together and they enjoy each others’ company.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>Jinn</em> are called <em>Jinn</em> from <em>Al-Ijtinaan, </em>which means the state of being hidden. And from it is <em>Al-Janeen</em> (the embryo) in the womb, because it is hidden, and it is said about a person <em>jannahul-layl</em> (the night covered him) when it covers him over, and it is also said <em>Al-Mijann</em> (a shield), that which is taken for protection in war for arrows and so on, so it covers the one who carries it. So <em>Al-Ijtinaan</em> and <em>Al-Janaan</em>, is something which is hidden and concealed. So the <em>Jinn</em> are hidden from us, we do not see them. And they are a species of beings who exist, whoever denies them then he is a disbeliever, since he is denying the truth of what Allaah and His Messenger have said, and denying the consensus of the Muslims, since Allaah the Mighty and Majestic has made clear that He did not create <em>Jinn</em> and mankind except to worship Him, not for anything else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He did not create them in order for them to benefit Him or to harm Him nor in order to feel powerful because of them and not feel lowly nor in order to seek increase through them in place of having little because He is <em>Ghaniyy</em> (Independent), having no need of the creation, and He did not create them because of any need for them, He did not create them in order that they should provide for Him or that they should earn wealth for Him:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا أُرِيدُ مِنْهُم مِّن رِّزْقٍ وَمَا أُرِيدُ أَن يُطْعِمُونِ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الرَّزَّاقُ ذُو الْقُوَّةِ الْمَتِينُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>I do not want provision from them, and I do not want that they should feed Me. Allaah, He is the Great Provider, the Possessor of Tremendous Power, the Strong. </strong></span>[51:57-58]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah is not in need of the creation rather He created the <em>Jinn</em> and mankind for one thing alone and it is that they should worship Him, and He is not in need of their worship, rather they are in need of it, since if they worship Allaah, then He honours them and enters them into Paradise. So the benefit of worship returns to them, and the harmful effect of sins is upon them, as for Allaah the Majestic and Most High, then He is not harmed by the obedience of the obedient one nor by the sin of the sinful one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Perfect and Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> إِن تَكْفُرُوا أَنتُمْ وَمَن فِي الْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَغَنِيٌّ حَمِيدٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If you people disbelieve, you and everyone upon the earth together, then Allaah is the Independent One, free of all needs, the One deserving of all praise.</strong></span> [14:8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is not harmed by the sinning of the one who sins and He is not benefitted by the one who is obedient, rather this returns to the creation themselves. If they obey Him then they benefit, and if they disobey Him then they are harmed by sinning against Him.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong> Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And I did not create the Jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me alone </strong></span>[51:56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And the meaning of, “they should worship”, is, “they should single Me out with all worship.”</span></strong><sup>16</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan’s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “And the meaning of <em>ya‘budoon</em> is <em>yuwa<u>hh</u>idoon</em>”: meaning they single Me out with all worship. So worship and <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> have one and the same meaning. <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> can be explained to mean worship, and worship can be explained to mean <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, and the meaning of these two is one. So this contains a refutation of those who explain <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> to be affirming that Allaah is the Creator, the Provider, the One who gives life, the One who gives death, the One who is in control of affairs. This is not the <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> for which the creation were created, rather the creation were created for the tawheed of worship which is <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed-ul-Uloohiyyah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for one who only affirms <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed-ur-Ruboobiyyah </em>(<em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of Allaah’s Lordship), then he is not a <em>muwa<u>hh</u>id</em> (person of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>) and he will not be from the people of Paradise, rather he will be from the people of the Hell-Fire, because he has not come with the <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> which he was created for, and with worship.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Third Treatise :<br />
</strong><strong><em>Al-<u>H</u>aneefiyyah</em></strong><strong> (The Straight and True Religion), the Religious Way Followed by Ibraaheem</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong> </strong><strong>The Definition of <em>Al-<u>H</u>aneefiyyah</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong> Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">إنَّ الحنيفيةَ: مِلَّةُ إبراهيمَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">That <em>Al-<u>H</u>aneefiyyah</em> (The straight and true religion) the religious way followed by Ibraaheem</span></strong><sup>13</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan’s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “That <em>Al-<u>H</u>aneefiyyah</em> the religious way followed by Ibraaheem”: meaning that which is obligatory that you should know and be aware of is that <em>Al-<u>H</u>aneefiyyah</em> is the religious way of Ibraaheem, and <em>Al-<u>H</u>anf</em> in the language means inclination.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the meaning of <em>Al-<u>H</u>aneefiyyah</em> is the religious way which turns away from <em>shirk</em> towards <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>. And Ibraaheem <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> was a <em><u>H</u>aneef</em>, a Muslim. <em><u>H</u>aneef</em> meaning one who inclined away from <em>shirk</em> and turned away from it towards <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and making his religion purely and sincerely for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ كَانَ أُمَّةً قَانِتًا لِّلَّهِ حَنِيفًا وَلَمْ يَكُ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Ibraaheem was an <em>Ummah</em> </strong>(a teacher of good, and a leader followed upon guidance)<strong>, obedient to Allaah, <em><u>H</u>aneef</em> </strong>(upright upon the true religion of Islaam)<strong>, and he was not from those who associate others with Allaah </strong></span>[16:120]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>al-<u>H</u>aneef</em> was one of the attributes of Ibraaheem <em>‘alaihissalaam</em> with the meaning that he turned away from <em>shirk </em>and inclined away from it totally in favour of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, turning totally towards <em>taw<u>h</u>eed </em>and making worship purely for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. Allaah the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ أَنِ اتَّبِعْ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then we revealed to you that you should follow the religious way of Ibraaheem the <em><u>H</u>aneef</em>  </strong>(the one who was upon the true religion, <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> turning away from <em>shirk</em>)<strong>. </strong></span>[16:123]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the One free of all imperfections said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا كَانَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ يَهُودِيًّا وَلَا نَصْرَانِيًّا وَلَٰكِن كَانَ حَنِيفًا مُّسْلِمًا وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Ibraaheem was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but rather he was a <em><u>H</u>aneef</em>, a Muslim, and he was not from those who associated others with Allaah </strong></span>[3:67]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the tremendous characteristics of Ibraaheem <em>‘alaihissalaam, </em>from them is that he was <em><u>H</u>aneef</em>, and that his religious way is <em><u>H</u>aneefiyyah</em>, and it is the religion which is purely and sincerely for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic which has no <em>shirk</em> in it. And Allaah commanded His Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>that he should follow this religious way by His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ أَنِ اتَّبِعْ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا ۖ وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Then We revealed to you that you should follow the religious way of Ibraaheem who was <em><u>H</u>aneef</em>, and he was not from those who associated others with Allaah.</span> </strong>[16:123]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we have been commanded likewise that we should follow the religious way of Ibraaheem ‘<em>alaihissalaam. </em>He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">هُوَ اجْتَبَاكُمْ وَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِي الدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ ۚ مِّلَّةَ أَبِيكُمْ إِبْرَاهِيمَ ۚ هُوَ سَمَّاكُمُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">He has chosen you for His religion, and He has not placed any unbearable difficulty upon you in the religion. So follow the religious way of your forefather Ibraaheem. Allaah it is who has named you the Muslims</span></strong> [22:78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it was the religion of all of the Messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However because of the fact that Ibraaheem <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam </em>is the most excellent one of the Prophets after our Prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>because he encountered in the path of calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> such torment and trials as were not encountered by anyone else, and he had patience upon that. And because he was the father of the Prophets, because the Prophets who came after him, all of them were descendants of his <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam. </em>So therefore <em>Al-<u>H</u>aneefiyyah</em> was the religious way of all of the Prophets and it is the call to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and the prohibition of <em>shirk </em>this was the religious way of all of the Messengers. However because Ibraaheem took notable stances for this religious way, it was ascribed to him and for those who came after him. And the Prophets all of them after him, they were upon the religious way of Ibraaheem, and it is the religion of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and <em>ikhlaa<u>s</u></em> making the religion purely and sincerely for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is this religious way which our Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> was commanded to follow, and which we have been ordered to follow? It is obligatory upon us that we should be aware of it, because the Muslim, it is obligatory that he should be aware of whatever Allaah has made obligatory upon him, so that he can comply with it, and in order that he will not violate it. It is not sufficient to merely ascribe oneself to it without awareness, it is not sufficient to ascribe oneself to Islaam when he does not know what it is, and he does not know what are those things which nullify Islaam, and what are the religious duties of Islaam and the rulings of Islaam, and it is not sufficient to merely ascribe yourself to the religious way of Ibraaheem and you do not know what it is, and if you are asked about it you say, “I don’t know”. This is not permissible, it is obligatory that you are well aware of it so that you can proceed upon it upon clear insight and so that you do not violate anything from it.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أنْ تعبدَ اللهَ وحدَهُ مخلصًا له الدِّين</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Is that you worship Allaah alone, making the religion purely and sincerely for Him</strong></span><sup>14</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan’s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “Is that you worship Allaah alone, making the religion purely and sincerely for Him”: this is the religious way of Ibraaheem, that you worship Allaah making the religion purely and sincerely for Him. That you combine two matters: worship and making the worship purely for Allaah. So whoever worships Allaah but does not make the whole of religion purely for Him, then his worship will be nothing at all. So whoever worships Allaah and fasts and performs the <em>Hajj</em> (pilgrimage) and prays and performs <em>‘Umrah</em>, and gives in voluntary charity and pays the <em>Zakaat </em>and does a great number of acts of obedience, however he does not do so making it purely and sincerely for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, either because he does that for show or for repute, or because he mixed his deeds with something from <em>shirk, </em>such as calling upon other that Allaah, and calling for aid upon other than Allaah, and slaughtering for other than Allaah, then this person will not be <em>mukhli<u>s</u></em> one who is acting purely and sincerely for Allaah in his worship, rather he will be a <em>mushrik</em>, and he will not be upon the religious way of Ibraaheem <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam.</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many of those who ascribe themselves to Islaam today fall into major <em>shirk</em>, into calling upon other than Allaah and worshipping the graves and the tombs and sacrificing for them and performing vows for them and making <em><u>t</u>awaaf</em> around them and seeking blessing from them and calling for aid to the dead and other than that, and they say that they are Muslims. Those people do not know the religious way of Ibraaheem <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam </em>which their Prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> was upon, they do not know of it or they know of it but then contradict it knowingly, and Allaah’s refuge is sought, and this is even worse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the religious way of Ibraheem does not accept <em>shirk</em> in any form and whoever mixes his actions with <em>shirk</em> then he is not upon the religious way of Ibraaheem, even if he ascribes himself to it and claims that he is a Muslim. So what is obligatory is that you should have awareness of the religious way of Ibraaheem and that you act upon it and that you adhere to it by worshipping Allaah making the whole of the religion purely and sincerely for Him, that there is not in your worship anything from lesser <em>shirk </em>or greater <em>shirk.</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the religious way of Ibraaheem ‘<em>alaihissalaam: Al-<u>H</u>aneefiyyah</em>, which turns away from <em>shirk</em> totally and turns to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> totally, that you worship Allaah making the religion purely and sincerely for Him.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> <em>Al-Walaa’ wal-Baraa’ (</em>Alliance and Dissociation)</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> </strong>الثَّالِثَةُ: أَنَّ مَنْ أَطَاعَ الرَّسُوْلَ وَوَحَّدَ اللهَ لاَ يَجُوزُ لَهُ مُوَالاَةُ مَنْ حَادَّ اللهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَلَوْ كَانَ أَقْرَبَ قَرِيبٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The third: that whoever obeys the Messenger and singles out Allaah, then it is not permissible for him to love and ally himself with those who oppose Allaah and His Messenger, even if they be those most closely related to him</strong></span>.<sup>10</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan’s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible for those who do that to have love and alliance to those who oppose Allaah and his Messenger, even if they be those most closely related to him. This is the matter of <strong><em>Al-Walaa’ wal-Baraa’ </em></strong>(Alliance and Dissociation), and it follows on from <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, from the rights of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> is to have love and alliance for the beloved servants of Allaah and to have dissociation from the enemies of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the words, “<strong><em>Al-Muwaalaat</em></strong>”, and, “<strong><em>Al-Walaa’</em></strong>”, have one and the same meaning, and, “<em><strong>Al-Walaa</strong>’</em>”, means having love in the heart, and it means aiding and assisting, and it means, in the matter of inheriting and payment of blood-monies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslim he loves and has alliance for the beloved servants of Allaah, meaning that he restricts his love to those who are beloved and obedient servants of Allaah, and he aids them, so the Muslim is with the Muslims, they are allies to each other. Just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأُولُو الْأَرْحَامِ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلَىٰ بِبَعْضٍ فِي كِتَابِ اللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And blood-relations are more entitled to inheritance from each other as decreed by Allaah. </strong></span>[8:75]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So payment of blood-monies for accidental killing occurs between the Muslims, and it is what is called mutual responsibility. All of this enters into alliance, so there is no alliance between a Muslim and an unbeliever, and love and aiding and inheriting and payment of blood-money and guardianship in marriage and guardianship in legal matters and so on, this does not occur between a Muslim and a disbeliever, rather this is between the Muslims, because of his saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَن يَجْعَلَ اللَّهُ لِلْكَافِرِينَ عَلَى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ سَبِيلًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And Allaah will never give a way to the unbelievers over the believers. </strong></span>[4:141]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory that the believers are distinguished from the disbelievers, so it is not permissible for one who singles out Allaah and obeys the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> to have love and alliance with those who oppose Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And, <strong>“<em>Al-Mu<u>h</u>aaddah</em>”</strong>(opposing), means that the person is upon one side, and Allaah and His Messenger and the believers are on the other side, and those who oppose are upon the side of the unbelievers in this opposition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Even if that person is the most closely related to him</strong>”: meaning in lineage. So if your close relative is one who opposes Allaah and His Messenger, then it is obligatory upon you to oppose him and to cut off from him, and whoever is an obedient servant of Allaah and an ally to His Messenger, then it is obligatory upon you that you should love him and have alliance with him, even if he be far removed from you in lineage, even if he be a non-arab, or a black person, or a white person, or a red person, it is obligatory upon you to have love and alliance for him and that you love him, whether he is from your land, or whether he is from the farthest place in the East, or the farthest place in the West. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَالْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَاتُ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَاءُ بَعْضٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the believing men and the believing women are friends and allies to each other. </strong></span>[9:71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: between them there is love and mutual help and mutual aid, and between them there is to be affection, this is between the believers.</p>
<hr />
<p>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَّا تَجِدُ قَوْمًا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ يُوَادُّونَ مَنْ حَادَّ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَلَوْ كَانُوا آبَاءَهُمْ أَوْ أَبْنَاءَهُمْ أَوْ إِخْوَانَهُمْ أَوْ عَشِيرَتَهُمْ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ كَتَبَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمُ الْإِيمَانَ وَأَيَّدَهُم بِرُوحٍ مِّنْهُ ۖ وَيُدْخِلُهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا ۚ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا عَنْهُ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ حِزْبُ اللَّهِ ۚ أَلَا إِنَّ حِزْبَ اللَّهِ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You will not find a people who truly believe in Allaah and the Last Day loving those who oppose Allaah and His Messenger even if they are their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kinsfolk. Rather Allaah has ordained true faith for their hearts and has strengthened them with strength from Him and He will enter them into gardens which have rivers flowing beneath their trees they shall remain forever therein. Allaah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. They are the party of Allaah. Indeed the party of Allaah are the ones who will be successful. </strong></span>[58:22]<sup>11</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan’s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>لَّا تَجِدُ</strong> </span>“<strong>You will not find</strong>”: this is an address to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>meaning: this will not happen and will never exist, that one who is a true believer in Allaah and His Messenger will love the disbelievers, so if a person does love them, then he is not a true believer, even if he claims to be.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn-ul-Qayyim <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said in <em>Al-Kaafiyat-ush-Shaafiyah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>Do you love the enemies of the beloved One and still claim,</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>That you love Him? That is not possible</em><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>And likewise you strive hard to oppose those He loves,</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>Where is the love O brother of Satan?</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is not possible ever, that he loves the disbelievers, whilst he says, “I love Allaah and His Messenger”, because of His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَتَّخِذُوا عَدُوِّي وَعَدُوَّكُمْ أَوْلِيَاءَ تُلْقُونَ إِلَيْهِم بِالْمَوَدَّةِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who believe do not take My enemies and your enemies as friends and allies, for whom you have affection </strong></span>[60:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Up until His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قَدْ كَانَتْ لَكُمْ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ فِي إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَالَّذِينَ مَعَهُ إِذْ قَالُوا لِقَوْمِهِمْ إِنَّا بُرَآءُ مِنكُمْ وَمِمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ كَفَرْنَا بِكُمْ وَبَدَا بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمُ الْعَدَاوَةُ وَالْبَغْضَاءُ أَبَدًا حَتَّىٰ تُؤْمِنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَحْدَهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is for you a fine example in Ibraaheem and those with him, when they said to their people, “We are free of you and whatever you worship besides Allaah, we have rejected you, and there has appeared between us and you enmity and hatred forever until you truly believe in Allaah and single Him out with all worship. </strong></span>[60:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا كَانَ اسْتِغْفَارُ إِبْرَاهِيمَ لِأَبِيهِ إِلَّا عَن مَّوْعِدَةٍ وَعَدَهَا إِيَّاهُ فَلَمَّا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ أَنَّهُ عَدُوٌّ لِّلَّهِ تَبَرَّأَ مِنْهُ ۚ إِنَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ لَأَوَّاهٌ حَلِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And Ibraaheem’s seeking forgiveness for his father was only because of a promise which he had made to him. So when it became clear to him that he was an enemy to Allaah, then he dissociated himself from him. Indeed Ibraaheem is one who frequently supplicated to His Lord and who was forbearing. </strong></span>[9:114]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the religious way of Ibraaheem. He dissociated himself from his father, the closest of the people to him, when it became clear to him that he was an enemy to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>aayah</em> shows that <span style="color:#ff0000;">having love for an unbeliever negates true faith in Allaah and in the Last Day, either in its very origin, or with regards to its completion</span>. However, if love of them has with it supporting what they are upon and their unbelief, then this is to exit from the fold of Islaam, but if it is just having love without aiding them, then this is counted as something which causes a person’s <em>eemaan</em> (belief) to be deficient and is <em>fisq</em> (open sin) and something which weakens <em>eemaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said that this aayah came down with regard to Aboo ‘Ubaidah ibn al-Jarraa<u>h</u> <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu, </em>when he killed his father on the day of Badr, because his father was upon unbelief, and he wanted to kill his son Aboo ‘Ubaidah, but Aboo ‘Ubaidah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu </em>killed him, because he was an enemy to Allaah and he was not prevented by that fact that it was his father, that did not prevent him from killing him out of anger for the sake of Allaah the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Those ones</strong>”: meaning those who keep away from loving and having affection for those oppose Allaah and His Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">كَتَبَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمُ الْإِيمَانَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He</strong> (Allaah)<strong> ordained <em>eemaan</em> for their hearts </strong></span>[58:22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning Allaah confirmed and firmly planted <em>eemaan</em> in their hearts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَيَّدَهُم بِرُوحٍ مِّنْهُ ۖ وَيُدْخِلُهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He strengthened them with a <em>Roo<u>h</u></em> from Him, and He willl enter them into gardens beneath which rivers flow.</strong></span>[58:22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>At-Ta’yeed </em></strong>means strengthening, He strengthened them with a <em>Roo<u>h</u></em> from Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the word <em>Ar-Roo<u>h</u></em> has a number of different usages in the Qur’aan, from them is <em>Ar-Roo<u>h</u></em> which is the <strong>spirit</strong> through which there is life, and from them is <strong>revelation</strong> as occurs in His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَكَذَٰلِكَ أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ رُوحًا مِّنْ أَمْرِنَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And likewise We sent down by revelation to you a <em>Roo<u>h</u></em> </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(revelation)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> by Our command.</span> </strong>[42:52]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them is Jibreel <em>‘alaihissalaam</em>, that he is <em>Roo<u>h</u>-ul-Qudus</em> (the Pure Spirit), and <em>Ar-Roo<u>h</u>-ul-’Ameen </em>(the Trustworthy Spirit).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ نَزَّلَهُ رُوحُ الْقُدُسِ مِن رَّبِّكَ بِالْحَقِّ لِيُثَبِّتَ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَهُدًى وَبُشْرَىٰ لِلْمُسْلِمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: the Pure Spirit </strong>(Jibreel <em>‘alaihissalaam</em>)<strong> brought it</strong> (the Qur’aan)<strong> down from your Lord in truth, to make those who believe firm and as guidance and as good news for the Muslims </strong>(those who submit to Allaah’s commands) </span>[16:102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">نَزَلَ بِهِ الرُّوحُ الْأَمِينُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Trustworthy Spirit</strong> (Jibreel <em>‘alaihissalaam</em>) <strong>descended with it</strong> (the Qur’aan)<strong>. </strong></span>[26:193]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them is what occurs in this <em>aayah </em>and it is <strong>strength</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, “<em>Ayyadahum</em> <em>bi roo<u>h</u>imminh</em>”, meaning with strength from Him, He the Perfect and Most High, strength of true faith in the world, and in the hereafter:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَيُدْخِلُهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He will enter them into gardens</strong></span> [58:22]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The plural of <em>jannaah, </em>and the <em>jannah</em> in the language, it means a garden. It is called a <em>jannaah </em>because it is <em>mujtannun bil-ashjaar</em> (hidden or concealed by trees), meaning hidden and covered by intertwined trees, because paradise contains shade and trees and rivers and palaces, and its highest part and its ceiling is the Throne of the Most Merciful, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">With rivers flowing beneath it they will remain therein forever</span> </strong>[58:22]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, they will remain in it and will not move away from it. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> لَا يَبْغُونَ عَنْهَا حِوَلًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They will not want to move away from it </strong></span>[18:108]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will not fear death and they will not have to fear anyone forcing them out or evicting them, as occurs in this world. A person in this world may live in palaces, however he is not secure from death so that he has to depart from them, nor is he secure from enemies overcoming him and expelling him. A person in this world is always fearful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا عَنْهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him </strong></span>[58:22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since they angered their close relatives who were unbelievers and had enmity towards them, so they will receive in replacement the pleasure of Allaah the Perfect and Most  High, Allaah will be pleased with them and they are pleased with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> أُولَٰئِكَ حِزْبُ اللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They are the party of Allaah</strong></span> [58:22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: the group of people for Allaah, and as for the disbelievers, then they are the party of Satan, just as Allaah the Most High said about them:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> أُولَٰئِكَ حِزْبُ الشَّيْطَانِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They are the party of Satan</span> </strong>[58:19]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the group of people for Satan and the helpers of Satan. As for those people (i.e. the believers) then they are the supporters of the Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this matter relates to having enmity towards the disbelievers and not having love and alliance for them. And it does not necessitate that we cut off from the disbelievers in social matters and matters of worldly benefit. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Rather a number of affairs are an exception to that:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The first one is: </strong></span>that along with our hatred of them and our enmity to them, then it is obligatory that we call them to Allaah the Perfect and Most High. It is obligatory that we call them to Allaah and we do not leave them and just say, “They are enemies of Allaah and our enemies.” It is obligatory upon us that we call them to Allaah so perhaps Allaah may guide them. And if they do not respond, then we fight them along with the ability.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> So either then they will enter into Islaam, or they will pay the <em>jizyah</em> (an amount of money that is given over to the Muslims), if they are from the Jews and Christians or the Magians, whilst they are humbled and submitting to the rule of Islaam, and they are then left upon what they are upon. However, with the condition that they <em>jizyah</em> is handed over and that they submit to the rule of Islaam. However, if they are not people of the Two Books and they are not Magians, then there is disagreement between the scholars about taking <em>jizyah</em> from them.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> [Meaning the Muslims united under a Muslim ruler, i.e. the army of Muslims, with the ability to do so.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Secondly</span>: </strong>there is nothing to prevent having a truce with the unbelievers when there is a need, if the Muslims have need of it, because of the fact that the Muslims are not able to fight against them, and there is fear for the Muslims from their evil, then there is no harm in having a truce until the Muslims become strong enough to fight them, or if they request a truce:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِن جَنَحُوا لِلسَّلْمِ فَاجْنَحْ لَهَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if they incline towards peace, then you incline to it </strong></span>[8:61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then a truce is made with them. However it will not be a perpetual truce, rather a temporary peace with a time-limit in accordance with the view of the ruler of the Muslims regarding what is beneficial.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Thirdly</span>: </strong>there is nothing to prevent returning their fine treatment, if they treat the Muslims well, there is nothing to prevent returning their fine treatment. Allaah the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَّا يَنْهَاكُمُ اللَّهُ عَنِ الَّذِينَ لَمْ يُقَاتِلُوكُمْ فِي الدِّينِ وَلَمْ يُخْرِجُوكُم مِّن دِيَارِكُمْ أَن تَبَرُّوهُمْ وَتُقْسِطُوا إِلَيْهِمْ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُقْسِطِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah does not forbid you from those who do not fight against you with regard to the religion and who do not expel you from your homes from treating them well and treating them with justice. Allaah loves those who treat the people justly. </strong></span>[60:8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Fourthly</span>: </strong>the father who is a disbeliever, it is obligatory upon his son who is Muslim to treat him well. However he should not obey him with regard to unbelief, because of His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَوَصَّيْنَا الْإِنسَانَ بِوَالِدَيْهِ حَمَلَتْهُ أُمُّهُ وَهْنًا عَلَىٰ وَهْنٍ وَفِصَالُهُ فِي عَامَيْنِ أَنِ اشْكُرْ لِي وَلِوَالِدَيْكَ إِلَيَّ الْمَصِيرُ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِن جَاهَدَاكَ عَلَىٰ أَن تُشْرِكَ بِي مَا لَيْسَ لَكَ بِهِ عِلْمٌ فَلَا تُطِعْهُمَا ۖ وَصَاحِبْهُمَا فِي الدُّنْيَا مَعْرُوفًا ۖ وَاتَّبِعْ سَبِيلَ مَنْ أَنَابَ إِلَيَّ ۚ ثُمَّ إِلَيَّ مَرْجِعُكُمْ فَأُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We commanded man to treat his parents well, his mother bore him upon a state of weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning was in two years. We enjoin him to give thanks to Me and to your parents, to Me is your return. And if they strive to make you associate something along with Me, that which you have no knowledge of, then do not obey them, but live along with them in this world in a good manner and follow the path of those who turn to Me</span>. </strong>[31:14-15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The parent has a right, even if he is an unbeliever. However, you should not love him with love of the heart, rather you recompense him for having brought you up and for the fact that he is a father and he has a right,so you recompense him for that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Fifthly</span>: </strong>having mutual business dealings with them, and buying needs from them, and importing goods and weapons from them by paying their price, there is no harm in that. And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>used to have dealings with the disbelievers. Likewise he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> dealt with the people of Khaibar and they were Jews upon the basis that they would farm the land in exchange for a part of its produce. This is not from alliance and love, rather it is affairs of mutual benefit. It is obligatory that we are aware of these matters, and that they do not enter into love and alliance and are not something prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise taking a loan from them, the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>took some food from a Jew as a debt and he left his coat of armour as a surety with him and he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>died and his coat of armour was left as a surety with the Jew, for some food which he bought for his family. There is nothing to prevent this because these are worldly matters and matters of welfare and it does not indicate love and affection in the hearts. So we must differentiate between this and this, because there are some people, who when he hears the texts of enmity towards the unbelievers and not loving them, then he may understand that he cannot have any dealings with them and cannot have any connection with them whatsoever, and that there is to be a total cut-off from them. No, this is something limited by rulings and limits and conditions which are well known with the people of knowledge, which are taken from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Sixthly</span>: </strong>Allaah has permitted marriage to the women of the people of the Book with the condition that they are chaste with regard to their honour and dignity. And Allaah has made permissible for us to eat the meat slaughtered by them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Seventhly</span>:</strong> that there is no harm in responding to their invitations and eating their food which is permissible, just as the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Eighthly</span>: </strong>is treating neighbours who are disbelievers well, because they have the right of being neighbours.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Ninthly</span>:</strong> it is not permissible to wrong or oppress them. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَا يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شَنَآنُ قَوْمٍ عَلَىٰ أَلَّا تَعْدِلُوا ۚ اعْدِلُوا هُوَ أَقْرَبُ لِلتَّقْوَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And let not hatred of a people prevent you from treating them justly. Do justice, it is closer to <em>taqwaa</em> </strong>(dutifulness to Allaah)<strong>. </strong></span>[5:8]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنَّ الْمَسَاجِدَ لِلَّهِ فَلَا تَدْعُوا مَعَ اللَّهِ أَحَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And that <em>masaajid</em> (the places of prayer) are to be for Allaah alone, so do not invoke anyone along with Allaah</span>. </strong>[72:18] <strong><sup>9</sup></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is not pleased that anyone should be associated with Him, no matter who it is, and this is stated clearly in the Book and in the Sunnah, however, to one who uses the intellect and who thinks carefully, and who discards blind following and the use of false and futile excuses, and who is alert to his own benefit. And the proof that Allaah is not pleased that anyone else besides Him should be associated with Him no matter who it is, is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنَّ الْمَسَاجِدَ لِلَّهِ فَلَا تَدْعُوا مَعَ اللَّهِ أَحَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And that the places of prayer are to be for Allaah alone, so do not invoke anyone along with Allaah</span>. </strong>[72:18]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Masaajid </em>(the mosques), are the houses of Allaah and they are the places which are prepared for the <em><u>S</u>alaah </em>(prayer) and they are the most beloved of places to Allaah, and they are houses which Allaah has commanded should be raised and in which His Name should be mentioned. Then these mosques must be made a place for the worship of Allaah alone, nothing for other than Allaah must occur within them, so graves are not to be built in them, nor tombs because the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> cursed those who did that, and he informed that this is the practice of the Jews and the Christians and he forbade us from that at the end of his life, whilst he was in the throes of death <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> with his saying:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">ألا إن من كان قبلكم كانوا يتخذون القبور مساجد</h3>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"> ألا فلا تتخذوا القبور مساجد فإني أﻧﻬاكم عن ذلك</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Indeed those who came before you used to take the graves as places of prayer…” </strong> (he said this whilst he was dying), <strong>“…Indeed do not take the graves as places of prayer, for I certainly forbid you from that.”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">لعنة الله على اليهود والنصارى اتخذوا قبور أنبيائهم مساجد</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah’s curse is upon the Jews and the Christians, they took the graves of their Prophets as places of prayer.”</strong><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the mosques, it is obligatory that they be purified from traces of <em>shirk</em> and idolatory and that they not be built upon the graves, nor should the dead be buried in them after they have been built, rather they should be places for the worship of Allaah alone, the prayer should be established in them, and the Name of Allaah should be mentioned in them, and the Qur’aan should be recited in them, and beneficial lessons should be established in them, and people should remain in them for worship. This is the role of the mosques.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for having in them idols which are worshipped besides Allaah, then these are not mosques, these are shrines of <em>shirk</em>, even if their people call them mosques, because Allaah says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنَّ الْمَسَاجِدَ لِلَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And that the mosques, the places of prayer, are for Allaah</span> </strong>[72:18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: not for anyone else besides Him. And because the mosques, they are the places where the people gather and meet, so it is obligatory that they should be pure and free of <em>shirk</em> and <em>bid‘ah </em>(innovations) and false superstitions, because the people acquire knowledge in them and worship, so if anything from shirk and false superstitions are found in the mosques, then they will be influenced by that and they will propagate it upon earth, so it is obligatory that mosques should be purified from <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the greatest of them is <em>al-Masjid-ul-<u>H</u>araam </em>(the Sacred Mosque, in Makkaah), just as Allaah, the Majestic and Most High commanded that it should be purified, He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِذْ بَوَّأْنَا لِإِبْرَاهِيمَ مَكَانَ الْبَيْتِ أَن لَّا تُشْرِكْ بِي شَيْئًا وَطَهِّرْ بَيْتِيَ لِلطَّائِفِينَ وَالْقَائِمِينَ وَالرُّكَّعِ السُّجُودِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And remember when We showed the site for the House to Ibraaheem and commanded him, that you should not associate anything with Me, and purify My house, for those people who are performing <em><u>T</u>awaaf</em> and for those who are standing in prayer and performing the bowing and prostration.</strong></span> [22:26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Purify it from what? Purify it from <em>shirk</em>, and from innovations and false superstitions, just as it is also to be purified from impurities and filthy things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> لَا تَدْعُو</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do not call upon or invoke</span> </strong>[72:18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The, “<em>laa”</em>, is the, ‘no of prohibition’. And the, “<strong><em>tad‘oo</em></strong>”, is a present tense verb which is in the jussive form because of the prohibiting, <em>“laa”</em>, and the sign that it is the jussive form is the removal of the, <em>‘noon’</em>. So the factor which makes it jussive is the, ‘no of prohibition’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So do not invoke, O people, anyone along with Allaah, do not supplicate for help from anyone along with Allaah, such as saying, “O Allaah, O Mu<u>h</u>ammad”, “O Allaah, O Abd-ul-Qaadir”, or saying, “O Abd-ul-Qaadir, O Mu<u>h</u>ammad”, or the like of that, because Allaah is not pleased with that and will not accept it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying He the Most High, “<strong><em>a<u>h</u>adan</em></strong>”, (anyone): is in indefinite form in the context of a prohibition, so therefore it is general to everyone, no-one is excepted, neither any angel drawn close nor any prophet sent, nor any idol, nor any object of worship, nor any grave, nor any Shaikh, nor any beloved servant of Allaah, nor any living person, nor any dead person, no matter who it is.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is general covering everyone who is called upon besides Allaah</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَلَا تَدْعُوا مَعَ اللَّهِ أَحَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So do not call upon, do not invoke anyone along with Allaah.</span> </strong>[72:18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this <em>aayah</em> shows that worship will not benefit except with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed, </em>and that if <em>shirk</em> is mixed with it, then it becomes null and void and it will be an affliction for the person. Then He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنَّ الْمَسَاجِدَ لِلَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the places of prayer are for Allaah</span> </strong>[72:18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory that they be built purely and sincerely, that the intention of the one building them should not be to show off or to be heard of or to be remembered as they say, or to be just Islamic antiquities, all of this is futile.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mosques should be built for worship and with the intention of worship, and the intention in them should be purely and sincerely for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and also they should be built from good and pure earnings, they should not be built from forbidden earnings because they are for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الله لا يقبل إلا طيبا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<span style="color:#000000;">Allah does not accept except what is good and pure</span>”</strong><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the mosques are to be built from lawful spending and the intention of their builders is that it is to be done purely and sincerely seeking the Face of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, he should not intend by building it to obtain praise from the people, or to be remembered, or for show of, or to be heard of, because building the mosques is worship and worship, it is obligatory that it should be done purely and sincerely for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;">المَسْأَلَةُ الثَّانِيَةُ: <span style="color:#000000;"><sup> </sup>أَنَّ اللهَ لاَ يَرْضَى أَنْ يُشْرَكَ مَعَهُ أَحَدٌ غَيرُهُ فِي عِبَادَتِهِ</span></h3>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>[In this Audio]</strong></span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لاَ مَلَكٌ مُقَرَّبٌ وَلاَ نَبِيٌّ مُرْسَلٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Neither any angel brought near, nor any Messenger sent</span>.</strong><sup>8</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Neither any angel brought near, nor any Messenger sent</strong>”: the angel brought near – this is the most excellent ones from the angels such as Jibreel <em>‘alaihissalaam</em>, and the bearers of the Throne, and those around it, and the angels drawn close to Allaah the Perfect and Most High. So despite the closeness of their place to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and their drawing close to Him with worship and their status with Allaah, if anyone were to associate them along with Allaah in worship then Allaah will not be pleased that an angel drawn close is associated with Him, nor any Prophet sent, such as Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam, </em>and ‘Eesaa and Noo<u>h</u> and Ibraaheem, those Messengers who are firmest in resolve. <span style="color:#ff0000;">He is not pleased that anyone should be associated with Him even if it be one of the most excellent of the angels, even if it be one of the most excellent of mankind.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He is not pleased that anyone should be associated along with Him from the angels nor from the Messengers. So how about other than them from the beloved servants of Allaah and righteous people, so other than the angels and the Messengers it will be even more the case that Allaah is not pleased that they be associated with Him in worship. And this is a refutation of those people who claim that they take the righteous people and the beloved servants of Allaah as intercessors with Allaah in order to draw them closer to Allaah, just as the people of the days of ignorance used to say:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا نَعْبُدُهُمْ إِلَّا لِيُقَرِّبُونَا إِلَى اللَّهِ زُلْفَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">We do not worship them except so that they should draw us closer to Allaah </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(by interceding for us with Allaah)</span> [39:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Otherwise they believed that those ones whom they took, they do not create and they do not give provision and they do not possess power over death nor life nor resurrection. Rather their intention was just to take them as intermediaries with Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and therefore they directed some worship towards them to draw them closer to them, so they made sacrifices for the graves, and they made vows for the graves and they supplicated for aid and called upon the dead.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah the Perfect and Most High is not pleased that anyone else should be associated in worship with Him</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">المَسْأَلَةُ الثَّانِيَةُ: <span style="color:#000000;"><sup> </sup>أَنَّ اللهَ لاَ يَرْضَى أَنْ يُشْرَكَ مَعَهُ أَحَدٌ غَيرُهُ فِي عِبَادَتِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second matter: that Allaah is not pleased that anyone else should be associated with Him in worship of</strong> <strong>Him<sup>7</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih Al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This matter is connected to the first matter, because the first one was an explanation of the obligation of worshipping Allaah, and of following the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>and it is the meaning of the <em>shahaadatain </em>(two testifications), the meaning of the testification that, ‘None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah’, and the testification that, ‘Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah’. And the second matter is that worship, if it has <em>shirk</em> mixed with it, then it will not be accepted, because it is essential that worship is done purely for the Face of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore whoever worships Allaah, and worships something else along with Him, then the worship of him is futile or null and void. Its presence is just the same as its absence, because worship will not benefit except with <em>ikhlaa<u>s</u></em> (i.e. it is done purely for Allaah) and <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>. So if it is mixed with <em>shirk</em> then it is corrupted, just as he the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَقَدْ أُوحِيَ إِلَيْكَ وَإِلَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكَ لَئِنْ أَشْرَكْتَ لَيَحْبَطَنَّ عَمَلُكَ وَلَتَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And it was revealed to you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(O Mu</span><span style="color:#008000;"><u>h</u></span><span style="color:#008000;">ammad) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">and to those Messengers who came before you, that if you associate anything with Allaah then all your deeds will be rendered null and void, and then you would certainly be from the losers</span>. </strong>[39:65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Perfect said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَوْ أَشْرَكُوا لَحَبِطَ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if they committed <em>shirk</em> </strong>(associated anything along with Allaah) <strong>then whatever deeds they had done would be rendered null and void. </strong></span>[6:88]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So worship is not called worship except along with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed, </em>just as the <em><u>s</u>alaah</em> (prayer) is not called <em><u>s</u>alaah</em> except along with purification. So if <em>shirk</em> is mixed with worship, it corrupts it and nullifies it, just as is the case with purification, if it is mixed with one of those things which break the <em>wu<u>d</u>oo’</em> then that corrupts it and nullifies it, and therefore Allaah in many <em>aayahs</em> of the Qur’aan joins the command to worship Him and the prohibition of <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And worship Allaah and do not associate anything along with Him </strong></span>[4:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211;</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا أُمِرُوا إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ حُنَفَاءَ وَيُقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَيُؤْتُوا الزَّكَاةَ ۚ وَذَٰلِكَ دِينُ الْقَيِّمَةِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they were not commanded except that they should worship Allaah making the religion purely and sincerely for Him, upon the true religion of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, turning away from <em>shirk</em>. </strong></span>[98:5]</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلَّا نُوحِي إِلَيْهِ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا أَنَا فَاعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We did not send before you a Messenger except that We revealed to him that none has the right to be worshipped except Me so therefore worship Me alone. </strong></span>[21:25]</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا أَنَا فَاعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>None has the right to be worshipped except Me </strong></span>[21:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This contains two matters: it contains a negation of <em>shirk</em> and it contains affirmation of worship for Allaah the Most High.</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَضَىٰ رَبُّكَ أَلَّا تَعْبُدُوا إِلَّا إِيَّاهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And your Lord commanded that you should not worship except Him </strong></span>[17:23]</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولًا أَنِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُوا الطَّاغُوتَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We sent a Messenger to every nation, commanding worship Allaah and avoid <em>a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>aaghoot</em> </strong>(all false objects of worship)</span><strong>. </strong>[16:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He joined between the worship of Allaah and avoiding the <em><u>T</u>aaghoot </em>(all the false objects of worship)<em>, </em>because the worship of Allaah will not be worship except with avoiding the <em><u>T</u>aaghoot, </em>and that is <em>shirk</em>. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِالطَّاغُوتِ وَيُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ فَقَدِ اسْتَمْسَكَ بِالْعُرْوَةِ الْوُثْقَىٰ لَا انفِصَامَ لَهَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So whoever rejects the <em><u>T</u>aaghoot</em> and truly believes in Allaah, and that Allaah alone has the right to be worshipped, then he has clung on to the firmest hand-hold which will never break</span> </strong>[2:256]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So truly believing in Allaah is not sufficient except with rejection of <em>a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>aaghoot, </em>otherwise the <em>mushrikoon</em> (the people of <em>shirk</em>) they believed in Allaah, however they associated others in worship with Him:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا يُؤْمِنُ أَكْثَرُهُم بِاللَّهِ إِلَّا وَهُم مُّشْرِكُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And most of them do not believe except that they associate others in their worship of Allaah</strong></span> [12:106]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He the Perfect makes it clear that they had belief in Allaah, however they corrupted it with <em>shirk</em> (association of others in worship of Allaah), and Allaah’s refuge is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is meaning of the saying of the Shaikh (author), that whoever worshipped Allaah and obeyed the Messenger, then he may not associate anything in worship along with Allaah, because Allaah is not pleased that anything be associated with Him in His worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>said in that which he reported from his Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, Allaah the Most High said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">أنا أغنى الشركاء عن الشرك ، من عمل عملا أشرك معي فيه غيري تركته وشركه</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“I am the One having no need of any association of worship. Whoever does an action in which he associates anyone else along with Me, then I will abandon him and his <em>shirk</em>.”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Muslim as a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Huraira (<em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu).</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there are people who pray the <em><u>s</u>alaah</em>, and they bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and they do that plentifully, and they fast and they perform the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em>. However, they make supplication to tombs, and they perform worship of Al-Hasan and Al-Husain and Al-Badawee and so-and-so and so-and-so, and they call for relief from the dead. Those people their worship is false and futile, because they have associated others with Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, they have mixed worship with shirk so their deeds are futile and nullified, until they single out Allaah the Mighty and Majestic with worship and they make worship purely for Him and they abandon the worship of everything else besides Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Otherwise they will be upon nothing, so it is obligatory to draw attention to this, because Allaah is not pleased that anything should be associated with Him in His worship, anyone no matter who it is. He the Perfect is not pleased that anyone should be associated with Him no matter who it may be, so that no-one should say, “I take the beloved servants of Allaah, the righteous people and the good people as intercessors. I do not worship the idols and images as they used to do in the times of ignorance. I only take these ones as intercessors, I do not worship them.” So we say to him: This was the saying of the people in the times of ignorance, they took them as intercessors with Allaah because they were righteous people and beloved servants from the beloved servants of Allaah. But Allaah is not pleased with this.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَمَنْ أَطَاعَهُ دَخَلَ الجَنَّةَ وَمَنْ عَصَاهُ دَخَلَ النَّارَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So whoever obeys him will enter paradise, and whoever disobeys him will enter the fire.<sup>5</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih Al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Whoever obeys him</strong>”: meaning in that which he commands, then he will enter paradise. And his saying, “<strong>And whoever disobeys him</strong>”: in that which he forbade, then he will enter the fire. This is something for which there is a great deal of confirmation in the Qur’aan. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَّن يُطِعِ الرَّسُولَ فَقَدْ أَطَاعَ اللَّهَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Whoever obeys the Messenger, then he has indeed obeyed Allaah. </strong></span>[4:80]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلَّا لِيُطَاعَ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We did not send any Messenger except that he should be obeyed by the permission of Allaah. </strong></span>[4:64]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِن تُطِيعُوهُ تَهْتَدُوا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And if you obey him </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the Prophet </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> you will be rightly guided</span>. </strong>[24:54]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And obey the Messenger that you may be shown mercy. </strong></span>[24:56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever obeys him is guided, and will enter paradise, and whoever disobeys him will be astray and will enter the fire. He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">كلكم يدخل الجنة إلا من أبى ، قالوا : يا رسول الله ومن يأبى ؟ قال : من أطاعني دخل الجنة ومن عصاني فقد أبى</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“All of you will enter paradise except for those who refuse.” They said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, and who will refuse?’ He said, “Whoever obeys me enters paradise and whoever disobeys me has refused.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong>So his <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> saying, “<strong>He has refused</strong>”: means he will have refused to enter paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لا يسمع بي يهودي ولا نصراني ثم لا يؤمن بالذي جئت به إلا دخل النار</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“No-one will hear of me, no Jew nor any Christian, and then not believe in that which I came with except that he will enter the fire.”<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever obeys him will enter paradise and whoever disobeys him will enter the fire, and this is the distinguishing factor between the true believer and between the disbeliever.</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّا أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَيْكُمْ رَسُولًا شَاهِدًا عَلَيْكُمْ كَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ رَسُولًا</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَعَصَىٰ فِرْعَوْنُ الرَّسُولَ فَأَخَذْنَاهُ أَخْذًا وَبِيلًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We sent a Messenger to you as a witness for or against you, just as we sent a Messenger to the Pharaoh. But the Pharaoh disobeyed the Messenger so we seized him with a severe punishment. </strong></span>[73:15-16] <span style="color:#993300;"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih Al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And the proof</strong>”: meaning for the sending of the Messenger is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">We sent a Messenger to you as a witness for or against you, just as we sent a Messenger to the Pharaoh. But the Pharaoh disobeyed the Messenger so we seized him with a severe punishment</span>. </strong>[73:15-16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High, “<em>Innaa</em>”, the pronoun here (meaning ‘We’) refers to Allaah the Perfect and Most High and this is a pronoun of one declaring his own greatness, because He is indeed Tremendous, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“We sent”, likewise this pronoun is to show greatness, and the meaning of, <em>“arsalnaa</em>”, is We sent him and sent revelation to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word, “<em>ilaykum</em>”, (to you people), meaning O two weighty species (mankind and the <em>jinn</em>). It is an address to the whole of mankind, because the <em>risaalah</em> (messengership) of this Messenger is universal to all of mankind until the Hour is established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<em>Rasoolan</em>”, (a Messenger), he is Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam.</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the phrase:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> شَاهِدًا عَلَيْكُمْ كَمَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>As a witness upon you </strong></span>[73:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: with Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, on the Day of Resurrection, a witness that he conveyed to you the message of Allaah, and that he established the proof upon you, just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">رُّسُلًا مُّبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنذِرِينَ لِئَلَّا يَكُونَ لِلنَّاسِ عَلَى اللَّهِ حُجَّةٌ بَعْدَ الرُّسُلِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah sent Messengers as bringers of glad tidings for the obedient ones, and as warners for the disobedient ones, so that no plea should remain with the people with Allaah, after the sending of the Messengers. </strong></span>[4:165]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So no-one on the Day of Resurrection will be able to say, “I did not know that I was created for worship, I did not know what was obligatory upon me, I did not know what was forbidden for me”. It will not be possible for someone to say this, because the Messengers <em>‘alaihimu<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> conveyed the message to them, and this nation of Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam, </em>it will bear witness against them. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَكَذَٰلِكَ جَعَلْنَاكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطًا لِّتَكُونُوا شُهَدَاءَ عَلَى النَّاسِ وَيَكُونَ الرَّسُولُ عَلَيْكُمْ شَهِيدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And likewise We made you the best and a justly balanced nation so that you should be witnesses against mankind, and the Messenger should be a witness upon you. </strong></span>[2:143]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this nation will bear witness against the previous nations on the Day of Resurrection that their Messengers conveyed the messages of Allaah to them, based upon what they find in the Book of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, because Allaah has narrated to us the news of the previous nations and of the Messengers and of what they said to their nations. All of this we know from the Book of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, which is not approached by falsehood from in front nor from behind, which is revelation sent down by the One who is All-Wise, the One Deserving of All Praise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the Messenger he will be … </strong></span>[2:143]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam, </em>he will be upon you, O nation of Mu<u>h</u>ammad, a witness, he will witness upon you with Allaah that he indeed established the proof upon you and that he conveyed the message to you and that he sincerely advised you for Allaah’s sake. So no proof will remain on the Day of Resurrection for a person to say, “Nothing reached me. No warner came to me”. Even the unbelievers, they will confess when they are thrown into the fire. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">كُلَّمَا أُلْقِيَ فِيهَا فَوْجٌ سَأَلَهُمْ خَزَنَتُهَا أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ نَذِيرٌ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قَالُوا بَلَىٰ قَدْ جَاءَنَا نَذِيرٌ فَكَذَّبْنَا وَقُلْنَا مَا نَزَّلَ اللَّهُ مِن شَيْءٍ إِنْ أَنتُمْ إِلَّا فِي ضَلَالٍ كَبِيرٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Whenever a crowd of them are thrown into the fire its keepers will ask them, “Did not a warner come to you?” They will say, “Yes indeed a warner came to us, but we denied, and we said Allaah did not send down anything, you are upon great misguidance.” </strong></span>[67:8-9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said to the Messengers, “You are upon misguidance.” So they denied the Messengers and they declared them to be upon misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the wisdom in the sending of the Messengers – to establish the proof upon the people, and to guide whomever Allaah wished to guide. The Messengers, Allaah guides through them whoever He wishes, and He establishes the proof upon those who obstinately refuse and deny and disbelieve.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">كَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ رَسُولًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Just as we sent a Messenger to Pharaoh</strong></span> [73:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger here is Moosaa <em>‘alaihissalaatu wassalaam </em>and the Pharaoh, he was the tyrannical king in Egypt the one who claimed lordship for himself, and the Pharaoh was the title of every king of Egypt – he was called a Pharaoh. And what is meant by it here is the Pharaoh who claimed <em>ruboobiyyah</em> (lordship) for himself.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَقَالَ أَنَا رَبُّكُمُ الْأَعْلَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">That he said: “I am you highest lord.”</span> </strong>[79:24]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَعَصَىٰ فِرْعَوْنُ الرَّسُولَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So the Pharaoh disobeyed the Messenger </strong></span>[73:16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was Moosaa, Pharaoh disbelieved in him just as Allaah has narrated in His Book, narrating what occurred between Moosaa and the Pharaoh, and how the affair of the Pharaoh and his people ended up.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> فَأَخَذْنَاهُ أَخْذًا وَبِيلًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So we seized him with punishment</span> </strong>[73:16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: We seized Pharaoh with punishement and it was that Allaah drowned him, him and his people, in the ocean. Then he entered him into the fire.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مِّمَّا خَطِيئَاتِهِمْ أُغْرِقُوا فَأُدْخِلُوا نَارًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Because of their sins they were drowned, and they were entered into fire</span>. </strong>[71:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he is in the fire in the <em>Barzakh</em> (the intermediate life after death and before the Day of Resurrection). He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">النَّارُ يُعْرَضُونَ عَلَيْهَا غُدُوًّا وَعَشِيًّا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The fire, they are exposed to it morning and evening </strong></span>[40:46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is in the <em>Barzakh</em> before the hereafter, they are exposed to the fire morning and evening, until the Hour is established, and this is a proof for <em>‘Adhaab-ul-Qabr</em> (punishment of the grave), and Allaah’s refuge is sought.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَيَوْمَ تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ أَدْخِلُوا آلَ فِرْعَوْنَ أَشَدَّ الْعَذَابِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And on the Day when the Hour is established it will be said, “Enter the people of Pharaoh into the severest torment.</strong></span> [40:46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is three punishments:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: that Allaah drowned them and wiped them out, all of them in a simgle moment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: that they are being punished in the <em>Barzakh </em>until the hour is established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>: that when they are raised up on the Day of Resurrection they will enter the severest torment, and Allaah’s refuge is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise will be the case with those who disobey Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam, </em>for his outcome will be more severe than the outcome of the people of Pharaoh, because Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the most excellent one of the Messengers. So whoever disobeys him, his punishment will be worse.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> أَخْذًا وَبِيلًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>With severe punishment </strong></span>[73:16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It means severe and strong with no leniency.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَكَذَٰلِكَ أَخْذُ رَبِّكَ إِذَا أَخَذَ الْقُرَىٰ وَهِيَ ظَالِمَةٌ ۚ إِنَّ أَخْذَهُ أَلِيمٌ شَدِيدٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And thus is the punishment of your Lord when He punishes the towns for their wrongdoing. His punishment is painful and severe</span>.</strong> [11:102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this <em>aayah</em> is a proof for Allaah’s bestowing favour upon us by the sending of the Messenger Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam </em>to us, and that the purpose behind his being sent is that he should make clear to us the way to worship. So whoever obeys him will enter paradise, and whoever disobeys him will enter the fire, just as the people of Pharoah entered the fire when the disobeyed their messenger Moosaa <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam.</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise the enemies of the Messengers, all of them, this is their way and their path.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left"><strong>[7:16 minutes]</strong><br /><strong>Sharh-ul-Usool-ith-Thalaathah : Lesson 07 &#8211; Part B</strong><br /><strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>



<p><strong>Previous Class</strong>:<br /> <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/04/07/allaah-created-us-and-gave-us-provision-and-did-not-leave-us-without-purpose/">The first matter is that Allaah created us and gave us provision and did not leave us without purpose</a></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Rather He sent a Messenger to us</strong></span>.<sup>4</sup></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>[4]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih Al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation</strong></p>



<p>Since it is the case that we may not carry out worship based upon what we think is good nor upon <em>taqleed</em> (blindly following) so-and-so and so-and-so from the people, then therefore Allaah sent to us Messengers to make clear to us how we are to worship him, because acts of worship are <em>tawqeefiyyah</em> (dependent upon text) it is not permissible that Allaah be worshipped except with that which He has legislated.</p>



<p>So acts of worship are <em>tawqeefiyyah</em> – restricted to text, to that which the Messengers <em>‘alaihimu<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> came with. So the wisdom behind sending the Messengers is that they should make clear to the people how they are to worship their Lord, and for them to forbid them from <em>shirk</em> (association of others along with Allaah) and from <em>kufr</em> (disbelief) in Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. This is the duty of the Messengers <em>‘alaihimu<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam. </em>And therefore he <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> said:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;">من عمل عم لا ليس عليه أمرنا فهو رد</span></h3>



<p><strong>“Whoever does an action which our affair is not in accordance with, then it will be rejected”.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>So worship is <em>tawqeefiyyah</em> (dependent upon text), and <em>bid‘a</em> (innovations) are rejected, and baseless superstitions and ideas are rejected and blind following is rejected. Acts of worship are not taken except from the <em>sharee‘ah </em>(revealed law) which the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu alaihi wa sallaam</em> came with.</p>



<p>His saying, “<strong>Rather He sent to us a Messenger</strong>”: he is Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallaam </em>the seal, the last one of the Prophets. He sent him to make clear to us why we were created, and to make clear to us how we are to worship Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and to forbid us from <em>shirk </em>and <em>kufr</em> (unbelief) and from sins. This was the duty of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallaam, </em>and he clearly conveyed the message and he fulfilled the trust which was given to him, and he gave sincere advice to the nation <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam, </em>and he explained fully and made clear, and he left us upon a clear white ground, its night is just the same as its day, no-one deviates away from it except one who is destroyed, and this is just as is in His saying, He the Most High:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;">الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ الْإِسْلَامَ دِينًا</span></h3>



<p><strong><span style="color:#008000;">This day have I completed your religion for you and perfected my favour upon you and are pleased for you with Islaam as your religion</span>.</strong> [5:3]</p>



<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>



<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Its checking has preceded. (Mentioned by al-Bukhaaree in disconnected form as <u>h</u>adeeth 7350 in the Book of clinging to the Book and the Sunnah Chapter 20. And the <em><u>H</u>adeeth</em> is reported by Muslim with a fully connected chain as a <u>h</u>adeeth of ‘Aa’ishah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu ‘anhaa.</em>)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first matter is that Allaah created us and gave us provision and did not leave us without purpose.<sup>3</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>The first: that Allaah created us</strong>”: meaning, He produced us from non-existence, so before we were created we were nothing, just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">هَلْ أَتَىٰ عَلَى الْإِنسَانِ حِينٌ مِّنَ الدَّهْرِ لَمْ يَكُن شَيْئًا مَّذْكُورًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Has there not come upon man a time-period when he was nothing worthy of mention</strong>.</span> [76:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the One free of all imperfections said:<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ كَذَٰلِكَ قَالَ رَبُّكَ هُوَ عَلَيَّ هَيِّنٌ وَقَدْ خَلَقْتُكَ مِن قَبْلُ وَلَمْ تَكُ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He said: that is the case, however your Lord has said, “It is easy for Me and I have already created you before, when you were nothing.” </strong></span>[19:9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man, before he was created was nothing, and the One who brought him into existence and created him is Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْ خُلِقُوا مِنْ غَيْرِ شَيْءٍ أَمْ هُمُ الْخَالِقُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Were they brought into existence without any creator, or are they themselves their own creators? </strong></span>[52:35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>and He gave us provision</strong>”: since we need provision, we need food and drink and clothing and habitations and transport and requirements then He the Perfect, He knew our needs, so therefore He made subservient for us whatever is in the heavens and the earth all of it for our welfare in order for us to be able to remain alive, and in order for us to use that to help us upon the purpose for which we were created – which is the worship of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>and He did not leave us without purpose</strong>”: <em>Al-Haml</em> it means something which is neglected and abandoned which no-one cares about. So Allaah created us and gave us provision for a wise purpose, He did not create us in vain, nor without purpose. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَفَحَسِبْتُمْ أَنَّمَا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ عَبَثًا وَأَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْنَا لَا تُرْجَعُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do you think that you were created uselessly and that you will not be returned to us? </strong></span>[23:115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Perfect said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَيَحْسَبُ الْإِنسَانُ أَن يُتْرَكَ سُدًى</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَمْ يَكُ نُطْفَةً مِّن مَّنِيٍّ يُمْنَىٰ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ كَانَ عَلَقَةً فَخَلَقَ فَسَوَّىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Does man think that he will be left without any duties? Was he not previously a drop of semen emitted, then he became a clot, then Allaah created and fashioned him as a human in due proportion? </strong></span>[75:36-38]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا خَلَقْنَا السَّمَاءَ وَالْأَرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا بَاطِلًا ۚ ذَٰلِكَ ظَنُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا ۚ فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِنَ النَّارِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We did not create the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them without purpose. That is the assumption of those who disbelieve, so woe to those who disbelieve from the Fire!</strong></span> [38:27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah only created us and created these provisions for us and these faculties for a tremendous wisdom and a tremendous purpose and it is that we should worship Him, He the Perfect and Most High.  And He did not create us like cattle, which were created for the welfare of the servants, then they will die and pass away because they are not duty-bound, they were not commanded and they were not forbidden. Rather He created us for His worship, just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا أُرِيدُ مِنْهُم مِّن رِّزْقٍ وَمَا أُرِيدُ أَن يُطْعِمُونِ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الرَّزَّاقُ ذُو الْقُوَّةِ الْمَتِينُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And I did not create <em>jinn</em> and mankind except to worship Me alone. I do not desire from them any provision and I do not want that they should feed Me. Indeed Allaah, He is the Great Provider, the Possessor of Tremendous Power, the Strong.</strong></span> [51:56-58]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He did not create us just for the life of this world that we should live in it and roam  around freely and make merry and eat and drink and make ourselves at home in it and that there is nothing after it. Rather life is a planting-ground and a market place for the next life so that we should equip ourselves in it with righteous deeds. Then we will die and move on from it, then we will be resurrected, then we will be taken account of, then we will be recompensed in accordance with our deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the purpose behind the creation of the <em>jinn</em> and mankind. And the proof for that is many <em>aayahs </em>which prove <em>al-Ba‘ath</em> (the raising to life after death) and <em>an-Nushoor</em> (the resurrection) and <em>al-Jazaa’</em> (the recompensing) and <em>al-<u>H</u>isaab</em> (the reckoning). And the intellect proves this, because it would not befit the Wisdom of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, that He should create this amazing creation, and that he should subject this creation to the descendents of Aadam, and then just leave them to die and pass away without any result, this would be futile play, so the results of these deeds must certainly appear in the next abode.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore, there can be from the people those who spend their whole lives in the worship of Allaah and in obedience to Him, and yet he is in poverty and is needy and maybe he is one who is oppressed and hard-pressed and who suffers difficulty and he does not attain anything from the reward of his actions in this world. And vice versa, that from the people there can be a person who is an unbeliever, an evil atheist who roams around as he wishes and makes merry in this life. He enjoys a life of luxury and he is given whatever he desires, and he commits that which Allaah has made forbidden, and he oppresses the people, and he transgresses against them and he devours their wealth and he kills people without any right, and he overcomes and he behaves tyrannically, and then he dies upon that condition, he has not been struck with anything from punishment. Does it befit the Justice of Allaah the Perfect and Most High and His Wisdom that He should leave this obedient person without any reward and that he should leave this unbeliever without any recompense? This does not befit His Justice, the Perfect and Most High, and therefore He has made the next abode to recompense this doer of good for the good which he did, and this doer of evil for the evil which he did. So in it the fruits of deeds will become apparent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this world is the an abode of action, but as for the hereafter then it is an abode of recompense, either paradise or the fire, and he did not leave us without purpose as is thought by the atheists and the <strong><em>Duhriyyoon</em> </strong>(those who think that death is the end of us). He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالُوا مَا هِيَ إِلَّا حَيَاتُنَا الدُّنْيَا نَمُوتُ وَنَحْيَا وَمَا يُهْلِكُنَا إِلَّا الدَّهْرُ ۚ وَمَا لَهُم بِذَٰلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ ۖ إِنْ هُمْ إِلَّا يَظُنُّونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they say, “There is no life except our life in this world, we die and our children live, and nothing brings an end to us except Time.” And they do not have certain knowledge, rather they just surmise.</span> </strong>[45:24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the saying of the atheists those who do not believe in the return to life and resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Mighty and Majestic rebutted them, so He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَفَنَجْعَلُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ كَالْمُجْرِمِينَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا لَكُمْ كَيْفَ تَحْكُمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Shall we make the Muslims like the criminals just the same? What is wrong with you how do you judge?</span> </strong>[68:35-36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْ حَسِبَ الَّذِينَ اجْتَرَحُوا السَّيِّئَاتِ أَن نَّجْعَلَهُمْ كَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ سَوَاءً مَّحْيَاهُمْ وَمَمَاتُهُمْ ۚ سَاءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do those who commit evil deeds think that We will treat them just the same as those who truly believe and work righteous deeds, the same in their life and after their deaths? What an evil judgement they make. </strong></span>[45:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْ نَجْعَلُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ كَالْمُفْسِدِينَ فِي الْأَرْضِ أَمْ نَجْعَلُ الْمُتَّقِينَ كَالْفُجَّارِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Or shall We make those who truly believe and work righteous deeds like those who cause corruption upon the earth, or shall We treat those who are dutiful to Allaah just like the wicked unbelievers? </strong></span>[38:28]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is not possible and this will never be the case.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<h3>:وَقَالَ البُخَارِيُّ رَحِمَهُ اللهُ: بَابٌ: العِلْمُ قَبْلَ القَوْلِ وَالعَمَلِ. وَالدَّلِيلُ قَوْلُهُ تَعَالَى</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And al-Bukhaaree <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaahuta‘aalaa</em> said: “Chapter: Knowledge comes before speech and action; and the proof is:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَاعْلَمْ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَاسْتَغْفِرْ لِذَنبِكَ وَلِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَاتِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Then know that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and seek forgiveness for your sin and for the believers.</span> </strong>[47:19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong>So He began with knowledge”, before speech and action.<sup>13</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13]: S<strong>haykh Salih Al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhaaree: he was the Imaam Mu<u>h</u>ammad ibn Ismaa‘eel ibn Ibraaheem al-Bukhaaree. Al-Bukhaaree is an ascription to Bukhaaraa, a town in the East. He was the Imaam of the people of <em><u>H</u>adeeth</em>, and a mountain of memorization, may Allaah have mercy upon him, he was the compiler of the <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em>, which is the most authentic of books after the Book of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “Knowledge comes before speech and action”: because action will not benefit unless it is built upon knowledge. As for action which is built upon ignorance, then it will not benefit the person rather it will be an affliction and misguidance for him on the Day of Resurrection, so precedence must be given to learning knowledge before action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “And the proof”: meaning for this heading is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَاعْلَمْ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَاسْتَغْفِرْ لِذَنبِكَ وَلِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَاتِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then know that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and seek forgiveness for your sin </strong></span>[47:19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since He began with knowledge, and His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاسْتَغْفِرْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And seek forgiveness … </strong></span>[47:19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is action. So He the Perfect began with knowledge before action, because action if it is built upon ignorance then it will not benefit the person, so a person should begin with knowledge first and then act upon what he has learnt, this is the foundation.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Proof is He the Most High’s saying:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَالْعَصْرِ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">إِلَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالْحَقِّ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">By Time. Mankind is certainly in loss. Except for those who have <em>eemaan</em> (those who truly believe) and perform righteous deeds, and enjoin one another with the truth and enjoin one another with patience.</span> [103:1-3]</strong><sup style="text-align:justify;">11</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory that you learn these four matters in detail – is there any proof for what the Shaikh has said? That it is obligatory upon us to learn these four matters, and he has promised us that he will not say anything except with a proof, so where is the proof? The proof upon that is His saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Bismillaahirra<u>h</u>maanirra<u>h</u>eem</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">By Time. Mankind is certainly in loss. Except for those who have <em>eemaan</em> </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(those who truly believe)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> and perform righteous deeds, and enjoin one another with the truth and enjoin one another with patience.</span> </strong>[103:1-3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Except for those who have <em>eemaan</em>”, <strong>this is the first matter</strong>: knowledge, because <em>eemaan</em> cannot be except through knowledge, which is awareness of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, awareness of His Prophet and awareness of the religion of Islaam with the proofs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second matter: </strong>“And they perform the righteous deeds”, this is action upon the knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third matter: </strong>“And they enjoin each other with the truth”, this is calling to the knowledge and action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The fourth matter:</strong> “And they enjoin each other with patience”, upon harm in the path of calling to knowledge and action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying, He the One free of all imperfections:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَالْعَصْرِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">By Time.</span> </strong>[103:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The, “<em>Waw</em>”, is the <em>waw-ul-qasm</em> (the <em>‘waw’</em> of an oath). And <em>Al-‘A<u>s</u>r </em>is a noun upon which an oath is sworn and it is <em>majroor</em>, and the sign that it is <em>majroor</em> is that it has a <em>kasrah</em> upon it. And what is meant is Time and a time period.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, swears by a time period and by Time, and it is something created. And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, swears by whatever He wishes from the creation, but the creation may not swear an oath except by Allaah. And Allaah does not swear an oath except by something which has importance, and which contains a Sign from His Signs, He the Perfect and Most High. So this Time, contains a lesson and has importance, and therefore Allaah swore an oath by Time, and He swore by the night when it covers, and He swore an oath by the daytime brightness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for the creation, then he may not swear an oath except by Allaah. And it is not permissible for us to swear an oath by other than Allaah. He <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu’ alaihi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever swears an oath by other than Allaah, then he has committed unbelief or he has committed shirk.”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever is going to swear an oath, then let him swear by Allaah or let him keep silent.”</strong><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah swears by whatever he wishes and he does not swear except by something which has importance and which contains a lesson, so what is the lesson here in this Time? The lessons are tremendous, the succession of the night and the day, and how they interchange and take from each other, this one taking from that one, and that one taking from this one, and they succeed each other in this amazing ordered manner which does not vary or alter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a proof for the Ability of Allaah the Perfect and Most High. And then, whatever occurs within this Time from events and catastrophies and calamities and from favours and blessings and good things, and whatever occurs within this Time, this is from the lessons. And likewise because night and day are an arena for righteous action to be performed in. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> .. وَهُوَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ اللَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ خِلْفَةً </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He </strong>(Allaah)<strong> is the One who made the night and the day to follow each other in succession …</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning they follow each other in succession, this one follows on from this one.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> لِّمَنْ أَرَادَ أَن يَذَّكَّرَ أَوْ أَرَادَ شُكُورًا ..</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">… for whoever wants to be reminded of Allaah or whoever wants to give thanks for Allaah’s favours.</span> </strong>[25:62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in some of the recitations of this <em>aayah, </em>it occurs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">… for the one who wants to remember Allaah …</span> </strong>[25:62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the night and the day are a tremendous bounty to be earned for a person who utilizes them in obedience to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and the arena for action is the night and the day, you have nothing else besides the night and the day, they are the arena for action and for good and pure earning for this world and the hereafter. So in the night and the day there are lessons and there are benefits, so therefore Allaah swore an oath by Time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is this oath sworn upon? It is His saying:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Mankind is certainly in loss.</span> </strong>[103:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It (Mankind) means all of the descendants of Aadam, He did not exclude anyone, neither the kings nor the leaders, nor the rich people nor the poor people, nor the free people nor the slaves, nor the males nor the females. So, “<em>Al-</em>”, in, “<em>Al-Insaan</em>”, is for <em>istighraaq</em> – to make the word all-inclusive. All of the descendants of Aadam are in loss, meaning they will be in loss and destruction if they waste this precious Time, and they utilize it in disobedience to Allaah and in doing that which will harm them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this Time which is very cheap with many people, time seems prolonged for them, they become weary and bored, and they say, “<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>We want to kill some time</strong></span>”. So they bring amusements, or they travel abroad to spend a holiday and just to spend some time somewhere, or they laugh and joke to use up time. So those people, they use it up and waste it – then it will be loss and regret upon them on the Day of Resurrection. And it could be the source of their true happiness, if only they took care of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So all of the descendants of Aadam are in loss and destruction, except for those who have the <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">four qualities</span></strong> which are: knowledge and action and calling to Allaah and having patience upon any harm which the person meets. So whoever has these four qualities will be saved from this loss.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And having <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah is not possible except through having knowledge, which is knowledge and awareness of Allaah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"> وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they perform the righteous and correct deeds</span> </strong>[103:3]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning they perform the righteous deeds from the obligatory duties and the recommended duties. So they utilize their time in performing the righteous deeds in that which will benefit them in their religion and in their worldly life, for even worldly action contains good and can contain reward if it is done with the intention of using it as an aid upon obedience. So how about action for the hereafter. So what is important is that you do not waste the time, rather you use it in something which will be to your advantage and benefit you.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالْحَقِّ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they enjoin each other with the truth</span> </strong>[103:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They command the good and they forbid the evil and they call to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and they teach beneficial knowledge and they propagate knowledge and good amongst the people. They become callers to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"> وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they enjoin each other with having patience.</span> </strong>[103:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They have patience upon whatever strikes them. <span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>abr</em></strong></span> in the language means <strong>restraining</strong>, and what is meant by it here is restraining oneself upon obedience to Allaah. And it is of three types:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first one is: </strong>Patience upon obedience to Allaah.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second one is: </strong>Patience in keeping away from those things which Allaah has forbidden.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third one is:</strong> Having patience with those things which Allaah has Pre-decreed to occur.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So the first:</strong> patience upon obedience to Allaah, because the person’s soul desires laziness and desires relaxation, so therefore a person must force it to have patience upon obedience and upon the prayer and upon fasting and upon <em>jihaad</em> in Allaah’s cause even though it may dislike these matters, he should cause it to have patience and he should restrain it on obedience to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the second: </strong>patience in keeping away from those things Allaah has made forbidden. The soul desires forbidden things and desires. It inclines towards them and is attracted to them, so therefore the person must bind it and restrain it away from the forbidden things, and this requires patience, and it is not easy to prevent the soul from desires and forbidden things. Whoever does not have patience, then his soul will overcome him and incline towards forbidden things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third is: </strong>having patience with the painful things which Allaah has decreed, the calamities which strike a person, from the death of a close relative or loss of wealth or illness which befalls a person, he must have patience upon the pre-ordainment and pre-decree of Allaah and he should not become vexed and he should not become angry, rather he should restrain the tongue from wailing and forbidden lamenting and from displaying anger and he should withhold himself from vexation and he should withhold his limbs from striking the cheeks and from tearing the front-opening of the garments. This is patience upon calamities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for faults, then he should not have patience upon them, rather he should repent to Allaah and flee away from them. However, with regard to calamities which are not something which you yourself have done, rather they are from Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, He has decreed that they will occur to you as a test and a trial or as a punishment for you for sins which you have committed just as there occurs in His saying the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا أَصَابَكُم مِّن مُّصِيبَةٍ فَبِمَا كَسَبَتْ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَيَعْفُو عَن كَثِيرٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whatever calamity strikes you then it is on account of the sins which your hands have committed and Allaah pardons and does not punish, a great deal.</span> </strong>[42:30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a calamity strikes the Muslim in his self or in his wealth or in his children or his close relative or one of his brothers from the Muslims, then it is upon him to have patience and to await reward. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِينَ إِذَا أَصَابَتْهُم مُّصِيبَةٌ قَالُوا<span style="color:#008000;"> إِنَّا لِلَّهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ</span></span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أُولَٰئِكَ عَلَيْهِمْ صَلَوَاتٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَرَحْمَةٌ ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُهْتَدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those who, when a calamity strikes them they say, “Indeed we belong to Allaah and we will certainly be returning to Him”. Those people, upon them is praise from their Lord and mercy, and they are the ones who are guided.</span> [2:156-157]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is patience, and from that is having patience upon harm which comes in calling to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, for that is from the calamities. So it is upon you to have patience upon whatever you meet from harm upon the path of good. And do not turn away from doing good, because some people wish to do good, however, if something which he dislikes faces him he then says, “It is not obligatory upon me to enter myself into these matters”. Then he abandons teaching if he is a teacher, he abandons calling to Allaah, he abandons giving the <em>khu<u>t</u>bah</em> if he is a <em>kha<u>t</u>eeb</em> (one who gives the <em>khu<u>t</u>bah</em> in a mosque), he abandons leading the prayer in the mosque, he abandons commanding the good and forbidding the evil – this person has not had patience upon the harm which came to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you are upon error, then it is upon you to turn back to the truth and to correctness, but if you are upon  something true and you have not erred, then it is upon you to have patience and to await and expect reward and to be aware and to feel that this is in the cause of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and that you will receive reward for it, and that you remember the harm which occurred to the Prophets <em>‘alaihimu<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam </em>and how they had patience and how they strove and fought in Allaah’s cause, until Allaah the Mighty and Majestic gave them victory.</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ الشَّافِعِيُّ رَحِمَهُ اللهُ:<span style="color:#808000;"> لَوْ مَا أَنْزَلَ اللهُ حُجَّةً عَلَى خَلْقِهِ إِلاَّ هَذِهِ السُّوْرَةَ لَكَفَتْهُمْ</span></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shaafi‘ee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said: “<strong>If Allaah had not sent down any proof upon his creation except this <em>soorah</em>, then that would have sufficed for them</strong>.”<sup>12</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “Ash-Shaafi‘ee”: He is the Imaam Mu<u>h</u>ammad ibn Idrees Ash-Shaafi‘ee and Ash-Shaafi‘ee is an ascription to his great great grandfather who was called Shaafi‘, and he was from Quraish from Banul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib. He died in the year 204 H, and he was one of the four Imaams. And he said this saying, because Allaah has made clear in this <em>soorah</em> the reasons for wretchedness and the means for true happiness and success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the means for true happiness and success is that the person has these four characteristics: knowledge, and action, and calling, and having patience upon harm in the cause of Allaah the Most High. So Allaah’s proof is established upon His creation through this <em>soorah</em>. Allaah the Perfect says to them &#8211; I have made clear to you the means for true happiness in this short and brief <em>soorah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Qur’aan, all of it, and the Sunnah are details for these four matters. However, this <em>soorah</em> has made clear the means to true happiness and success in general terms, through it the proof has been established upon the creation, and the texts of the Qur’aan and the Sunnah give the details and clarify these four matters. And the speech of Ash-Shaafi‘ee does not mean that this <em>soorah</em> is sufficient for mankind, even if Allaah had not sent down anything else. But rather it has established the proof upon them, because Allaah has made clear in it the means to true happiness and the reasons for total wretchedness, so on the Day of Resurrection no-one can say, “I did not know the means to true happiness and I did not know the reasons leading to total wretchedness”, when he has read this brief and short <em>soorah</em>.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<h3><strong>Calling to the Knowledge</strong></h3>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الثَّالِثَةُ: الدَّعْوَةُ إِلَيْهِ<sup> </sup><span style="font-size:10px;vertical-align:super;"> </span></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The third is calling to it.<sup>9</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Calling to it</strong>”: meaning, it is not sufficient that a person learns knowledge and acts himself and does not call to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. Rather he must call and invite others so that he benefits himself and benefits others, and because this knowledge is something he is entrusted with, it is not your personal property which you can hoard away and withhold from the people, when the people are in need of it. So what is obligatory upon you is to convey it and to explain it and to call the people to good. This knowledge, which Allaah has given you the task of carrying, is not an endowment for your benefit alone, rather it is for you and for others besides you, so do not keep it to yourself and prevent the people from benefiting from it. Rather it is essential that you convey it and you must clarify it to the people. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِذْ أَخَذَ اللَّهُ مِيثَاقَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ لَتُبَيِّنُنَّهُ لِلنَّاسِ وَلَا تَكْتُمُونَهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And when Allaah took the solemn agreement from those who were given the scripture, you must make it clear to the people and not conceal it</span> </strong>[3:187]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a solemn agreement which Allaah took from the <em>‘ulemaa</em> (people of knowledge) that they would make clear to the people that which Allaah has taught them, in order that the good should spread, and to bring the people out from the depths of darkness into light, and this was the work of the Messengers and of those who followed them. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ هَٰذِهِ سَبِيلِي أَدْعُو إِلَى اللَّهِ ۚ عَلَىٰ بَصِيرَةٍ أَنَا وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَنِي ۖ وَسُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَمَا أَنَا مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say: “This is my way, I call to Allaah upon clear knowledge, I and those who follow me, and Perfect is Allaah and I am not from the people of <em>shirk</em> (those who associate others with Allaah).”</span> </strong>[12:108]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the way of Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam </em>and the way of his followers: knowledge, and action and calling to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. So whoever does not call, and he has the ability to call, and he has knowledge and he conceals it, then he will be given a bridle of fire on the Day of Resurrection as occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Aboo Daawood and At-Tirmidhee and Ibn Maajah from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah who said: Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong> “Whoever is asked about knowledge and he conceals it, then Allaah will give him a bridle of fire on the Day of Resurrection”. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Albaanee declared this <u>h</u>adeeth <u>h</u>asan <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibn Maajah reports a longer wording from Aboo Sa‘eed Al-Khudree … [declared very weak by Al-Albaanee].</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Having patience upon harm which is encountered whilst carrying this out.</strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong><span style="color:#993300;">الرَّابِعَةُ: الصَّبْرُ عَلَى الأَذَى فِيهِ<sup>  </sup></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><sup> </sup>The fourth is having patience upon any harm encountered whilst carrying it out.<sup>10</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Having patience upon any harm encountered whilst carrying it out</strong>”: it is known that whoever calls the people, and commands the good and forbids the evil, then he will be exposed to harm from the evil-doers, because many of the people do not want good, rather they want desires and forbidden things and false whims, so when someone comes who calls them to Allaah and who deters them away from their desires, then there will certainly be a reaction from them either in speech or in action. So what is obligatory upon whoever calls to Allaah and desires the Face of Allaah is that he should have patience upon the harm, and he should persist in calling to Allaah, and his example in that regard will be the Messengers <em>‘alaihimu<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>, and the best of them and their seal is Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ’alaihi wasallam.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What did he encounter from the people, how much harm did he suffer in sayings and actions? They said he was a sorcerer and a liar, and they said he was a madman. They said those sayings about him which Allaah the Mighty and Majestic has mentioned in the Qur’aan. And they harmed him with physical harm, they threw stones at him until his heels ran with blood <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ’alaihi wasallam</em> when he called them to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. And they threw the after-birth of camels on his back whilst he was making prostration by the Ka‘bah, and they threatened to kill him and they tried to intimidate him, and in the battle of U<u>h</u>ud, there occurred to him and to his Companions that which occurred <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> – they broke his lateral incisor tooth and they wounded his head <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ’alaihi wasallam</em> and he fell into a ditch, and he was the Prophet of Allaah – all of this was harm in calling to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. However he had patience and he bore it and he was the most excellent one of the creation <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>. So therefore whoever carries out this call will certainly face harm in accordance with the level of his <em>eemaan</em> and his call, however it is upon him to have patience as long as he is upon the truth, then he should have patience and bear it, for he is in Allaah’s cause, and whatever harm befalls him then it will be reward from Allaah the Perfect and Most High, upon the scale of his good deeds.</p>

<p><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F422807028&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> </strong>الثَّانِيَةُ: العَمَلُ بِهِ  <sup> </sup></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second: Action upon it.<sup>8</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “Action upon it”: meaning upon the knowledge, since it is not sufficient that a person teaches and learns, rather he must act upon his knowledge. So knowledge without action is just a proof against the person, so knowledge will not be beneficial except with action. As for the person who has knowledge, and he does not act upon it, then he is one upon whom is Anger, because he knows the truth, but he abandons it upon knowledge and insight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the poet says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>The scholar who does not act upon his knowledge,<br />
</em><em>                        Will be punished before the worshippers of idols</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is mentioned in the noble hadeeth:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إن من أول من تسعر ﺑﻬم النار يوم القيامة ، عالم لم يعمل بعلمه<em> </em></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“That from the first of those for whom the Fire will be made to blaze on the Day of Resurrection will be a scholar who does not act upon his knowledge”.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowledge is joined to action, and action is the fruit of knowledge, so knowledge without action is like a tree without fruit, there is no benefit in it, and knowledge was sent down to bring about action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as action without knowledge will be an affliction and misguidance for its person. If a person acts without knowledge, then his action will be affliction and a burden upon the person. He <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ’alaihi wasallam </em>said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">من عمل عملا ليس عليه أمرنا فهو رد</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever does an action which our affair is not in accordance with, then it will be rejected”.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore we read in <em>Al-Faati<u>h</u>ah</em> in every <em>rak’ah:</em></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">اهْدِنَا الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا الضَّالِّينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Guide us upon the straight path, the path of those whom You have favoured, not those upon whom is Your Anger, nor those who are astray.</span> [1:6-7]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah called those people who act without knowledge those who are astray; and those people who have knowledge, but do not act upon it as being those upon whom is Anger. So let us be attentive to that, because it is very important.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a>  A similar <u>h</u>adeeth is reported by At-Tirmidhee, and it is part of a long <u>h</u>adeeth, and it contains the wording, “<strong>Those three people will be  the first of the creation for whom Allaah will make the Fire blaze on the Day of Resurrection</strong>”, from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu ‘anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[However the wording of the <u>h</u>adeeth mentions three men, who will be the first for whom the Fire will blaze – “<strong>So the first of these men will be a person who gathered the Qur’aan…</strong>”. Al-Albaanee declares this <u>h</u>adeeth <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a>  Reported by al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree in disconnected form as <u>h</u>adeeth 7350, and reported by Muslim as <u>h</u>adeeth 1718/18 from a <u>h</u>adeeth of ‘Aa’ishah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu ‘anhaa. </em>And also reported by al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree in connected form as <u>h</u>adeeth 2697 and Muslim as <u>h</u>adeeth 1718/17 from ‘Aa’ishah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu ‘anhaa, </em>that she said, Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ’alaihi wasallam </em>said, “<strong>Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it will have it rejected</strong>”.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَهُوَ مَعْرِفَةُ اللهِ ، <sup> </sup>وَمَعْرِفَةُ نَبِيِّهِ <sup>  </sup></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><sup> </sup>And it is knowledge and awareness of Allaah and knowledge of His Prophet<sup>5</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And it is knowledge and awareness of Allaah</strong>”: How does the servant come to have knowledge and awareness of his Lord? He knows of Him through His Signs and His created things, so from His Signs are the night and the day, and from those things which He has created are the sun and the moon, as will be explained later on <em>inshaa’ Allaah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He knows of Allaah by means of His <strong><em>Aayaat-ul-Kawneeyah</em></strong> (Signs within the creation) and His <strong><em>Aayaat-ul-Qur’aaneeyah</em></strong> (The aayahs of His Qur’aan). If he recites the Qur’aan, then He knows that Allaah the Perfect and Most High – He is the One who created the heavens and the earth and that He is the One who made subservient whatever is within the heavens and the earth, and that He is the One who gives life and gives death, and that He has full Ability over everything, and that He is <em>Ar-Ra<u>h</u>maan </em>the Extremely Merciful One, and <em>Ar-Ra<u>h</u>eem</em> the One Who bestows mercy. So the Qur’aan provides knowledge and awareness of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and that He is the One Who bestowed all favours upon us, and that He is the One who created us and gives us provision, so if you recite the Qur’aan, then you will know your Lord, the Perfect and Most High, by way of His Names and His Attributes and His Actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you look into the creation, then you will know and be aware of your Lord, the Perfect and Most High – that He is the One Who created this creation, and who made this creation subservient, and Who caused it to proceed by His Wisdom and His Knowledge – He the Perfect and Most High; this is knowledge of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And knowledge of His Prophet</strong>”: he is Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ’alaihi wa sallam</em>, because he was the one who conveyed the message from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, he is the intermediary between us and Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, with regard to conveying the message, so therefore it is essential that you know him, you know who he is, and you know his lineage, and you know his city, and you know that which he <em>sallallaahu ’alaihi wa sallam</em> came with. That you know how the revelation first came to him, and how he established the call to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, in Makkah and in Al-Madeenah. That you know the life history of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ’alaihi wa sallam </em> even if it is in abridged form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ’alaihi wa sallam</em>, he is Mu<u>h</u>ammad the son of ‘Abdullaah, the son of ‘Abdul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib, the son of Haashim, the son of ‘Abd-Manaaf, all the way to the end of the noble Prophetic lineage, which goes all the way back to Ibraaheem <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>. And you know how he lived before he was raised as a Prophet, and how the revelation came to him from Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and what did he <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> do after his being raised as a Prophet – you know that through study of his <em>seerah </em>(of his life), and it is not befitting for the Muslim that he should be ignorant of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ’alaihi wasallam</em>. For how can you follow a person when you do not have knowledge of him? This cannot be comprehended.</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَعْرِفَةُ دِينِ الإِسْلامِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And knowledge of the religion of Islaam<sup>6</sup></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Knowledge of the religion of Islaam</strong>”: which is the religion of this Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ’alaihi wasallam</em>. Indeed, it is the religion of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, which He commanded His servants with, and which He commanded you to follow, and you are required to follow it, so you must have knowledge and awareness of this religion. And Islaam is the religion of all of the Messengers. All of the Messengers, their religion was Islaam, with the general meaning. So everyone who followed a Messenger from the Messengers, then he is a Muslim, one who submits in Islaam to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, one who submitted to Him and one who singled Him out with all worship – this is Islaam with the general meaning, that it is the religion of all the Messengers. So Islaam is:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الاستسلام لله بالتوحيد والانقياد له بالطاعة والخلوص من الشرك وأهله</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“To submit to Allaah with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, and to comply to Him with obedience, and remaining free of <em>shirk</em> and its people”</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Islaam with the specific meaning, then it is that which Allaah sent His Prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam</em> with, since after the sending of the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam</em> then there is no religion except for his religion <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatuwassalaam. </em>And Islaam is confined to following him <em><u>s</u>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam, </em>so it is not possible for a Jew to now say, “I am a Muslim”, or a Christian to say, “I am a Muslim”, after the sending of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam, </em>if he does not follow him. So Islaam, after the sending of the Prophet, is following him <em><u>s</u>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam. </em>He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Say: If you people truly love Allaah, then follow Me, then Allaah will love you [3:31]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is Islaam with its general meaning and with its specific meaning.</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">بِالأَدِلَّةِ<sup>    </sup></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">With the proofs.<sup>7</sup></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “With the proofs”: not due to <em>taqleed</em> (blind following), but rather with the proofs from the Qur’aan and from the Sunnah – this is knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ul-Qayyim said in <em>Al-Kaafiyat-ush-Shaafiyah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Knowledge is Allaah said, His Prophet said,</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>          The Companions said – they are the possessors of knowledge and awareness</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Knowledge is not that you foolishly raise up a disagreement</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>          Between the Messenger and the opinion of so-and-so.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what is knowledge, knowledge is the knowledge contained in the Book and the Sunnah. As for the sayings of the <em>’ulemaa</em> (the scholars), then they only explain and clarify the speech of Allaah and the speech of the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam, </em>and some of them may contain a mistake, and the proofs are not the speech of the <em>’ulemaa</em>, rather the proofs are the <em>aayahs</em> of the Qur’aan and the Prophetic <em>a<u>h</u>adeeth</em>. As for the speech of scholars, then it explains and clarifies that, except it is not a proof in itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the first matter, and it is the foundation, the Shaikh <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> began with it because it is the foundation, and one should begin with <em>‘aqeedah</em> (creed and belief), and with the foundation in learning, and in teaching, and in calling to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. <em>‘Aqeedah</em> should be begun with, because it is the fundamental basis, and it is the foundation.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>That it is obligatory upon us to learn four matters</strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">الأُوْلَى: العِلْمُ</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The first is knowledge<sup>4</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “knowledge”: what is meant by knowledge here, is <strong><em>al-‘ilm ash-shar‘ee</em></strong> the legislated (islaamic) knowledge, because that is what it is obligatory to learn, and these matters are obligatory to learn upon every Muslim, male or female, free or slave, rich or poor, a king or a pauper, every Muslim, it is obligatory upon him that he should learn these four matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is what the scholars call <strong><em>al-waajib al-‘aynee</em></strong>, and it is what is obligatory upon every individual from the Muslims. So the five obligatory prayers which are upon the men and the  women, and the congregational prayer in the mosques, which is upon the men, this is obligatory upon every individual from the Muslims, that he learns about them. Therefore he said, “it is obligatory upon us”, and he did not say, “it is obligatory upon some of us”, rather he said, “it is obligatory upon us”, meaning upon us the Muslims. So it is from the knowledge which it is obligatory to learn upon all individuals, because knowledge is of two categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first of them: that which it is obligatory upon all individuals to learn</strong>, such that there is no excuse for anyone to be ignorant of it, and it is that which is such that the religion cannot be correctly established except with it, such as the five pillars of Islaam which are the Two Testifications, and the establishment of the Prayer, and the giving of the <em>Zakaat, </em>and the fast of <em>Rama<u>d</u>aan, </em>and <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> to the sacred House of Allaah. It is not permissible for the Muslim to be ignorant of that, rather he must learn it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since learning the meaning of the Two Testifications, is to learn the <em>‘aqeedah </em>(creed and belief), so the Muslim learns the creed and belief in order to act upon it, and he learns whatever opposes it in order to keep away from it – this is what is contained in the Two Testifications.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise he learns the pillars of the Prayer, and the conditions of the Prayer, and the obligations of the Prayer, and the sunnahs of the Prayer; he must learn these matters in detail. It is not just the case that he can pray when he does not know the rulings of the prayer. How can a person do an action when he does not have knowledge of the action which he is performing? How can he perform the Prayer when is ignorant of its rulings? So it is essential that he learns the rulings of the Prayer, and those things which nullify the Prayer, he must learn this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise he should learn the rulings of the <em>Zakaat</em>, and he should learn the rulings of the Fasting, and he should learn the rulings of the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em>, so when he wants to perform <em><u>H</u>ajj</em>, it becomes obligatory upon him to learn the rulings of the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> and the rulings of the <em>‘Umrah</em> in order to perform these acts of worship in the prescribed and legislated manner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this category, no-one is excused for being ignorant of it, and it is what is called <em>al-waajib al-‘aynee </em>that which is obligatory upon every individual Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second category from the categories of knowledge</strong>, is that which is additional to that, from the legislated rulings which the <em>Ummah</em> (Islaamic Nation) together has need of, and it may be the case that not every individual has a need of it, such as the rulings of trading, and the rulings of dealing and transactions, and the rulings of religious endowments, and laws of inheritance and bequests and the rulings of marriages, and the rulings relating to crimes. These are essential for the <em>Ummah</em>. However it is not obligatory upon every individual from the <em>Ummah</em> that he has to learn it. Rather, if these things are learnt by sufficient number of scholars, such that what is required is attained, then that will suffice so that they can fulfill the need of the Muslims for legal judgments and for religious verdicts and for teaching and other than this. This is called <strong><em>waajib al-kifaayah</em></strong> (the communal obligation), such that if a sufficient number of people carry it out, then sin falls away from the rest, and if all of them leave it, then they will all be sinful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the <em>Ummah</em> must have people who learn this category since they are in need of it. However, it is not said to every individual, “it is obligatory upon you to acquire knowledge of these matters”, because this may not  be possible for every individual. Rather this is specific to the people of ability and the people of capability from the <em>Ummah. </em>And if this is learnt by some of the <em>Ummah</em>, then the obligation has been established, contrary to the first category, for there, every individual is accountable for it himself, because it is not possible for him to perform these actions except with knowledge. And therefore the Shaikh said, “it is obligatory upon us”, and he did not say, “it is obligatory upon the Muslims”, or, “it is obligatory upon some of the Muslims”. Rather he said, “it is obligatory upon us”, meaning upon everyone from us as an individual obligation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we should know, before entering into the matters, that what is meant by knowledge, which it is obligatory upon the <em>Ummah</em> – whether it be that which is obligatory upon every individual, or whether it be that which is obligatory upon some, then it is <strong><em>al-‘ilm ash-shar‘ee</em></strong> the legislated (islaamic) knowledge, that which the Messenger <em>sallallaahu‘alaihiwasallam</em> came with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <strong>worldly knowledge</strong>, such as the knowledge of industries, and professions, and arithmetic, and mathematics, and engineering, then this knowledge is permissible – it is permissible to learn it and it can be obligatory if the <em>Ummah</em> has need of it, then it will be obligatory on those who are capable. However, it is not the knowledge which is intended in the Qur’aan and the Sunnah, that which Allaah the Most High has praised and commended its people, and that which the Prophet <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>said about it:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">العلماء ورثة الأنبياء</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The <em>‘ulemaa</em>, (the scholars, or the people of knowledge) are the inheritors of the Prophets.”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant is <em>al-‘ilm ash-shar‘ee</em> the legislated (islaamic) knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for worldly knowledge, then whoever is ignorant of it, then there is no sin upon him, and whoever learns it, then it is permissible for him, and if he utilises it to benefit the <em>Ummah</em>, then he is rewarded for it. And if a person died, and he was ignorant of this knowledge, then he would not be taken to account for it on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, whoever died and he was ignorant of <em>al-‘ilm ash-shar‘ee</em> the legislated (islaamic) knowledge, particularly essential knowledge, then he will be asked about it on the Day of Resurrection, “Why didn’t you learn? Why didn’t you ask?”. The one who says when he is placed in his grave, “My Lord is Allaah, and Islaam is my religion, and my Prophet is Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wasallam</em>”, this person will be saved.  It will be said to him, “Where did you acquire this from?”. So he will say, “I read the Book of Allaah and I learnt it”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the person who turns away from that, then when he is questioned in his grave, then he will say, “Haa, haa, I don’t know, I heard the people saying something so I said it”. Then this person, his grave will be made to blaze with fire upon him – and Allaah’s refuge is sought – and it will be crushed upon him, to such an extent that his ribs will cross over, and he will come to be in a pit from the pits of the hell-fire, because he did not have knowledge and he did not read. So it will be said to him:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">لا دريت ولا تليت )  أو لا تلوت )</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“You did not know and you did not read (or you did not follow)”.</strong><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong>So he did not learn and he did not follow the example of the people of knowledge, rather he was wasted and lost in his life, so this is the person who ends up in wretchedness, and Allaah’s refuge is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his saying, “Knowledge”, this is the legislated knowledge that is required from us as a body and as individuals, and it is knowledge and awareness of Allaah through His Names and His Attributes, and knowledge of His right upon us, which is to worship Him alone ascribing no partner to Him, so the first thing that is obligatory upon the servant is knowledge and awareness of his Lord the Mighty and Majestic, and how to worship Him.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> This is reported by al-Bukhaaree in disconnected form in the Book of Knowledge, Chapter, “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Knowledge comes before speech and action</strong></span>”, it follows on from <u>h</u>adeeth 67; and is reported by Aboo Daawood, and ibn Maajah and at-Tirmidhee from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Ad-Dardaa <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu‘anhu.</em> [Al-Albaanee declared the <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Daawood <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>].</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">اِعْلَمْ <sup> </sup>رَحِمَكَ اللهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Know! May Allaah have Mercy upon you</strong></span><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “Know!”, it is a word which indicates giving importance to the topic, so when he said, “Know!”, then its meaning is that the matter which he is going to put before you is a matter which is important. So this word, “Know!”, indicates the importance of the topic which he is beginning it with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the meaning of, “<strong>Know</strong>!”, Is that it is a command from, ‘<strong>knowledge</strong>’, meaning, ‘<strong>learn</strong>!’. And knowledge means: to comprehend something as it actually is, or, to perceive something in accordance with how it actually is.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To comprehend something in a manner which is contrary to how it actually is in reality, or to perceive something contrary to the reality of it, this is ignorance, and it is the opposite of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<em>May Allaah have Mercy upon you</em>”, this is a supplication for the seeker of knowledge, so the shaikh makes supplication for the student of knowledge, that Allaah has Mercy upon him, and that He the Perfect and Most High should place Mercy upon them. So this shows the kindness of the teacher towards the student, and that he should begin with good and fine speech, and with righteous supplication, so that this has an effect upon him and so that he turns attentively to his teacher.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for if the teacher begins with stern words, and with speech which is not appropriate, then this will alienate (i.e. will cause the student to flee). So what is obligatory upon the teacher and upon whoever calls to Allaah and whoever commands the good and forbids the evil is to be kind and gentle with those he addresses with making supplication for him and complimenting him and speaking with mild speech, because this is more likely to bring about acceptance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the obstinate opponent and the person who proudly refuses to accept, then there is a different way of addressing this person. Allaah the Perfect said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَا تُجَادِلُوا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ إِلَّا بِالَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ إِلَّا الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا مِنْهُمْ ۖ وَقُولُوا آمَنَّا بِالَّذِي أُنزِلَ إِلَيْنَا وَأُنزِلَ إِلَيْكُمْ وَإِلَٰهُنَا وَإِلَٰهُكُمْ وَاحِدٌ وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And do not debate with the People of the Book except in a manner which is best, except those of them who transgress. And say we truly believe in what was sent down to us, and what was sent down to you, and our Lord whom we worship and your Lord is One, and we are Muslims in submission to Him. </strong></span>[29:46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So those who transgressed from the People of the Book and knowingly and obstinately refused the truth, and rejected the truth with pride, those people are not addressed in the manner which is finest, rather they are addressed with that which will deter them. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ جَاهِدِ الْكُفَّارَ وَالْمُنَافِقِينَ وَاغْلُظْ عَلَيْهِمْ ۚ وَمَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ ۖ وَبِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O Prophet, strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be stern with them. And their final abode is the Hell-fire, and what an evil destination</span>. </strong>[9:73]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hypocrites, they are not fought against with weapons, rather <em>jihaad</em> is waged against them with proof and speech and by refuting them with sternness as a deterrent for them, and in order to deter the rest of the people away from them. And He the Most High said with regard to them:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ يَعْلَمُ اللَّهُ مَا فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ فَأَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ وَعِظْهُمْ وَقُل لَّهُمْ فِي أَنفُسِهِمْ قَوْلًا بَلِيغًا </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And admonish them with a saying which will have an effect upon them.</span> </strong>[4:63]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a specific manner of addressing those people, because they are people who deliberately and obstinately reject, and reject from pride, and they do not want the truth, rather they want to misguide the people, so those people are addressed with that which befits them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the student who seeks guidance, then he should be spoken to with gentleness and mercy, and kindness, because he desires the truth, and he desires knowledge and he desires benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<em>Know! May Allaah have Mercy upon you</em>”, is a supplication for you for mercy, for if Allaah truly has Mercy upon you, then through that you will be blissful in this life and in the hereafter, if you enter within the Mercy of Allaah – and this is a supplication from a great scholar and a righteous man, so it is to be hoped that it will be accepted, if Allaah wishes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>[11:33 minutes]</strong><br /><strong>Sharh-ul-Usool-ith-Thalaathah : Lesson 01 : Part B</strong><br /><strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>



<p><strong>The Author’s Introduction</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">قال رحمه الله:<span style="color:#008000;"><strong> بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمَـٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</strong></span></h3>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#993300;">He, may Allaah have mercy upon him, said: <strong>In the Name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy</strong>.<sup>1</sup></span></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p class="has-text-align-justify">[1]: He began, may Allaah have mercy upon him, this treatise with the <strong><em>Basmalah</em></strong>, following the example of the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, since the first thing which you see in the <em>mus-<u>h</u>af</em> (the printed copy of the Qur’aan), and before every <em>soorah</em> of it is, <em>Bismi Allāhi Ar-Raĥmāni Ar-Raĥīm</em> (In the Name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy).</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">So therefore it is used to begin treatises, or letters and books and works following the example of the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. And likewise the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wasallam</em> used to write it at the start of his letters when he wrote to the governors and the chiefs and to those who were in the different regions of the earth, calling them to Islaam, he would begin his letter with,&nbsp; <em>Bismi Allāhi Ar-Raĥmāni Ar-Raĥīm</em>.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wasallam</em> used to begin his talks and his speech with,&nbsp; <em>Bismi Allāhi Ar-Raĥmāni Ar-Raĥīm (</em>“In the Name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy”), which shows that beginning with,&nbsp; <em>Bismi Allāhi Ar-Raĥmāni Ar-Raĥīm</em>, is the sunnah of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wasallam, </em>just as Sulaymaan <em>‘alaihissalaam</em> when he wrote to Bilqees, the Queen of Saba’, he began his letter with, <em>Bismi Allāhi Ar-Raĥmāni Ar-Raĥīm</em>:</p>



<h3 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَتْ يَا أَيُّهَا الْمَلَأُ إِنِّي أُلْقِيَ إِلَيَّ كِتَابٌ كَرِيمٌ</span><br /><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهُ مِن سُلَيْمَانَ وَإِنَّهُ بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</span><br /><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَّا تَعْلُوا عَلَيَّ وَأْتُونِي مُسْلِمِينَ </span></h3>



<p><strong><span style="color:#008000;">She said: O chiefs, a noble letter has been delivered to me, it is from Sulaymaan, and it reads, “<em>In the Name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy</em>”. Do not be haughty, and refuse what I call you to, but rather come to me in submission”</span>. </strong>[27:29-31]</p>



<p>So it is befitting to begin with, <em>Bismi Allāhi Ar-Raĥmāni Ar-Raĥīm</em>, in every important affair and in every work which has importance and value, and in every letter.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">So therefore those people who do not begin their works and their letters with, <em>Bismi Allāhi Ar-Raĥmāni Ar-Raĥīm</em> , those people have <strong>left the Prophetic sunnah</strong> and <strong>left following the example of the Book of Allaah</strong> the Mighty and Majestic and perhaps because of that these books of theirs and these letters of theirs do not contain blessing and do not contain benefit, because they are deprived of, <em>Bismi Allāhi Ar-Raĥmāni Ar-Raĥīm</em>. So therefore, they are deprived of benefit.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Why did they abandon,&nbsp;Bismi Allāhi Ar-Raĥmāni Ar-Raĥīm? They abandoned it because it is a sunnah, and <strong>they flee away from the sunnah</strong>, or they <strong>blindly follow those people who flee away from the sunnah</strong>. So it is befitting that attention is given to the like of this.</p>



<p>So the meaning of, Bismi Allāhi Ar-Raĥmāni Ar-Raĥīm, is seeking aid through the Name of Allaah.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">So his saying, <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Bismi Allāh</span></strong> (With the Name of Allaah), this is a preposition, and a word which is governed by the preposition, connected to something which is left unmentioned, whose meaning is taken to be, “<strong>I seek aid through the Name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy</strong>”, or, “<strong>I begin with the Name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy</strong>”, seeking blessings by means of it and seeking the aid of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">So therefore it is a tremendous preface for speech and for books and for letters, so a person seeks the aid of Allaah in its beginning and seeks blessing by means of His Name, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>

<p><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F418273748&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/introu3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Introduction to the Explanation </strong>(Sharh-ul-Usool-ith-Thalaathah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allaah the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is for Allaah the Lord of the whole of creation and may Allaah extol and grant peace and security to our prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad and to his true followers and to his companions, all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to Proceed:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So before us is this treatise – the treatise “<strong>The Three Fundamental Principles</strong>” &#8211; and it is a tremendous treatise which is brief, supported by evidences from the Book of Allaah and the sunnah of his Messenger <em><u>s</u>allaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this small treatise is about a tremendous fundamental matter from the fundamentals of Islaam and it is <em>al-‘aqeedah</em> – creed and belief. And the scholars give importance to these brief works, authoring them and exerting themselves to shorten them and refine them, then they would encourage their students to memorize them so that they should remain fundamental assets for them and a store of provision for them which they can derive benefit from, and bring benefit to others by means of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And beginning with these shorter works is the foundation for the students of knowledge, so the student of knowledge should begin by learning little by little, taking from the initial points of knowledge and its fundamentals and then proceed in stages through it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these brief works are the path leading on to the longer works. So it is not possible for the longer works to be understood except after the brief works have been understood and then the person has proceeded on from them in stages. And therefore they said about the meaning of His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#333333;">وَلَٰكِن كُونُوا رَبَّانِيِّينَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تُعَلِّمُونَ الْكِتَابَ وَبِمَا كُنتُمْ تَدْرُسُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">But rather be <em>rabbaaniyyoon</em> (wise scholars who cultivate the people) by your teaching them the Book and your studying it</span> </strong>[3:79]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word <em>rabbaaniyoon</em> &#8211; they are those who begin with the small matters of knowledge before the greater ones. They cultivate themselves and their students beginning with the smaller matters and moving on to the larger matters, and this is something natural, because all things begin from their roots and their foundations and then they grow bigger and larger after that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the person who pounces upon knowledge from its top, then this person will just tire himself out and will not attain anything. Whereas the one who begins with the fundamentals and proceeds in stages, this is the person, who by the permission of Allaah will be proceeding in the correct way and with sound direction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#333333;">يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْأَهِلَّةِ ۖ قُلْ هِيَ مَوَاقِيتُ لِلنَّاسِ وَالْحَجِّ ۗ وَلَيْسَ الْبِرُّ بِأَن تَأْتُوا الْبُيُوتَ مِن ظُهُورِهَا وَلَٰكِنَّ الْبِرَّ مَنِ اتَّقَىٰ ۗ وَأْتُوا الْبُيُوتَ مِنْ أَبْوَابِهَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They ask you about the crescent moons. Say: they are signs to mark periods of time for mankind and for the <em>hajj</em>. And righteousness in not that you enter the houses from their backs, but rather righteousness is the quality of the person who has <em>taqwaa </em>(who fears and is dutiful to Allaah). And enter houses through their proper doors. </span></strong>[2:189]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those people asked a question about the crescent moons: why does the crescent moon begin as something small and then grow larger until it becomes full, then it grows smaller until it is again a crescent? So Allaah rebukes them, and directed them towards asking about that which will benefit them, and that they should come to the houses of knowledge from their correct doors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for asking about the crescent moon and it conditions and its smallness and its largeness, then this has no benefit in it for them, rather benefit is that they ask about what they are in need of and that is awareness of the benefits of the crescent moon, and therefore He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#333333;">قُلْ هِيَ مَوَاقِيتُ لِلنَّاسِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: they are signs to mark periods of time for mankind</strong> </span>[2:189]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He explained their benefits and that is that Allaah makes them signs marking periods of time for mankind by means of which they can become aware of acts of worship and dealings and time spans and other than that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He directed them to the benefits of the crescent moons and He did not respond to their question about the reality of the crescent moons, because there was no benefit for them in that, and so that He should direct them towards what is befitting for them to ask about and it is the doors to knowledge, not the back-doors of knowledge and the superfluous unnecessary matters which they have no need of. And if they do have some need of them, then it is only a slight need.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 79 : Point 135-136</strong><br />
<strong> Shaykh Ahmad Najmee | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>135</strong>]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong> If you hear a man attacking the narrations (<em>athaar</em>) or rejecting the narrations or desiring some thing other than the narrations then have doubt about his Islam. And do not doubt that he is the person of Desires and Innovator.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>136</strong>] <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that Ruler&#8217;s oppression does not reduce or remove anything that Allaah has made obligatory upon the tongue of his prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). His oppression will be upon himself and your acts of obedience along with him will be complete if Allaah,the Most High,wills. Meaning, the congregational prayer and the <em>jumu&#8217;ah</em> prayer along with them and fighting <em>jihaad</em> along with them. And all acts of obedience accompany them in that , for you will have your intention.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 84 : Point 150C</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Yūnus ibn &#8216;Ubayd saw his son come away from the company of a person of the innovated sects, so he said &#8220;<em>O my son! where have you just come from?&#8221;</em> He replied &#8220;<em>from being with Amr ibn Ubayd</em>&#8220;. He said &#8220;<em>O my son! that I should see you coming out from the house of a Khunsaa (hermaphrodite, bisexual) would be more beloved to me than that I should see you coming out from the house of so-and-so.That you should meet Allaah, O my son, as a fornicator , a major sinner, a thief and a treacherous person would be more beloved to me than that you meet Him with the saying of the people of the deviant sects.&#8221;</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Do you not see that the Yūnus ibn &#8216;Ubayd knew that the hermaphrodite would not misguide his son away from his religion whereas the innovator may lead him astray until he becomes a disbeliever.</strong></span></p>

<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>148</strong>] <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Know that whoever speaks against anyone from the companions of Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), then know that he seeks really to attack Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and he has caused harm towards him in his grave.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>149</strong>] <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>If some innovations become apparent to you from a person, then beware of him since what he conceals from you will be more than what he makes apparent.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 80 : Points 140</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The lawful is that which you would witness and swear to be lawful, likewise the prohibited (<em>haraam</em>). That which causes uneasiness in your heart is something doubtful </strong></span>[1].</p>
<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p>[1] An-Nu’maan ibn Basheer said: Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;What is lawful is clear and what is unlawful is clear, but between them are certain doubtful things which many people do not know. So he who guards against doubtful things keeps his religion and his honour blameless. But he who falls into doubtful things falls into that which is unlawful, just as a shepherd who grazes his cattle in the vicinity of a pasture declared prohibited (by the king); he is likely to stray into the pasture. Mind you, every king has a protected pasture and Allah&#8217;s involved limits is that which He has declared unlawful. Verily, there is a piece of flesh in the body, if it is healthy, the whole body is healthy, and if it is corrupt, the whole body is corrupt. Verily, it is the heart.&#8221;</span></p>

<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Do not say anything about any of the Mothers of the Believers [1] (<em>radi Allaahu anhunna</em>) except good</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p>[1] This is the term of respect used for all the wives of the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>). This is how they have been termed in Soorah al-Ahzaab, Aayah number 6.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">النَّبِيُّ أَوْلَىٰ بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ مِنْ أَنفُسِهِمْ</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Prophet is closer to the believers than their ownselves, and his wives are their (believers&#8217;) mothers (as regards respect and marriage).</span> (Qur&#8217;aan 33:6)</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 79 : Points 137</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">If you see a man making supplication against the ruler, then know that he is a person of desires. If you see a man a making supplication in favor of the ruler for him to be sound and righteous, the know that he is a person of the Sunnah, if Allah wills.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Fudayl ibn ‘Iyaad </span></strong>[1]<strong><span style="color:#993300;"> said, “If I had a supplication that was going to be answered, I would make it for the ruler.” It was said to him, “O Abu ‘Alee, explain this to us.” He said, “If I were to make it for myself, then it will not extend beyond me. But, if I made it for the ruler, then he will be corrected and, through that, the servants and the land will be set in order” </span></strong>[2].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">So we are commanded to make supplication for them (the rulers) to be sound and righteous. And we have not been commanded to make supplication against them, even if they commit tyranny and oppression, since their tyranny and oppression will be only upon themselves, but their rectitude will be good for themselves and for the Muslims.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Al-Fudayl ibn ‘Iyaad ibn Mas’ood, Shaikhul-Islam, Abu ‘Alee, alYarboo’ee, al-Khurasaanee. He was born in Samarqand and grew up to be a highway robber. However, his heart was moved upon hearing the Qur’an recited and he repented and then travelled in search of knowledge to Koofah, eventually settling in Makkah. Some of his students were Ibn al-Mubaarak, Yahyaa al-Qattaan, ‘Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Mahdee, ‘Abdur-Razzaaq, ash-Shaafi’ee and Qutaibah ibn Sa’eed. Ibn al-Mubaarak said, “No one better than Fudayl ibn ‘Iyaad remains upon the face of the earth.” Haaroon ar-Rasheed said, “I have not seen any scholar with greater dignity than Maalik, nor anyone more pious than al-Fudayl.” As-Siyaar (8/421-441) and Tadhkiratul-Huffaadh (1/245-246) of adh-Dhahabee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] This narration is reported by Abu Nu’aym in al-Hilyah (8/91) with a saheeh isnaad and by al-Khallaal in as-Sunnah (no.9).</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 78 : Points 134</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">If you see a man criticizing anyone from the Companions of  Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>), then know that he is a follower of desires and a person of evil speech because of the saying of Allaah&#8217;s  Messenger (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>), “When my Companions are mentioned then withhold”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) knew of any slips that they were going to make after his death, yet still he did not say about them except good. And his saying , “Leave my Companions and do not say about them anything except good”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Do not discuss anything from their slips or their wars, nor that which you do not have knowledge of. Do not listen to it  from anyone who speaks with it, for  your heart will not be secure if you listen to it.</span></strong></p>

<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Whichever woman gives herself away in marriage to a man, then she will not be permissible for him.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] The Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> “ There is no marriage without a guardian (walee).” </strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Abaas (<em>radiallaahu anhu</em>) said,</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] This is what the extreme innovators, amongst them the <em>Baatinees</em> and extreme <em>Soofees</em>, call to. They explain things away by claiming that they have an outer aspect and an inner aspect. They twist the Book of Allah and His <em>Sharee’ah</em> to suit their own desires. Their claim of receiving hidden religious knowledge, outside of the Book and the Sunnah, is disbelief.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 77 : Points 131</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The blameless one from the Muslims is the one from whom nothing suspicious becomes apparent.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F408965550&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“O you who believe, avoid much (types) of suspicion. Verily some (forms) of suspicion is a sin.”</strong></span> [Surah Al-Hujuraat: 12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Abu Hurairah (<em>radhi Allaahu anhu</em>) reported that Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>Beware of suspicion, for indeed suspicion is the most untruthful form of speech</strong>.” [<em>Saheeh</em> – Reported by Al-Bukhaaree (10/484 of al-Fath) and Muslim (2563)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ahaadeeth with this same understanding I have mentioned here are many. <strong>What the backbiting of the heart means, is: When the heart has firm conviction and holds bad thoughts about someone. But as for the notions that occasionally display in one’s mind or when one talks to himself, then as long as these thoughts do not remain established and continuous in him, it is excused according to the consensus of the scholars</strong>. This is since he has no choice in the matter as to stop it from occurring nor can he find any way to liberate himself from it when it does occur. This is the understanding of what has been authentically established (in the texts).</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 76 : Point 128</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Whoever abandons the <em>Jumu’ah</em> Prayer and the congregational prayers in the mosque, without a valid excuse, then he is an innovator </strong></span>[1]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>. The valid excuse is such as an illness, because of which he is unable to go out to the mosque, or fear of an oppressive ruler and whatever is besides that then there is no excuse for you.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Congregational payer in the mosque is an obligation upon the sane, adult males who are able to attend. This is the most correct saying of the scholars.</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A blind man came to the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) and said: “O Messenger of Allah! I have no one to guide me to the mosque.” He, therefore, sought his permission to perform <em>Salat</em> (prayer) in his house. He (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) granted him permission. When the man turned away, he called him back, and said, “Do you hear the <em>Adhan</em> (call to prayer)?” He replied in the affirmative. The Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) then directed him to respond to it.</span></p>
<p>[Muslim]. <a title="[Riyad-us-Saliheen] The Excellence of Performing Salat (Prayers) in Congregation" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/04/riyad-us-saliheen-imaam-nawawi-chapter-191/">[The Excellence of Performing Salat (Prayers) in Congregation</a> – Riyadh ul saaliheen]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas’ood (<em>radiAllaahu anhu</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Whoever would be happy to meet Allaah tomorrow as a Muslim, then let him preserve (in establishing) these five prayers from the place where they are called from (i.e. masjids), for verily, Allaah has legislated for your Prophet the ways of guidance. And indeed these (five prayers in the masjid) are from the ways of guidance. And if you were to pray in your homes as this man who refrains (to pray in the masjid) prays in his home, then you would have abandoned the Sunnah of your Prophet. And if you were to abandon the Sunnah of your Prophet (s<em>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>) you would go astray. There is not a man that performs the ablution and does it well, then sets out to go to one of these masjids except that Allaah records a good deed for him for every step he takes and raises him up one level and erases one evil deed due to it. You have certainly seen us, and no one would refrain from the prayer (in the masjid) except the hypocrite whose hypocrisy was well known. And indeed a man would be brought supported by two men until he was made to stand in the row (for prayer).”</span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 76 : Point 127</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The greeting of salaam is to be given to all of Allah’s worshippers.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F408009939&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/greetings-of-salaam-are-to-be-given-to-all-of-allahs-worshippers" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“When Allah created Adam (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>), He said to him: `Go and greet that company of angels who are sitting there – and then listen to what they are going to say in reply to your greetings because that will be your greeting and your off-spring’s.’ Adam (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to the angels: `<em>As-Salamu `Alaikum</em> (may you be safe from evil).’ They replied:<em> `As-Salamu `Alaikum wa Rahmatullah</em> (may you be safe from evil, and Mercy of Allah be upon you).’ Thus adding in reply to him: `<em>wa Rahmatullah</em> (and Mercy of Allah)’ to his greeting.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p>Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Enter not houses other than your own, until you have asked permission and greeted those in them.</span>” (24:27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">But when you enter the houses, greet one another with a greeting from Allah (i.e., say: As-Salamu `alaikum – peace be on you), blessed and good</span>.” (24:61)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">When you are greeted with a greeting, greet in return with what is better than it, or (at least) return it equally</span>.” (4:86)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">Has the story reached you, of the honoured guests [three angels; Jibril (Gabriel) along with another two] of Ibrahim (Abraham)? When they came in to him, and said, `Salam (peace be upon you)!’ He answered: `Salam (peace be upon you).</span>”’ (51:24,25)</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 75 : Point 126</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Commanding the good and forbidding the evil is obligatory</strong></span><span style="color:#993300;"><b style="color:#993300;">, except with </b><span style="color:#993300;"><b>regard</b></span><b style="color:#993300;"> to one whose use of  the sword or the rod, you fear.</b></span></p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever amongst you sees an evil, he must change it with his hand; if he is  unable to do so, then with his tongue; and if he is unable to do so, then with his heart; and that is the weakest form of Faith”.</strong></span> [Muslim].</p>
<p>Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Let there arise out of you a group of people inviting to all that is good (Islam), enjoining <em>Al-Ma`ruf</em> (i.e., Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do) and forbidding <em>Al-Munkar</em> (polytheism and disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden). And it is they who are the successful.”</span> (3:104)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“You (true believers in Islamic Monotheism, and real followers of Prophet Muhammad (s<em>allallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) and his Sunnah) are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind; you enjoin <em>Al-Ma`ruf</em> (i.e., Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam has ordained) and forbid<em> Al-Munkar</em> (polytheism, disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden)”.</span> (3:110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“The believers, men and women, are Auliya’ (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) <em>Al-Ma`ruf</em> (i.e., Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do), and forbid (people) from <em>Al-Munkar</em> (i.e., polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden)”.</span> (9:71)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The hypocrites, men and women, are from one another, they enjoin (on the people) <em>Al-Munkar</em> (i.e. disbelief and polytheism of all kinds and all that Islam has forbidden), and forbid (people) from <em>Al-Ma&#8217;ruf</em> (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do), and they close their hands [from giving (spending in Allah&#8217;s Cause) alms, etc.]. They have forgotten Allah, so He has forgotten them. Verily, the hypocrites are the <em>Fasiqun</em> (rebellious, disobedient to Allah).</span> (9:67)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O my son! <em>Aqim-is-Salat</em> (perform <em>As-Salat</em>), enjoin (people) for <em>Al-Ma&#8217;ruf</em> (Islamic Monotheism and all that is good), and forbid (people) from <em>Al-Munkar</em> (i.e. disbelief in the Oneness of Allah, polytheism of all kinds and all that is evil and bad), and bear with patience whatever befall you. Verily! These are some of the important commandments ordered by Allah with no exemption.</span> (Surah Luqman 31:17)</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 73 : Point 122</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Know, May Allah have mercy upon you! that the wealth of a Muslim is not permissible to take except for that which he gives willingly </strong>[1]<strong>. If a man has some wealth that was illegally acquired, then he is responsible for it. It is not permissible for anyone to take any thing from him, except with his permission. So perhaps he will repent and wish to restore it to its rightful owner, and you will have taken something unlawful.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] The Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The wealth of a Muslim is not permissible except what he gives willingly.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Ahmad and declared <em>saheeh</em> by Shaikh al-Albaanee (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) in <em>Saheehul-Jaami’</em> (no.7539) and <em>al-Irwaa’</em> (no.1459).</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 72 : Point 121</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>To withhold regarding the fighting between ‘Ali and Mu’aawiyah, ‘Aaishah, Talhah and az-Zubayr. May Allah have mercy upon them all and upon those who are with them. Do not dispute concerning them, and consign their affair to Allah, the Exalted and Most High, for Allah&#8217;s Messenger  (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said, “Beware of speaking about my Companions and my in-laws” </strong></span>[1]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong> and his saying, “Allah, the Exalted and the Most High, looked upon the people who fought at Badr and said: Do whatever you wish, for I have forgiven you” </strong></span>[2].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] The hadeeth with this wording is not authentic. However, what is authentic is the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed (<em>radiallaahu anhu</em>), who reports that the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Do not abuse my Companions for, if any of you were to spend gold equal to Uhud in charity, it would not equal a handful of one of them or even half of that</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by al-Bukhaaree (Eng. trans 5/17/no.22) and Muslim (Eng. trans. 4/1349/no.6168).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Reported by al-Bukhaaree (Eng. trans. 5/212-214/no.318) and Muslim (Eng. trans. 4/1331/no.6087).</p>

<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Beware of looking into rhetorical theology (<em>kalaam</em>) and sitting with the people of rhetorical theology (<em>kalaam)</em> </strong></span>[1].</p>
<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] It is reported that Imaam ash-Shaafi’ee (<em>rahimahullah</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“My ruling regarding the people of theological rhetoric is that they should be beaten with palm branches and shoes and led around the markets an it (should) be said: This is the punishment of those who have abandoned the Book and the Sunnah and taken to theological rhetoric.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by al-Baghaawee in<em> Sharh as-Sunnah</em> (1/218).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“A person of theological rhetoric will never succeed. The scholars of theological </strong><strong>rhetoric are wicked heretics.”</strong></span></p>
