										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam ash-Shanqiti [1] , Adwaa&#8217;ul-Bayaan (10/21-23)<br />
Al-Istiqaamah Magazine , Issue No.8 &#8211; Shawwal 1418H / February 1998</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And do not say about those who are killed fighting in the Path of Allaah that they are dead. Rather, they are alive!&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:154].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse is an apparent proof that the martyrs [those who are killed in the Path of Allaah] are not dead. Yet in another verse Allaah says, whilst addressing the Prophet Muhammad sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam; who is better than any and every martyr :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed you will die, and they will die.&#8221;</b> [Soorah az-Zumar 39:30].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reply to this [apparent contradiction] is: That the martyrs are dead from a worldly point of view, this is why they can be inherited from, and why their wives can remarry again &#8211; a point about which the Scholars have ijmaa&#8217; (consensus) upon. It is this death, the worldly death, that Allaah informed would occur to the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam. This is why Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq radiallaahu &#8216;anhu said, when the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam passed away: &#8220;May my mother and father be sacrificed for you O Prophet of Allaah! By Allaah! Allaah will never combine two deaths for you. You have died the death that Allaah decreed for you &#8230; Whosoever worships Muhammad, let him know that Muhammad is dead.&#8221; Then he deduced this by reciting the [above] verse, and the Companions of the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam accepted this.2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the life that Allaah affirmed in the Qur&#8217;aan for the martyrs, and the life that has been affirmed for the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam in which he is able to return the greetings of salaam to whosoever sends it upon him, then both of them refer to the life of the barzakh (a state of existence between the present life and the Hereafter); an existence which cannot be truly comprehended by the people of this world. So with regards to the martyrs there is a reference to this in Allaah &#8211; the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;Rather, they are alive, but you do not perceive it.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:154]. The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam explained this verse by saying: <i>&#8220;Their souls ore in the bellies of green birds, which hove lanterns suspended for them from Allaah&#8217;s Throne. They roam around in Paradise wherever they desire, then return to these lanterns &#8230;&#8221;</i>3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for [the life affirmed for] the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, then he said: &#8220;There is no one who sends the greetings of salaam upon me, except that Allaah returns my soul hock until I reply to their greeting.&#8221;4 And: &#8220;Indeed Allaah&#8217;s Angels roam around the earth conveying to me the greetings of salaams from my Ummah.&#8221;5 So this life also cannot truly be comprehended by the intellects of the people of this world. Since, along with this [fact], his sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s blessed soul resides in the loftiest part of Paradise with the companionship of the highest company; a company higher than the souls of the martyrs. Yet the reality of how his pure soul links itself to his noble body &#8216;alayhis-salaam &#8211; a body which the earth cannot consume &#8211; is a reality which no one knows, except Allaah alone. Thus, if this type of life was like the life that is understood by the people of this world, then why did Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq radiallaahu &#8216;anhu say that the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam was dead, and why was it permitted to bury him? [And if he sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam did not die] then why was there a need to appoint a khaleefah (succesor) after him. Also, those events; such as the [tragic] killing of &#8216;Uthmaan radiollaahu &#8216;anhu, or the differences which arose between the Companions, or that which occurred with &#8216;Aaishah radiallaahu &#8216;anhaa need not have happened if he sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam were still alive! Since if that were the case, they could have referred judgement back to him concerning those issues in which they differed [if he sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam were still alive and could fulfill such needs].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, just as the Qur&#8217;aan is explicitly clear that the martyrs are actually living; due to Allaah &#8211; the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;Rather, they are alive.&#8221;</b> Then likewise, the Qur&#8217;aan is just as explicitly clear that this state of living is one whose reality cannot be truly understood by the people of this world; due to Allaah&#8217;s saying: <b>&#8220;But you do not perceive it.&#8221;</b> Similarly, just as it is established that the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam is living in the grave; replying to the greetings of salaam, yet even though his Companions actually buried him, they were still unable to perceive this state of living. Thus, we know that this state of living is likewise a reality which cannot be truly understood by the people of this world. However, what could make this more clear is by considering the example of someone who is</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">asleep. The state of one who is asleep differs from that of one who is awake in many ways, including the fact that the one who sleeps experiences dreams which can be understood. And Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim (d.751H)- rahimahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;It is known by necessity that the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s body is intact and has not decayed. The Companions asked him: How are we to send greetings of salaam upon you when your body has decayed! So he sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi we sallam replied: <i>&#8220;Indeed Allaah has prohibited the earth from consuming the bodies of the Prophets.&#8221; </i>So if his body was not in his grave, then why would he respond to this question! And it has been authentically established from him that he said: <i>&#8220;Indeed Allaah&#8217;s Angels roam around the earth conveying to me the greetings of salaams from my Ummah.&#8221;</i>7 It is authentic from him that he once came with Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar [into the mosque] and said: &#8220;We shall be raised up like this on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;8 It is also established that he sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam saw the Prophet Moosaa praying in his grave on the night of his Israa (Heavenly Ascension), and he also saw him [on that same night] in the sixth or seventh Heaven.9 So the soul is in one place and is connected to the body, which resides in the grave. Similarly, the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam is in his grave; replying to the greetings of salaam sent to him, along with the fact that his soul resides in the loftiest part of Paradise along with the highest companionship. So there is no contradiction between these two matters; since the affairs of the souls is one thing, whilst that of the bodies is another.&#8221;10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in these words is a proof that the life of the barzakh, that was previously mentioned, is a life whose reality is not known to the people of this world. About this Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Rather, they are alive, but you do not perceive it.&#8221;</b> And complete and perfect knowledge is only with Allaah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed Allaah will help those who help Him. Indeed Allaah is Exalted in Might, All-Powerful.&#8221; [Soorah Hajj 22:40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shanqeetee (d.1393H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; explains in this noble <i>Aayah</i> that He has sworn to help and give victory to those who help Him. It is known that the help and victory of Allaah comes by following what He has prescribed, obeying His commend, avoiding His prohibitions, by helping His Messengers and their followers, aiding His Religion and fighting against His enemies and overpowering them &#8211; until the word of Allaah is made uppermost, whilst the word of His enemies is debased and mode low. Then Allaah &#8211; the Most High, the Most Magnificent &#8211; explains the charecteristics of those whom He has promised would receive His help and victory, distinguishing them from others. So He said &#8211; explaining those to whom He swore He would aid and give victory to &#8211; because He is the one to aid and give victory:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Those who, if We establish them in the earth, establish the prayer, give the Zakaat, enjoin the good and forbid the evil.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Hajj 22:41].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that which this noble <i>aayah</i> indicates is that whosoever aids Allaah, then Allaah will aid Him. This is clearly explained in other than this place, such as His &#8211; the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; sayings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;O you who Believe. If you help Allaah, Allaah will help you; and establish your feet firmly. But those who disbelieve, for them is destruction and Allaah will make their deeds vain.&#8221; </b>[Soorah Muhammad 47:7].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed, Our Word has gone forth of old for our slaves, the Messengers, that they will certainly be victorious; and that Our forces will certainly be triumphant.&#8221;</b> [Soorah as-Saafaat 37:171-173].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allaah has Decreed: It is My Messenger and I who will prevail.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Mujaadalah 58:21].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allaah has promised to those amongst you who believe and do righteous actions that He will grant you the khilaafah in the land.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Noor 24:55].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in His &#8211; the Most High &#8216;s &#8211; saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Those who, if We establish them in the earth, establish the prayer, give the Zakaat, enjoin the good and forbid the evil.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Hajj 22:41].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In it is a proof that there is no promise from Allaah of His help, except by establishing the Prayer, paying the Zakaah, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil. So it is these whom Allaah will establish upon the earth and will strengthen His Word through them. However, those who do not establish the salaah, nor pay the Zakaah, nor enjoin the good nor forbid the evil, then there is no promise for them from Allaah that He will aid and grant them victory. They are not from His party, nor are they his friends -those who have the promise of His help and victory. Rather, they are the party of Shaytaan and his friends. So if they were to expect the help of Allaah and the fulfillment of His promise upon them, then their example is like that of a hired worker who refuses to do the labour that he was hired for, yet he expects to be rewarded. So whosoever is like this, then he has no intellect!&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the help that we so desperately await, and the victory that we so strongly desire will only come about by: &#8220;The Muslims returning and repenting to their Lord, correcting their &#8216;aqeedoh (beliefs) and cultivating themselves and their families upon the pure and correct Islaam; putting into effect Allaah &#8211; the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Never will Allaah change the condition of a people, until they change themselves.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ar-Ra&#8217;d 13:11].&#8221;2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Adwaa&#8217; ul-Bayaan (5/703-704) of &#8216;Allaamah ash-Shanqeetee.<br />
