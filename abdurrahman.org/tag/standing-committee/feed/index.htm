<p style="text-align:center;">Fatwa No. 8377</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: I would like to raise an issue that caused a dispute between some people. It is the writing of the word &#8220;Allah&#8221; and the word &#8220;Muhammad&#8221; in an interlacing shape on top of the door of one of the Masjids (mosques) in Adlab. Some of them said that it is not permissible to write these names in such a shape. The proof they mentioned to support their viewpoint was that in this way, Muhammad&#8217;s status (peace be upon him), would be the same as Allah&#8217;s which is not reasonable. Others said that writing them in such a way is permissible as Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) places His name beside the name of His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him). I would like you to guide me to what is right. Thank you very much.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ans. by Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217;, KSA:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shari&#8217;ah (Islamic law) texts join between testifying that no one is worthy of worship except Allah and testifying that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah in certain places, such as in Adhan (call to Prayer), Iqamah (call to start the Prayer), in the Hadith: Islam is based on five pillars: (Testifying that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah&#8230;) and other places. These texts point out what Mukallafun (legally competent persons) should believe in with regard to Allah and the Messenger, such as saying that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>But mixing the two words in writing was not mentioned in the Book of Allah or the Sunnah </strong>(whatever is reported from the Prophet, peace be upon him).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Moreover, mixing both words in writing contains great danger as this is similar to the false creed of the Christians with regard to the trinity. They believe that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit are one God.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It also contains an element of the false creed of pantheism, and leads to elevating the Prophet </strong>(peace be upon him)<strong> and worshipping him along with Allah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is prohibited to write the Name of Allah and the name of His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) by mixing the letters of the two words together.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, it is also <strong>prohibited to write the words (Allah &#8211; Muhammad) next to each other</strong> on the top of the door of the Masjids or any other place because doing so may contain some delusion and misguidance with regard to the prohibitions mentioned above.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Maniy</strong> (sperm/vaginal secretions that are released on <strong>orgasm)</strong><br />
<strong>Wady</strong> (a thick white secretion discharged after urination)<br />
<strong>Madhy</strong> (thin white viscid fluid secreted due to erotic thoughts or desire)</p>
<p>The fifth question of Fatwa no. 8540</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q:</strong></span> <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What are the Wady and Madhy discharges? How can a person purify himself from them? Do they occur during sleep? </strong></span></p>
<p>A: All praise be to Allah Alone, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger, and his family and Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Wady</em> is mostly discharged after urination. It is a white thick fluid that resembles the <em>Maniy</em> (spermatic fluid) in thickness, but differs from it in turbidity, and it is odorless.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Madhy</em> is a white, tenuous, viscous fluid that is discharged when engaging in foreplay, thinking of or desiring intercourse, or because of a look and the like, at the abatement of desire. A person may not feel the discharge come out, but it is discharged at the onset of sexual desire. It is experienced by both men and women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Both fluids (<em>Madhy</em> and <em>Wady</em>) are <em>Najis</em> (impure) and invalidate <em>Wudu</em>’ (ablution). Therefore, when such secretions are discharged, the soiled parts (of body and clothes) must be purified with water and the person must perform <em>Wudu</em>’. Discharge of <em>Madhy</em> also necessitates washing the whole penis and testicles with water.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<p>The second question of Fatwa no. 4262</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q:</strong></span> <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What is the difference between <em>Maniy</em> and <em>Madhy</em>? Which of them necessitates taking <em>Ghusl</em> (ritual bath)?  </strong></span></p>
<p>A: All praise be to Allah Alone, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger, and his family and Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>, the difference between <em>Maniy</em> (sperm/vaginal secretions) and <em>Madhy</em> (thin white viscid fluid secreted when having sexual thoughts or desire) is that <em>Maniy</em> in the case of men is a thick white fluid, and in the case of women it is thin and yellow. <em>Madhy</em>, on the other hand, is a thin, white, sticky fluid that is emitted when engaging in foreplay, thinking of or desiring intercourse, or because of a look and the like. <em>Madhy</em> is emitted by men and women alike.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>, <em>Maniy</em> necessitates <em>Ghusl</em>, while <em>Madhy</em> necessitates washing the penis and testicles, performing <em>Wudu</em>’ (ablution) like that performed for <em>Salah</em> (prayer), in addition to washing it off from the body and clothes.</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fatwa no. 18084</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 1: Toothpaste contains some sugar ingredients which a person tastes while using it, keeping in mind that the normal taste of food takes place by the dissolution of the food within the saliva, and then its penetration to the taste receptors. Accordingly, if the tasted matter dissolves within the saliva then, most probably, no one can avoid swallowing it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">A- Is it permissible for a fasting person to use toothpaste, keeping in mind that they can use the toothbrush only?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">B- What is the ruling on using mouthwash?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">C- It was reported through a good chain of transmission from Ibn ‘Abbas (Al-Irwaa&#8217;, p. 937) that he (may Allah be pleased with him) did not see any harm in tasting honey, butter, and similar foods and then spitting it out while one is observing Sawm (Fast). This view was also reported from some Salaf (righteous predecessors). Thus, after knowing the way in which food is tasted, what is the ruling on tasting food by a fasting person</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: There is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>no harm in using toothpaste during Sawm; however, one should spit out</strong> </span>what has been dissolved of the toothpaste in the mouth; and if something from it goes unintentionally into the throat, it will not affect Sawm.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By the same token, there is no harm in using <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>mouthwash</strong> </span>which contains medication provided that one spits it out, and nothing from it goes intentionally into the throat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same ruling applies to <strong><span style="color:#000000;">tasting food</span></strong>; there is no harm in doing it as long as one spits it out without swallowing anything of it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa no. 21436</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Praise be to Allah Alone and peace and blessings be upon the Last Prophet. To continue,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217; had read the letter received by his Eminence, the Grand Mufty (Islamic scholar qualified to issue legal opinions) from a number of inquirers whose names are registered at the Secretariat General of the Council of Senior Scholars nos.(5411) ,(1026), (1016),(1395), (1650), (1893), (2106) dated 7/11/1420, 7/2/1421, 7/2/1421, 3/8/1421, 17/3/1421, 25/3/1421, 7/4/1421 A.H., successively.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The inquirers asked many questions to the following effect: Lately, the idea of <em><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/al-murjiah/"><strong>Irja</strong></a></em>&#8216; (a deviant conviction claiming that Faith is restricted to belief not deeds) has dreadfully spread. Many writers have been propagating it, depending on some incomplete quotations from the Shaykh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah&#8217;s writings, something which leads many people to confusion with respect to the definition of <em>Iman</em> (faith). They try to exclude the element of deeds from the definition of <em>Iman</em>. They claim that anyone who abandons all deeds will still be saved (from Hellfire). This definitely facilitates the committing of sins, acts of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and <em>Riddah</em> (apostasy) for people attain <em>Iman</em> in light of this conviction, even if they do not abide by religious obligations, avoid prohibitions, or act in accordance with Shari`ah (Islamic law). There is no doubt that this conviction has a severe effect on Islamic societies, issues of `<em>Aqidah</em> (creed) and worship. Therefore, I hope Your Eminence will reveal the reality of this conviction and its bad effects, and the truth that is based on the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet). I hope you will also verify the writings reported from Shaykh-ul-Islam so that all Muslims can be sure about and have knowledge of their religion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: After the Committee studied the inquiry, it answered as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The mentioned sayings are attributed to <strong><em>Al-Murji&#8217;ah</em></strong> (a deviant Islamic sect claiming that Faith is restricted to belief not deeds) who exclude deeds from the definition of <em>Iman</em>. They claim that <em>Iman</em> is achieved by belief with the heart and utterance with the tongue, whereas the deeds, according to their view, are a condition for attaining perfection but are not considered a prerequisite for it. Thus, according to their conviction, anyone who believes with their heart and utters with their tongue will be a perfect <em>Mu&#8217;min</em> (believer), even if they abandon obligations and violate prohibitions, they will also be entitled to enter <em>Jannah</em> (Paradise) without observing any good deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>This has led to many null ideas, including the restriction of <em>Kufr</em> (disbelief) to denial of faith and <em>Al-Istihlal</em> (deeming what is <em>Haram</em> (prohibited) to be lawful) by heart. In fact, all these sayings are false, deviant and contradict the Qur&#8217;an, Sunnah and the way of <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah</em> (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream); the predecessors and successors.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>However this opens the door to the people of evil and mischief to deviate away from their religion and be free from Allah&#8217;s (Glorified be He) commands, prohibitions, fear and reverence.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>This also deactivates the concept of Jihad (struggling in the cause of Allah), enjoining good and forbidding evil.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Furthermore, this also equates between good and bad, obedient and disobedient people, a person who abides by Allah&#8217;s Shari`ah and the <em>Fasiq</em> (someone flagrantly violating Islamic law) who abandons His Commands and Prohibitions since deeds do not violate <em>Iman</em> as they claim.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Imams of Islam concentrated on clarifying the falseness of this conviction and replying to its supporters in the past and the present. They also allocated a chapter for this issue in the books of `<em>Aqidah</em> and compiled complete books in this regard, such as the Shaykh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful to him) and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful to him) mentioned in <em>Al-`Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Among the fundamentals of <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah w-Al-Jama`ah</em> is that Din (religion of Islam) and <em>Iman</em> are attained by words and actions and that <em>Iman</em> increases by acts of obedience and decreases by acts of disobedience.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also mentioned in his book Al-Iman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;In this chapter, we find several sayings of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) and the Senior Scholars of Sunnah in explaining <em>Iman</em>. Sometimes they say: It is utterance and action and some others say: utterance, action and intention. Others say: <em>Iman</em> is utterance with the tongue, belief with the heart, and acts with organs. All these definitions are true.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, he (may Allah be merciful to him) added:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The Salaf strictly censured <em>Al-Murji&#8217;ah</em> for excluding actions from <em>Iman</em>. However, their claim that all people have the same degree of <em>Iman</em> is absolutely fraudulent. Belief, love, fear of Allah, knowledge, etc., of people vary from one person to another.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He added:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Regarding this basic origin, <em>Al-Murji&#8217;ah</em> deviated from what was clarified in the Qur&#8217;an, Sunnah, opinions of the <em>Sahabah</em> (Companions of the Prophet) and the <em>Tabi`un</em> (Followers, the generation after the Companions of the Prophet), rather they founded their opinion on their own understanding and linguistic interpretation [of texts]; this is certainly the manner of people of <em>Bid`ahs</em> (innovations in religion).&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among the proofs that indicate that deeds are included in Iman and that they affect it positively or negatively is Allah&#8217;s saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The believers are only those who, when Allâh is mentioned, feel a fear in their hearts and when His Verses (this Qur’ân) are recited unto them, they (i.e. the Verses) increase their Faith; and they put their trust in their Lord (Alone); Who perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât) and spend out of that We have provided them. It is they who are the believers in truth</span>. (Qur&#8217;an &#8211; Surah Al-Anfaal  Verses: 2-4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Successful indeed are the believers. Those who offer their <em>Salât</em> (prayers) with all solemnity and full submissiveness. And those who turn away from <em>Al-Laghw</em> (dirty, false, evil vain talk, falsehood, and all that Allâh has forbidden). And those who pay the <em>Zakât</em>. And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts) Except from their wives or (the slaves) that their right hands possess, &#8211; for then, they are free from blame; But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors; Those who are faithfully true to their <em>Amanât</em> (all the duties which Allâh has ordained, honesty, moral responsibility and trusts) and to their covenants; And those who strictly guard their (five compulsory congregational) <em>Salawât</em> (prayers) (at their fixed stated hours). </span>(Qur&#8217;an &#8211; Surah Al-Muminoon  Verses: 1-9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, the Messenger (peace be upon him) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>Iman</em> (Faith) has over seventy branches, the most superior of which is the declaration that there is no deity except Allah, and the lowest of which is the removal of (anything) harmful from the street, and modesty is a branch of Iman.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh-ul-Islam (may Allah be merciful to him) also mentioned inhis book Al-Iman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;The origin of Iman is in the heart, including utterance and action. It is recognition of belief, love and submissiveness. Whatever rests in the heart should be manifest in action. If a person does not act in accordance to it, this indicates absence or weakness of Iman. This is why the visible deeds are a reflection of the <em>Iman</em> of heart and a confirmation to what exists in it. They constitute evidence of it and they are a branch and part of full <em>Iman</em>.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Thinking of what<em> Al-Khawarij</em> and <em>Al-Murji&#8217;ah</em> say with respect to the meaning of <em>Iman</em> reveals that this includes disobedience of the Messenger. Obeying Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger (peace be upon him) denotes the perfection of <em>Iman</em>, and that Allah (Exalted be He) would never render a sinner to be a <em>Kafir</em>. <strong>Suppose</strong> that some people went to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and told him: &#8216;We believe in what you have brought us by our hearts and bear witness (that there is no deity except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah) with our tongues, but we do not abide by your commands and prohibitions; as we do not offer prayers, fast, perform Hajj or believe what is told to us; we do not return trusts, fulfill our promises, maintain the ties of kinship or observe any good acts which you ordained us; we drink intoxicants and commit incest and adultery; we kill as many people as we can of your Companions and Ummah (nation) and take their money; we may even kill you too and fight with your enemies against you.&#8217; Can any rational person imagine that the Prophet (peace be upon him) would answer them by saying: &#8216;You are the perfect <em>Mu&#8217;minun</em> (believers) and you are the ones entitled to my intercession on the Day of Resurrection, and it is expected that none of you would enter Hellfire?&#8217; On the contrary, every Muslim indisputably knows that the Prophet (peace be upon him) would have told them: &#8216;You are the most disbelieving people ever to what I came with&#8217; and that he would have executed them if they had not repented.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;When the word of <em>Iman</em> is generally mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah, it is meant with dutifulness, piety, and religion as previously mentioned, for the Prophet (peace be upon him) declared that <em>Iman</em> has over than seventy branches, the best of which is to witness that there is no Deity but Allah, and the least is to remove harm from the road. Therefore, whatever pleases Allah falls under the meaning of <em>Iman</em>. All this is also included in the meaning of dutifulness when generally mentioned, and so are the <em>Taqwa</em> (fear/wariness of offending Allah) and the <em>Din</em> (religion of Islam). It was also narrated that when people asked about Iman, Allah revealed the following Ayah: <span style="color:#008000;">It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness, and each and every act of obedience to Allâh, etc.) that you turn your faces</span> .What is meant here is that <em>Iman</em>, which is accompanied by action, is praised, other than that which is devoid of it.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said about Iman; anyone who reports other than this on his authority will be inventing lies against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">Whereas what was mentioned in the Hadith concerning the entrance of some people into <em>Jannah</em> despite that they had never done any good is not absolute to anyone who abandons deeds while being capable of doing them. Rather it is restricted to those who have excuses for abandoning deeds or for any other reason that is consistent with the objectives of Shari`ah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After clarifying this issue, the Permanent Committee warns against arguing over the fundamentals of `<em>Aqidah</em>, because of the serious consequences resulting from this. It recommends resorting to the books of the Righteous Salaf and leading Muslim scholars which are based on the Qur&#8217;an, Sunnah and accounts of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also warns against referring to any books that carry views opposing the original references, or modern books that are issued by authors who have not acquired knowledge through scholars or from original sources. Those people are intruders to this one great fundamental of `<em>Aqidah</em>. They adopt the views of <em>Al-Murji&#8217;ah</em> and falsely attribute them to <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah W-al-Jama`ah</em>, causing confusion to people. They also wrongly ascribe these views to the Shaykh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful to him) and other Imams of the Salaf through incomplete quotations. We advise them to fear Allah and to return to the Right Path, and not break the unity (of Muslims) by promoting this deviant belief. The Committee also warns Muslims against being tempted and falling into the trap of those opposing <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah W-al-Jama`ah</em>. May Allah guide everyone to useful knowledge, righteous deeds and good understanding of the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Leaving the Masjid after the Adhan is announced</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second question of Fatwa no. 5133</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the ruling on leaving the Masjid (mosque) after the Adhan (call to Prayer)? Moreover, does the same ruling apply to a person who may be in a room, not used for Salah, within the precincts of the Masjid but when leaving, he passes through the courtyard of the Masjid?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is not permissible to leave the Masjid after hearing the Adhan except to perform Wudu&#8217;, answering the call of nature, or any other necessity. It is reported that Abu Hurayrah  saw a person leaving the Masjid after the Adhan. Upon this he remarked,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>&#8220;This (man) disobeyed Abu Al-Qasim (peace be upon him).&#8221;</strong> </span>Related by Muslim in his Sahih. The same ruling applies for a person who is in a room inside the precincts of the Masjid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[Q] What is the ruling regarding leaving the Masjid after the Adhan has been called?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A] Abu Hurayrah saw a man leave (the Masjid) after the Adhan (had been called) and said (about him):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">As for this (one), then he has gone against (the teachings of) Abul-Qasim (Muhammad, peace be upon him</span>)</strong></span>.(Sahih Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And to go against (the teachings) principally is prohibited. Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed in a plain error.</strong></span> (Quran, 33:36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, because of this, the people having Islamic knowledge have said: <span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Indeed it is not permissible for a person to leave the Masjid after the Adhan (has been called) except for an (Islamically justifiable) reason, such as leaving to make Wudhu or if he wanted to go to answer the call of nature, then he is permitted to leave, even if he misses the prayer</strong></span> as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">There is no prayer if food has been served or for him who needs to answer the call of nature</span></strong>. (Sahih Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if we say that someone is waiting for the prayer and then felt the need to go and answer the call of nature or even to pass wind, since some people (may be in) need of passing wind, then there is no harm if he left and relieved himself (and) then returned. And if he was able to (catch and) join the congregation, then it is a blessing, and if he was unable to do so, then there is no harm in this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth question of Fatwa no. 16874</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q4: <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Is raising the hands upward when supplicating to Allah after the end of Adhan (call to Prayer) an act of Bid`ah (innovation in religion)?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: After repeating Adhan and invoking Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings upon Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), it is recommended to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>O Allah! Lord of this perfect call and of the regular prayer which is going to be established, bestow upon Muhammad Al-Wasilah (the highest position in Paradise) and Al-Fadilah (extra degree of honor) and raise him to Al Maqam Al Mahmud (the best and the highest place in Paradise), which You have promised him</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This statement is authentically reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) on the authority of Jabir ibn `Abdullah Al-Ansary (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) in Sahih Al-Bukhari (may Allah be merciful to him). <strong>However, raising the hands has no mention in the report, so it is an act of Bid`ah.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>171- What is the ruling on raising one&#8217;s hands in Du`a&#8217; after Iqamah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: I have noticed that some Muslims, who are about to perform Salah (Prayer), raise their hands and supplicate immediately after the Mu&#8217;adhin (caller to Prayer) finishes the announcement of the Adhan (call to Prayer). This takes place before Takbirat-ul-Ihram (saying: &#8220;Allahu Akbar [Allah is the Greatest]&#8221; upon starting Prayer. Is this practice reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This action has no basis in Shari`ah (Islamic law). Nothing has been reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to supplicate between Iqamah (call to start the Prayer) and the start of Prayer. <strong>He was never reported as having raised his hands at this time</strong>. This should not be done because it is contrary to the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa no. 1304</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: The questioner would like to be given a general idea about the Qadiriyyah Tariqah (Sufi order). He read one of the Qadiriyyah books: <em>&#8220;Al-Fiyudat Al-Rabbaniyyah fi Al-Ma&#8217;athir wa Al-Awrad Al-Qadiriyyah&#8221;</em>, and saw a poem including some of the claims and feats performed by the shaykh of this Tariqah. He asks if what is said in this poem is true or untrue. The questioner sent the poem along with his question to ask for a general Fatwa (legal opinion issued by a qualified Muslim scholar) on it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The poem that was sent by the questioner shows that the one who wrote it was ignorant, as the things that he ascribes to himself are Kufr (disbelief) and misguidance. He claims that all the scholars&#8217; knowledge has been derived from his knowledge and is part of him. He also claims that the Servants&#8217; behavior is according to what he legislates for them and that he would be able to close the Fire due to his greatness, except for a prior pledge taken from the Prophet. He says he can help those of his Murid (students) who are loyal to him and save them from ordeals, protect them in this world and in the Hereafter, secure them from fear, and be with them at the Mizan (the Scales for weighing deeds) on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are false claims, and could only be said by someone who is ignorant and does not know his own ability. Comprehensive knowledge is possessed by Allah Alone, as are the matters related to the Hereafter, and He Alone has control over them; not an angel, a prophet, or a pious person. Allah commanded His Messenger, who was the best of His Creation, to recite to the Ummah (nation) His Words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;I possess no power over benefit or harm to myself except as Allâh wills. If I had the knowledge of the Ghaib (Unseen), I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth, and no evil should have touched me. I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings unto people who believe</strong></span>.&#8221; (Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 188)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Say: &#8220;It is not in my power to cause you harm, or to bring you to the Right Path.&#8221; </strong></span>(Surah Al-Jinn, 72: 21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;None can protect me from Allâh’s punishment (if I were to disobey Him), nor can I find refuge except in Him</strong></span>.&#8221; (Surah Al-Jinn, 72: 22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) told those closest to him to save themselves and their children from Allah&#8217;s Punishment through having Iman (Faith) in Him (Glorified be He) and by acting according to His Shari`ah (laws). He also told them that Allah is not in need of them and that Adam, Nuh (Noah), Ibrahim (Abraham) and `Isa (Jesus) will be saying on the Day of Resurrection, &#8220;Myself, myself!&#8221; So how can a shaykh of the Qadiriyyah Tariqah or anyone else created by Allah save their followers, protect those who are loyal to them, and come with them when their deeds are being weighed on the Day of Resurrection? And how could he close the gates of Hell by his greatness? <strong>This is a manifest fabrication and clear Kufr regarding the Shari`ah of the Lord of the Worlds</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author of this poem has been excessive in his exaggeration and has overstepped the boundaries of the senses,the intellect, and the Shari`ah, when he claims that he was in the light of Muhammad before the existence of creation, and that he witnessed the meeting of friends, i.e. when Jibril (Gabriel) met with Muhammad (peace be upon them both); he was with Nuh (peace be upon him) in the ark and witnessed the flood; he was with Ibrahim (peace be upon him) when he was thrown to the fire and saw how the fire cooled due to his Du`a&#8217; (supplication); he was with Isma`il (Ishmael) and that the ram was only sent except by his generosity; he was with Ya`qub (Jacob, peace be upon him) when his sight was taken away and that his eyes were only cured with his spit; he was the one who settled Idris (Enoch, peace be upon him) in Jannah (Paradise); he was with Musa (Moses, peace be upon him) when he talked to his Lord and that Musa&#8217;s stick was taken from his stick; he was with `Isa (peace be upon him) in the cradle; and that it was he who gave Dawud (David) his beautiful voice for recitation. He also makes even more obscene claims than these, as he claims that he is Allah in three verses of his poem, the clearest of which is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I am the one, the only, and the great one in himself,<br />
I am the describer and the described; the shaykh of the Tariqah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah be Exalted and Glorified from this great exceeding of the bounds; <strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">is there anything worse than this sheer Kufr?</span> </strong>May Allah protect us from it!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Dear questioner, may Allah turn you away from this evil you heard and make you feel no need to study the detailed history and biography of the Qadiriyyah, and what is in this poem by the shaykh of this Tariqah in terms of falsehood, Kufr, and exaggeration. Exert yourself instead to learn the truth from the Book of Allah(Exalted be He), the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace be upon him), and the explanations of the Salaf (pious predecessors) from among the Sahabah (Companions) and their followers of the Qur&#8217;an and the Sahih (authentic) Sunnah. We believe that <strong>Shaykh `Abdul-Qadir Al-Jilany</strong>, to whom this Tariqah is ascribed, is as innocent of what is in this poem as the wolf was innocent of the blood of Yaqub&#8217;s son. His followers tell many lies about him and ascribe to him that which he is innocent of.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What is the ruling on non-Muslims donating blood to Muslims?</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q 1: What is the ruling on blood donation? What is the ruling on non-Muslims donating blood to Muslims?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is permissible to donate blood to Muslims whether the donor is Muslim or Kafir (non-Muslim); and whether he is of the People of the Book, or idolater if there is no harm to the donor and the person to whom blood is donated was in need of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217; &#8211; alifta.net<br />
Fatwas of the Permanent Committee&gt;Group 1&gt;Volume 25: Miscellaneous Fatwas 2&gt;Treatment with blood&gt;Blood donation</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it allowed to transfer blood from one person to another, and what if the two are of different religions?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a patient becomes so sick that the only way for him to get better is to undergo a blood transfusion, and when doctors are at least confident of the benefits that will result, he may be treated in this fashion, even if the donor and the recipient belong to different religions. Blood form a disbeliever, even though he may be at war with the Muslims, can be donated to a Muslim. <strong>And Muslim blood may be donated to a disbeliever who is not at war with the Muslims</strong>. May Allaah send peace and blessings upon Muhammad, his family, and his Companions.</p>

<h3><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Muslims donating blood to non-Muslims is a good deed</strong></span></h3>
<p>The former Mufti of Saudi Arabia Shaykh bin Baz mentioned&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible for Muslims to donate blood to non-Muslims and you will be rewarded (by Allah) for doing so. But it’s not permissible to accept compensation for donating blood. Thus Whoever accepted money for donating blood should give that money in charity to the poor.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transferring blood from a male to a female and vice versa</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing wrong with transferring blood from a male to a female and vice versa, as this does not affect marriageability and such matters.</p>
<p>[Issued by the Permanent Committee, Fatwa no. 19477, the sixth question]<br />
<a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;PageID=319&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=17" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;PageID=319&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=17</a></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Donating blood and taking a Price / receiving Gifts for it.</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Receiving compensation for blood donation is unlawful, whether the compensation is money or any other kind of payment based on the Hadith reported on the authority of Abu Juhayfah in Sahih Al-Bukhari: The Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade the price of blood [1].There is a general Ijma` (consensus of scholars) that it is unlawful even if the money is a gift; for it is a gift given in return for something that it is forbidden to sell.</p>
<p>[1] Al-Bukhari, Sahih, Book on clothing, no. 5945; and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 4, p. 308.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;PageID=321&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=17" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;PageID=321&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=17</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated `Aun bin Abu Juhaifa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My father bought a slave who practiced the profession of cupping. (My father broke the slave&#8217;s instruments of cupping). I asked my father why he had done so. He replied, <strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;The Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) forbade the acceptance of the price of a dog or blood, and also forbade the profession of tattooing, getting tattooed and receiving or giving Riba, (usury), and cursed the picture-makers.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sahih al-Bukhari 2086 (Book 34, Hadith 39), Translated Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: A blood bank grants gifts to blood donors, such as prayer rugs, medals, head coverings or the like, and sometimes three hundred riyals. I would like to know what is the Islamic ruling on such gifts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: After considering the Fatwa request, the Committee gave the following answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible to sell blood based on the Hadith related in Sahih Al-Bukhari on the authority of Abu Juhayfah who said: I saw my father buying a cupper [a person who performs cupping] and ordered that his tools be broken. I asked him about this and he replied: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) forbade the price of blood, the price of dogs, and the earnings of a prostitute; and he cursed the woman who tattoos others and she who gets tattooed, the one who takes or gives Riba (usury or interest), and the Musawwir (one who makes pictures, statues, or photographs of living beings).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafiz in Al-Fath said: <strong>&#8220;This means that it is prohibited to sell blood just as it is prohibited to sell dead meat and pork. This is unanimously Haram (unlawful), i.e., to sell blood and take a price.&#8221;</strong></p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Does blood transfusion create a Mahram relationship?</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Transferring blood from a man to a woman or vice versa does not fall under the same category as breastfeeding, whether linguistically, conventionally, or legally, nor is it liable to the rulings on breastfeeding, such as creating a Mahram (unmarriageable relatives) relationship or affecting marriageability and the like, as breastfeeding does.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Issued by His Eminence Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al-Shaykh, may Allah be merciful to him]</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Establishing an Islamic bank to store blood for emergency aid for wounded Muslims</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible to found an Islamic bank for accepting blood donations from people and preserving it to provide first aid to the Muslims who need it, provided that the bank does not take anything from the patients or their guardians in return for providing blood to them and does not use it as a commercial means to earn money. There is no doubt that such project will be of public interest to Muslims.</p>

<p>The following Question and Answers are extracted from the Fatwa from The Permanent Commitee ( Link <strong><a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Tree&amp;NodeID=2195&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here</a>)&nbsp;</strong>&amp; Fatwa of Ibn Baz.. Download the PDF of these Fatawa <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/sujud-ul-tilawah-prostration-of-recitation1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Here</strong></a></p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>What is&nbsp;the ruling on Sujud-ul-Tilawah (Prostration of Recitation)?</b></span></p>



<p>Sujud-ul-Tilawah is an act of Sunnah.</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>When someone is reciting the Qur&#8217;an and does Sujud-ul-Tilawah (Prostration of Recitation), should they say Takbir (saying: &#8220;Allahu Akbar [Allah is the Greatest]&#8221;) when prostrating and when rising up from the Sujud (prostration) or just when prostrating?</b></span></p>



<p>They should say Takbir when prostrating, as&nbsp;related by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">&nbsp;Abu Dawud&nbsp;</span>in his Sunan (Hadith compilation classified by jurisprudential themes) on the authority of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">&nbsp;Ibn `Umar&nbsp;</span>(may Allah be pleased with them) who said,&nbsp;<a name="TheMessengerofAllah(peacebe"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="1025" class="tip"></span><span style="color: #99cc00"><em>The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) used to recite the Qur&#8217;an to us. When he came upon Ayat-ul-Sujud (Qur’anic verses of Prostration), he would say Takbir and prostrate, and we would prostrate</em></span>.</span></p>



<p>A Muslim should not say Takbir when rising from the Sujud, as it was not confirmed that he (peace be upon him) did so. Sujud-ul-Tilawah is an act of worship and acts of worship are Tawqifiy (bound by a religious text and not amenable to personal opinion), they are limited to what was proved in the Shari`ah texts.</p>



<p>It was related that the Takbir is only said when going into Sujud-ul-Tilawah and not when rising from it, <strong>unless the Ayat-ul-Sujud are recited while offering Salah (prayer), then the Takbir is said when prostrating and when rising from the Sujud.</strong> There are many Sahih (authentic) Hadith that mention how the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to offer Salah, which report that he used to say Takbir when prostrating and when rising from prostration.</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>Should Taslim (salutation of peace ending the Prayer) be made when Sujud-ul-Tilawah is performed during recitation of the Qur&#8217;an outside Salah (Prayer)?</b></span></p>



<p>There is no Nas (Islamic text from the Qur’an or the Sunnah) to support that Taslim should be made after performing it; therefore, no Taslim should follow Sujud.</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>Should they recite the Tashahhud (a recitation in the sitting position in the second/ last unit of Prayer) and should they say the Taslim (salutation of peace ending the Prayer)?</b></span></p>



<p>The Tashahhud should not be said during Sujud-ul-Tilawah nor the Taslim, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) did not do so. Sujud-ul-Tilawah is an act of worship and acts of worship, as was mentioned, are Tawqifiy. So you should not resort to Qiyas (analogy) and include the Taslim or Tashahhud in the Sujud-ul-Tilawah as it is in Salah.</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>If someone is offering Salah and one of Ayat-ul-Sujud (Qur&#8217;anic verses of Prostration) is recited at the end of the Surah (Qur&#8217;anic chapter), should they start to recite the next Surah after rising up from Sujud (prostration) or just proceed directly to Ruku` (bowing)?</b></span></p>



<p>It is not obligatory for someone who offers Salah and performs Sujud-ul-Tilawah at the end of Surahs such as Al-A`raf, Al-Najm, and Al-`Alaq, to recite more Qur&#8217;an after rising from Sujud-ul-Tilawah and before bending for Ruku`; but there is nothing wrong if they do.</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>Some people believe that it is not a requirementto be in a state of Taharah (ritual purification) and face the Qiblah (Ka`bah-direction faced in Prayer)when performing Sujud-ul-Tilawah (Prostration of Recitation), while others say that it is. Which opinion is correct?</b></span></p>



<p>Some scholars consider Sujud-ul-Tilawah a Salah (Prayer) and, on the basis of this opinion, stipulate the conditions of Taharah, facing the Qiblah, Takbir (saying: &#8220;Allahu Akbar [Allah is the Greatest]&#8221;) when prostrating and upon rising from Sujud, and offering Taslim (salutation of peace ending the Prayer). Other scholars consider it an act of `Ibadah (worship), yet not similar to Salah, and therefore do not deem the abovementioned conditions &#8211; such as Taharah, facing the Qiblah, and the other conditions &#8211; necessary. This is the preponderant opinion, as we do not have any evidence supporting the necessity of meeting these conditions. However, whenever it is possible to face the Qiblah or be ritually pure when performing Sujud-ul-Tilawah, this is preferred, to avoid the divergent opinions of scholars.</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>What is the Du`a&#8217; (supplication) that should be said in Sujud-ul-Tilawah?</b></span></p>



<p>The Du`a&#8217; that should be said is the same as that said in Sujud during Salah.</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>Is it permissible for a menstruating woman to do the Sujud-ul-Tilawah (Prostration of Recitation) and the Sujud-ul-Shukr (Prostration of Thankfulness to Allah)?&nbsp;If it is not permissible, can she glorify Allah verbally (by saying: &#8220;Subhana Allah [Glory be to Allah]&#8221;) when hearing Ayat-ul-Sujud (Qur’anic verses of Prostration)?</b></span></p>



<p><b>Firstly:&nbsp;</b>When a woman is allowed to recite the Qur&#8217;an, she is permitted to do the Sujud-ul-Tilawah, whether she listens to it or recites it.The soundest opinion is that it is permissible for a woman to recite from memory, but not from the Mus-haf (copy of the Qur&#8217;an), and she is permitted to prostrate, because it is not a Salah (prayer), but a way of showing submissiveness to Allah and an act of worship, like Dhikr (Remembrance of Allah).</p>



<p><b style="font-size: 1rem">Secondly:&nbsp;</b><span style="font-size: 1rem">It is not conditional for a reciter or a listener to be in a state of Taharah (ritual purification) to perform Sujud-ul-Tilawah or Sujud-ul-Shukr, because they do not have the same ruling of Salah.</span></p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>Is it permissible for a woman reciting the Qur&#8217;an to prostrate upon coming across one of Ayat-ul-Sujud (Qur’anic verses of Prostration) while she is not wearing Khimar (veil covering to the waist)?</b></span></p>



<p>It is better that her head be covered when she prostrates, but hopefully it is not wrong if she performs Sujud-ul-Tilawah (Prostration of Recitation) without covering her head, because Sujud-ul-Tilawah does not have the same ruling as Salah (Prayer). Rather, Sujud-ul-Tilawah is a way of showing submission to Allah (Glorified be He) and a means of approach, similar to reciting Adhkar (invocations and remembrances said at certain times on a regular basis) and performing other righteous works.</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>What is the ruling on passing in front of a worshiper who is performing Sujud-ul-Tilawah (Prostration of Recitation)?</b></span></p>



<p>There is nothing wrong in this.</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><strong>Sajdatut-Tilawah is a Sunnah</strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><strong>Question</strong>:&nbsp;If I come across a Verse in which there is a prostration when I am reciting the Quran at my desk, or when I am teaching the students, or in any place, should I perform Sajdatut-Tilawah, or not? And is the prostration for the reciter and the listener both?</span></p>



<p><strong>Answer</strong>:&nbsp;Sajdatut-Tilawah is a Sunnah for the reciter and for the listener and it is not an obligation, nor is it prescribed for the listener except in following of the reciter.</p>



<p>So if you recite a Verse in which there is a prostration in your office or the place of instruction, it is lawful for you to make prostration and it is prescribed for the students to prostrate with you, because they are the listeners. And if you do not observe the prostration, there is no objection.</p>



<p>Shaykh `Abdul-`Azeez Bin Baz<br />Fatawa Islamiyah Vol. 2 Page 282, Darussalam English Publication</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>Q: What are the Ayahs (Qur’anic verses) requiring prostration when recited and which of them are obligatory?&nbsp;( alifta Link&nbsp;<a href="http://www.alifta.net/fatawa/fatawaDetails.aspx?languagename=en&amp;BookID=14&amp;View=Page&amp;PageNo=1&amp;PageID=4882" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here</a>)</b></span></p>



<p><strong>Answer from Shaykh Ibn Baz:</strong></p>



<p>Any Sujud-ul-Tilawah (Prostration of Recitation) is Sunnah (supererogatory act of worship following the example of the Prophet) and is not obligatory.</p>



<p>There are <strong>fifteen prostrations of recitation in the Qur&#8217;an,</strong> according to the correct opinion of scholars: one at the end of Surah Al-A`raf, one in Surah Al-Ra`d, one in Surah Al-Nahl, one in Surah Al-Isra&#8217;, one in Surah Maryam, two in Surah Al-Hajj, one in Surah Al-Furqan, one in Surah Al-Naml, one in Surah Al-Sajdah, one in Surah Sad,&nbsp;one in Surah Fussilat, one at the end of Surah Al-Najm, one in Surah Al-Inshiqaq that begins with:&nbsp;<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0"/><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Inshiqaq, 84: 1" target="_blank" name="Whentheheavenissplitasunder"></a><span style="color: #99cc00">When the heaven is split asunder</span>,&nbsp;and the last one in Surah Al-`Alaq that begins with:&nbsp;<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0"/><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-`Alaq, 96: 1" target="_blank" name="Read!IntheNameofyourLord"></a><span style="color: #99cc00">Read! In the Name of your Lord</span>&nbsp;These are fifteen positions for prostration.</p>



<p>It is an act of the Sunnah to prostrate upon reciting them and if one does not prostrate, there is no sin, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) read Surah Al-Najm at times and did not offer Sujud (prostration). This indicated that Sujud-ul-Tilawah is not obligatory.<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">&nbsp;`Umar&nbsp;</span>(may Allah be pleased with him) also said: &#8220;<strong>Allah has not made Sujud-ul-Tilawah obligatory; only if we want to</strong>.&#8221; This shows that whoever prostrates is rewarded and whoever does not prostrate is absolved.</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><strong>The Ruling on reciting the Verses of Prostration in the Quiet Prayers</strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><strong>Question</strong>:&nbsp;What is the ruling on reciting a Verse in which there is a prostration in the quiet prayers, such as Zuhr prayer or Asr prayer?</span></p>



<p>Answer:&nbsp;It is disliked for the Imam to recite a Verse of prostration in the quiet prayers, because he has no alternative in that case but either to prostrate for it or not. If he does not do so, he is abandoning a Sunnah, and if he does so, he will cause confusion in the minds of the worshippers. Therefore it is better to avoid the cause of such confusion. But if he does recite it, he should not prostrate, so as not to confuse the worshippers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Fatwas &gt; Shawwal Fatwas &gt; Priority to make up for missed days of Ramadan over fasting the six days of Shawwal</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is prescribed to give priority to make up for missed days of Ramadan over fasting the six days of Shawwal</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Q: Is it permissible to observe Sawm (Fasting) for six days in Shawwal before making up for the missed days of the previous month of Ramadan?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Scholars differ regarding this issue; however, the soundest opinion is that it is prescribed to give precedence to observing Sawm of the missed days of Ramadan over the six days of Shawwal and other supererogatory Sawm, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <strong>Anyone who fasts Ramadan and then follows it with six days of Shawwal it is as if they fasted the whole year.</strong> (Related by Muslim in his Sahih [Authentic Hadith Book]) If one chooses to observe Sawm of the six days of Shawwal first, it will not be considered as one who fasts these six days after fasting all of Ramadan, but after some days of Ramadan. Making up for the missed days of Ramadan is a Fard (obligatory act of worship) while fasting the six days of Shawwal is voluntary, and a Fard is more important to fulfill. May Allah grant us success!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Q: I was unable to fast during Ramadan due to post-partum bleeding. I became ritually pure during the days of ‘Eid and I really wish to fast the six days of Shawwal. Is it permissible for me to fast these days and then begin making up the missed days of Ramadan? Please give us your Fatwa (legal opinion issued by a qualified Muslim scholar). May Allah guide you to all goodness!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is prescribed to first make up for the missed days of fasting in Ramadan, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <strong>Anyone who fasts Ramadan and then follows it with six days of Shawwal it is as if they fasted the whole year.</strong> (Related by Muslim in his Sahih) Thus, the Prophet (peace be upon him) clarified that fasting six days of Shawwal comes after fasting Ramadan. It is your duty to start by making up for your missed days of fasting, even if you miss fasting the six days of Shawwal, for the previous Hadith. Moreover, Fard (obligatory act of worship) take precedence over Nafl (supererogatory act of worship). May Allah guide us all to success!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fatwas of the Permanent Committee</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Browse by Volume Number &gt; Group 1 &gt; Volume 20: Divorce &gt; Wisdom behind granting the right to initiate Talaq to men &gt; Is it permissible for a woman to have the right to divorce?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa no. 5245</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Q: Many people from neighboring countries ask me about the issue of `Ismah (the bond of marriage, i.e. the right to initiate divorce). Is it permissible for a woman to have this right? Please enlighten us.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The basic rule is that divorce is in the husband&#8217;s hands and anyone he delegates. This is in case the husband is fit, but if he is not, his guardian will act in his behalf. <strong>Moreover, if the husband authorizes his wife to initiate the divorce, she will have the right to do so as long as he has not annulled the Wakalah (appointment of a legally accountable person to act on behalf of another for a specific permissible matter)</strong>. However, when a husband grants his wife the right to initiate divorce at any time by adding a condition in the marriage contract, this condition is Batil (null and void) since it opposes the main purpose behind the marriage contract. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;Any condition that is not in the book of Allah is null, even if they are one hundred conditions.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">Browse by Volume Number &gt; Group 1 &gt; Volume 20: Divorce &gt; Wisdom behind granting the right to initiate Talaq to men &gt; Wisdom behind granting the right to initiate Talaq to men</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third question of Fatwa no. 4497</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q 3: Why does Islam grant only the husband the right to initiate Talaq (divorce pronounced by a husband)? What is the ruling if the husband&#8217;s company is unbearable? How can we say that Islam treats both men and women equally?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <strong>Firstly</strong>: Allah grants the husband alone the right to initiate Talaq due to many important reasons, such as;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) The husband&#8217;s wisdom, strong will, understanding, and insight being more than the wife&#8217;s.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) The husband is the one who provides for the family, manages its affairs and takes decisions. He is the main pillar and head of the household.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(iii) The husband is obligated to pay the Mahr (mandatory gift to a bride from her groom) and that is why divorce is in his hand. Had it been in the woman&#8217;s hand, a woman may marry someone to take the Mahr and divorce him to marry another, and so on. This is not proper and Allah warns Muslims against this when He says: Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allâh has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: When the husband&#8217;s company is unbearable, the matter is to be referred to the courts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>: Allah favors men with some rulings and favors women with some rulings, and both of them share some rulings, and the mutual reference is the Shari`ah (Islamic law).</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">Browse by Volume Number &gt; Group 1 &gt; Volume 20: Divorce &gt; Wisdom behind granting the right to initiate Talaq to men &gt; Should a woman make Kaffarah for divorcing her husband?</p>
<p>The first question of Fatwa no. 8065</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q 1: When a woman divorces her husband, is she required to make Kaffarah (expiation)? If so, what is it?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: When a woman pronounces the divorce word to her husband, the divorce does not take place. No Kaffarah is required, but she has to perform Tawbah (repentance to Allah) and ask Allah&#8217;s forgiveness. Her pronouncement of divorce to her husband goes against the Shari`ah (Islamic law) proof that indicates that the right of divorce is given to the husband or the Islamically lawful authorized person that replaces the husband in divorce.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings of Allah be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Statement from the Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta’ concerning the ruling on celebrating the Gregorian Year 2000 and related issues</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allah, Alone, and peace and blessings be upon the Last of the Prophets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The questioners have asked about the ruling on dedicating attention to the Gregorian millennium, celebrating it, and other issues relating to the event. It is sufficient for us to quote just two of the posed questions:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The first question says,</strong> “Nowadays we see the programs that the mass media is broadcasting about the celebrations and preparations held for the arrival of the Year 2000, and the beginning of the third millennium. The Kafirs (disbelievers) from among the Jews, Christians, and others, are very happy about it and pin their hopes on this event. My question, Your Eminence, is that some Muslims have become interested in it and are considering it a happy occasion to get married or do business on. Others are advertising this event in their shops or companies, and doing other things that offend Muslims. What is the Shari‘ah (Islamic law) ruling on celebrating this event and exchanging verbal congratulations and cards on it? May Allah reward you with the best for the efforts you exert for Islam and Muslims!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second question says,</strong> “The Jews and the Christians are preparing to celebrate the arrival of the Year 2000 according to their calendar, in an extraordinary way to promote their plans and beliefs in the world, particularly in Muslim countries. Some Muslims have been influenced by this propaganda and have also started preparing for it and many of them are announcing sales on this occasion. We fear that this may affect the Muslims’ ‘Aqidah (creed) in relation to their loyalties to non-Muslims. We hope you will explain the ruling on Muslims’ following the Kafir (disbelievers) in their special occasions, propagating and celebrating them, and the ruling on giving workers the day off in some organizations and companies to mark this occasion?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Does doing any of these or similar things, or approving them, have any effect on a Muslim’s ‘Aqidah?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Having studied the questions, the committee answered as follows:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam and the guidance to the Straight Path are the greatest blessings that Allah has bestowed upon His Servants. It is through His Mercy that Allah (Exalted be He) obligates His Believing Servants to ask Him for guidance during Salah (Prayer). They ask Him to guide them to and keep them on the Straight Path. Allah (Glorified be He) describes this Straight Path as being the path of those on whom He has bestowed His Grace from among the Prophets, the Siddiqin (the followers of the prophets who were first to believe in them, such as Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq), the martyrs, and the righteous, and not the path of those who have gone astray from the Jews, Christians, and other Kafirs (disbelievers) and Mushrikin (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once this is learned, it is obligatory on a Muslim to realize the greatness of Allah’s Blessing upon them. They should give thanks to Allah (Glorified be He) in words, deeds, and beliefs. They should guard this blessing, protect it, and adopt the means necessary to keep from loss.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An insightful look into Allah’s Din (Religion) in today’s world, in which the truth and falsehood have become mixed and confused for many people, will clearly see the efforts the enemies of Islam are exerting to destroy its realities, extinguish its light, distance Muslims from it, and sever all their connections with it by any possible means. Not only that, but they are also attempting to distort its image and bring accusations and forge lies against it, to avert people from the Way of Allah,and from Iman (Faith) in what Allah revealed to His Messenger, Muhammad ibn ‘Abdullah (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) confirms this by saying (what means): <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 109" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="ManyofthepeopleoftheScripture"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Many of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) wish that if they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed, out of envy from their ownselves, even after the truth (that Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم is Allâh’s Messenger) has become manifest unto them</span>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-&#096;Imran, 3: 69" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="ApartyofthepeopleoftheScripture"></a><span style="color:#008000;">A party of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) wish to lead you astray. But they shall not lead astray anyone except themselves, and they perceive not.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-&#096;Imran, 3: 149" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="Oyouwhobelieve!Ifyouobey"></a><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! If you obey those who disbelieve, they will send you back on your heels, and you will turn back (from Faith) as losers</span>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-&#096;Imran, 3: 99" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="Say:OpeopleoftheScripture"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Say: &#8220;O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Why do you stop those who have believed, from the Path of Allâh, seeking to make it seem crooked, while you (yourselves) are witnesses [to Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم as a Messenger of Allâh and Islâm (Allâh’s religion, i.e. to worship none but Him Alone)]? And Allâh is not unaware of what you do.</span>&#8220;<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There as also many other Ayahs (Qur’anic verses) to this effect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nevertheless, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) has made a promise to protect His Religion and Book, as He says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-Hijr, 15: 9" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="Verily,We,itisWeWhohavesent"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Qur’ân) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption</span>).<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /> All praise is to Allah! Moreover, the Prophet (peace be upon him) has informed that a group of his Ummah (nation based on one creed) will continue on the Truth, triumphant, and they will not be harmed by those who forsake or oppose them until the Day of Judgment. All praise is to Allah! We ask Allah (Exalted be He), Who is the Ever-Near and the Responsive, to make us and our Muslim brothers among this group. Indeed, He is the Most Generous Bestower.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta’ has seen and heard about the huge preparations and great interest shown by the Jews, the Christians, and those so-called Muslims who are influenced by them to mark the end of the year and welcome the new millennium according to the Gregorian calendar, and the committee cannot but provide advice and clarification for all Muslims on the facts of this occasion and give the ruling of the sanctified Shari‘ah on it, so Muslims will be enlightened about their Din and beware of the deviations of those who earned Allah’s Anger and those who went astray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>To continue:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>First</strong></span>: The Jews and the Christians have attached events, sufferings, and pinned hopes on the arrival of this millennium, which they are certain &#8211; or almost certain &#8211; that they shall come to pass, as they are the outcome of their researches and studies, as they claim. They have also attached some of their creedal issues to this millennium, which they claim to have been mentioned in their distorted books. It is obligatory on Muslims not to pay attention to this or believe it; instead they should be content with the Book of their Lord (Exalted be He) and the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace be upon him), and any theory or opinion contrary to these is just an illusion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">Second</span></strong>: This and other similar occasions are never devoid of mixing the truth with falsehood, and inviting to Kufr (disbelief), Dalalah (deviation from what is right), licentiousness, atheism, and the emergence of Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect).Among these invitations are the calls to unify the religions, equate Islam with false creeds and sects, ask for the blessing of the Cross, and practice the Jewish and Christian rites. This is in addition to the words and deeds that either imply that the distorted abrogated Christian and Jewish creeds can lead to Allah, or express approval of some of their beliefs which contradict the Din of Islam or constitute Kufr (disbelief) in Allah, His Messenger, and Islam, by the Ijma‘ (consensus) of the Muslim Ummah. Moreover, this occasion is one of the means of alienating Muslims from their Din.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Third</strong></span>: The Qur’an, Sunnah, and authentic Athar (narrations from the Companions) give detailed evidence on the prohibition of imitating the disbelievers in what is particular to them. This includes imitating them in their ‘Eids or celebrating them. ‘Eid (festival) is a generic term which (in the context of these reports) includes every day or occasion which is repeated and is venerated by the Kafirs, or any place in which the Kafirs hold religious gatherings, or any action which they do in these places or at these times &#8211; all of that is part of their ‘Eids or festivals. The prohibition applies not only to their festivals, but to any times or places which they venerate that have no basis in the Din of Islam; and all the invented acts that they do at them are prohibited also. The days preceding and following their festivals are also covered by this prohibition, as pointed out by Shaykh Al-Islam, Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful to him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the Ayahs (Qur’anic verses) which specifically forbid imitating Non-Muslims in their festivals is Allah’s Saying: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-Furqan, 25: 72" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="Andthosewhodonotbearwitness"></a><span style="color:#008000;">And those who do not bear witness to falsehood</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /> This is stated as one of the characteristics of Allah’s Believing Servants. A group of the Salaf (righteous predecessors), including: Ibn Sirin, Mujahid, and Al-Rabi‘ ibn Anas, interpreted the word &#8220;<strong>Al-Zur (falsehood)</strong>&#8221; as referring to the festivals of the Kafirs. It was authentically reported that Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said, <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="WhentheMessengerofAllah(peace"></a><span id="13870"></span>“<span style="color:#008000;">When the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) came to Al-Madinah, they had two days on which they would celebrate. He (peace be upon him) asked, ‘What are these two days?’ They said, ‘We used to celebrate on these two days during the Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance).’ The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, “Allah has given you two days instead of these that are better than them: the Day of Al-Adha (the Festival of the Sacrifice) and the Day of Al-Fitr (the Festival of Breaking the Fast)</span>.”<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /> (Reported by Al-ImamAhmad, Abu Dawud, and Al-Nasa&#8217;y, through Sahih [authentic] Sanad [chain of narrators])</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was authentically narrated by Thabit ibn Al-Dahhak (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said, <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="Amanvowedtosacrificesomecamels"></a><span id="10255"></span>“<span style="color:#008000;">A man vowed to sacrifice some camels in Buwanah (a hill beyond Yanbu`) during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). So, he came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said, ‘I have vowed to sacrifice some camels in Buwanah.’ The Prophet (peace be upon him) asked, “Were there any idols of the Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance) there that were worshipped?” They said, ‘No.’ He (peace be upon him) asked, ‘Were any of their festivals held there?’ They said, ‘No.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, ‘Fulfill your vow, for there is no fulfillment of a vow which involves disobedience to Allah, or with regard to a thing the son of Adam does not own</span>.’”<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /> (Reported by Abu Dawud through a Sahih Sanad)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said, “<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do not enter to the Mushrikin (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) in their churches on the day of their festivals, for Wrath descends upon them</strong></span>.” He (may Allah be pleased with him) also said, “<span style="color:#008000;">Keep away from the enemies of Allah on their festivals.</span>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also reported that `Abdullah ibn `Amr ibn Al-`As (may Allah be pleased with them both) said, “<span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who settles in the land of the non-Muslims and celebrates their Nayruz (New Year’s Day) and their Mahrajaan (two non-Islamic Persian festivals), and keeps imitating them until they die in that state, will be gathered with them on the Day of Resurrection</span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">Fourth</span></strong>: Muslims are prohibited from observing the festivals of the Kafirs for many reasons, some of which are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Imitating them in some of their festivals will give them delight and complacency in their falsehoods.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Imitation and similarity in external matters will inevitably leads one to imitating them and behaving like them in internal matters such as their corrupt beliefs, and being slowly and subtly won over to their way of thinking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. One of the gravest ensuing corruptions is that imitating the Kafirs in external matters generates a kind of love, friendship and loyalties that are incompatible with Iman (Faith), as Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 51" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="Oyouwhobelieve!Takenotthe"></a><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Auliyâ’ (friends, protectors, helpers), they are but Auliyâ’ of each other. And if any amongst you takes them (as Auliyâ’), then surely he is one of them. Verily, Allâh guides not those people who are the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers and unjust)</span>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-Mujadalah, 58: 22" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="You(OMuhammad%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%89%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%85)"></a>Y<span style="color:#008000;">ou (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will not find any people who believe in Allâh and the Last Day, making friendship with those who oppose Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم)</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Fifth</strong></span>: Based on the above, it is not permissible for a Muslim who believes in Allah as their Lord, Islam as their religion, and Muhammad as their Prophet to celebrate any festival that has no basis in the Din of Islam, and that includes the so-called new millennium. Neither are they permitted to attend such festivals or take part in them, or to help others do so in any way whatsoever, because this is sin and transgression of the limits set by Allah. Allah (Exalted be He) says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 2" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="Oyouwhobelieve!Violatenot"></a><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allâh. Verily, Allâh is Severe in punishment</span>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Sixth</strong></span>: It is not permissible for a Muslim to cooperate, in any way, with the Kafirs with regard to their festivals &#8211; including the new millennium under discussion &#8211; by publicizing and announcing them, or propagating them by any means, whether through the mass media, or by setting up digital clocks and notice boards, manufacturing clothing and memorabilia, printing cards or school notebooks, announcing sales, offering prizes, organizing sport events, or producing special slogans or logos.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Seventh</strong></span>: It is not permissible for Muslims to consider the festivals of the Kafirs &#8211; including the millennium &#8211; to be happy occasions or blessed times for taking the day off work, getting married, starting a business or beginning new projects, etc. It is not permissible to believe that these days are more special than other days; because these are just like any other days.This is a corrupt belief that does not change the reality of these days in the slightest. Such beliefs are nothing but sin upon sin. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Eighth</strong></span>: It is not permissible for a Muslim to congratulate the Kafirs on their festivals, as this implies a kind of approval of their false beliefs and makes them happy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn Al-Qayyim</strong> (may Allah be merciful to him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“As for offering congratulations on the special ritualistic occasions of Kufr (disbelief), this is agreed to be Haram (prohibited), such as congratulating them (the Kafirs) for their festivals and fasts by saying, ‘Happy or blessed festival to you’ and the like. Even if the one who says so escapes committing Kufr, it is still Haram. It is like congratulating someone for prostrating to the Cross; in fact it is even more sinful in the Sight of Allah and more hateful than congratulating someone for drinking Khamr (intoxicants), killing a soul, or committing adultery, and so on. Many of those who have no respect for their Din fall into this error; they do not realize the abhorrence of their action. Anyone who congratulate a person for committing an act of disobedience, Bid‘ah (innovation in religion) or Kufr exposes themselves to the Hate and Wrath of Allah.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Ninth</strong></span>: It honors the Muslims to abide by the <strong>Hijri (lunar) calendar</strong> which is based on the date of Hijrah (migration) of their Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to Madinah, upon which the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet, may Allah be pleased with them) consensually agreed, and they dated events according to it without celebrating it. Muslims have followed in their footsteps and passed on this heritage for fourteen centuries to our present day. Therefore, it is not permissible for a Muslim to abandon the Hijri calendar and adopt the calendar of any other nation on earth, such as the Gregorian. This means exchanging that which is better for that which is worse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We, therefore, advise all Muslims to have Taqwa (fear/wariness of offending Allah) and to act in obedience to Allah, keep away from sins, and to exhort one another to persevere in this and be patient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let every believer be true to their soul and strive to save it from the Wrath of Allah and His Curse in this world and the Hereafter by actualizing their knowledge and Iman. They should take Allah as their Guide, Helper, Lawgiver, and Protector, for He is the Best Protector and the Best Helper. Indeed, sufficient is your Lord as a Guide and Helper.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let them also repeat the Du‘a’ (supplication) of the Prophet (peace be upon him):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="OAllah!LordofJibril,Mika%E2%80%99il,"></a><span id="19858"></span>“<span style="color:#008000;">O Allah! Lord of Jibril, Mika’il, and Israfil, Creator of the heavens and the earth, Knower of the Unseen and the Seen, You will judge between Your servants concerning that over which they used to differ. Guide me to the truth of that wherein they differed, by Your leave, for You guide whomsoever You will to the Straight Path</span>.”<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">The second question of Fatwa no. <span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">7807</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">Q 2: Is the call for rapprochement between religions (Islam &#8211; Christianity &#8211; Judaism) a legitimate one? Is it permissible for a Muslim believer to support it? I heard that this is done by some scholars in Al-Az-har and other Islamic institutions. Is the call for rapprochement betweenAhl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream) and theShiites, Druze, Al-Isma`iliyyah, Al-Nusayriyyah and such sects useful for Muslims? Is reconciliation between them possible, although all of these sects entail Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), offense to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and hostility towards Islam and Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah? Is this rapprochement permissible according to Shari`ah?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody"><b>A: <span style="color:#ff0000;">First</span>: </b>the roots of Iman (faith) which Allah has revealed to His Messengers in the Holy Books: Tawrah (Torah), Injil (Gospel), Zabur (Psalms), and the Qur&#8217;an; and which the Messengers Ibrahim (Abraham), Musa (Moses), &#8216;Isa </span>(<span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">Jesus</span></span>),<span class="HarfBody"> and other Messengers (peace be upon them) called to, are all the same. The former ones of them told the latter about them; and the latter confirmed what the former said, even if they differed in the branches, each according to the circumstances of their own era and the benefit of the people at their time. This is the wisdom and mercy of Allah, as He says, <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#ff6600;"><em>The Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allâh, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. (They say), &#8220;We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers&#8221; &#8211; and they say, &#8220;We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your Forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all).</em>&#8220;</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" />(Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 285).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Allah also says, <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><em><span style="color:#ff6600;">And those who believe in Allâh and His Messengers and make no distinction between any of them (Messengers), We shall give them their rewards; and Allâh is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful</span></em>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /> (Surah Al-Nisa&#8217;, 4: 152). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Allah also says, <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" />And (remember) when Allâh took the Covenant of the Prophets, saying: &#8220;<em><span style="color:#ff6600;">Take whatever I gave you from the Book and Hikmah (understanding of the Laws of Allâh), and afterwards there will come to you a Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) confirming what is with you; you must, then, believe in him and help him</span></em>.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Allâh said: <em><span style="color:#ff6600;">&#8220;Do you agree (to it) and will you take up My Covenant (which I conclude with you)?&#8221; They said: &#8220;We agree.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Then bear witness; and I am with you among the witnesses (for this).&#8221;<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" />Then whoever turns away after this, they are the Fâsiqûn (rebellious: those who turn away from Allâh’s Obedience).<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" />Do they seek other than the religion of Allâh (the true Islâmic Monotheism &#8211; worshipping none but Allâh Alone), while to Him submitted all creatures in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">After mentioning Ibrahim&#8217;s call for Tawhid (monotheism) and the Messengers who were contemporary with him, Allah says, <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><em><span style="color:#ff6600;">They are those whom We gave the Book, Al-Hukm (understanding of the religious laws), and Prophethood.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">A person who thinks of compromising between Islam, Christianity, and Judaism is like a person who tries to match two contradictory things; truth and falsehood; Kufr and Iman.</span></p>

His evil spread widely; many sects were deceived by him, so they turned to Kufr after having embraced Islam; and controversy spread among Muslims.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Some of the sincere great scholars were deceived by this call, as their hearts were too pure and they were inexperienced in life. So, they issued a magazine called &#8220;Al-Taqrib&#8221;. However, the truth was uncovered soon after, and this call ended in failure. This is not strange, as the inclinations are different, the ideas are distinct, and the &#8216;Aqidahs are contrasting. There is no way to reconcile the contraries.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa no. 2396</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Some callers to Allah (Exalted be He) told us that a Muslim should not wipe over his face after making Du`a&#8217; (supplication), because this is a form of Bid`ah (innovation in religion), as they say. They further say that if the Mu&#8217;adhin (caller to Prayer) says while performing Iqamah (call to start the Prayer): &#8220;The time of Salah (Prayer) has come&#8221;, it is not permissible for prayers to say: &#8220;May Allah establish it and cause it to continue.&#8221; Kindly give us the legal opinion in this regard.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: First, the slave&#8217;s calling upon his Lord and asking Him for his needs is valid and encouraged, and <strong>raising the hands while performing Du`a&#8217; (supplication)</strong> to beseech Allah (Exalted be He) and turn to Him, is an established act of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning <strong>wiping over the face after making Du`a&#8217;</strong>, there is Hadith which is classed as Da`if (weak) and is related by Ibn Majah from the narration of Salih ibn Hassan Al-Nadry on the authority of Muhammad ibn Ka`b Al-Qurazhy from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, <em>When you supplicate Allah, do so with the palms of your hands, not with their backs. After you have finished, wipe your face therewith</em>. [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Hadith is Da`if due to the weakness of Salih ibn Hassan. He was classified as a weak narrator by Ahmad, Ibn Ma`in, Abu Hatim, and Al-Daraqutny. Al-Bukhari said that his narrated Hadith are rejected, and the same was said by Abu Nu`aym Al-Asbahany who said that his (Salih&#8217;s) Hadith are rejected and he is Matruk (a narrator whose Hadith transmission was discarded due to unreliability). Ibn Hibban said: He used to listen to songs and singers and also used to narrate fabricated Hadith while falsely ascribing them to trustworthy narrators. It is also said by Ibn Al-Jawzy concerning this Hadith, it is unauthentic because of the presence of Salih ibn Hassan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is another Hadith in this regard related by Al-Tirmidhy in his Sunan: Abu Musa Muhammad ibn Al-Muthanna and Ibrahim ibn Ya`qub and others said: We were told by Hammad ibn `Isa Al-Juhany on the authority of Hanzhalah ibn Abu Sufyan Al-Jumahy from Salim ibn `Abdullah from his father, from `Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: <span style="color:#993300;"><em>Whenever Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) raised his hands for supplication, he would not lower them until he had passed them over his face</em></span>.[2] Muhammad ibn Al-Muthanna said in the Hadith he narrated: “<span style="color:#800000;"><em>He did not put them back down until he had wiped them over his face</em>.” [3]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu `Isa said: This is a Sahih Gharib (a Hadith with a single narrator usually at the beginning of the chain of narration) Hadith which has only one narration by Hammad ibn `Isa and he is the only narrator of it although his narrations are few. Hanzhalah ibn Abu Sufyan is a Thiqah (trustworthy) narrator, as judged by Yahya ibn Sa`id Al-Qattan. However, the Hadith has in its Sanad (chain of narrators) Hammad ibn `Isa who is a weak narrator as well as being the only narrator of the Hadith as mentioned by Al-Tirmidhy in his Sunan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As Du`a&#8217; is a prescribed `Ibadah (worship), and there is no authentic evidence from the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him), whether in his words or actions to support that; rather, only Da`if narrations, it is preferable to abandon that act in favor of the authentic Hadith in which there is no mention of wiping over the face after finishing Du`a&#8217;.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second, the basic rule concerning acts of worship is that they are Tawqifiy (bound by a religious text and not amenable to personal opinion), and Allah (Exalted be He) is only to be worshipped in the manner that He ordained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, it has not been authentically narrated from the Prophet (peace be upon him) upon hearing the Iqamah, that he said: &#8220;May Allah establish it and cause it to continue&#8221;. But this was narrated by Abu Dawud in his Sunan from a weak narrator. He said: We were told by Sulayman ibn Dawud Al-`Ataky who said: We were told by Muhammad ibn Thabit who said: I was told by a man from the Levant (the region covering Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Palestine) on the authority of Shahr ibn Hawshab from Abu Umamah or from some of the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) that Bilal started to declare Iqamah, and when he said, &#8220;The time of Salah has come,&#8221; the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;May Allah establish it and cause it to continue.&#8221; The reason behind the weakness of that Hadith is that its Sanad had an unknown narrator whose narration is not considered reliable. Therefore, the saying &#8220;may Allah establish it and cause it to continue&#8221; is not prescribed, because it was not authentically reported; rather, it is preferable on the part of anyone hearing the Iqamah to say as the person who declares it says, because it takes the same ruling as Adhan (call to Prayer). The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, When you hear the Mu&#8217;adhin (caller to prayer), repeat what he says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The second question of Fatwa no. 1474</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Q2: Is it permissible for a person to offer an Ud-hiyah (sacrificial animal offered by non-pilgrims) on behalf of a dead person?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: All Muslims have agreed upon its permissibility. So, it is permissible to offer Ud-hiyah on behalf of a dead person because of the generality of the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>When a man dies, his acts come to an end, but three, recurring charity, or knowledge (by which people) benefit, or a pious son, who prays for him (for the deceased).</strong>[1]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">(Narrated by Muslim, Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhy, Al-Nasa&#8217;y and Al-Bukhari in his book Al-Adab Al-Mufrad on the authority of Abu Hurayrah) </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Offering Ud-hiyah on behalf of the dead is also considered a Sadaqah Jariyah (ongoing charity) because it benefits the person offering it, the dead person and other people.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong><span style="color:#752722;" class="has-inline-color">The Transcribed Text from the audio:</span></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم </p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In the name of Allah, The Most Beneficent, The Most Merciful. I testify that there is no true God worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is Allah&#8217;s true slave and messenger. May Allah&#8217;s salah and salaam be upon the noble prophet, the believers of his family and the noble companions and those who follow on their path until the Day of resurrection. I ask Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ‎) to make us from those who follow their path until the Day we meet Him (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ‎) while pleased with us.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">We continue with the discussion on correct creed. What we are going to cover now is correct creed with the respect to karaamaat and the miracles.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">It is from the creed of Ahlul sunnah and from the basic foundations of their creed is to believe in the karaamaat. Karamaat means charisma that occur by the Auliya&#8217;, those righteous who are close to Allah.This forms part of the principles of the creed of Ahlul sunaah.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Who is the Walee? The walee is defined in the Qur&#8217;an: ٱلَّذِینَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَكَانُوا۟ یَتَّقُونَ  These are the auliya&#8217;, those who believe and are pious, complying with the commands of Allah and  are abstaining from his prohibitions, these are Auliya, the friends of Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ‎). These are the righteous who are close to Allah.  This is defined clearly in Surah Yunus in chapter 10 verse 62 and 63. </p>



<p>Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ) says</p>



<p>أَلَاۤ إِنَّ أَوۡلِیَاۤءَ ٱللَّهِ لَا خَوۡفٌ عَلَیۡهِمۡ وَلَا هُمۡ یَحۡزَنُونَ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>&#8220;No doubt verily the Auliya&#8217; no fear shall come upon them&#8221;</strong></p>



<p>Who are they? </p>



<p>Then comes the definition:    </p>



<p><strong>ٱلَّذِینَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَكَانُوا۟ یَتَّقُونَ</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>&#8220;Those who believe in Tawheed and feared Allah much (by abstaining from evil deeds and sins and by doing righteous deeds).&#8221;</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And the karamaah is a matter that transcends the conceivable or customary or natural, Allah makes occur on the hands of one of His auliya&#8217; as He chooses as a help on some religious matter or a worldly matter.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And the karamaah does not reach the level of the miracles, which is to the prophets and the messengers.So all those ordinary occurrences and habits which Allah manifests through the Auliya&#8217; in terms of various knowledges, spiritual experiences, powers, influences, and those that are mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an like in surah al kahf the people of the cave and also regarding former communities and about the initial period of the sahaabah and the successors of this ummah and also those that all exist in this ummah till today and will continue to remain till the Day of Judgement. Allah makes them manifest on the hands of the friends of Allah. The happenings of the karaamaat, the charisma through the followers guidance of Allah&#8217;s messenger is true and these karaamaat as we said is an unusual event which Allah manifests through one of His auliya&#8217; for supporting a mundane or a spiritual matter.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And the difference between karaamaat and miracles, miracles mean mujizat implies that miracles is the claim of prophethood and messengership but karaamaat does not imply this.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And there are a number of points of wisdom and aims in the manifestation of karaamaat and the important among these are as follows:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>(1)</strong> They are like miracles which prove the perfection of the power of Allah and the dominance of His will. They are like miracles in the sense that whatever Allah wills, He is the Greatest performer of it. Allah has an addition to this methods and known causes other methods also which are beyond the access of the human knowledge nor can the human sense organs their reason.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>The story of the people of the cave</strong> (ashabul kahf) is one of such evidences, including that sleep that Allah imposed upon them for a long time along with protecting their bodies from being disintegrated.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Another of these is the <strong>provision being given to Maryam</strong> (alaihassalam), the daughter of &#8216;Imran, in the arches on which zakariya had left astonished and said &#8220;where do you get it from these provisions?&#8221; She said &#8220;from Allah.&#8221;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And likewise the fact Maryam becoming pregnant and the <strong>birth of Jesus alayhis salaam without a father</strong>.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And<strong> talking by Jesus while still in cradle </strong>and this did not occur only with Jesus, meaning there are those who spoke in the cradle other than Jesus as authentically reported in Bukhari and Muslim from the hadith of Abu Huraira (radhiyallaahu anhu) from the prophet (ﷺ) who said that three ones are only who spoke in the cradle, three only, Jesus is one of them.<br /><br />The second one: There was a man amongst the children of Israeel, his name was <strong>Jurayj</strong>, this man was praying one time and his mother came and called upon him, she needed something from him. So he talked to himself “shall I respond or shall I continue the prayers?” So she invoked and said “O Allah! don&#8217;t make him die until he sees the faces of the woman who solicits sex. And while he was in his place of worship a woman came and she talked to him into illegal sexual intercourse and he refused. So she went to a shepherd and asked him for the same thing and she seduced him into that.  She gave birth to a child and she went to say that this is the  child of Jurayj, so the people came to him and broke the door of his place of worship and brought him down, insulted him. So he went to make ablution and prayed to Allah concerning this child from this prostitute.  So He came to the child and talked to the child and said “Who is your father?” The child spoke in the cradle and said “the shepherd”. So everyone was amazed and astonished and they came apologised and said &#8220;we will build your place of worship from gold&#8221; He said &#8220;no, just build it from mud.&#8221;<br /><br />And the third one: one woman was suckling her child and this took place <strong>a woman from children of Israeel</strong>, a man who was on his mount passed by.  So she liked that man and said “O Allah! make my son like him this”, the child left her breast and directed himself towards the rider and said “O Allah! don&#8217;t make me like him” and then he came back to suckle. And Abu Huraira said: while the prophet was reciting the hadeeth to them as if I remember looking at the prophet ﷺ suckling his finger. Then a slave-girl passed by the woman and then she said “O Allah! don&#8217;t make my son like her” he left her breast and said “O Allah! make me like her”  So she talked to her child “why?” and he said that rider was a tyrant from the tyrants and this girl they say that she was a thief, stole certain things and that she committed adultery while she was innocent.<br /><br />So this hadeeth tells us of some of these karaamaat and from this we know that three spoke in the cradle Eesa (alayhis salaam), the child who spoke to Jurayj and this child of this woman from the children of Israeel.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Also from this is the story of the man in surah Al Baqarah whom Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ‎) made him die for a hundred years then resurrected him.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And the story of the three who from the children of Israeel who went to a cave and a huge rock came and blocked the entrance of the cave and they invoked Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ‎) each by his own righteous deed and Allah made the rock move until they had a clearance to leave and save them.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And there are many other instances and that the karaamaat exist in this ummah until Day of resurrection because of it is belief and righteousness.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Now if anyone comes up with an extraordinary matter, transcends the norm this can not be a purification for this person that he is a friend of Allah until his actions refer to the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah and it becomes evident that he is a follower of the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah openly and outwardly manifesting his Worship of Allah in accordance to the Sunnah.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The friends of Allah are true and existing and they have merits as in the hadeeth of Sahih Bukhari: Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ‎) says “<strong>whoever stand in enmity towards any of the auliya&#8217; then he is at war with Him (glorious and exalted be He)</strong>.”</p>



<p>The karaamaat of the auliya&#8217; are in fact the miracles of the prophets, for the auliya&#8217; receive these karaamaat by following the guidance of their prophets and acting accordingly.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The karaamaat of the auliya&#8217;, and now we know the definition of auliya&#8217;, it is that glad tidings in which Allah has given them in the world itself. The Bushra which is called tidings means every such thing which proves their being protectors, supporters, friends and having good end in here and hereafter.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">As we said earlier the karaamaat still exists in the ummah and will be found until the Day of resurrection and observation is the best argument to prove it.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The philosophers have denied the karaamaat of the friends of Allah even as they have denied the miracles of the prophets.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The Mu&#8217;tazila sect and some of Ash&#8217;ari sects have also denied the occurrence of the karaamaat claiming these are like miracles but this is a false claim as we have mentioned that it does not imply a claim of Prophethood in no way.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">One must remain vigilant from the <strong>Dajjal</strong>, the false liars of these innovators and the deeds of the misguided people and satanic show of  extraordinary occurrences who call themselves <strong>sufi</strong>, such as entering into the fire, striking one&#8217;s body with weapons, catching hold of snakes and foretelling about the unseen and so forth.These are not karaamaat. The karaamaat are performed by the auliya&#8217; of Allah and these are not the auliya&#8217; of Allah but these are shayateen in the form of men.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">We ask Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ‎) to protect us from all false Creed and all innovations and to guide the ummah to follow the path of the prophet ﷺ and the righteous predecessors.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left"><strong>Karamat-ul-Awliya’</strong><br />The fourth question of Fatwa no. <span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">9027 </span><br />The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><b></b><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Q 4:</b><b> Do the Awliya&#8217; (pious people) perform Karamahs (extraordinary events caused by Allah for or through a pious person)? </b>Can they change anything in the heavens or on earth? Do they intercede with Allah for others while they are in Barzakh (period between death and the Resurrection) or not?</span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span class="HarfBody"><b>A: </b><b>Karamah </b>is an extraordinary event which Allah (Exalted be He) bestows on a pious person as an honor to protect him against harm, benefit him, or help him defend people&#8217;s rights. </span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span class="HarfBody">But a pious person cannot perform these events whenever he wishes just as the prophet could not perform miracles by himself whenever he wished. It is Allah Alone Who helps them to do all these things. </span></p>



<p><span class="HarfBody">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:#000000;" title="Surah Al-`Ankabut, 29: 50" target="_blank" name="Andtheysay:Whyarenotsigns"></a>And they say: &#8220;Why are not signs sent down to him from his Lord? Say: &#8220;The signs are only with Allâh, and I am only a plain warner.&#8221;</span></strong></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span class="HarfBody">Also pious people are not empowered with any superiority to change things in the heavens or on earth except for what Allah enables them just like all other humans. They can make changes in things like farming, building, trading, and such works which ordinary humans do&nbsp;</span><span class="HarfBody">with Allah&#8217;s Will. In Barzakh, pious people cannot intercede for anyone whether alive or dead, as Allah (Exalted be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Say: “To Allâh belongs all intercession.&#8221;</span></strong></span></p>



<p><span class="HarfBody">Allah also says: </span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span class="HarfBody"><strong><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Zukhruf, 43: 86" target="_blank" name="Andthosewhomtheyinvokeinstead"></a><span style="color:#000000;">And those whom they invoke instead of Him have no power of intercession &#8211; except for those who bear witness to the truth knowingly (i.e. believed in the Oneness of Allâh, and obeyed His Orders), and they know (the facts about the Oneness of Allâh).</span></strong></span></p>



<p><span class="HarfBody">Moreover, He says: </span></p>



<p><span class="HarfBody"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His Permission</span></strong></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span class="HarfBody">Whoever believes that pious people govern the universe or that they know the Ghayb (Unseen), is a Kafir (disbeliever), as Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody">To Allâh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is therein, and He is Able to do all things.</span></strong></span></p>



<p><span class="HarfBody">Also Allah (Glorified be He) says:</span></p>



<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:#000000;" title="Surah Al-Naml, 27: 65" target="_blank" name="Say:Noneintheheavensandthe"></a>Say: “None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghaib (Unseen) except Allâh”</span></strong></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span class="HarfBody">Allah (Glorified be He) removes all ambiguity whatsoever and declares the truth in a clear-cut manner when addressing the Prophet (peace be upon him):&nbsp;</span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong><span class="HarfBody"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 188" target="_blank" name="Say(OMuhammad%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%89%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%85):"></a><span style="color:#000000;">Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;I possess no power over benefit or harm to myself except as Allâh wills. If I had the knowledge of the Ghaib (Unseen), I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth, and no evil should have touched me. I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings unto people who believe.&#8221;</span></span></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: An employee works at a company surrounded by more than three Masjids (mosques). He always offers Salah (Prayer) at the Masjid, but his colleagues offer it in the company. They urge him to join them rather than go to the Masjid. Some Muslim brothers advised him to offer Salah with them to preach and deliver lessons after offering Salah and also lead them in Salah, as he is the most knowledgeable of Sunnah, although one of their colleagues has memorized a greater portion of the Qur&#8217;an than him. Should he listen to them or continue to offer Salah at the Masjid, paying no attention to what they say?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The employees in this company should offer Salah in any of the nearby Masjids like their colleague, as he is the one doing the right thing by offering Salah at the Masjid, for the Sahih Hadiths (authentic Hadiths) reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) denote the obligation of offering Salah in congregation in the Masjid with regard to men. Accordingly, it is not permissible to miss congregational Salah in the Masjid except for a Shar&#8217;y (Islamically lawful) excuse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.<br />

<p>–</p>
<p>Allaah, Ta’aala, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">أُحِلَّ لَكُمْ لَيْلَةَ الصِّيَامِ الرَّفَثُ إِلَى نِسَائِكُمْ هُنَّ لِبَاس ٌ لَكُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ لِبَاس ٌ لَهُنَّ عَلِمَاللَّهُ أَنَّكُمْ كُنتُمْ تَخْتَانُونَ أَنفُسَكُمْ فَتَابَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَعَفَا عَنْكُمْ فَالآنَ بَاشِرُوهُنَّ وَابْتَغُوا مَا كَتَبَ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَكُلُوا وَاشْرَبُوا حَتَّى يَتَبَيَّنَ لَكُمُ الْخَيْطُ الأَبْيَضُ مِنَ الْخَيْطِ الأَسْوَدِ مِنَ الْفَجْرِ ثُمَّ أَتِمُّوا الصِّيَامَ إِلَى اللَّيْلِ وَلاَ تُبَاشِرُوهُنَّ وَأَنْتُمْ عَاكِفُونَ فِيالْمَسَاجِدِ تِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ فَلاَ تَقْرَبُوهَا كَذَلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُ آيَاتِه ِ لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَّقُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is made lawful for you to have sexual relations with your wives on the night of As-Saum (the fasts). They are body covering for you and you are the same for them. Allaah knows that you used to deceive yourselves, so He turned to you (accepted your repentance) and forgave you. So now have sexual relations with them and seek that which Allaah has ordained for you (offspring), and <strong>eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night)</strong>, then complete your Saum (fast) till the nightfall. And do not have sexual relations with them (your wives) while you are in I’tikaaf in the mosques. These are the limits (set) by Allaah, so approach them not. Thus does Allaah make clear His Ayaat to mankind that they may become Al-Muttaqun.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwas of the Permanent Committee&gt;Group 2&gt;Volume 2: `Aqidah&gt;The Sects&gt;Ahmad Deedat&#8217;s &#8220;Al-Qur&#8217;an the Miracle of Miracles&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa no. 19040</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Ahmad Deedat said in his book &#8220;Al-Qur&#8217;an the Miracle of Miracles&#8221; that Qur&#8217;an includes many references to the number 19 and its multiplications. He gave many examples and here are some of them: </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">&#8211; The word &#8220;اسم&#8221; (name) is mentioned 19 times in the Qur&#8217;an. </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">&#8211; The word &#8220;الله&#8221; (Allah) is mentioned 2698 (19 x 142) times in the Qur&#8217;an. </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">&#8211; The word &#8220;الرحيم&#8221; (The Most Merciful) is mentioned 114 (19 x 6) times in the Qur&#8217;an. </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">&#8211; The letter &#8220;ن&#8221; (Nun) is mentioned 133 (19 x 7) times in Surah Al-Qalam. </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">He also made reference to the study conducted by Dr. Rashad Khalifah in his book &#8220;Al-Qur`an Taqdim Mar&#8217;y li-Mu`jizah&#8221;. Here are some examples of the points he raised: </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">&#8211; The first Qur&#8217;anic revelation is composed of 19 words which include 76 (19 x 4) letters. </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">&#8211; The first Surah (Qur&#8217;anic chapter) revealed in the Qur&#8217;an includes 19 Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) and 285 (19 x 15) letters, etc. </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">Please give us your Fatwa (legal opinion issued by a qualified Muslim scholar) in this regard. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This study is among the fabricated falsities of a sect called Al-Batiniyyah Al-Baha&#8217;iyyah. It is based on glorifying the number 19. There is no doubt that this study is false, as it involves manipulating the Glorious Qur&#8217;an and distracting people from pondering  its true meanings.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li style="text-align:justify;">This malicious group holds many false beliefs such as some of its leaders claiming prophethood.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">Its followers believe in <strong>Hulul</strong> (a Sufi term meaning indwelling) and <strong>Ittihad</strong> (a Sufi claim of union with Allah), </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">deem Jihad (fighting in the Cause of Allah) to be unlawful and </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">call for the unification of religions plus many other things.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span style="line-height:1.5;">So, it is the duty of Muslims to beware of falling into this evil group and of being affected by its ideas or books. </span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">We ask Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) to save us from their plotting and to protect Muslims from their evils, for He is All-Powerful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 5: Is it permissible for a Muslim who believes in one God to participate in the wedding ceremonies of Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), and help them arrange such ceremonies on account of a blood or marriage relationship, or the like? Also, is it permissible to attend their funerals, without praying for their dead, and the burial? Is it permissible to sit and commiserate with them?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ans:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is not permissible to share in their occasions, which involve Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) or Bid`ah (innovation in Islam). </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Moreover, it is not permissible to follow their funeral processions; because this is a type of forbidden association with them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa no. 17727</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Some Arab newspapers and magazines dedicate pages to the horoscope, talking about zodiac signs such as Aries, Taurus, Gemini and others. They claim that people born under these signs will probably be moody because the zodiac conflicts a lot during this period. There are many things written in these pages, a copy of which is attached to the message and many Muslim youth read them. Please clarify the Islamic ruling on zodiac signs and your advice to Muslims and to those responsible for the magazines.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This is considered the same as <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>divination</strong> </span>used by fortune-tellers to inform people if they will be happy or miserable and if they should be optimistic or pessimistic. This is a prohibited idea dating back to the days of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance). It is not permissible to practice, follow or spread these ideas. It is even more misleading and misguiding to Muslims to spread such ideas in newspapers, as they involve claiming to know Ghayb (the Unseen), which is the sole Right of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) Who says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Say</strong>: &#8220;<strong>None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghaib (Unseen) except Allâh, nor can they perceive when they shall be resurrected</strong>.&#8221; <span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Al-Naml, 27: 65]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And with Him are the keys of the Ghaib (all that is hidden), none knows them but He. And He knows whatever there is in the land and in the sea; not a leaf falls, but he knows it. There is not a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything fresh or dry, but is written in a Clear Record.&#8221; </strong><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Al-An`am, 6: 59]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah even denied that His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) knew the Ghayb. <span style="line-height:1.5;">Allah says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="line-height:1.5;">&#8220;Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): </span>I don’t tell you that with me are the treasures of Allâh, nor (that) I know the Unseen; nor I tell you that I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me.</strong>&#8221; <strong>Say</strong>: &#8220;<strong>Are the blind and the one who sees equal? Will you not then take thought?</strong>&#8221; <span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Al-An`am, 6: 50]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And I do not say to you that with me are the Treasures of Allâh, nor that I know the Ghaib (Unseen), nor do I say I am an angel, and I do not say of those whom your eyes look down upon that Allâh will not bestow any good on them. Allâh knows what is in their inner-selves (as regards belief, etc.). In that case, I should, indeed be one of the Zâlimûn (wrong-doers, oppressors).&#8221;</strong> <span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Hud, 11: 31]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Anyone who acquires a branch of the knowledge of astrology has acquired a branch of magic (of which they acquire more as long as) they continue to do so.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) and Hadiths in this regard. Muslim scholars unanimously agree on this well-established ruling prohibiting astrology.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Thus, it is the duty of every Muslim seeking the best for themselves and their religion to avoid this form of manipulating people&#8217;s minds and beliefs, to fear Allah regarding themselves and their nation and not to spread misleading ideas among Muslims</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>On the other hand, Muslim rulers (may Allah grant them success) should prevent this practice and punish those who spread it according to the Islamic prescribed punishment.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q 5: Is it permissible for the Imam to perform Du`a&#8217; (supplication to Allah) after performing the prescribed prayer while all the people are still present?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Acts of worship are <strong>Tawqifiy</strong> (bound by a religious text and not amenable to personal opinion). Therefore, it is not legally permitted to say that this act of worship is permissible with regard to its origin, number, manner or place without legal evidence for saying so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not know any Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him) where he did this, either from his sayings, doings or what gains his consent. All blessings are in following his guidance. The guidance of the Prophet (peace be upon him) is established with authentic proofs that denote what he (peace be upon him) did after Taslim (salutation of peace ending the Prayer). The successors, the Companions of the Prophet and those who followed them in righteousness followed his example in this regard. Whoever innovates anything other than the guidance of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), his acts will be rejected. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He who did any act for which there is no sanction from our behalf, that is to be rejected</strong></span>.&#8221; [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Imam who makes Du`a&#8217; (supplication to Allah) after Taslim and the followers pronounce Ta&#8217;min (saying: &#8220;Amin&#8221;) after his Du`a&#8217; should be asked to bring evidence that proves his deeds. Otherwise, his acts will be rejected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, we will give an outline about the guidance of the Prophet (peace be upon him) after Taslim. When the Prophet (peace be upon him) pronounced Taslim, he used to ask Allah for forgiveness three times and say: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>O Allah, You are the Grantor of security, and security comes from You. You are Blessing, O You Who have majesty and nobility)!&#8221; </strong>[2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Awza`y was asked about the manner of the Prophet&#8217;s asking for forgiveness. He answered: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#000000;">He said: &#8216;I seek the forgiveness of Allah. I seek the forgiveness of Allah</span></strong>.'&#8221; This is the narration of Muslim, Al-Tirmidhy and Al-Nasa&#8217;y. But Al-Nasa&#8217;y said that the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to say that upon finishing his prayer, and then mentioned the Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the narration reported by Abu Dawud: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>After finishing his prayer, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) used to ask Allah for forgiveness three times and say: O Allah! You are Peace</strong></span>.&#8221; [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the narration reported by Abu Dawud and Al-Nasa&#8217;y on the authority of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<strong>When the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) pronounced salutation, he used to say: O Allah: You are peace, and peace comes from You, blessed are You, Possessor of Glory and Honor</strong>.&#8221;[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari and Muslim reported on the authority of Warrad the scriber of the servant of Al-Mughirah ibn Shu`bah that he said that Al-Mughirah ibn Shu`bah dictated to me a letter to Mu`awiyah that When the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) finished the prayer and pronounced salutation he uttered (this supplication): <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There is none worthy of worship (in truth) but Allah. He is alone, Who has no partner. To Him belongs the sovereignty and to Him praise is due and He is Potent over everything. O Allah! No one can withhold what You give, or give what You withhold, and the riches cannot avail a wealthy person with You. </strong>[5]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim reported in his Sahih on the authority of `Abdullah ibn Al-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: He used to say at the end of every prayer after pronouncing salutation (these words): <strong><span style="color:#000000;">There is none worthy of worship (in truth) but Allah. He is alone. There is no partner with Him. Sovereignty belongs to Him and He is Potent over everything. There is no might or power except with Allah. There is none worthy of worship (in truth) but Allah and we do not worship but Him alone. To Him belong all bounties, to Him belongs all Grace, and to Him is worthy praise accorded. There is none worthy of worship (in truth) but Allah, to Whom we are sincere in devotion, even though the unbelievers should disapprove it</span></strong>. <strong>He added: The Prophet (peace be upon him) used to say so after pronouncing salutation at the end of every prayer. </strong>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration reported also by Muslim the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#000000;">He who recites after every prayer: Subhan-Allah (Allah is free from imperfection) thirty-three times; Al-hamdu lillah (praise be to Allah) thirty-three times; Allahu Akbar (Allah is Greatest) thirty-three times; and completes a hundred with: La ilaha illallahu, wahdahu la sharika lahu, lahul-mulku wa lahul-hamdu, wa Huwa `ala kulli shai&#8217;in Qadir (there is no true god except Allah. He is One and He has no partner with Him. His is the sovereignty and His is the praise, and He is Omnipotent), will have all his sins pardoned even if they may be as the foam on the surface of the sea</span></strong>.&#8221; [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He who wants to know more supplications should read supplications in the comprehensive books like Jami` Al-&#8216;Ousoul, Majm` Al-Zawa&#8217;d, Al-Matalib Al-`Aliyah Bi Zawa&#8217;d Al-Masanid Al-Thamaniyah and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The first question of Fatwa no. 7425</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 1: There is a card which facilitates financial transactions in Western countries, as it helps a person to do without carrying cash with them. A person can purchase any goods they want with this card, then at the end of each month they receive a bill with the sum of money they have to pay for what they bought using this card, and they pay the full amount without any increase. This process protects one&#8217;s money from being stolen. But there is a condition for receiving this card. Depending on the terms of the card, one may pay interest charges for every day of delay on the amount that they do not pay within twenty five days. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible to deal with this card taking into account that a person can avoid dealing with Riba (usury/interest) if they pay the bill during the twenty five days grace period?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: If the reality is as you have mentioned, then such dealing is not permissible <strong>as this contract contains Riba (usury/interest)</strong> because you stipulate paying Riba in case of delaying payment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q: What is the ruling on some people who sway from right to left and backwards and forwards while reciting the Qur&#8217;an? Please advise, may Allah reward you.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Swaying while reciting the Qur&#8217;an is one of the habits that should be abandoned. It contradicts the etiquettes required when reciting the Qur&#8217;an. When reciting or listening to the Qur&#8217;an, a person should listen carefully and not play with things so that the listener and the reciter ponder over the meanings of the Qur&#8217;an and their hearts be submissive to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Scholars mentioned that this is one of the habits of the Jews when reciting their Book, and we are forbidden to imitate them.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the ruling on the blood that comes out of a woman outside the menstrual or post-partum period? Should she make up later for the days in which she experiences such blood during the daytime of Ramadan? </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fatwa : 19665</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q : Should the <strong>Hawl</strong> (<span style="color:#808080;">one lunar year calculated from the time a property reaches the minimum amount upon which Zakah is due</span>) for the Zakah (obligatory charity) on money and commercial commodities be considered according to the Hijri (lunar) year or the Gregorian solar year, as there is a <strong>difference of 11 days</strong> between both? Ifthe calculation of Zakah is made according to the Hijri year, what is the solution for organizations that issue their budgets and calculate their Zakah according to the solar year. Is it permissible to delay paying the due Zakah on commercial commodities beyond the Hijri year, as several contracting organizations delay the issuance of budgets six months after the passing of the year of Zakah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A : <strong>Zakah is due on property after the passing of 12 months according to the Hijri calendar</strong>.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">They ask you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) about the new moons. Say: These are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage</span>. [Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 189]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is impermissible to delay the payment of Zakah beyond the fixed time unless a legal excuse preventing the payment is verified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8230;pay the due thereof (its Zakât, according to Allâh’s Orders 1/10th or 1/20th) on the day of its harvest</span> [Surah Al-An`am, 6: 141]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) also says:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The third question of Fatwa no. 2442</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 3: <strong>What is the ruling on acting the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet, may Allah be pleased with them) in school theaters?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The Council of Senior Scholars previously reviewed this question and issued a decree as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Allah (Exalted be He) has praised and set clear the high status of the Sahabah. Thus, acting any of them on stage or on the screen is contrary to this Divine praise and is <strong>detrimental to the high status and honor</strong> which Allah has bestowed upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Representing any of them in this way <strong>exposes them to mockery and ridicule</strong>. Actors are usually people who have no room for righteousness, piety, and Islamic morals in their lives. Moreover, those who put on plays are doing so as a means to earn money, and no matter how much they try to avoid it, it will involve some lying and backbiting. Acting the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) may have an <strong>effect on their status in the hearts and minds of the Muslims, or diminish the reverence they have for them, and paves the way for arousing doubts in Muslims about their religion and disputes over the personalities of the Sahabah</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also necessarily implies that one of the actors will play the role of Abu Jahl and other disbelievers, thus he will have to <strong>utter words insulting Bilal, and insulting the Messenger (peace be upon him) and the Message of Islam</strong> that he brought. Undoubtedly, this is a great evil. This act may be targeted to confuse the Muslims about their creed, the Book of Allah and Sunnah of their Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. If it is claimed that this serves the interest of calling people to Islam and spreading noble Islamic morals and etiquette through showing exact biographies of those Sahabah is simply an assumption and wishful thinking. Whoever knows the real nature and aims of actors will realize that this kind of acting is in sharp contrast to the real nature of the actors, their standards, lives, and behaviors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. It is basically stated in the principles of Shari`ah (Islamic law) that <strong>if a certain matter is definitely or probably harmful, it will be forbidden</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">Acting the Sahabah may serve some interest, but the harm done by this is far greater than any good that might be achieved.</span> Accordingly, to protect those interests and ward off harm, and to preserve the honorable status of the Sahabah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), we must not allow that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings of Allah be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"> Fatwa no. 3828</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: I am a Muslim woman in my twenties. I was married about a year and a half ago and thanks to Allah, I had a baby six months ago delivered naturally. A week after delivery, I began to suffer from severe depression, which had never happened to me before. I lost interest in everything, even taking care of the baby. I went to a psychiatrist and took medication until recently, but it was of no use and I became tired of long treatment. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">I ask Allah that you find an Islamically approved treatment for my distress and psychological depression, or the best remedy, so that I can return to my normal state and take care of my husband and baby, and be able to manage the affairs of my home. I heard sometime ago the Hadith, which states: The water of Zamzam is for whatever it is drunk for. I hope from Allah, then you, to clarify the meaning of this Hadith. Does it apply to my psychological case, or is it only for physical diseases? If Zamzam water is useful, by the Will of Allah, in treating my case, how can I get it? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Put your <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>trust in Allah</strong></span> and <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>expect good from Him</strong></span>. Entrust your affairs to Him and do not despair of His Mercy and Benevolence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no disease for which Allah has not also sent down the cure. You should make use of means and continue to consult specialized doctors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Recite <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Surahs Al-Ikhlas, Al-Falaq and Al-Nas</strong></span> three times, blowing into your hands after each recitation and wiping your face and whatever parts of your body you can. Repeat this procedure day and night and before going to sleep.<span style="line-height:1.5;">Recite </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Surah Al-Fatihah</strong></span><span style="line-height:1.5;"> anytime of day or night, and </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong style="line-height:1.5;">Ayat-ul-Kursy</strong></span><span style="line-height:1.5;"> (the Qur’anic Verse of the Throne, Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:255) before going to sleep. This is the best Ruqyah (Qur’an and supplications recited over the sick seeking healing) to protect oneself from evil. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">You should also <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>appeal to Allah with the Du‘a’</strong> </span>(Supplication) to be said at times of distress: </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">لَا إلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ الْعَظيمُ الْحَلِيمْ، لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ رَبُّ العَرْشِ العَظِيمِ، لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا الله رَبُّ السَّمَوّاتِ ورّبُّ الأَرْضِ ورَبُّ العَرْشِ الكَريم</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="line-height:1.5;color:#008000;">La ilaha illa Allah al-`azim al-halim, la ilaha illa Allah rabbul-`arshi al-`azim, la ilaha illa Allah, rabbul-samawaati wa rabbul-ardi wa rabbul-`arshi al-karim </span>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="line-height:1.5;color:#008000;">(There is no god but Allah, the Most Great and the All-Forbearing. There is no god but Allah, the Lord of the Great Throne. There is no god but Allah, the Lord of the heavens and the earth and the Lord of the Noble Throne). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">You may also heal and protect yourself through the <strong>Ruqyah</strong> of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him): </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="line-height:1.5;color:#008000;">&#8220;Remove the affliction, O Lord of mankind, and bring about healing as You are the Healer. There is no healing but Your Healing; a healing that leaves behind no ailment&#8221; </span>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">There are also many other Adhkar (invocations and remembrances said at certain times on a regular basis), Ruqyahs, and supplications stated in the Books of Hadith and Al-Nawawy mentioned them in his book Riyad Al-Salihin and Al-Adhkar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for what you mentioned about <strong>Zamzam water</strong> and the statement of the Prophet (peace be upon him): <em><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Zamzam water is for whatever it is drunk for. </span></strong></em>[3] This Hadith was related by Imam Ahmadand Ibn Majah on the authority of Jabir ibn `Abdullah from the Prophet (peace be upon him). It is a Hadith Hasan (a Hadith whose chain of narration contains a narrator with an exactitude weaker than that of authentic hadiths, but it is still free from eccentricity or blemish) and general in application. What is more authentic than it is the statement of the Prophet (peace be upon him) about Zamzam water: <em><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>It is blessed; it is a food that nourishes and a cure for sickness.</strong></span></em> [4] (Related by Muslim and Abu Dawud; this is the wording of Abu Dawud) If you would like some Zamzam water, you can ask anyone performing Hajj from your country to bring you some.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Ruling on offering Salah without a turban</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Is it permissible to offer Salah (Prayer) without a turban? Is it permissible for the Imam (the one who leads congregational Prayer) to pray without a head cover? Is wearing a cap sufficient? Please support your answer with evidences. May Allah protect you. As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: There is nothing wrong with offering Salah without a turban because the head [with regard to men] is not included in `Awrah (parts of the body that must be covered in public), and it is not obligatory to cover it when offering Salah, whether the person praying is an Imam, a Munfarid (person offering Prayer individually), or a Ma&#8217;mum (person being led by an Imam in Prayer).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if wearing a turban is customary then it is best to do it, especially when offering Salah with others. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: <strong><em><span style="color:#008000;">O Children of Adam! Take your adornment (by wearing your clean clothes), while praying [and going round (the Tawâf of) the Ka‘bah,]</span></em></strong> The turban is considered a type of adornment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is well known that men who are Muhrims (pilgrims in the ritual state for Hajj and `Umrah) offer Salah bareheaded, because they are not allowed to cover their heads while in Ihram (ritual state for Hajj and `Umrah). Hence it is known that there is nothing wrong with offering Salah bareheaded. </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah guide all to acquire beneficial knowledge and act upon it! He is the All-Hearer and All-Respondent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Baaz Fatwas &#8211; <a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaSubjects.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;HajjEntryID=0&amp;HajjEntryName=&amp;RamadanEntryID=0&amp;RamadanEntryName=&amp;NodeID=3329&amp;PageID=1687&amp;SectionID=14&amp;SubjectPageTitlesID=23811&amp;MarkIndex=1&amp;0#ToofferSalah(Prayer)withoutaturban" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.alifta.net</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 10: Some people wear a turban, some wear a Qulunsuwah (cap), and many offer Salah (Prayer) with bare heads, I mean men. Which manner is the best in reward? We appreciate your advice, may Allah reward you with the best. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is desirable for a Muslim to wear his full garment when going to Prayer, the head cover included; because Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) enjoined His servants to adorn themselves when going to Salah. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <em><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O Children of Adam! Take your adornment (by wearing your clean clothes), while praying [and going round (the Tawâf of) the Ka‘bah,]</strong></span></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Besides, it has not been reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he offered Salah without a head cover</strong></span>. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>In fact, he used to always wear a turban, and the practice of Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the best guidance.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the ruling on some people who say: &#8220;O Allah, I worship You out of my love for You. If I worship You fearing Your Hell, let me enter it and if I worship You seeking to enter Your Paradise, let me enter Your Hell&#8221;? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Worshiping Allah just by loving Him is the Manhaj (methodology) of misguided Sufis, which is of their own invention.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Loving Allah is the highest degree of Ibadah (worship), but not the sole act of Ibadah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Manhaj of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream) is to worship Allah through love, fear, hope and other expressive forms of `Ibadah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Invoke your Lord withhumility and in secret</strong></span>.&#8221; [Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says about His Prophets:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Verily, they used to hasten on to do good deeds, and they used to call on Us with hope and fear, and used to humble themselves before Us.&#8221;</span></strong><span style="color:#000000;"> [</span><span style="color:#000000;">Surah Al-Anbiya&#8217;, 21: 90]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also says about the angels:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;And they stand in awe for fear of Him.&#8221; </strong>[Surah Al-Anbiya&#8217;, 21: 28]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded.&#8221; </strong>[Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 50]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) elaborating on this meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Some of our Muslim brethren hold birthday parties for themselves and their children, what is the ruling on such festivals? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The basic principle regarding acts of <strong>Ibadah</strong> (worship) is that they are <strong>Tawqifiy</strong> (bound by a religious text and not amenable to personal opinion), and as such, no one is allowed to worship Allah in a way other than which He ordained, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said in the Sahih (authentic) Hadith:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who introduces anything into this matter of ours (Islam) that is not part of it will have it rejected. </span></em>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (peace be upon him) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who does an action which is not in accordance with this matter of ours (Islam) will have it rejected. </span></em>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Birthday parties are an act of Bid&#8217;ah (innovation in religion) that should not be done for any person, regardless of their rank or role in life. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most honorable of all creation and the best of all Messengers (peace be upon them), i.e. Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdullah (peace be upon him) was never reported to have held a festival for the day he was born, or even instructed his Ummah (nation based on one creed) to celebrate it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, the best of this Ummah after its Prophet (peace be upon him) are the Rightly-Guided Caliphs and the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet), but none of them is reported to have made a festival for the Prophet&#8217;s birthday, or for any of them (may Allah be pleased with them), and all goodness is to be found in following their pathand patterning oneself after the teachings of the Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, such Bid`ah pave the way to<strong> imitate the Jews, Christians and other Kafirs</strong> (non-Muslims) in terms of their newly invented festivals. Allah is the One sought for help!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth question of Fatwa no. 8598</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 4: Does rolling up the sleeves count as part of the tucking up that is not allowed during Salah?If it is part of that tucking up, does the ruling differ if I start praying with my sleeves rolled up, meaning, I do not roll them up during the Salah, or does it make no difference?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>not permissible to roll up the sleeves or to fold them up before the Salah or during it</strong></span> to avoid that they will touch the ground when performing Sujud (prostration), because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, <span style="color:#008000;">I have been commanded to pray on seven bones and <strong>not to tuck up my hair or my clothes</strong></span>. [Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Q: I hear people saying that using Miswak (tooth-cleansing stick) in the Masjid is impermissible. Is this true?  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Using the Miswak is an affirmed act of Sunnah. It should be used when necessary upon performing <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Wudu&#8217; (ablution), Salah, reciting the Qur&#8217;an, changing the mouth smell</strong></span>, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It may be used inside or outside the Masjid, as no text supports the prohibition of using it inside the Masjid when necessary. Moreover, it finds further support in the general meaning of the following Hadith, “<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Were it not for the fear that it might be hard for my Ummah (nation), I would have ordered them to use Miswak for every Salah</span></strong>.” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, a person should be careful not to overdo the Miswak in the Masjid lest they should vomit or bleed in the Masjid.</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

Therefore, the word &#8216;Eid means a day that comes again like `Eid-ul-Fitr (the Festival of Breaking the Fast) or Friday, the gathering on that day and the acts done as acts of worship or habits on that day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: Anything that is meant to worship Allah, seek to be closer to Him to get reward through doing so or any thing meant to be similar to disbelievers and the like is a Bid`ah that is included in the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">He who innovates things in our affairs for which there is no valid (reason) (commits sin) and these are to be rejected.</span>&#8221; This Hadith was reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. <strong>Celebrating the Prophet&#8217;s Mawlid, Mother&#8217;s Day, and National Day fall into this category.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first one includes an act of worship that was not legislated by Allah. Moreover, it contains similarity to the Christians and other disbelievers. <strong>The second and the third are prohibited as it is imitating disbelievers</strong>. Whatever is in the interest of the Ummah (nation) and arranging its affairs as the Week of the Traffic, arranging the times of studying, holding meetings with employees to arrange work and the like are not acts of worship, they are of the innovated habits that are not included in the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;He who innovates things in our affairs for which there is no valid (reason) (commits sin) and these are to be rejected.&#8221;</span> Then, there will be no blame for doing so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fatwa no. 14777</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: I am a married woman with children and I am a practicing Muslim &#8211; all praise be to Allah &#8211; but my husband smokes<strong> Shisha (hookah, water pipe)</strong>. I have advised him, in vain, to give it up. In fact, he has sworn by Allah that he will stop smoking it, but he has not done so. After this, I took an oath by Allah that, if he did not stop smoking, I would go to my parents, but he has not stopped and I have not gone to my parents. What should I do with my husband? What is the ruling on the oath that I took? What is the ruling on smoking Shisha? I hope that you will answer my letter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <strong>First</strong>: smoking shisha is Haram (prohibited) because it is an obnoxious habit and includes many harmful effects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: It is Wajib (obligatory) on your husband to fulfill his oath and stop smoking Shisha.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: You have done well to advise your husband to stop smoking Shisha. You should continue doing so and make Du‘a’ (supplication) to Allah for Him to guide your husband.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the oath that you broke, you have to make Kaffarah (expiation) for it and you should not go to stay with your parents.The Kaffarah is to feed ten Miskin (needy people), to clothe them, or to free a believing slave. If you are unable to do any of these things, you should observe Sawm (Fasting) for three days.<br />
May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Ruling on smoking and using hookah &#8211; Shaykh Ibn Baaz</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the ruling on smoking and using hookah? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Smoking and using hookah are prohibited, because they contain evil and much harm. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) made lawful for His servants all kinds of lawful and good things and made unlawful to them all kinds of evil things, as He (Glorified and Exalted be He) says to His Prophet (peace be upon him): <span style="color:#008000;">They ask you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) what is lawful for them (as food). Say: &#8220;Lawful unto you are At-Tayyibât [all kind of Halâl (lawful-good) foods which Allâh has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables and fruits)]</span>. Surah Al-Ma&#8217;idah, 5: 4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says with regard to the description of His Prophet (peace be upon him): &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;he allows them as lawful At-Tayyibât (i.e. all good and lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods), and prohibits them as unlawful Al-Khabâ’ith (i.e. all evil and unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods)&#8221;  </span>Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 157</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No type of smoking is from the lawful good things, but they are from the evil things due to their much harm. They are not from the lawful-good things which Allah (Exalted be He) permitted; therefore, they should be abandoned and o<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>ne should beware of approaching them and should strive against his evil soul to avoid these evil things, because the soul persists in evil, except those relieved by Allah&#8217;s Mercy.</strong></span> It is the duty of the believer to strive against his soul to set aside whatever harms him from these and other evil things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A 2005 WHO report states that smoking using a waterpipe poses a serious potential health hazard and is not a safe alternative to cigarette smoking. The average hookah session typically lasts more than 40 minutes, and consists of 50 to 200 inhalations that each range from 0.15 to 0.50 liters of smoke. <strong>In an hour-long smoking session of hookah, users consume about 100 to 200 times the volume of smoke of a cigarette</strong>. The chemical compositions of cigarette smoke and hookah smoke are different, however, as the workings of the charcoal in the modern hookah causes the tobacco mixture to be heated to a lower temperature, as opposed to the higher temperature in a cigarette where the tobacco is directly burnt. Consequently, the potential health effects of hookah smoke are expected to be very different.<sup id="cite_ref-Saad_58-0" class="reference"><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa no. 20842</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Most mobiles have musical ring tones. Is it permissible to use these musical tones instead of the regular ring tone?  Could you kindly advise and direct us to what is beneficial for Muslims? May Allah reward you and protect you from harm! </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>not permissible to use musical tones</strong></span> on mobiles or other devices, because listening to musical instruments is prohibited as indicated by Shar‘y (Islamic legal) evidence. It is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>enough to use the regular ring tone</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The third question of Fatwa no. 6430</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q3: What is the ruling on a Muslim who boards a crowded plane and is forced to one of the following cases?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">1. A group of women surround him; two on each side, one in front of him and a fourth one behind him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> 2. He sits face to face with a non-Mahram (not a spouse or an unmarriageable relative) woman, Arab or other.</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> 3. He sits beside a non-Mahram woman who may be very old.</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> 4. His seat faces the flight hostess who sits in her seat for a short period after takeoff and before landing of the plane. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Sometimes, there are no empty seats left on the plane, or the passengers refuse to exchange seats so that the crew cannot do anything to help him change an inappropriate situation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ans</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>If traveling by plane is necessary and the cases you mentioned are inevitable, you should choose the case which involves less Fitnah (temptation) based on the rule of applying the lesser of two harms or evils. Additionally, you should lower your gaze as much as possible.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>However, if traveling by plane is not necessary and you have other alternatives, you should avoid that to guard your faith.</strong></span></p>
<p>May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: Is it permissible for a boy to sleep with his mother and his sister if he has reached the age of puberty?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is not permissible for boys who have reached the <strong>age of puberty or ten years of age</strong> to sleep with their mothers or their sisters in the same bed, out of protection of honors, to keep away from Fitnah (temptation) and block the means leading to sin. The Prophet (peace be upon him) asked us to separate the beds of boys and girls when they reach the age of ten in his saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;">Command your children to offer Salah (Prayer) when they become seven years old; beat them for (neglecting) it when they become ten years old; and arrange their beds (to sleep) separately.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Abu Dawud, Sunan, Book on Salah, no. 495; and Ahmad, Musnad, vol. 2, p. 187.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who have not reached the age of puberty yet, they are asked to take permission when entering the rooms three times when people put on light clothes and `Awrah (parts of the body that must be covered in public) most probably could be revealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;">O you who believe! Let your slaves and slave-girls, and those among you who have not come to the age of puberty ask your permission (before they come to your presence) on three occasions: before Fajr (morning) Salât (prayer), and while you put off your clothes for the noonday (rest), and after the ‘Ishâ’ (late-night) Salât (prayer). (These) three times are of privacy for you; other than these times there is no sin on you or on them to move about, attending to each other. Thus Allâh makes clear the Ayât (the Verses of this Qur’ân, showing proofs for the legal aspects of permission for visits) to you. And Allâh is All-Knowing, All-Wise. <span style="color:#666699;"> [Surah Al-Nur, 24: 58]</span></span></p>
<p>Those who have reached the age of puberty are required to take permission at all times.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;">And when the children among you come to puberty, then let them (also) ask for permission, as those senior to them (in age). Thus Allâh makes clear His Ayât (Commandments and legal obligations) for you. And Allâh is All-Knowing, All-Wise. <span style="color:#666699;">[Surah Al-Nur, 24: 59]</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All this is for the purpose of keeping away Fitnah, protecting honors and eliminating the means leading to evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for boys who are less than ten years old, it is permissible for them to sleep with their mothers and sisters in their beds, as they need care and to remove hardship. However, if there is no fear of Fitnah, it is permissible for them to sleep in the same room, even if they are adults, but each one on a separate bed.<br />
May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 12: A man has many children and lives with his family in a small room that hardly accommodates them. What should he do in order not to contradict the order of the Messenger of Allah that children should be separated in beds at certain age?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Having separate beds for children is Wajib (obligatory) according to one&#8217;s ability. The Muslim should strive hard to fulfill that. Allah (Exalted be He) said, So keep your duty to Allâh and fear Him as much as you can The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, When I command you to do anything, do of it as much as you possibly can.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.<br />

Translated by: Abu az-Zubayr Harrison &#8211; <a href="http://www.authentic-translations.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">authentic-translations.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: Some people these days call others to boycott American products and companies like Pizza Hut, McDonald’s, etc. So, should we comply with such requests? Are transactions like buying and selling with non-Muslims in countries at war against us permissible, or are they only allowed with those with whom we have peace?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Through what avenues does the Shaytaan find a way to make suggestions to man?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">There are many avenues;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He might try to incite someone to <strong>fornicate</strong>, for example. He first incites his victim to be alone with women, then to look at them, then to talk to them, then perhaps to listen to them sing, and so on until he achieves his end: when his victim fornicates.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Shaytaan may attack a person through his </span>stomach<span style="color:#000000;">, by tempting him into eating what is unlawful, into drinking <strong>alcohol</strong>, or even into taking <strong>drugs</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Shaytaan may find that a person has an inordinate love for owning things, so he biguiles him into gaining wealth through unlawful means:<strong> stealing, swindling, practicing usury, usurping, cheating.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He may find that a person has a great deal of <strong>pride</strong>, so he will encourage him to belittle others, to be haughty with those inferior to him in society,</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">and the list of Shaytaan&#8217;s tricks is endless.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">May Allaah send peace and blessings on Muhammad, his family, and his Companions.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">I have witnessed some of the Muslim youth fasting, but they do not pray. Is the fast of the person who fasts but does not pray accepted? I have heard some of the preachers telling these youth to break their fast and not to fast, as he who does not pray has no fast?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whomever the prayer is obligatory upon and he intentionally abandons it, rejecting its obligation, then he has disbelieved according to the consensus of the scholars. Whoever abandons it due to being lax and lazy about it, then he has disbelieved according to the correct opinion from the opinions of the people of knowledge. When it is ruled that he is a disbeliever, then his fasting and other acts of worship are nullified. This due to Allah&#8217;s statement: <strong>And if they had associated partners with Allah, all that they used to do would have been of no benefit to them</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However such a person should not be ordered to abandon fasting. This is because his fasting will only increase him in goodness and closeness to the religion. Also, due to the fear of his heart, it is hoped that it will lead him to return to the performance of the prayer and repentance from abandoning it. And success is from Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and his Companions.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">I borrowed 20,000 Pakistani Rupees, which were worth 7,000 Saudi Riyals at that time, from my brother. I now want to settle my debt, but the debt of 20,000 Pakistani Rupees is now worth 2,000 Saudi Riyals. Is it permissible for me to repay him with 2,000 Riyals or do I have to give him 7,000 Riyals according to the value when I borrowed it, or is it obligatory on me to give it to him in Pakistani Rupees, the same currency that I borrowed from him?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory on you to return the money that you borrowed from your brother in the same currency you took it from him, regardless of whether its value has risen or fallen against other currencies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You therefore have to give him 20,000 Pakistani Rupees, no more or less, for the 20,000 Pakistani Rupees you borrowed. You have to give him what equals its value at the time of the repayment in another currency, such as in Saudi Riyals or another currency, on the condition that it is done in one session. This is based on the answer which the Prophet (peace be upon him) gave to the inquirer who asked him whether it was permissible to sell Dirhams (a dirham of silver equals 2.975 grams of silver) for Dinars (old Arab coin that equals 2.975 grams of gold) or Dinars for Dirhams. He (peace be upon him) said, <span style="color:#008000;">“There is nothing wrong with taking them at the current rate so long as you do not separate leaving something to be settled.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions. The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<span style="line-height:1.5em;">We visited Abu Sa`id Al-Khudry in his house and while we were waiting for him (to finish his Prayer) we heard something under his bed. We looked towards the sound and found a snake. I jumped up to kill it, but he (Abu Sa`id Al-Khudry) gestured that I should sit down. I sat down and when he finished (the Prayer) he pointed to a room in the house and said: Do you see this room? I said: Yes. He said: There was a young man amongst us who was newly wed. We went with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) to take part in the Battle of the Trench, this young man used to ask for Allah&#8217;s Messenger&#8217;s (peace be upon him) permission to return to his family everyday at midday. One day, he sought permission from him and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) (after granting him the permission) said to him: Carry your weapons with you for I fear the tribe of Qurayzhah (may harm you). The man took his weapons and came back to find his wife standing between the two doors. He was hit by jealousy and made a dash towards her with a spear in order to stab her. She said: Keep your spear away and enter the house until you see that which has made me come out. He entered and found a big snake coiled on the bed. He darted with the spear and pierced it and then went out, but the snake quivered and attacked him and no one knew which of them died first, the snake or the young man . . .</span></span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> </span><span style="line-height:1.5em;">(Related by</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> Muslim </span><span style="line-height:1.5em;">in his Sahih (authentic) Book of Hadith </span><span style="line-height:1.5em;">&#8216;Refer to Mishkah Al-Masabih,chapter on [The lawful and the prohibited to eat]&#8217;)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>A: Firstly: </b>The Hadith is Sahih (a Hadith that has been transmitted by people known for their uprightness and exactitude; free from eccentricity and blemish) in terms of its Sanad (chain of narrators) and Matn (text).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Secondly: </b>Adam was created from clay in human form, then his offspring propagated. Jinn were created from fire then became living beings and were divided into males and females. The Prophet (peace be upon him) was sent to both humans and Jinn, some of them believed and some disbelieved. Humans can harm Jinn with or without knowledge and Jinn can harm humans, knock them down, or kill them just as a human may harm another human. A Jinny (a creature created from fire) may harm another Jinny. Indeed, whoever denies the power of Jinn while unaware of their condition follows that of which they have no knowledge and contradicts the guidance of the Qur&#8217;an concerning their power.</p>

We benefited one from the other, but now we have reached our appointed term which You did appoint for us.&#8221; He will say: &#8220;The Fire be your dwelling-place, you will dwell therein forever, except as Allâh may will. Certainly your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.&#8221;<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-An`am, 6: 129" target="_blank" name="AndthusWedomaketheZ%C3%A2lim%C3%BBn"></a>And thus We do make the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers) Auliyâ’ (supporters and helpers) of one another (in committing crimes), because of that which they used to earn.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Read also the Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) of Surah Al-Jinn for it tells you all about their form, actions, and the recompense of those who believed and those who disbelieved.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing strange about a Jinny hurting a human or inflicting harm on them just as a human may hurt a Jinny and inflict harm if the Jinny takes the form of an animal such as the one mentioned in the question and the Hadith related by<span id="ContentParagraph"> Al-Bukhari</span>on the authority of<span id="ContentParagraph"> Abu Hurayrah </span>(may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="AstrongdemonofJinncameto"></a>A strong demon of Jinn came to me yesterday suddenly, so as to spoil my Salah (Prayer), but Allah enabled me to overpower him, and so I caught him and intended to tie him to one of the pillars of the Masjid (mosque) so that all of you might see him, but I remembered the invocation of my brother Solomon: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Sad, 38: 35" target="_blank" name="Hesaid:MyLord!Forgiveme,"></a>My Lord! Forgive me, and bestow upon me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> so I let him go cursed. Generally, Jinn and humans are either Mu&#8217;mins (believers) or Kafirs (disbelievers), good or bad, beneficent or harmful but it is all by Allah&#8217;s Will as mentioned above.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Finally: </b>The Jinn world and forms are screened from humans. It is an area where we know nothing except what is mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an or Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet). We should believe in the truth conveyed in the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah with no doubt or denial. Similarly, we should refrain from interfering with what is unknown to us, for affirming or denying things that are unwarranted in the Qur&#8217;an or Sunnah is an act of ignorance which Allah (Exalted be He) forbids: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Isra', 17: 36" target="_blank" name="Andfollownot(Omani.e.,say"></a>And follow not (O man i.e., say not, or do not or witness not) that of which you have no knowledge. Verily! The hearing, and the sight, and the heart, of each of those one will be questioned (by Allâh).<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong style="line-height:1.5em;">Question</strong><span style="line-height:1.5em;">:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most people think that things were created from the light of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and that his light was created from the light of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They narrate, “I am the light of Allaah and everything is from my light” and also, “The first thing that Allaah created was the light of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).” Is there any basis for this?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They also narrate “I am ‘Arab without (the letter) ‘ayn, i.e., Rabb, and I am Ahmad without (the letter) meem, i.e., Ahad.” Is there any basis for this?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has been described as being light from the light of Allaah. If what is meant by this is that he himself is from the light of Allaah, then this goes against the Qur’aan, which refers to his being human. If what is meant is that he is light in the sense that he brought the Revelation by which whoever Allah wills of His creation is guided, then this is correct. The committee has issued a fatwa concerning this matter, as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has light which is the light of the message and guidance from Allaah, through which Allaah guides whomsoever He will of His slaves. No doubt the light of the message and of guidance comes from Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It is not given to any human being that Allaah should speak to him unless (it be)by inspiration, or from behind a veil, or (that) He sends a Messenger to reveal what He wills by His Leave. Verily, He is Most High, Most Wise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And thus We have sent to you (O Muhammad) Roohan (an Inspiration, and a Mercy) of Our Command. You knew not what is the Book, nor what is Faith? But We have made it (this Qur’aan) a light wherewith We guide whosoever of Our slaves We will. And verily, you (O Muhammad) are indeed guiding (mankind) to the Straight Path (i.e., Allaah’s religion of Islamic monotheism), &#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The path of Allaah, to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. Verily, all the matters at the end go to Allaah (for decision).”[al-Shura 42:51-53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This light is not derived from the Seal of the Awliya’ as some heretics claim. The body of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was blood and flesh and bone, and so on. He was created from a father and a mother, and had no existence before he was born. The reports which say that the first thing created by Allaah was the light of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or that Allaah grasped a handful of the light from His Face and that this handful was Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then He looked at it and it formed drops, and from each of these drops He created a Prophet, or He created all of creation from the light of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) – all of these reports and the like are not saheeh, and nothing like this has been narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the fatwa quoted above, it is clear that this is a false belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the report which says “I am ‘Arab without (the letter) ‘ayn, i.e., Rabb, and I am Ahmad without (the letter) meem, i.e., Ahad” – the attributes of Lordship (ruboobiyah, from Rabb meaning Lord) and Absolute Unity (Ahad meaning One) are attributes that belong uniquely to Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted. It is not permissible for any one of His creation to be described as “the Lord (Rabb)” or as being One (Ahad) in absolute terms. These are attributes that belong exclusively to Allaah, and are not used to describe the Messengers or any other human beings. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Ifta’ (Standing Committee for Academic Research and the Issuing of Fatwas).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 1/310.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it said that Allaah created the heavens and earth for the purpose of creating the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)? What is the meaning of the words, “Were it not for you, the universe [lit. heavenly bodies] would not have been created”? Is there any basis for this hadeeth? Is it saheeh or not? Please give us the facts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The heavens and earth were not created for the sake of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). They were created for the reason mentioned by Allaah in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is Allaah Who has created seven heavens and of the earth the like thereof (i.e., seven). His Command descends between them (heavens and earth), that you may know that Allaah has power over all things, and that Allaah surrounds (comprehends) all things in (His) Knowledge.”[al-Talaaq 65:12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the hadeeth mentioned, it is falsely attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and has no grounds for authenticity. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 1/312.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[Q.1]: How can we make <i>hijrah</i> (migration) for the sake of Allaah nowadays?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A.1]: </b>The praise is for Allaah.  <i>Hijrah</i> (migration) for the sake of Allaah means moving from the land of <i>Shirk </i>to the land of Islaam, as the Muslims moved from Makkah before its people became Muslim to al-Madeenah, because it had become the city of Islaam after its people had pledged their allegiance (<i>bay’ah</i>) to the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) and asked him to make <i>hijrah</i> to them. So <i>Hijrah</i> means migrating to join other Muslims. <i>Hijrah</i> may also take the form of moving from one land of <i>Shirk</i> to another land of <i>Shirk</i> where evil is less prevalent and there is less danger to the Muslims, as when some of the Muslims migrated from Makkah, at the command of the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>), to Abyssinia (Ethiopia).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah is the Source of Strength.  May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his Family and his Companions, and grant them peace. [1]<i></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[Q.2]: What are the necessary qualities that must be present in a country for it to be regarded as <i>daarul-harb</i> (land of war) or <i>daarul-kufr</i> (land of disbelief)?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A.2]: </b>The Praise is for Allaah Every land or region in which the rulers and those in authority uphold the limits set by Allaah and they rule their people in accordance with Islaamic <i>Sharee’ah</i>, and the people are able to carry out what Islaam has enjoined upon them, is considered to be <i>Daarul-Islaam</i> (the land of Islaam).  The Muslims in such lands have to obey their rulers with regard to that which is right (<i>ma’roof</i>) and be sincere towards them, helping them to take care of the affairs of state and giving them moral and practical support. They should live there, and not go to live anywhere else except to another place which is under Islaamic rule where they may be better off. This is like the case of al-Madeenah after the <i>Hijrah</i> of the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>), when the Islaamic state was established there, and like Makkah after the Conquest, when the Muslims took power there and it became <i>Daarul-Islaam</i> after it had been <i>daarul-harb</i> and it had been obligatory for the Muslims there who were able to leave, to migrate from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every country or region in which the rulers and those in authority do not uphold the limits set by Allaah and do not govern those who are under their care by the rules of Islaam, and in which the Muslims are not able to establish the rituals of Islaam, is <i>daarul-kufr</i> (the land of kufr). This is like Makkatul-Mukarramah before the Conquest, when it was <i>daarul-kufr</i>.  The same applies to any land in which the people belong to the religion of Islaam, but those who are in authority govern by laws other than those revealed by Allaah, and the Muslims are not able to establish the rituals of their Religion.  They have to migrate from that place, fleeing so that their religious commitment will not be compromised, to a land which is ruled by Islaam and where they will be able to do that which is required of them by <i>Sharee’ah</i>. Whoever is unable to migrate men, women or children will be excused, but Muslims in other lands are obliged to save them and bring them from the <i>kaafir</i> lands to the Muslim land. Allaah the Exalted says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>Verily, as for those whom the angels take </b>(in death)<b> while they are wronging themselves </b>(as they stayed among the disbelievers even though emigration was obligatory for them)<b>, they </b>(angels)<b> say </b>(to them)<b>: In what </b>(condition)<b> were you? They reply: We were weak and oppressed on the earth. They </b>(angels)<b> say: Was not the earth of Allaah spacious enough for you to emigrate therein? Such men will find their abode in Hell what an evil destination! Except the weak ones among men, women and children who cannot devise a plan, nor are they able to direct their way. These are they whom Allaah is likely to forgive them, and Allaah is Ever Oft Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.</b>” [Sooratun-Nisaa‘ 4:97-99]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>And what is wrong with you that you fight not in the Cause of Allaah, and for those weak, ill-treated and oppressed among men, women, and children, whose cry is: Our Lord! Rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors; and raise for us from You one who will protect, and raise for us from You one who will help.</b>” [Sooratun-Nisaa‘ 4:75]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But whoever is able to establish the rituals of Islam within his family and establish evidence against the rulers and people in authority, and bring about reform, making them change their ways, then it is prescribed for him to stay among them, because there is the hope that by staying there he may be able to convey the message and reform them so long as he is safe from temptation and <i>fitnah</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah is the source of strength. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling about having shares in companies and banks&#8217;? And is it permissible for a shareholder (in a company or a bank) to sell shares, specifically after he has become a shareholder himself, to offices dealing in buying and selling (stockbrokers)? And from that which is possible is selling them (the shares) for more than the price that the shareholder paid. So what is the ruling about the profit which the shareholder makes every year from the value of the shares bought?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Response</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having shares in banks and companies that trade in ribaa is not permissible. And if the shareholder wants to rid himself of any ribaa in his shareholding, then he should sell his shares at market value and take the initial investment only. The rest he should give in charity, and it is not permissible for him to take anything from the profits of his shareholding or interest. However, if the shareholding was in a company which does not trade in ribaa, then it&#8217;s profits are halaal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And with Allaah lies all success and may Allaah send prayers and salutations upon our Prophet (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam) and his family and his companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;"><strong>Question</strong>: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The Islaamic Bank has shares for sale and the value of each share is one hundred and ten US dollars ($110). And that which we have understood is that the bank in question does not trade in ribaa and that the money from the sale of the shares will be used in trading activities which are free from any dealings in interest. The profits will then be divided amongst the shareholders. So out of concern of falling into that which is impermissible, we request you to give a fatwa about whether this is permissible or not.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Response</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible to have shares in a bank which does not trade in ribaa, and the profits which accrue from these shares are the result of trading which is not haraam , so it is halaal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And with Allaah lies all success and may Allaah send prayers and salutations upon our Prophet (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam) and his family and his companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I hope your excellencies can advise us about using Saudi Net (debit) cards when buying items from stores in the following manner: When the total sale price is agreed upon, for example SR150 (riyals), the card is presented to the salesman who passes (&#8220;swipes&#8221;) it through a machine he has in the store. The (total) value of the transaction is then debited instantly by transferring the amount from the buyer&#8217;s account to the vendor&#8217;s account in the same instant, i.e. before the buyer leaves the store.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Response</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the matter is as you describe, then there is no harm in using the mentioned card, so long as the buyer has sufficient funds in his account to cover the required amount (of the sale).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And with Allaah lies all success and may Allaah send prayers and salutations upon our Prophet (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam) and his family and his companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> </b><b> Q 11:</b><b> What is the ruling on a person who performs `Umrah (lesser pilgrimage) before Hajj, although the former is only an act of Sunnah? </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> A: </b><span style="color:#008000;">The correct view of the two rulings of the scholars is that `Umrah is obligatory, because Allah states:Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 196<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" /><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#008000;"> And perform properly (i.e. all the ceremonies according to the ways of Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him) the Hajj and â€˜Umrah (i.e. the pilgrimage to Makkah) for AllÃ¢h. </span></a><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" />There are also other Hadiths narrated in this regard. If a Muslim performs `Umrah before Hajj during the months of Hajj and performs Hajj in the same year, then he has performed Tamattu` Hajj (combining Hajj and `Umrah with a break in between) which is better than the Ifrad Hajj (performing Hajj only) and Qiran Hajj (combining Hajj and `Umrah simultaneously) for the one who has not brought a hadiy with him. It is reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) told the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) who did not bring sacrificial animals:<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" /><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#008000;"> Make it `Umrah, for if I had formerly known what I came to know lately, I would not have driven the Hadiy with me and would have finished the state of Ihram along with the people when they finished it. </span></a><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" /></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The fifth question of Fatwa no. 9527<br />
Q 5: <span style="color:#993300;">How many Rak‘ahs (units of Prayer) are there in Salat-ul-Khusuf (Prayer on a lunar eclipse)? And what is to be recited in them?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">A: Salat-ul-Kusuf (Prayer on a solar eclipse) and Salat-ul-Khusuf (Prayer on a lunar eclipse) are each comprised of two Rak‘ahs (units of Prayer). Recitation in both Salahs (Prayers) is performed out loud. <strong>In each Rak‘ah, there are two Ruku‘s (bowing), the second of which is always shorter than the first, and there are also two recitations</strong>. After the Takbirat-ul-Ihram (saying: &#8220;Allahu Akbar [Allah is the Greatest]&#8221; upon starting Prayer), Surah Al-Fatihah and a long Surah are recited. After the first Ruku‘, Surah Al-Fatihah and a long Surah are recited, which is shorter than the preceding recitation. There are two Sujuds (Prostrations) in each Rak‘ah. This is the most authentic report mentioned regarding this Salah.</span></p>

</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: How should Salat-ul-Kusuf (Prayer on a solar eclipse) and Salat-ul-Khusuf (Prayer on a lunar eclipse) be performed? Is there any difference between them? What is your opinion on the reports published by the papers about the timings of a solar or lunar eclipse?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: There are authentic Hadith in which the Prophet (peace be upon him) showed how Salat-ul-Kusuf can be performed. He (peace be upon him) ordered that people should be called to it by announcing<strong> as-salatu jami&#8217;ah &#8220;&#8216;Gather for Salah&#8221;.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most authentic reports concerning this Salah show that it consists of<strong> two Rak&#8217;ahs</strong> and that in <strong>each Rak&#8217;ah one should make two recitations and perform two Ruku&#8217; (bowings) and two Sujud (prostrations)</strong>. The person should make lengthy recitation, Ruku&#8217; and Sujud. The first recital and Ruku&#8217; should be longer than the second ones. Similarly, the recitation in the second Rak`ah should be shorter than the second recital in the first Rak`ah. The person should make Ruku&#8217; in the second Rak`ah for a shorter time than the two Ruku&#8217; in the first one. During the second Rak`ah, the person should make a second recital and Ruku&#8217; for a shorter time than the first in the same Rak`ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the two Sujud, it is a Sunnah (recommended) to be lengthy providing that this does not cause any difficulty to the Ma&#8217;mums because this was the Prophet&#8217;s (peace be upon him) way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Upon completing Salah, the Imam, if he is knowledgeable, is allowed to give a <strong>sermon</strong> and tell people that the solar and lunar eclipse are two signs of Allah (Exalted be He) by which He frightens His servants. The Muslims, upon seeing it, are prescribed to offer Salah, remember Allah (Exalted be He), make Du`a&#8217; and Takbir, give in charity and emancipate a believing slave until the end of the eclipse. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, <span style="color:#339966;">&lt;&lt;Verily the sun and the moon are two signs among the signs of Allah by which He frightens His servants and they do not eclipse on account of the death or birth of anybody&gt;&gt;</span>. So when you see either of them, observe Prayer, and supplicate Allah (may He be Exalted) till it is cleared from you. Another narration reads, &lt;&lt;<span style="color:#339966;">So whenever you see them, haste to remember Allah, invoke Him and ask Him for forgiveness</span>.&gt;&gt; It is narrated in some Hadith that the person should give in charity and emancipate slaves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">The astronomical reports about the timing of the eclipse must not be taken as the basis for offering Salat-ul-Kusuf</span>. Some people of knowledge, including Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and his knowledgeable disciple Ibn Al-Qayyim, may Allah be merciful with both of them, supported this view saying that the astronomers may sometimes be wrong and then these reports are not reliable and people should not offer Salat-ul-Kusuf depending on them. Rather, they have to offer the Salah upon seeing the eclipse when it is happening.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The publications of the astronomers&#8217; reports about the timing of eclipse should be banned by the Ministry of Information lest some people should be deceived by them. These publications may make people feel less fear upon seeing the eclipse. Allah (Exalted be He) has made them to be frightening and hence, people remember, fear, invoke Allah, and treat their slaves well. May Allah grant us success!</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Eclipse Prayer can be done individually or in congregation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Do we have to pray Salaatul Khusoof (eclipse prayer) even if we do not witness it? And are there any specific ad&#8217;iyah (pl. duâaa) that we have to say in the day or during the eclipse?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer: The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم said: &#8220;The sun and the moon are two signs from the signs of Allaah. They do not eclipse for the death of anyone neither their life (i.e. birth). Allaah uses these to strike fear into His slaves. So when you see them offer the prayer and supplicate until the eclipse passes away.&#8221;[1] If someone establishes that an eclipse is present then he should pray the Eclipse Prayer (Salaatul Khusoof), whether he has to pray it individually or in congregation and similarly whether it is a man or a woman. It is performed as described in the Shareeâah (Legislation).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">When is the proper time for Du`a’ Al-Istikharah (supplication for guidance); before or after Taslim (salutation of peace ending the Prayer)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A: </strong>Du`a’ Al-Istikharah should be said after Taslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Page&amp;PageID=2603&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Page&amp;PageID=2603&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=7</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q14: When performing Du`a’ Al-Istikharah (supplication for guidance) in regard to an action or a need, is it conditional to have memorized the Du`a reported from Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) or is it possible to read it from a book after finishing Salah (Prayer)? After performing the Du`a’, how can it be known or felt that Allah (may He be Praised and Exalted) is guiding the supplicant to do or to abandon something? Please, advise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A: </strong>Whether you memorize the Du`a’ Al-Istikharah or read it from a book, it is accepted as the matter is flexible. What you should do is to strive to prepare your heart and attain Khushu` (the heart being attuned to the act of worship), and be sincere in the Du`a’. Afterwards, it is permissible to consult reliable and experienced people. When you feel that your heart feels at ease with one of the two possibilities, this is the sign that this is what Allah has chosen for you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and his Companions!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: Our Prophet (peace be upon him) taught us Salat-ul-Istikharah (Prayer for guidance); I hope that Your Eminence would point out to us the conditions concerning anyone who performs Istikharah in behalf of another person, if this is permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A: </strong>It is prescribed for every person to perform Salat-ul-Istikharah for themselves, and it is not permissible on part of a certain person to perform it in behalf of another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Page&amp;PageID=11384&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Page&amp;PageID=11384&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=7</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q 1: If one performs Salat-ul-Istikharah (prayer for guidance) before proceeding with an important matter such as marriage, applying for a job, etc. then begins to comply with the direction of such Salah (Prayer), can one be afflicted by evil or any calamity after that? If so, what must be done in this case?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A: </strong>Performing Salat-ul-Istikharah is enjoined for matters wherein a person is unclear. The aim of Salat-ul-Istikharah is to leave one’s affairs to Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted) and ask Him to choose what is best for one’s faith and worldly matters. However, if a person performs Salat-ul-Istikharah after which there is a negative result; it must be understood that this is for achieving a wisdom that Allah wills and that in the negative result there is real goodness.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Page&amp;PageID=11385&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Page&amp;PageID=11385&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=7</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: First, is it permissible to intend to pray Salat-ul-Istikharah (prayer for guidance) after starting to pray the Sunnah Ratibah (supererogatory Prayer performed on a regular basis) or Nafila (supererogatory) Salah such as Tahiyyat-ul-Masjid (two-unit-Prayer to greet the mosque)? Or Should my intention be specifically for offering Salat-ul-Istikharah only?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second, is it permissible to raise the hands while performing Du`a’ (supplication)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Third, is it permissible for me to offer Salat-ul-Istikharah for more than one matter?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fourth, is it permissible for me to perform Du`a’-ul-Istikharah (supplication for guidance) regarding the time of offering `Umrah (lesser pilgrimage), such as saying: “O’ Allah, if You know that there is goodness in my going to perform `Umrah on that night, and then state a certain time”; or is Istikharah itself not related to acts of obedience and their time of performance?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fifth, is it true concerning what people say that if a person offers Du`a’-ul-Istikharah, they will see in a dream or feel inner relief or abhorrence towards the matter for which they made Istikharah; then act according to what they feel assured about. What is the benefit in knowing that all goodness is in acting according to what results from Istikharah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allah with His Most-High Names and Most Beautiful Attributes to bless you and admit you to Jannah (Paradise) with the Prophets, the Siddiqûn (followers of the Prophets who were first and foremost to believe in them, like Abu Bakr As-Siddîq may Allah be pleased with him), the martyrs, and the righteous. And how excellent these companions were!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A: First, </strong>Salat-ul-Istikharah (prayer for guidance) should be independent, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: If anyone of you intends to do something, they should offer a two-Rak‘ah prayer other than the compulsory prayers…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second, </strong>It is permissible for you while offering Du`a’-ul-Istikharah to raise the hands, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to do so on passionately offering Du`a’ (supplication).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third, </strong>It is permissible for one to offer a single Istikharah for more than one matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth, </strong>As far as `Umrah is concerned, you should perform Istikharah concerning the time of performing it, not whether to perform it or not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifth, </strong>There is no validity to what is said that Istikharah is related to having a particular vision; rather, one should act upon the matter which one’s heart is receptive to, and vice versa. This is the correct manner to either go ahead with a certain matter or not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b><b>Q 9: Is it permissible to offer Salat-ul-Duha (supererogatory Prayer after sunrise) in four or six Rak`ahs (units of Prayer) with one Taslim (salutation of peace ending the Prayer)?</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> A: </b> salat-ul-Duha is an act of Sunnah (reported from the Prophet) and its minimum is two Rak`ahs and it has no maximum limit. However, it is preferable not to exceed eight Rak`ahs and to say Taslim after each pair of Rak`ahs. Furthermore, they should not be combined with one Taslim at the end, for the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:<a> The (optional) Salah (Prayer) by night and day should consist of pairs of Rak`ahs. </a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Salah of Al-Awwabin</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b><b>Q 2:</b><b> is there a Salah (Prayer) called the Salah of the penitent, and when is it offered? </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> A: </b>This was reported regarding Salat-ul-Duha (supererogatory Prayer after sunrise). Zayd ibn Arqam (may Allah be pleased with him) said that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) stated,<a> The Salah of those who are penitent is offered when your Fisal (weaned camels) feel the heat of the sun. </a>Related by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means at the time when the young camels&#8217; hoofs are burnt by the sun.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Waiting in the Masjid until the sun rises and then offering Salat-ul-Duha</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b><b>Q2: A man</b><b> sits in the mosque reading the Qur&#8217;an after praying Al-Fajr Salah (Dawn Prayer) until sunrise, </b>then he prays two Rak`ahs. However, some people denied his deed and said: It is impermissible, because it is the tradition of the worshippers of the Sun. Please, advise! Mat Allah reward you!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer2: </b>Whoever sits in the mosque reading the Qur&#8217;an and reciting the formulas of Adhkar (invocations and Remembrances said at certain times on a regular basis) after praying Al-Fajr Salah (Dawn Prayer) until sunrise is clear and the time when Salah is forbidden is over and prays two Rak`ahs or what he could, he indeed does a good and great deed. His act agrees with the Sunnah and is rewarded, God willing. In support of this, it is reported on the authority of Anas Ibn Malik: ()may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah said:<a> &#8216;Whoever prays the morning prayer in congregation then sits remembering Allah until the sun rises, then prays two units of prayer has the reward like that of Hajj and `Umrah.'&#8221; </a><b>rt No : 6</b><b>,</b><b>Page No:147</b><b>)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (May Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings be upon him) said:<a> ‘Completely, completely, completely’ </a>Recorded by Al-Tirmidhy who said: It is Hadith Hasan Gharib (a good Hadith that is strange to come from this chain of narration) from Sahl Ibn Mu`adh from his father (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (May Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings be upon him) said:<a> &#8220;If anyone sits in his place of prayer when he finishes the dawn prayer till he prays the two Rak&#8217;ahs of the forenoon, saying nothing but what is good, his sins will be forgiven even if they are more than the foam of the sea&#8221;. </a>Recorded by Al-Imam Ahmad and Abu Dawud. According to another narration:<a> His would be Paradise </a>The same narration is recorded by Al-Bayhaqy but he added in the end of the report:<a> “Hellfire will never touch his skin.” </a>The report has many supporting tarditions that back its authority and is also strengthened with the report of Jabir Ibn Samurah (may Allah be pleased with him) that<a> The Prophet (peace be upon him) used to sit crossed legged after the Fajr (dawn) Prayer in the same place in which he had prayed till the sunrise is complete. </a>Recorded by Imam Muslim in his Sahih (authentic) Collection of Hadith, Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhy, and Al-Nasa`y. The denial expressed by some people aginst his man is baseless denial and only ignorant people may deny this act.<b>(</b><b> Part No : 6</b><b>,</b><b>Page No:148</b><b>)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his Family, and Companions!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The best time for offering Salat-ul-Duha</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> </b><b> Q 1: It is narrated in a Hadith from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he said:</b><b> <a> Whoever prays the congregational Salah &#8216;Prayer&#8217; of Fajr &#8216;Dawn&#8217;, then sits &#8216;in the Masjid [mosque]&#8217; doing Dhikr &#8216;Remembrance of Allah&#8217; until sunrise, then prays two Rak`ahs &#8216;units of prayer&#8217;, receives a complete reward of Hajj and `Umrah &#8216;lesser pilgrimage&#8217;. </a> </b>My question here is whether these two Rak`ahs are considered a part of Salat-ul-Duha (supererogatory Prayer after sunrise) which is to be performed in eight Rak`ahs, or are they another independent Nafilah (supererogatory) Prayer?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> A: </b>The two Rak`ahs which are mentioned in this Hadith are considered a part of Salat-ul-Duha though they have special merit due to being linked to sitting in the Masjid until sunrise. on the other hand, the best time for offering Salat-ul-Duha is when it becomes very hot in the forenoon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Should someone who offers Salah then returns home and offers Salat-ul-Duha there take the reward of a person who sits in the Masjid?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b><b>Q: I usually offer Fajr (Dawn) Prayer in the Masjid (mosque) and after that I go </b><b>(</b><b> Part No : 6</b><b>,</b><b>Page No:149</b><b>)</b>home and engage myself in reciting the Qur&#8217;an until the shade of sun is as the length of two spears. Then I perform ten Rak`ahs with the intention of Salat-ul-Duha (supererogatory Prayer after sunrise). This is my habit everyday, Praise be to Allah. But one of my colleagues, may Allah reward him, brought my attention to the following: The meaning of the Hadith which reads:<b> <a> He used to sit in his praying place until the sun had risen </a> </b>Therefore, I ask Your Eminence: Shall I have the reward in this condition or should I sit in the Masjid? Could you kindly advise? May Allah reward you! As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> A: </b>Your recitation of the Qur&#8217;an and offering Salat-ul-Dhuha after the time of prohibition are good but what was reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) is that he used to sit in the Masjid after Fajr (Dawn) Prayer. Imam Muslim related in his Sahih on the authority of Jabir ibn Hamzah (may Allah be pleased with him) that:<a> Whenever the Prophet of Allah (peace be upon him) observed the Fajr (Dawn) Prayer, he used to set at the place of worship till the sun had risen enough. </a>This action is considered as extension to Salah because of what was authentically reported on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger (peace be upon him) said:<a> The angels ask for blessings on each one of you as long as he is in the place where he has prayed and has not discharged anything. They say: O Allah, forgive him and have mercy on him. </a><b>(</b><b> Part No : 6</b><b>,</b><b>Page No:150</b><b>)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Whether someone who leaves the Masjid after the Fajr Prayer to perform Wudu&#8217; again then returns to it should take the reward of a person sitting in the Masjid</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b><b>Q 2: If a person stays in the Masjid (mosque) to remember Allah after performing Fajr (Dawn) Prayer, then enters the state of minor impurity and goes to perform ablution, does his leaving the Masjid deprive him of the reward of doing Hajj and `Umrah (lesser pilgrimage) if he returns to the Masjid then offers Salat-ul-Duha (supererogatory Prayer after sunrise) as mentioned in the Hadith?</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> A: </b>If the person who sits in the Masjid after offering Fajr Prayer to make remembrance of Allah till sunrise enters the state of minor ritual impurity, then leaves the Masjid to perform ablution, returns soon to the Masjid without staying long outside the Masjid, then offers two Rak`ahs after sunrise, his leaving the Masjid does not deprive him of the great reward of offering this act of worship, that is, making perfect Hajj and `Umrah and entering Paradise, Allah Willing. The Hadith that indicates this is reported by Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) said:<a> Whoever offers Fajr (Dawn) Prayer in congregation then sits for the remembrance of Allah till sunrise, then offers two Rak`ahs (units of Prayer), will have the reward of making perfect Hajj and `Umrah)</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a>he added that Allah&#8217;s Messenger repeated the word &#8216;perfect&#8217; thrice. </a>Related by Al-Tirmidhy in (Al-Jame`) and he said, &#8216;This is a Hadith Hasan Gharib (a good Hadith that is strange to come from this chain of narration)&#8217;. Al-Tabarany related a similar narration with a good Isnad (chain of narrators)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Salat-ul-Duha for the traveler </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b><b>Q 2: Is it permissible for me to offer Salat-ul-Duha (supererogatory Prayer after sunrise) even if I traveled to one of the Arab countries and stayed there for a while?</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> A: </b>It is Mustahab (desirable) to offer salat-ul-Duha, whether you are a traveler or not, at least two Rak`ahs. It is to be offered from after the sun rises, until it reaches the middle of the sky.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Whether a traveler is obligated to offer Salat-ul-Duha </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b><b>Q 4:</b><b> is it permissible for a traveler not to perform Salat-ul-Duha (supererogatory Prayer after sunrise) </b>like other Nawafil (supererogatory prayers), or should it be performed while on a journey? Should one recite the Qur&#8217;an in Salat-ul-Duha audibly or inaudibly? How many Rak`ahs should be offered, and what is the best time for performing it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> A: </b>Salat-ul-Duha is a recommended not obligatory Salah, and it is not a Sunnah Ratibah (supererogatory Prayer performed on a regular basis). It is recommended in many authentic Hadiths reported from the Prophet<b>(</b><b> Part No : 6</b><b>,</b><b>Page No:152</b><b>)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(peace be upon him), but it was not established that he (peace be upon him) offered it on a continuous basis. It was authentically reported that<a> Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) offered four Rak`ahs in the Duha prayer and might add to them whatever Allah willed. </a>Narrated by Muslim on the authority of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her). The word &#8220;offered&#8221; does not indicate that the Prophet continuously performed Salat-ul-Duha based on what she (may Allah be pleased with her) said when<a> she was asked if the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to observe Duha (Salat-ul-Duha) prayer. She said, &#8220;No, only when he came back from travel. </a>Related by Muslim. The linguistic meaning of the word &#8220;offered&#8221; does not indicate constancy. However, this does not contradict her (may Allah be pleased with her) saying:<a> I have never seen the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) offering the supererogatory Duha prayer, but I offer it. </a>Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. In fact, she (may Allah be pleased with her) negated seeing Allah&#8217;s Messenger offering Duha, and performed Duha on the basis of what she knew of the reward of Duha and the act of the Prophet (peace be upon him). As a result, the wordings narrated on her authority are consistent. As for the number of Rak`ahs of Duha Prayer, it is from two to eight Rak`ahs. Also, it is not preferable to recite the Qur&#8217;an audibly while offering Duha. Concerning the time for offering Duha, there is a Hadith narrated by Zayd ibn Arqam (may Allah be pleased with him) that <b>(</b><b> Part No : 6</b><b>,</b><b>Page No:153</b><b>)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) said:<a> The Salah (prayer) of those who are penitent is offered when the weaned camels feel the heat of the sun. </a>Related by Muslim. The Hadith means the time when the hoofs of young camels are harmed by the scorching heat caused by the intense rays of the sun on the sand. It is reported in the Two Sahihs (Al-Bukhari and Muslim&#8217;s Books of Authentic Hadith)<a> that the Prophet (peace be upon him) recommended Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) to observe the two Rak`ahs of Duha. </a>As for the virtue of Duha Prayer, it is narrated in Sahih Muslim that the Prophet (peace be upon him) advised Abu Ad-Darda&#8217; (may Allah be pleased with him) to offer it, as well as Muslim&#8217;s narration on the authority of Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:<a> Each morning, there is a charity due from every bone in the body of every one of you. Each utterance of Allah&#8217;s glorification (i.e. Subhana Allah) is an act of charity, every utterance of praise (i.e. Al-hamdu-lillah) is an act of charity, every utterance of affirmation of His Oneness (i.e. La Ilaha Illa Allah) is an act of charity, every utterance of affirmation of His Greatness (i.e. Allahu Akbar) is an act of charity, and enjoining right and forbidding evil is an act of charity. It suffices for all of this to offer two Rak`ahs of Duha. </a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Salah of Al-Awwabin</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b><b>Q 5: Is there a two-Rak‘ahs Salah (two-unit-Prayer) called the Salah of Al-Awwabin (Prayer of the Oft-Repentant) that is performed after the supererogatory Salah for the Maghrib (Sunset) Prayer? Surahs Al-Fatihah and Al-Zalzalah are recited in each Rak‘ah (unit of Prayer) 15 times and those who perform it regularly are recorded among Al-Awwabin (the oft-repentant). May Allah grant you a long life!</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> A: </b> salah of Al-Awwabin is Salat-ul-Duha (supererogatory Prayer after sunrise), which is performed (at the time of the day) when the sun’s heat becomes intense. It was authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said,<a> “The Salah of Al-Awwabin is when the feet of young camels are scalded (by the heat of sand).” </a>It signifies the time when the sand heated by the sun becomes unbearably hot for the feet of young camels. As for offering Salah after the supererogatory Salah for the Maghrib Prayer in which Surahs Al-Fatihah and Al-Zalzalah are recited 15 times, we know of no basis for this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, and his family and Companions!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Salah of Al-Awwabin</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b><b>Q: We heard that after the Maghrib (Sunset) Prayer, there is a two-Rak`ah (units of Prayer) Salah offered called &#8220;Salah of the penitent&#8221;. Is it a Sunnah (supererogatory act of worship following the example of the Prophet)? How is it offered? </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> A: </b> the Sunnah Ratibah (supererogatory Prayer performed on a regular basis) offered after the Maghrib Prayer is two Rak`ahs, and then a person may offer any number of Rak`ahs they like. As for the two-Rak`ah Salah called &#8220;Salah of the penitent&#8221;, it is groundless.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">it rather refers to Salat-ul-Duha (supererogatory Prayer after sunrise) which is offered when it becomes too hot, according to the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him),<a> The Salah of the penitent is offered when your Fisal (weaned camels) feel the heat of the sun. </a>Related by Muslim in his Sahih (authentic) Book of Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong style="line-height:1.5em;">Question</strong><span style="line-height:1.5em;">:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a particular group in Pakistan called the ((Braylwiyyah)) or ((Jamaa&#8217;ah Nuwaaree)) which is a reference to their current leader known as ((Nuwaaree)). I ask your excellencies the Sharee&#8217;ah ruling regarding them and their &#8216;aqeedah, and the prayer behind them as this is a contentious issue which many people are unaware of the reality. I will mention some of their defective ways and beliefs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) The belief that the Messenger of Allaah (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam) is alive;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) The belief that the Messenger of Allaah (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam) is present and all-seeing, especially immediately after Salaat al-Jumu&#8217;ah;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3) The belief that the Messenger (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam) is the foremost intercessor;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4) They believe in &#8220;saints&#8221; and the dead in their graves, and they offer salaah at the graves requesting them for their needs to be met;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5) Their commendation of domes and lighting up of graves;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6) Their saying ((Yaa Rasool, Yaa Muhammad (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam)));</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7) Their hatred towards whoever loudly says ((Aameen)) and raises his hands in the salaah, considering such a person to be a Wahhaabee;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8) Their great astonishment at the use of the miswaak before the salaah;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9) Kissing the thumbs whilst doing wudhoo., the adhaan and after the salaah;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10) After the salaah, their imaam repeating the aayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{Allaah sends His prayers on the Prophet and also His angels too}, [Soorah al-Ahzaab, Aayah 56].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11) They gather after the Salaat al-Jumu&#8217;ah standing and reciting anaasheed and sending praises (to the Prophet (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam));</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12) After they complete the Noble Qur.aan in the Salaat at-Taraaweeh in the month of Ramadhaan, they prepare alot of food and distribute it in the dining area of the masjid, in addition to sweets;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13) They build masaajid and seek much importance in decorating them, writing ((Yaa Muhammad)) above the mihraab (standing place of the imaam);</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14) They consider themselves the people of the Sunnah and correct &#8216;aqeedah and that (all) others are in error;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15) What is the Sharee&#8217;ah ruling regarding performing the salaah behind them (their imaam), considering I am a medical student in Karachi and live next door to the masjid where they are in (overall) control (i.e. their beliefs and practices prevail)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Response</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever has these characteristics and attributes, then it is not permissible to offer your salaah behind them (their imaam), and whoever knows of their condition, then their salaah is not correct. This is because most of their characteristics and attributes are of kufr and bid`ah which negate the tawheed (oneness) with which Allaah had sent His messenger and revealed in His Book, and that which conflicts with the Qur.aan, such as His (Subhaanahu wa Ta&#8217;aala) saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{Verily, you (Muhammad) will die and verily, they (too) will die}, [Soorah az-Zumar, Aayah 30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{And the mosques are for Allaah (alone), so invoke not anyone along with Allaah}, [Soorah al-Jinn, Aayah 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And their bid`ah which they practice should be detested with good manners, and if they accept (and leave these pratices) then all praise is for Allaah (alone); And if they do not accept (and continue in these practices) then you should leave them and offer your salaah in the masjid of the Ahlus-Sunnah. And in this, with respect to Ibraaheem (alayhis-salaam) there is a good example:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{And I shall turn away from you and from those whom you invoke besides Allaah. And I shall call on my Lord; and I hope that I shall not be unblest in my invocation to my Lord}, [Soorah Maryam, Aayah 48].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And with Allaah lies all success and may Allaah send prayers and salutations upon our Prophet (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam) and his family and his companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sajdat al-Shukr is prescribed for anything that makes one happy, whether it is attaining some benefit or warding off some harm.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The evidence (daleel) for this is to be found in the Ahaadeeth and Aathaar (reports). Among the Ahaadeeth is the Hadeeth of Abu Bakrah (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) heard any news that made him glad, he would fall down prostrating to Allaah, may He be exalted. (Reported by the five except al-Nisaa’i; al-Tirmidhi said, it is hasan ghareeb). According to the version narrated by Ahmad: he saw the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), when news reached him that his troops had prevailed over their enemy, he was lying with his head in ‘Aa’ishah’s lap, then he got up and fell in prostration. (Reported by Ahmad, 5/45; al-Haakim, 4/291).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another hadeeth is that narrated by ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn ‘Awf, who said: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went out to the place where the sadaqah (charitable donations) was kept, then he faced the Qiblah and fell in prostration, remaining like that for a long time. Then he raised his head and said, “Jibreel came to me with good news, he said, ‘Allaah says to you, “Whoever sends blessings on you, I will send blessings on him, and whoever sends greetings of peace to you, I will send greetings of peace to him,”’ so I prostrated in thankfulness to Allaah.” (Narrated by Ahmad. Al-Mundhiri said: the hadeeth of Sajdat al-Shukr came from the hadeeth of al-Baraa’ with a saheeh isnaad, and from the hadeeth of Ka’b ibn Maalik and others.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reports include the following:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) prostrated when he heard the news that Musaylimah had been killed. (Reported by Sa’eed ibn Mansoor in his <i>Sunan</i>).</li>
<li>‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib prostrated when he found Dhu’l-Thadiyah among the Khawaarij. (Reported by Ahmad in <i>al-Musnad</i>)</li>
<li>Ka’b ibn Maalik prostrated at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he was given the glad tidings that Allaah had accepted his repentance. (The story is agreed upon)</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah is the source of strength. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah Li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Iftaa’, 7/266</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: How should sujud-ul-shukr (Prostration of Thankfulness to Allah) be performed? When is it Mustahab (desirable) to be performed? In addition, what is the Du`a&#8217; (Supplication) to be said in it? Please provide us with a detailed and complete clarification.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Sujud-ul-Shukr is enjoined to be performed by a person whenever they are blessed with a grace that they waited and longed for, or when they get rid of a distress or a misfortune that afflicted them or was about to do so. In such cases, it is Sunnah (a commendable act) that the concerned person makes one Sujud (prostration) in which they are to glorify Allah and thank Him. Finally, Wudu&#8217; (ablution) is not a condition for the validity of Sujud-ul-Shukr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa from Permanent Commitee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">source: alifta.net</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 2: does Tawakkul (putting one’s trust in Allah) negate du`a&#8217; (supplication)? That is to say, &#8220;Can a Muslim slave put his trust in Allah without performing Du`a&#8217; citing this Hadith Qudsy (Revelation from Allah in the Prophet&#8217;s words) which says &#8220;Whoever is occupied with My Dhikr rather than seeking My Grace, I shall give him/her the best I give to the seekers.” What is meant by &#8220;My Dhikr&#8221;? Does it mean the Holy Qur&#8217;an? And what is meant by &#8220;seeking My Grace&#8221;? The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, Whoever does not ask Allah,surely Allah will be angry with him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is what is meant by this Hadith. My question is, &#8220;Can we combine Du`a&#8217; with Tawakkul? Actually, I have been confused between the Hadith Qudsy and the Prophetic Hadith mentioned above. What is deemed preferable, asking Allah or being busy with Dhikr rather than asking Him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: First of all, This Hadith is related by Al-Tirmidhy in His Jami`, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Al-Hasan ibn Abu Yazid Al-Hamadany from `Amr ibn Qays from `Atiyyah from Abu Sa`id Al-Khudry who reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) as saying, Allah (Glory be to Him) says, &#8220;Whoever is occupied with the Qur&#8217;an rather than remembering Me and seeking My Grace, I shall give him/her the best I give to the seekers. Indeed, the superiority of Allah&#8217;s Word over that of man is to equal to His superiority over His creation. This Hadith is Da`if (a Hadith that fails to reach the status of Hasan, due to a weakness in the chain of narration or one of the narrators) as the chain of its narrators includes `Atiyyah Al-`Awfy and Muhammad ibn Al-Hasan ibn Abu Yazid, who are considered as weak narrators.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Abu Hatim Al-Razy said, &#8220;This is a Hadith Munkar (rejected Hadith reported by a weak narrator whose narration conflicts with an authentic Hadith).&#8221; Al-Hafizh Al-Dhahaby said, &#8220;Al-Tirmidhy tried to raise it to the rank of Hasan, but it is not considered as Hadith Hasan.&#8221; The Hadith was also related by Al-Darimy in his Sunan and Al-Tabarany in his book &#8220;The Du`a&#8217; (supplication)&#8221; and Al-Bayhaqy in Al-Asma&#8217; wa Al-Sifat (Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes). It was also mentioned by Ibn Al-Jawzy in &#8220;Al Mawdu`at&#8221; (fabricated Hadith); Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly, Many texts in the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah have recommended Du`a&#8217; urging its performance to the extent of describing it as the core of worship. Allah (may He be Exalted) said, Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 186 And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright. Allah (may He be Praised) also said,Surah Ghafir, 40: 60 And your Lord said: “Invoke Me, [i.e. believe in My Oneness (Islâmic Monotheism) and ask Me for anything] I will respond to your (invocation). Verily, those who scorn My worship [i.e. do not invoke Me, and do not believe in My Oneness, (Islâmic Monotheism)] they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!&#8221; In addition, there are many other relevant Qur&#8217;anic verses. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, Du`a&#8217; (Supplication) is itself the worship. Related by As-hab-ul-Sunan (authors of Hadith compilations classified by jurisprudential themes) through an authentic Sanad (chain of narration). Du`a&#8217; is not in conflict with Tawakkul, as the former denotes application of the means. Whoever thinks that Tawakkul means deserting Du`a&#8217; is fabricating lies against Shari`ah, the same as the one who thinks that Tawakkul can be a substitute for the application of the means, like selling, purchasing, cultivating in addition to other means. What is lawful for every Muslim is combining Tawwakul with pursuing the rightful and permissible means. In Allah Alone we seek help.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b style="line-height:1.5em;">Fatwa no.</b><b> 2798:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: If Tawakkul (putting trust in Allah) does not mean that you should jump into a pool of water while you cannot swim, nor put yourself in danger by a physical movement without previous training, nor sit in a room full of insects without using insecticide and expose oneself to affliction of a disease, nor leave a drawer opened exposing its contents to loss, then what is the meaning of Tawakkul? We appreciate your guidance, and many thanks to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>A: </b>Tawakkul means that a person should put their trust in Allah (may He be Exalted) Alone. It is an obligatory act and one of the tenets of Iman (faith). Allah (may He be Exalted) says:Surah Al-Ma&#8217;idah, 5: 23<a> &#8230; and put your trust in Allâh if you are believers indeed. </a>Tawakkul is one of the powerful moral means helping to achieve goals and fulfill purposes. However, a Muslim should combine it with other means, whether they are acts of `Ibadah (worship) like Du`a&#8217; (supplication), Salah (Prayer), Sadaqah (voluntary charity) or maintaining the ties of kinship, or other material means which Allah has predestined that their effects follow from their causes like the examples mentioned by the questioner here. We should have Tawakkul to follow the way of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) in this regard as he was the best person who had Tawakkul. He used to consider other appropriate material means along with his Tawakkul. So, whoever ignores the material means thinking that it is sufficient for them to have Tawakkul, contradict the way of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him). This type of Tawakkul is not permissible. Rather, it is recklessness and not a Shar`y (Islamically lawful) Tawakkul.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Question:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Please explain this <i>Hadeeth</i> so that we have a correct understanding of it: لو أنكم كنتم توكلون على الله حق توكله لرزقكم كما يرزق الطير تغدو خماصا وتروح بطانا <i>&#8220;Were you to depend upon Allaah with true dependence, He would have provided for you like He provides for the bird; early in the morning he leaves hungry, but returns at the end of the day with a full stomach.&#8221;</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <i>Hadeeth</i> from &#8216;Umar, may Allaah be pleased with him, that the Prophet (sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">لو أنكم كنتم توكلون على الله حق توكله لرزقكم كما يرزق الطير تغدو خماصا وتروح بطانا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;Were you to depend upon Allaah with true dependence, He would have provided for you like He provides for the bird; early in the morning he leaves hungry, but returns at the end of the day with a full stomach.&#8221;</i> (At-Tirmithi no. 2344, Ibn Majah no.4I64, Ahmad 1/30,52, Ibn Hibban no. 2548 and Al-Hakim 4/318)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">was recorded by Imam Ahmad, At-Tirmithi, An-Nisa&#8217;i, Ibn Majah, Ibn Hibban, and Al-Hakim, and At-Tirmithi said, &#8220;This <i>Hadeeth</i> is <i>Hasan Sahih</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The (Arabic) word (in the <i>Hadeeth</i> is) &#8220;<i>Tawakkul</i>,&#8221; means to depend sincerely in one&#8217;s heart upon Allaah Almighty, for bringing blessings and warding off harms, for this world and the Hereafter. If people were to sincerely trust and depend upon Allaah to bring them that which benefits them and to keep away that which harms them, and if they take reasonable, practical steps themselves, Allaah will send their provision to them by the simplest of means. Just as Allaah Almighty gives the bird provision when it simply leaves in the morning, seeking its sustenance, and returns at the end of the day. Yes, it does go out to search, but it is an easy effort. <i>Tawakkul</i> in reality does not deny actually working and striving for provision, for Allaah Almighty has decreed that we should work and it is from His ways that he gives people when they strive. In fact, Allaah Almighty ordered us to both depend upon Him and to work, to take the necessary steps needed to achieve our goals, and so the act of striving for our sustenance is an act of physical worship while trusting and depending upon Allaah is faith in Him. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَعلَى اللّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>&#8220;And in Allaah let believers put their Trust&#8221;</i></b> [Ibrahim 14:11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He made <i>Tawakkul</i> like <i>Taqwa</i> which is to establish the means that have been ordered, while depending upon Allaah. Dependence without working and striving is mere impotence, even though, when one does this, he may appear to depend on Allaah to a certain degree. No one, then, should transform his trust into mere impotence and weakness. One should rather deem his trust in Allaah to be like working and striving: it is one of the necessary steps one must take to achieve his goal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And with Allaah is the facilitation to do what is right. May Allaah send peace and blessings upon Muhammad, his family, and his Companions</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Seeking Blessings from Graves</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible to stand or sit by a grave for supplication in favour of the deceased?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The purpose of the legitimate visitation to graves is <strong>to get a lesson</strong>, <strong>remember death and heed</strong>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not for seeking blessings from the buried</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When one enters a cemetery he should greet the dead saying: <em>As-Salaamu Alaikum, O people of this place, believers and Muslims, and we will &#8211; if Allah wills &#8211; follow you. We ask Allah safety for ourselves and yourselves</em>.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One may also recite other supplication in favour of the dead that are recommended by the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> But he should not ask the dead people to fulfil his needs, seek relief or benefit from them.</strong> Supplication alone is an act of worship which must be dedicated to Allah alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">There is not harm however, in standing or sitting by the grave while supplicating, but not for seeking blessings or taking rest.</span> Graveyards are not resting places or residential area for people to sit in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is legitimate to stand by the grave areas right after burial to supplicate in favour of the buried asking Allah to confirm him and forgive him. It is authentically reported that <span style="color:#008000;">whenever the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) buried a dead, he would stand by his grave and say: Ask Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for your brother, and ask him to make him give firm answers, for right now he is being questioned.</span>[2]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">We joined a karate club in America, and when our trainer told us that we had to bow to him after he bowed to us, we refused, explaining to him that we couldn&#8217;t because of our religion. He accepted our excuse but then he said that we had to bow our heads at least. He said that since he began the greeting by bowing, we had to respond. What is the ruling in this issue?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To greet somebody by bowing is unlawful, regardless whether that person is a Muslim or a disbeliever, and <strong>regardless whether you bow with our entire upper body or with your head only</strong>. This is because bowing is a kind of worship, and worship is for Allaah Almighty alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah send peace and blessing upon Muhammad, his family, and his Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Q 4: <span style="color:#993300;">Is it true that a person who testifies that Allah is the Creator and Provider,and that Muhammad (peace be upon him) is Allah&#8217;s Messenger, and performs Salah (Prayer) is a Muslim even if they make Sujud (Prostration) to their shaykh and offer sacrifices for people other than Allah?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Making Sujud and sacrificing for anyone other than Allah is Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). People who indulge in any of these practices after being aware of the ruling of doing so, are Mushriks (people who associate others with Allah in worship) and Kafirs (disbelievers). Allah will not accept any of their deeds even if they offer Sawm (Fast) and Salah. Deeds of Mushriks are rejected. Moreover, if they die in this case, Allah will not forgive them.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, Allâh forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with Allâh, then Allâh has forbidden Paradise to him, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers) there are no helpers</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> But if they had joined in worship others with Allâh, all that they used to do would have been of no benefit to them. But if they return to Allah in sincere Tawbah (repentance to Allah) before death, Allah will forgive them</strong>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">as Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Say: “O ‘Ibâdî (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allâh: verily, Allâh forgives all sins</strong><span style="color:#008000;">.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim scholars unanimously agree that this Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) speaks about repentant people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Ayah of Surah Al-Nissa&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Verily, Allâh forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills</strong> ,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">it speaks about the unrepentant people, namely, those who died in Kufr (disbelief) and sin. May Allah protect us from that.</p>
<p><span style="color:#888888;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 5: The Al-Tijaniyyah sect has their own supplication called Salat Al-Fatih, which they consider to be better than reciting the Qur&#8217;an. Is this true? Moreover, on Friday before Maghrib (Sunset) Salah and after Subh (Dawn) Salah, they circle around a piece of cloth on which, they claim, the Prophet (peace be upon him) and Ahmad Al-Tijany sit. During such times they recite the supplication called Salat Al-Fatih. Please, provide evidence and clarify if this practice is proper.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <strong>All their claims are false. Moreover, their deeds are null and void and are considered to be Bid&#8217;ahs (rejected innovation in religion).</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For more clarification, I will cite the so-called Salat-ul-Fatih (Remembrance from the Tijaniyyah order).The following is cited in the Simplified Encyclopedia of Contemporary Religions, Doctrines, and Parties &#8211; The World Assembly Of Muslim Youths:<span style="color:#808000;"> &#8220;Their leader, Ahmad Al-Tijany, claims that he physically met the Prophet, peace be upon him, talked with him, and learned Salat-ul-Fatih from him- The wording of this Salat reads: &#8220;O Lord, have peace and blessings upon our master Muhammad, the opener of the closed, the last of the prophets, the supporter of right with right, and the guide to Your straight path, his family as high as his standing and rank.&#8221; They have beliefs concerning this Salah, including:The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, told him that the reward for reciting it once is equivalent to that of reciting the Qur&#8217;an six times.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, told him once again that the reward for reciting this Salah once is six thousand times as much as that for every Dhikr (Remembrance of Allah), Du`a&#8217; (supplication), long or short, and the recitation of the Qur&#8217;an (Jawahir Al-Ma`any Wa Bulugh Al-Amany, vol. 1, p. 136)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">The reward for such Salah is gained only if the reciter is authorized to recite it. This means there should be a chain of authorization tracing back to Ahmad Al-Tijany who, according to him, received this Salah from the Messenger of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Allegedly being the words of Allah (Exalted be He), this Salah is deemed to be a Hadith Qudsy (Revelation from Allah in the Prophet&#8217;s words) (Al-Durrah Al-Faridah, vol. 4, p. 128).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8211; He who recites Salat-ul-Fatih ten times will gain a reward that even an `Arif (Sufi who has reached a high station of worship) who had lived for one million years would not get if he had not recited it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8211; He who recites this Salah even once will have his sins forgiven and will have a reward as much as that for six thousand Tasbihs (saying: &#8220;Subhan Allah [Glory be to Allah]&#8221;), Du`a&#8217;s (supplication), and Dhikrs. (See Mushtaha Al-Kharif Al-Jani, pp. 127, 299 and 300.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say that the following verse applies to the above: <span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8220;Then woe to those who write the Book with their own hands and then say, &#8216;This is from Allah,&#8217; to purchase with it a little price!&#8221; </span>The Committee elaborated on this sect in the previous Fatwas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bismillaah Al-Hamdulillaah wa salatu wa salaamu &#8216;ala rasulullaah<br />
Amma ba&#8217;d</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">What is the wisdom behind facing the Ka`bah in Salah (Prayer)?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217;</strong> answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is known that the duty of a Muslim is to carry out Allaah&#8217;s commands as much as possible and refrain from committing what He has prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Whether one grasps its wisdom or not, one must believe that Allaah commands only that which is of benefit, and prohibits that which is harmful. All of His legislations contain wisdom which He knows; He reveals of this wisdom what He wishes so that believers may increase their Eeman, (Faith), and witholds what He wishes so that believers may increase their submission to Him</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims have taken the Ka`bah as a Qiblah (direction faced for Prayer) in obedience to Allaah&#8217;s order in His statement: <em><span style="color:#008000;">Verily! We have seen the turning of your (Muhammad&#8217;s, salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a Qiblah (prayer direction) that shall please you, so turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid-al-Haraam (at Makkah). And wheresoever you people are, turn your faces (in prayer) in that directio</span></em>n. (Surah Al-Baqarah, ayah 144)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wisdom behind this is perhaps that it is the Qiblah of our father Ibrahim (&#8216;alaihi salaam), as mentioned regarding the event when the Ayah was revealed. The Prophet (peace be upon him) had hoped to be ordered to face the Ka`bah during Salah instead of Jerusalem. Thus, Allah granted his wish. It might also be a refutation of the claim made by the Jews that we share their Qiblah. It may be for another reason and only Allah knows.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Fatwa no. 21203<br />
Fatwa from Permanent Committee :</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Some people celebrate Valentine&#8217;s Day on February 14 by exchanging red roses, dressing in red, and congratulating one another on that day. Some cake shops make heart-shaped cakes in red and draw hearts on them and other shops advertise special items on sale for this day. What is your opinion on: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>First</strong>: Celebrating this day?</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Second</strong>: Buying from these stores on this day? </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Third</strong>: Shop owners who do not celebrate this day selling gifts to be given by those who do celebrate it? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">May Allah reward you with the best!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The clear-cut evidence from the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah, upon which the <em>Salaf</em> (righteous predecessors) of this <em>Ummah</em> (nation based on one creed) unanimously agreed, confirms that there are only two <em>Eids</em> (festivals) in Islam: <em>Eid-ul-Fitr</em> (the Festival of Breaking the Fast) and <em>Eid-ul-Adha</em> (the Festival of the Sacrifice). Any other festival, whether peculiar to a person, a group, an event, or any other reason, is an invented festival that is not permissible for Muslims to celebrate, approve of, enjoy, or support in any way, because this is considered to be a transgression of the Limits of Allah.  Anyone who transgresses the limits set by Allah has wronged themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we add to this fabricated festival the fact that it is one of the festivals of the <em>Kafirs</em> (disbelievers), this heaps sin upon sin, because it entails resembling them and is a type of support of them. Allah (may He be Glorified) forbids the <em>Mumins</em> (believers), in His Ever-Glorious Book, from imitating or supporting the <em>Kafirs</em>. It is authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Anyone who imitates a people is one of them</strong></span>.&#8221; (Abu Dawud, Sunan, Book on clothing, no. 4031; Ahmad, Musnad, vol. 2, p. 50). Valentine&#8217;s Day falls under this heading, as it is one of the idolatrous Christian festivals. It is not lawful for a Muslim who believes in Allah and the Last Day to celebrate, approve of, or congratulate people on it; it is forbidden to them. Rather, it is obligatory for them to ignore and avoid it, in obedience to Allah and His Messenger and to keep away from that which will arouse Allah&#8217;s Anger and incur Punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is also <em>Haram</em> (prohibited) for Muslims to support this festival or any other <em>Haram</em> festival by any means, whether by supplying food or drinks; selling, buying, manufacturing, gift-giving, correspondence, advertising etc., because all this comes under cooperating in sin and transgression and disobeying Allah and His Messenger. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Help you one another in <em>Al-Birr</em> and <em>At-Taqwa</em> </strong>(virtue, righteousness and piety)<strong>; but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Severe in punishment.&#8221;</strong></span> (Surah Al-Ma&#8217;idah, 5: 2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory for Muslims to adhere to the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah in all matters, especially in times of <em>Fitnah</em> (trial) when corruption is widespread. They must be sagacious enough and on their guard to avoid falling into the misguidance of those who have earned Allah&#8217;s Anger, those who went astray, or the <em>Fasiqs</em> (those flagrantly violating Islamic law) who have no fear of Allah nor have pride in being Muslims. Muslims should resort to Allah, asking for guidance and steadfastness in Islam, as it is Allah Alone Who guides and keeps us steadfast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, and his family and Companions!</p>

<p>Amma ba&#8217;d</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here is a fatwa from the Permanent Committee regarding the game, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Pokemon</strong></span>. In the <strong>question</strong>, many evils of the game including its references to the Shinto religion is mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">a- The six-pointed star: You rarely find a card that does not contain such a star. It is associated with Judaism, the logo and sign of the state of Israel, and the first symbol of the Masonry organizations in the world.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">b- The cross: The game contains many forms of the cross which is the symbol of Christians.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">d- Symbols of the Shinto creed: <strong>Shinto</strong> is a polytheistic religion that exists in Japan. The Japanese deify the sun, the earth and many plants and animals. The game contains many of these images.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <a href="http://alifta.com/Search/ResultDetails.aspx?lang=en&amp;view=result&amp;fatwaNum=&amp;FatwaNumID=&amp;ID=10336&amp;searchScope=7&amp;SearchScopeLevels1=&amp;SearchScopeLevels2=&amp;highLight=1&amp;SearchType=exact&amp;SearchMoesar=false&amp;bookID=&amp;LeftVal=0&amp;RightVal=0&amp;simple=&amp;SearchCriteria=allwords&amp;PagePath=&amp;siteSection=1&amp;searchkeyword=112111107101109111110#firstKeyWordFound" target="_blank">answer of the Committee</a>, they mention:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Furthermore, this game promotes and circulates the symbols of disbelievers and the forbidden images. It is also a form of consuming money unlawfully.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Accordingly, the Committee decides that this game, earnings gained through it, its sale or purchase are all prohibited, for it is a form of gambling that is forbidden by Allah and His Messenger. The Committee also recommends that every Muslim should be careful of this game and prevent his children from playing it to preserve religion, morals and creed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">May Allaah protect the Muslims &amp; their kids from all evils and the plots of the Kuffaar.</span></p>

<p> <strong>Q: <span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling on keeping birds in a cage and giving them food, drink, and medication?</span></strong></p>
<p>A:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> It is permissible to raise birds, whether in cages or not, on the condition of giving them food, drink, and similar requirements. This is because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said about a cat:<em> A woman entered the Fire because of a cat which she had kept locked, neither giving it food or drink, nor setting it free to eat from the vermin of the earth</em>. Since this is applicable to a cat, it is also applicable to birds and the like.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>
<p>The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217;<br />
Member &#8211; Member &#8211; Member &#8211; Chairman<br />
Bakr Abu Zayd &#8211; `Abdul-`Aziz Al Al-Shaykh &#8211; Salih Al-Fawzan &#8211; `Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz</p>
<p>Fatwa no. 18807</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: <span style="color:#993300;">I would like to ask your Eminence about the ruling on trading in and possessing animals and birds for the purpose of having a hobby or for decorative purposes. These include for example: 1- Decorative birds such as parrots and other colorful birds 2- Reptiles such as snakes and lizards 3- Predators such as wolves, lions, foxes, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">These animals and birds are possessed either for their beauty or for their fur.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">It should be noted that they are very expensive and will be kept behind bars, but dealing in them is very profitable.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <strong>First</strong>, selling decorative birds like parrots, colorful birds and nightingales for their voices is permissible because looking at and listening to them is permissible. There is no text in the Shari`ah which forbids selling or possessing them; at the same time, there are texts which may be understood to mean that it is permissible to keep them in cages, as long as they are fed and watered and given all the care that is needed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among these texts is the Hadith narrated by Al-Bukhari on the authority of Anas who said: The Prophet (peace be upon him) was the best of people in attitude. I had a brother called Abu `Umayr who had just been weaned, I think. When he (peace be upon him) came, he would say, ‘O Abu `Umayr what happened to the nughayr?’ – a nughar [young sparrow or small bird] with which he used to play&#8230; Al-Hafez Ibn Hajar said in his commentary Fath al-Bary, when enumerating the things that we learn from this Hadith: “… it is permissible for children to play with birds; it is permissible for parents to allow their children to play with things with which it is permissible to play; it is permissible to spend money on permissible things to entertain children; it is permissible to keep a bird in a cage and it is permissible to clip a birds&#8217; wings – for one of these matters must have been the case with Abu `Umayr,and whichever one it was, the other is also implied in the ruling. There is also the Hadith narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) in which the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: A woman entered Hell because of a cat which she detained but she did not give it food or water, and she did not let it free so that it could eat of the vermin of the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this is permissible in the case of cats, then it is also permissible in the case of birds and the like. Some scholars saw that it is makruh (reprehensible) to keep them in cages. Others saw that this is not permissible because people do not need to listen to their voices and look at them. This is an unnecessary luxury and soft living, and it is also foolishness because it means that one is enjoying the voice of a creature that is calling out longing to be allowed to fly and grieving that it cannot fly freely in the open air. This view was stated in Al-Furu`, its Footnotes (4/9) and Al-Insaf (4/275) by Al-Marudy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>, among the conditions of valid sales is that the sold object should be something which is permissible to use and benefit from, even if there is no necessity as such. <span style="color:#ff6600;">There is no benefit in snakes, which are indeed harmful, so it is not permissible to buy or sell them. The same applies to lizards – there is no benefit in them, so it is not permissible to sell or buy them. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>, it is<span style="color:#ff6600;"> not permissible to sell predators such as wolves, lions, foxes or any other fanged carnivore</span>, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade that, and because it is a waste of money, which was also forbidden by the Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings of Allah be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

<p>&#8230;&#8230; According to the sound Hadith:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) saw a bird called &#8220;Al-Naghir&#8221; in the hand of Abu `Umayr Al-Ansary. Thereupon, he said: O Abu `Umayr, what did the bird do? He did not command him to release the bird and that was in the Sanctuary of Al-Madinah. Hisham ibn `Urwah said: The commander of the believers, `Abdullah ibn Al-Zubayr stayed in Makkah for nine years and saw birds in cages while the Companions of the Messenger (peace be upon him) used to come to Makkah and see them and they did not forbid that. &#8230;&#8230; </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fatwa no. 21079</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: On 12/8/1420 A.H. notices were placed on the roads of Riyadh conveying congratulations from the Banque Saudi Fransi on the <span id="ContentParagraph" style="font-family:tahoma;">New Year</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Employees of the Banque Saudi Fransi wish the Saudi people a merry year. Respected shaykh, it undoubtedly hurts every Muslim to find things like this common in the land of Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah/monotheism) and Al-Haramayn Al-Sharifayn (the Two Sacred Mosques, the Sacred Mosque in Makkah and the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque in Madinah).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">I hope that Your Honor will clarify the ruling of Islam on this matter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A Muslim is prohibited to congratulate the disbelievers, Christians, Jews or whomever, on their distinctive occasions. This involves a sort of agreeing with them on their falsehood and being loyal to them. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Similarly, a Muslim is prohibited to congratulate his Muslim brother on the feasts and celebrations of the disbelievers. By doing so, a Muslim imitates them.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslims must resent disbelievers, dissociate themselves from them and hate their disbelief and disobedience to Allah, as Allah (Exalted be He) states,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />It was authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><strong>Anyone who imitates a people becomes one of them</strong>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph">the Shaykh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah </span>commented on this Hadith saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>This Hadith at least implies that it is prohibited for a Muslim to imitate the disbelievers though it apparently signifies the disbelief of the imitator</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) states,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;and if any amongst you takes them as Auliyâ’, then surely he is one of them</span>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">You (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will not find any people who believe in Allâh and the Last Day, making friendship with those who oppose Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم)</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) states,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 51" target="_blank" rel="nofollow' id=" name="Oyouwhobelieve!Takenotthe"></a><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Auliyâ’ (friends, protectors, helpers), they are but Auliyâ’ of each other. And if any amongst you takes them as Auliyâ’, then surely he is one of them. Verily, Allâh guides not those people who are the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers and unjust)</span>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, <span style="color:#ff0000;">Muslims are not permitted to express joy or congratulate disbelievers on their festive occasions, whether by word of mouth, posters, newspapers, magazines, cards or the like</span>. The legal authorities must remove these notices.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success . May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fatwa no. 21778</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: The habit of lightening eyebrows has recently spread among women; they lighten the hairs below and above the eyebrow, so that it resembles Nams (removing hair from the face/eyebrows). This habit is an imitation of Western countries. The lightening substance is also medically harmful. What is the ruling of Shari`ah (Islamic law) on this deed? Please advise. May Allah reward you! It is worth mentioning that most women request a written Fatwa (legal opinion issued by a qualified Muslim scholar), and refuse to abide by verbal ones. May Allah make us benefit from it and preserve the religion of this Ummah (nation based on one creed). Indeed, He is the One able to do so.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">It is not permissible to lighten above and below the eyebrows in the way that was mentioned, as it entails changing Allah’s creation and resembles Nams which is prohibited, being in the same sense. It is even more prohibited if it entails imitation of non-Muslims, or if it is harmful to the body or hair. This is because Allah (Exalted be He) says: <span style="color:#008000;"><em>…and do not throw yourselves into destruction</em></span> The Prophet (peace be upon him) also said: “<em><span style="color:#008000;">There should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm.”</span></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 3: What is the islamic ruling on someone who works in the <strong>public sector</strong>, although we all know that most of the money of the government is the produce of usurious dealings and alcohol selling. Is it lawful to have a government job? Civil workers seek to benefit their family from the <strong>pension they receive after he dies</strong> as no pension is provided for freelance working. We live in a country where there is <strong>no Bayt-ul-Mal (Muslim treasury)</strong><span style="color:#888888;"><a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-1La" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color:#888888;">.</span></a></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There is nothing wrong in working in a non-Muslim country as long as the kind of work done does not involve disobeying or helping to disobey Allah. There is nothing wrong with you receiving your salary from the mixed treasury of the state<span style="color:#888888;"><a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-1La" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color:#888888;">.</span></a></span> May Allah grant us success.

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Regarding the asl of pention</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 1: I was enrolled in the Egyptian Armed Forces as a volunteer from September 1967 A.D. till January of 1981 A.D., and served in the Army for approximately thirteen years. They used to deduct part of my monthly salary to cover insurance and pensions. This was obligatory. After Allah guided me to understand Islam, I resigned, and thanks to Allah, my resignation was accepted. However, they started paying me 56.54 pounds as a </span><strong style="color:#993300;">monthly pension</strong><span style="color:#993300;">. A brother told me that the money of this pension is </span><strong style="color:#993300;">Riba (usury)</strong><span style="color:#993300;"> and that I must refuse it. Is this correct? What is the correct ruling concerning this pension?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">A: If the reality is as you mentioned, it is permissible for you to take the retirement pension as it is a reward for the period you served in the government.</span></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">Alifta.net &#8211; Fatwa no. 17929</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">All praise be to Allah Alone, and peace and blessings be upon the final Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta</strong>&#8216; has read the letter which was sent to his Eminence, the Grand Mufty, from the questioners, Chairman and Members of Association of Islamic law at the Faculty of Shari`ah and Islamic Studies at the university of Kuwait. This letter was transferred to the Committee by the Secretariat-General of the Council of Senior Scholars under the number 1202 in 11/03/1416 A. H. The questioners asked the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible that a male teacher teaches female students without there being a screen between them so that they see each other? It may be important to mention that mostly the teacher does not see their faces as they wear the face veil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible that a female student attends the office of her male teacher and the latter talks with her without there being a screen between them but mostly without seeing her face? Is it permissible that such a student takes a seat inside the office of a male teacher speaking with him about the field of study and so on, while no Mahram (spouse or permanently unmarriageable relative) accompanies her or she is accompanied by one of her female schoolmates and the teacher explains the lesson to them or answers their questions which are related to lectures and so on? It may be worthy to mention that the foregoing can be done by phone and that some of the teachers are still in their youth or have just started their old age while the female students are mostly in the beginning of their youth.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the Committee had studied the question it answered as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>, intermixing of men and women in schools or any other places is considered a great Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Shari`ah and Muslims of sound intellect) and a great evil with regard to the affairs of both Din (religion) and the world. Thus,<span style="color:#ff6600;"> it is not permissible for women to study or work in a place which intermixes men and women</span>. Similarly, their guardians should not allow them to do so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>, <span style="color:#ff6600;">it is neither permissible for men to teach unveiled women nor to teach women wearing Shar`y (Islamically acceptable) veil in privacy.</span> By the way, all of the body of a woman is `Awrah (parts of the body that must be covered) as far as a non-Mahram (not a spouse or an unmarriageable relative) is concerned. As for covering the head and showing the face, this is not full Hijab (veil).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>, <span style="color:#ff6600;">it is permissible for a man to teach women from behind a screen in female schools where there is no intermixing of male and female students or male and female teachers</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">If female students need to ask their male teacher about something, this should be done through closed communication networks, which are renowned and available, or via phones, however, such students should be careful not to soften their speech.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><a href="http://wp.me/p1QF7B-aP" target="_blank"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Sisters Kissing Cheeks when Meeting ?</strong></span></a></span></div>
<div style="text-align:center;"></div>
<div style="text-align:center;">بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</div>
<div style="text-align:center;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Assalaamu &#8216;alaykum wa rahmatullaahi wa barakaatuh</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">I felt that this email was necessary as kissing on the cheeks is being practised throughout the sisterhood in West London, it is almost as if it is obligatory.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Know that the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم forbade us from kissing when we meet our brothers/sisters:</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) said:</div>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A man said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, when one of us meets his brother or his friend, should he bow to him?&#8221; He said: &#8220;No.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Should he embrace him and kiss him?&#8221; He said: &#8220;No.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Should he take his hand and shake hands with him?&#8221; He said: Yes. </strong></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">[This hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan al-Tirmidhi]</div>
</blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">The permanent Committee was asked about the subject:</div>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q. There is the phenomenon of young men kissing one another on the cheeks every time they meet, every day. This phenomenon has also spread among old men, in the mosques and in the classrooms. Is this contrary to the Sunnah or is there nothing wrong with it? Is it a bid’ah or a sin or is it permissible?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. What is prescribed when meeting is to say salaam and shake hands, If the meeting is after a journey then it is prescribed to embrace as well, because it is narrated that Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: When the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) met, they would shake hands, and if they had come from a journey they would embrace. As for kissing the cheeks, we do not know of any Sunnah to indicate that. End quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 24/128</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, <strong>Shaykh al-Albani</strong> addressed this issue, after mentioning the hadeeth above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;In fact the hadeeth clearly states that kissing when meeting is not prescribed in Islam. That does not include kissing one&#8217;s children or wife, as is obvious.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to the ahaadeeth which state that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) kissed some of his companions on various occasions – such as when he kissed and embraced Zayd ibn Haarithah when he came to Madeenah, and when he embraced Abu’l-Haytham ibn al-Tayhaan, etc – the following points may be noted in response to that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 – These are unsound ahaadeeth which cannot be taken as evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – Even if any of them were saheeh, it is not permissible to use them against this saheeh hadeeth, because it is an action on the part of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) which may be interpreted as applying to a specific case or there may be some specific reason for that which makes this hadeeth unfit to be used as evidence, unlike this hadeeth, which is a verbal hadeeth that is addressed in general terms to the ummah as a whole, so it is string evidence which cannot be rejected. It is established in the field of usool that words take precedence over deeds in the event of a conflict, and the hadeeth which indicates a prohibition takes precedence over another which indicates permissibility. This hadeeth is verbal and indicates a prohibition, so it takes precedence over the other ahaadeeth mentioned even if they are saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, with regard to hugging and embracing, we say that it is not prescribed because the hadeeth forbids it, but Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: When the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) met, they would shake hands, and if they had come from a journey they would embrace Narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Awsat, and its men are the men of saheeh, as stated by al-Mundhiri (3/270), and al-Bayhaqi, 8/36</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bayhaqi (7/100) narrated with a saheeh isnaad from al-Sha’bi that when the companions of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) met, they would shake hands, and when they came from a journey they would embrace one another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhaari narrated in al-Adab al-Mufrad (970), and Ahmad narrated (3/495) that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah said: I heard I heard that a man knew a hadeeth and had heard it from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). I bought a camel, loaded my luggage onto it, and traveled for a month until I came to Syria, where I found ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Unays. I said to the doorkeeper: Tell him: Jaabir is at the door. He said: Ibn ‘Abd-Allaah? I said: Yes. He came out tripping on his garment and he embraced me and I embraced him… Its isnaad is hasan as stated by al-Haafiz, 1/195. al-Bukhaari narrated it among the mu’aalaq reports.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it may be said that embracing in the case of a journey is exempted from the prohibition, because the Sahaabah did that.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth al-Saheehah (1/74, hadeeth no. 160)]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Wearing coloured contact lenses</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling regarding wearing coloured contact lenses with the justification (for doing so) being for beautification and following the latest trend (fashion), keeping in mind that their price is no less than 700 (Saudi) Riyals (approximately £120)?</span></p>
<p><strong>Response</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no harm in wearing contact lenses due to necessity; As for other than that, then it is better to leave doing so especially if they are expensive, since this equates to being excessive in (spending one’s wealth) which is prohibited, in addition to that which exists therein of deceit and covering up the reality because they make the eyes appear in other than their natural state without there being a (Islaamically justifiable) need for that.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Some methods of adornment are available in our markets, such as <strong>artificial nails</strong>, <strong>false eyelashes</strong>, and <strong>colored contact lenses</strong> to change the eye color. There are many inquiries about such cosmetics, due to their being widespread among women. Please, Your Eminence, we would like you to guide us to the right thing. May Allah safeguard you with His Guidance!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is impermissible to wear artificial nails, false eyelashes, and colored contact lenses, because they are harmful to the body, and they also entail deception and changing the creation of Allah (Exalted be He). May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling regarding women cutting their hair? Some women beautify themselves in this way even if they are single. Where is the limit? What is the ruling on side parting?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn Bâz</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not allowed for the women to cut the hair. Their hair is their beauty. When they cut it, they subject the hair to disfigurement and an uneven hair.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the hair were to be really long, it is then allowed to cut the ends. It has been confirmed that the prophet’s (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) wives did it after his death. If the hair gets really long, she then may do so since she experiences difficulties with the washing and combing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for side parting, it is not allowed. It is an imitation of women that are Mumîlât Mâmilât.</p>

<p><strong>The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Question 3: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling on a woman parting her hair on the side, making only one braid, or wearing it in a bun, with the intention of making herself beautiful for her husband or to look good because it suits her?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to <strong>parting the hair on the side</strong>, this involves imitating the Kafir (disbelieving) women, and it is proven that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said it is Haram (prohibited) to imitate the Kafirs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to <strong>gathering the hair and letting it hang down on the back</strong>, either braided or not, there is nothing wrong with that so long as it is covered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, <strong>making it into a bun (on top of the head)</strong> is not permitted, because that is an imitation of Kafir women and it is Haram to imitate them. The Prophet (peace be upon him) warned against that when he said: &#8220;<span style="color:#666699;">There are two types amongst the denizens of the Fire whom I have not seen yet: Men having whips like the tails of cows with which they flog people, and women who would be naked in spite of their being dressed, who seduce others (to wrong paths) and are being seduced; their heads will appear like the humps of the Bactrian camels inclined to one side. These (women) would not enter Jannah (Paradise) nor perceive its odor, even though its odor can be perceived at such and such (very remote) distance.</span>&#8221; (Related by Ahmad and Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217; has read what was sent by to the General Chairman by the undersecretary of the foreign ministry for political affairs. This letter was refereed to the Committee by the administration of scholarly research and Ifta&#8217;. This letter is No. 23l that was sent in 1408 A.H. The Undersecretary sent this message:&#8221;I have received a request from the embassy of the Custodian of the two Sacred Mosques in Bonn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">It inquires if it is obligatory upon he who embraces Islam to change his name in order to be admitted access to the sacred area in order to perform Hajj or not? Can he who does not change his name be admitted entrance to these places? I would like to receive an answer in order to send it to the embassy there.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After reviewing the question, the Committee responded that if he confirms that he is a Muslim, he is legally permitted to enter to the sacred precincts regardless of his name.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>:  <span style="color:#993300;">Why is our religion called &#8220;Islaam&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because one who enters it <span style="color:#800080;"><strong>submits (Aslama)</strong></span> himself to Allaah, and he <span style="color:#800080;"><strong>surrenders to (Istislam)</strong></span>, and abides by, all of the judgements that come from Allaah and from His Messenger Salallaahu alayhi wasallam. Allaah Almighty said:</p>
<p>وَمَن يَرْغَبُ عَن مِّلَّةِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِلاَّ مَن سَفِهَ نَفْسَهُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And who turns away from the religion of Ibraheem except him who fools himself?</span> [Baqarah 2:130]</p>
<p>He also said:</p>
<p>إِذْ قَالَ لَهُ رَبُّهُ أَسْلِمْ قَالَ أَسْلَمْتُ لِرَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">When His Lord said to him, &#8220;Submit (i.e. be a Muslim)!&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have submitted myself (as a Muslim) to the Lord of all that exists.&#8221;</span> [Baqarah 2:131]</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>مَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لِلّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ فَلَهُ أَجْرُهُ عِندَ رَبِّهِ</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">But whoever submits his face (himself) to Allaah and he is a good-doer then his reward is with his Lord</span> [Baqarah 2:112]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Allah&#8217;s Name Al-Latif being repeated 129 times</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: In some of the Masjids (mosques) here in the district of Bashshar, people repeat Al-Latif (i.e. The Kindest), one of Allah&#8217;s Most Beautiful Names, every Friday after finishing the study circle before the Adhan (call to Prayer) and the two sermons of Friday Salah. They repeat this Name 129 times. I asked the Imam about this practice and he told me that they do so for Allah to save them from His Wrath. What is your view and explanation of this practice?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Recitation of Allah&#8217;s Name (Al-Latif) 129 times before the Adhan of Friday Salah has nothing to do with the guidance of the Prophet (peace be upon him) nor his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) nor the Salaf (righteous predecessors). In fact this is one of the Bid`ah (innovation in religion) introduced to religion. It is authentically reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he said: <span style="color:#008000;">He who innovates things in our affairs for which there is no valid (reason) (commits sin) and these are to be rejected <span style="color:#000000;">[1]</span>.</span> i.e. Allah will not accept it from the person who does it. With regards to sitting in circles for lessons before the Adhan (call to Prayer) of the Friday Salah and the two sermons, it is forbidden according to the Hadith that is narrated by Al-Nasa&#8217;y from `Amr ibn Shu`ayb from his father from his grandfather: <span style="color:#000000;"><span style="color:#008000;">That the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade sitting in study circles in mosques before the Jumu`ah (Friday) Prayer</span> [2]</span></p>
<p>May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Can humans see Allah in this world?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q 2: Is it possible to see Allah in this world overtly?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This issue is one of the issues that are based upon Tawqif (bound by a religious text and not amenable to personal opinion). No one is allowed to allege it without an authentic proof that can be cited as evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;an denotes that Musa (Moses) did not see his Lord. When Musa asked his Lord to see Him, He (Exalted be He) answered him saying: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;You cannot see Me&#8221; </span><span style="color:#888888;">(Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 143)</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The authentic Sunnah denoted that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) did not see his Lord with his eyes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was reported in the Sahih of Muslim that Masruq said: I was resting (at the house of) ‘Aishah when she said: O Abu `Aishah, there are three things, and he who affirms even one of them has fabricated the greatest lie against Allah. I asked what they were.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said: He who presumes that Muhammad (peace be upon him) saw his Lord (with his ocular vision) has fabricated the greatest lie against Allah. I was reclining but then sat up and said: O Mother of Believers, wait and do not be hasteful. Has Allah (may He be Exalted) not said: <span style="color:#008000;">And indeed he (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) saw him [Jibrîl (Gabriel)] in the clear horizon (towards the east)</span> <span style="color:#808080;">(Surah Al-Takwir, 81: 23)</span>. and <span style="color:#008000;">And indeed he (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) saw him [Jibrîl (Gabriel)] at a second descent (i.e. another time)</span> <span style="color:#808080;">(Surah Al-Najm, 53: 13)</span>. She said: I was the first of this Ummah to ask Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) about it. And he said: Verily he is Gabriel. I have never seen him in his original form in which he was created except on those two occasions (to which these verses refer). I saw him descending from the heaven and filling (the space) between the sky and the earth with the greatness of his bodily structure. She asked: Have you not heard Allah saying: <span style="color:#008000;">No vision can grasp Him, but He grasps all vision. He is Al-Latîf (the Most Subtle and Courteous), Well-Acquainted with all things</span>.<span style="color:#808080;">(Surah Al-An`am, 6: 103)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She (i.e. &#8216;Aisha) further asked: Have you not heard that, verily, Allah says: It is not given to any human being that Allâh should speak to him unless (it be) by Revelation, or from behind a veil, or (that) He sends a Messenger until His saying:<span style="color:#008000;"> Verily, He is Most High, Most Wise</span>.<span style="color:#808080;">(</span>Surah Al-Shura, 42: 51) ..<span style="color:#0000ff;">.<span style="color:#ff6600;">[1]</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was reported in Sahih Muslim on the authority of Abu Dhar that he asked the Prophet (peace be upon him): &#8220;Did you see your Lord?&#8221; He said: &#8220;I saw Light.&#8221;<span style="color:#ff6600;">[2] </span>In another narration, the Prophet said: “Light, how could I see Him.” <span style="color:#ff6600;">[3]</span> It was reported also in Sahih Muslim that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;None of you shall see his Lord until he dies.&#8221;<span style="color:#ff6600;"> [4]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah</strong> said: &#8220;The Imams of Muslims have agreed that no believer is liable to see Allah with his eyes in this world. They did not disagree except in the case of the Prophet (peace be upon him). However, the majority of scholars agreed that the Prophet (peace be upon him) did not see Him with his eyes in this world. Authentic narrations reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him), the Companions and the Imams of Muslims have confirmed this viewpoint.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was not authentically reported that Ibn `Abbas, Imam Ahmad and the like said that the Prophet (peace be upon him) saw his Lord with his eyes. What was authentically reported from them was the sight in general or confining the sight to that of the heart. There is nothing in the Hadiths of Mi&#8217;raj (Ascension to the heavens) that denotes that he saw Allah with his eyes. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">My Lord has come to me in the most-handsome shape I have ever seen</span>.&#8221; <span style="color:#ff6600;">[5]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Hadith was reported by Al-Tirmidhy and others. This Hadith was reported when the Prophet (peace be upon him) was in Al-Madinah This Hadith was interpreted that the Prophet (peace be upon him) saw his Lord in a dream.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also the Hadith of Um Al-Tufayl, the Hadith of Ibn `Abbas and others that contain seeing Allah. These Hadiths were reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) while he was in Al-Madinah just as they were explained by other Hadiths.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Mi`raj (Ascension to Heaven) was at Makkah as Allah (Exalted be He) says: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Glorified (and Exalted) be He (Allâh) [above all that (evil) they associate with Him] Who took His slave (Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) for a journey by night from Al-Masjid-al-Harâm (at Makkah) to Al-Masjid-al-Aqsâ (in Jerusalem)&#8221;</span>.<span style="color:#888888;">[Surah Al-Isra&#8217;, 17: 1]</span> Allah also said to Musa: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">You cannot see Me</span>&#8221; <span style="color:#888888;">[Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 143]</span>. Seeing Allah is greater than revealing a book from the heavens. Allah (Exalted be He) says:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;The people of the Scripture (Jews) ask you to cause a book to descend upon them from heaven. Indeed, they asked Mûsâ (Moses) for even greater than that, when they said: “Show us Allâh in public,”&#8221;</span>(Surah Al-Nisa&#8217;, 4: 153) Whoever alleges that he saw his Lord, it is as if he alleges that he is better than Musa ibn `Imran. This allegation is greater in evil than the allegation of those who falsely allege that Allah has revealed a book from the heaven upon them. The Companions, predecessors and Imams of Muslims believe that Allah will be seen in the Hereafter only and no one will see Him in this world except in a dream. Hearts in this case will find spiritual unveilings and sights that suit their status. Some people may have strong spiritual unveilings to the extent that they think that they saw their Lord with their eyes. But this is not true. Hearts unveilings or spiritual unveilings occur according the degree of the servant&#8217;s belief in his Lord. <span style="color:#ff6600;">[6]</span></p>
<p>May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Naqshabandiyyah</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the ruling, in your understanding, on the Sufi Tariqahs (orders) in general, and the Naqshabandi Tariqah in particular?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">A: There is a lot of Bid`ah (rejected innovation in religion) practiced among the Sufi Tariqahs, such as holding Dhikr (Remembrance of Allah) circles and gatherings in rows, in which they all repeat the Name of Allah together, saying, &#8220;Allah, Allah,&#8221; one of His Attributes saying, &#8220;Hayy (Ever-Living), Hayy,&#8221; or &#8220;Qayyum (Self-Subsisting), Qayyum,&#8221; referring to Him through the pronoun &#8220;Huwa (He), Huwa,&#8221; or repeating meaningless sounds, such as &#8220;Ah, Ah.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">They also repeat other formulas of Dhikr, in which they beseech help from other than Allah, seek support of the dead, such as Al-Badawy, Al-Shadhily, Al-Jilany, and others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Their books contain a lot of Bid`ah and scattered evil, especially Al-Naqshabandiyyah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">In their daily Wird (sayings recited with consistency), they repeat the Name of Allah in their hearts, without moving their lips. The Murids (students) evoke their shaykh and his Wird, believing that this will be a means of saving them on the Day of Resurrection. These practices are all abominable acts of Bi`dah; none of these forms of Dhikr were reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) in what was sent to him in the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is, however, authentically narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;Anyone who does something that we have not ordered (in worship) it will be rejected.&#8221; The Prophet also said, &#8220;Anyone who introduces something in this matter of our (the religion) that is not from it, it will be rejected.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Writing Basmalah and Allah&#8217;s Name on antiques</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the legal decision on the decorations and ornaments where the Glorious Name &#8220;Allah&#8221; and the name of the Prophet &#8220;Muhammad&#8221; are engraved? I work in business and I have dealings with some Muslim brothers in some countries. They want to know whether the Glorious Name &#8220;Allah&#8221; should be written on the right side and the name &#8220;Muhammad&#8221; on the left side or not?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">You will find three forms attached to this letter which I want to ask about. Is it permissible to imprint them on the excellent crystal and other ornaments? Please, advise. May Allah reward you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;">A: It is not permissible to write <strong>&#8220;In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful&#8221;</strong> on ornaments and other decorative items, for the phrase &#8220;In the name of Allah, Most Gracious,Most Merciful&#8221; is an Ayah. To write it on such things exposes it to humiliation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;">Also, it is not permissible to write the <strong>Glorious Name &#8220;Allah&#8221;</strong> on such things, because this may expose it to humiliation. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;">Likewise, <strong>the name of the Prophet</strong> (peace be upon him) should not be imprinted on these things to protect it from degradation and prevent the overestimation prohibited by the Prophet (peace be upon him).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Some calligraphers write the Exalted Name over the back of the cars which are subjected to be covered in dirt. Please, give us a Fatwa on that so that we may know the truth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is not permissible for calligraphers, painters or others to write the Exalted Name of Allah or one of His beautiful Names and Attributes on the back of the car or whatsoever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, the owner of the car is not permitted to do that under any pretext, such as decoration, seeking blessing, using it as a means of reminding and admonition or for any other purposes the common and ignorant people think of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an act of Bid`ah (innovation in religion) that has no origin in the Qur&#8217;an or Sunnah, and Allah does not make it an act of worship. Moreover, writing Qur&#8217;an in that way entails insult to the Names and Attributes of Allah and not keeping them above inappropriate handling. Perhaps, this leads the person to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) when he uses it as an amulet that brings about good and wards off evil merely by writing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">Allah does not teach us his Names and Attributes to be written on sets, notices or cars. Had this been permissible, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) would have guided us to it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) revealed His Names and Attributes to inform His slaves of Him so that they affirm them as He revealed in the Qur&#8217;an or to His Messenger (peace be upon him) and believe in all perfection and majesty they convey. Muslims should also give Allah His due praise and supplicate to Him in easy and hard times by virtue of His Names and Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every Muslim must believe in these Names, realize them in their creed and work and keep them in letter and spirit. A Muslim should attribute them to Allah properly without Tahrif (distortion of the meaning), Ta`til (denial of Allah&#8217;s Attributes), Tamthil (likening Allah&#8217;s Attributes to those of His Creation), Takyif (questioning Allah&#8217;s Attributes) or Tashbih (comparison), and guard their sanctity against abuse and inappropriate things. Allah (Exalted be He) says, <span style="color:#008000;">And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allâh, so call on Him by them, and leave the company of those who belie or deny (or utter impious speech against) His Names. They will be requited for what they used to do</span>. (Surah Al-A&#8217;raf 7:180)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">A: placing a piece of cloth in the Masjid and gathering around it to repeat the Name of Allah is a misleading act of Bid`ah (innovation in religion) undertaken by some <strong>Sufis</strong> who deviate from the course of the Messenger (peace be upon him). Therefore, it is not permissible to do or attend. This should also be prohibited and disavowed. Masjids should be protected from such acts of Bid`ah.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#003300;"><strong>When a person enters the Masjid (mosque) and finds people reciting Tashahhud, should he wait until they finish or should he join them in congregational Salah?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa no. 4397<br />
<span style="color:#800000;">Q: Once I went to the Masjid (mosque) to offer `Asr (Afternoon) Prayer, and I found that they had finished three Rak`ahs (units of Prayer) and were in the Sujud (prostration) position of the fourth Rak`ah. In this case, should I join them or wait until they finish Salah?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: In this case, you should join them then complete Salah from the point where you joined them and make up for what you missed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>If you find that they have risen from the Ruku` (bowing) position of the last Rak`ah, then join them and make up for the parts you missed after the Imam recites Taslim (salutation of peace ending the Prayer)</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is due to what is related by Abu Dawud (may Allah be merciful with him) on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) said, <span style="color:#008000;">&lt;&lt;When you come to prayer while we are prostrating ourselves, prostrate yourself and do not count it as one Rak`ah. Whoever catches a Rak`ah of the Prayer, in fact catches the Prayer&gt;&gt;</span>[1].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also because of the general meaning of what has been narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim (may Allah be merciful to them) on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with them) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, <span style="color:#008000;">&lt;&lt;When the words of Iqamah are pronounced, do not come to (prayer) running, but go with tranquility, and pray what you are in time for, and complete what you have missed&#8230;&gt;&gt;<span style="color:#000000;">[2]</span></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q 2: What is the evidence that Allah is in the heavens?</span></strong></p>
<p>A: The `Aqidah (creed) of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim main body) is that Allah is in the heavens, above all of His Creation, and that He has risen above the Throne, as He (Glorified be He) states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#339966;">&lt;&lt;Do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven (Allâh), will not cause the earth to sink with you, and then it should quake? Or do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven (Allâh), will not send against you a violent whirlwind? Then you shall know how (terrible) has been My Warning&gt;&gt; <span style="color:#888888;">(Surah Al-Mulk 67:16-17)</span><br />
</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and He (Exalted be He) states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#339966;">&lt;&lt;To Him ascend (all) the goodly words, and the righteous deeds exalt it (i.e. the goodly words are not accepted by Allâh unless and until they are followed by good deeds)&gt;&gt; <span style="color:#888888;">(Surah Fatir 35:10)</span><br />
</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;"><em>&lt;&lt;He manages and regulates (every) affair from the heavens to the earth; then it (affair) will go up to Him&gt;&gt; <span style="color:#888888;">(Surah Al-Sajdah 32:5)</span><br />
</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and in Surah Ta-Hah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#339966;">&lt;&lt;The Most Gracious (Allâh) rose over (Istawâ) the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty)&gt;&gt; <span style="color:#888888;">(Surah Taha 25:10)</span><br />
</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and (Glorified be He):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#339966;">&lt;&lt;Indeed, your Lord is Allâh, Who created the heavens and the earth in Six Days, and then He rose over (Istawâ) the Throne (really in a manner that suits His Majesty)&gt;&gt; <span style="color:#888888;">(Surah Al-Ara&#8217;f 7:54)</span><br />
</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">in seven places in the Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was authentically reported in the Hadith regarding the Kharijites that the prophet (peace be upon him) states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t you trust me though I am the trustworthy man of the One in the Heavens, and I receive the news of Heaven (i.e. Divine Inspiration) both in the morning and in the evening?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">when the Prophet (peace be upon him) asked a slave girl, &#8220;Where is Allah?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;In the heaven.&#8221; He (peace be upon him) then asked her, &#8220;Who am I?&#8221; She said, &#8220;You are the Messenger of Allah.&#8221; He (peace be upon him) said (to her master), &#8220;Release her, for she is a believer.&#8221; <span style="color:#888888;">[Related by Muslim]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) also stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">The Compassionate One has mercy on those who are merciful. If you show mercy to those who are on the earth, He Who is in the heaven will show mercy to you. <span style="color:#888888;">[Related by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and Al-Tirmidhi who classified it as a Hasan Sahih Hadith, and Al-Hakim who classified it as Sahih and Al-Dhahabi agreed with him].</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are many other Hadith to this effect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sheikh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah</strong> said that <span style="color:#800080;">this does not mean in any way that Allah is in the midst of, or surrounded by the heavens, as none of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) of this Ummah (community) or its Imams ever stated that; rather they agreed that allah is established on His Throne above the heavens and is distinguished from His creation with no similarity whatsoever between Him and His creation in terms of His Attributes, Names, or Power. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">Then he quoted the saying of Al-Imam Malik that Allah is above the heavens and His knowledge encompasses everywhere and every thing, until he (Malik) said whoever believes that Allah is in the mist of, or surrounded by the heavens and that He needs His Throne or any of His creation, or that His rising above the Throne is similar to that of any of His servants sitting on a chair, then he is astray, Mubtadi` (one who introduces innovations in religion) and Islamically ignorant. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">Likewise, whoever believes that Allah is not above the heavens and rising above His Throne and Muhammad was not carried to heaven or the Qur&#8217;an was revealed to him, is Mu`atil (denying Allah&#8217;s attributes), astray and Mubtadi`.</span>  [Quoted from the collection of Fatwa by Ibn Taymiyyah.]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 1: Is it correct that &#8220;Al-Rashid (The Righteous Teacher)&#8221; is one of the Names of Allah (Glorified be He)? What is the ruling on having the name of &#8220;`Abdul-Rashid (Servant of Al-Rashid)&#8221;? Is it obligatory upon anyone who has this name to change it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Rashid is not one of the Names of Allah (Exalted be He) because it is not stated in the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah. Accordingly, it is impermissible to say,  &#8220;Abdul-Rashid&#8221;. It is obligatory upon anyone who has this name to change it.</p>
