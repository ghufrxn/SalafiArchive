Chapter 369<br />
Expiation for the violation of Commandments of Allah</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>And if an evil whisper from Shaitan (Satan) tries to turn you away (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) (from doing good), then seek refuge in Allah</b></span><b>.&#8221; (41:36)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Verily, those who are Al-Muttaqun (the pious), when an evil thought comes to them from Shaitan (Satan), they remember (Allah), and (indeed) they then see (aright)</b></span><b>.&#8221; (7:201)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>And those who, when they have committed Fahishah or wronged themselves with evil, remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their sins; &#8211; and none can forgive sins but Allah &#8211; and do not persist in what (wrong) they have done, while they know. For such, the reward is forgiveness from their Rubb, and Gardens with rivers flowing underneath (Jannah), wherein they shall abide forever. How excellent is this reward for the doers (who do righteous deeds according to Allah&#8217;s Orders)!</b></span><b>&#8221; (3:135,136)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>And all of you beg Allah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful</b></span><b>.&#8221; (24:31)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1807.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who takes an oath and involuntarily says: `By Al-Lat and Al-`Uzza&#8217; should at once affirm: `La ilaha illallah (there is no true god except Allah)&#8217;, and he who says to his companion: `Come let&#8217;s gamble&#8217; should make expiation by giving something in charity</span>.&#8221;<br />

Chapter 370<br />
Ahadith about Dajjal and Portents of the Hour</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1808.</b> An-Nawwas bin Sam`an (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: One morning the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) made a mention of Dajjal, and he described him to be insignificant and at the same time described him so significant that we thought he was on the date-palm trees (i.e., nearby). When we went to him (the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) in the evening, he perceived the sign of fear on our faces. He said, &#8220;What is the matter with you?&#8221; We said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, you talked about Dajjal this morning raising your voice and lowering it until we thought he was hiding in the palm-trees grove: He said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Something other than Dajjal make worry about you. If he appears while I am with you, I will defend you against him. But if he appears after I die, then everyone of you is his own defender. Allah is the One Who remains after me to guide every Muslim. Dajjal will be a young man with very curly hair with one eye protruding (with which he cannot see). I compare (his appearance) to that of Al-`Uzza bin Qatan. He who amongst you survives to see him, should recite over him the opening Ayat of Surat Al-Kahf (i.e., Surat 18: Verses 1-8). He will appear on the way between Syria and Iraq and will spread mischief right and left. O slaves of Allah! Remain adhered to the truth</span>.&#8221; We asked: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! How long will he stay on the earth?&#8221; He said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">For forty days. One day will be like a year, one day like a month, one day like a week and the rest of the days will be like your days</span>.&#8221; We said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Will one day&#8217;s Salat (prayer) suffice for the Salat of that day which will be equal to one year?&#8221; Thereupon he said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">No, but you must make an estimate of time and then offer Salat</span>.&#8221; We said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! How quickly will he walk upon the earth?&#8221; Thereupon he said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Like cloud driven by the wind (i.e., very quickly). He will come to the people and call them to his obedience and they will affirm their faith in him and respond to him. He will then give command to the sky and it will send its rain upon the earth and he will then send his command to the earth and it will grow vegetation. Then in the evening their pasturing animals will come to them with their humps very high and their udders full of milk and their flanks stretched. He will then come to another people and invite them, but they will reject him and he will leave them, in barren lands and without any goods and chattels! He would then walk through the waste land and say to it: `Bring forth your treasures&#8217;, and the treasures will come out and follow him like swarms of bees. He will then call a person brimming with youth and strike him with the sword and cut him into two pieces and make these pieces lie at a distance, which is generally between the archer and his target. He will then call that young man and he will come forward, laughing, with his face gleaming out of joy; and it will be at this very time that Allah will send `Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary) who will descend at the white minaret in the eastern side of Damascus, wearing two garments lightly dyed and placing his hands on the wings of two angels. When he will lower his head, there would fall drops of water from his head, and when he will raise it up, drops like pearls would scatter from it. Every disbeliever who will find his (i.e., `Isa&#8217;s) smell will die and his smell will reach as far as he will be able to see. He will then search for Dajjal until he will catch hold of him at the gate of Ludd (village near Jerusalem), and will kill him. Then the people, whom Allah will have protected, will come to `Isa son of Maryam, and he will wipe their faces and will inform them of their ranks in Jannah, and it will be under such conditions that Allah will reveal to `Isa these words: `I have brought forth from amongst my slaves such people against whom none will be able to fight, so take these people safely to the mountain.&#8217; And then Allah will send Ya&#8217;juj and Ma&#8217;juj (Gog and Magog people) and they will sworn down from every slope. The first of them will pass the Lake Tabariyah (near the Dead Sea in Palestine) and drink all its water. And when the last of them will pass, he will say: `There was once water there.&#8217; Prophet `Isa (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and his companions will then be so much hard-pressed that the head of an ox will be dearer to them than one hundred dinar, and `Isa along with his companions, will make supplication to Allah, Who will send insects which will attack their (Ya&#8217;juj and Ma&#8217;juj people) neck until they all will perish like a single person. Prophet, `¦sa and his companions will then come down and they will not find in the earth as much space as a single span which would not be filled with their corpses and their stench. Prophet `Isa and his companions will then again beseech Allah, Who will send birds whose necks will be like those of Bactrian camels, and they will carry them and throw them where Allah will desire. Then Allah will send down rain which will spare no house in the city or in the countryside. It would wash away the earth until it appears like a mirror. Then the earth will be told to bring forth its fruit and restore its blessings; and as a result of this, there will grow such a big pomegranate that a group of people will eat from it and seek shelter under its skin. Milk will be so blessed that the milk of one she-camel will suffice for a large company and the cow will give so much milk, that it will suffice for a whole tribe. The sheep will give so much milk that the whole family will be able to drink out of that, and at that time Allah will send a pleasant wind which will soothe people even under their armpits, and will take the life of every Muslim and true believer, and only the wicked will survive. They will commit adultery in public like asses and the Resurrection Day will be held</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1809.</b> Rib`i bin Hirash (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I accompanied Abu Mas`ud Al-Ansari to Hudaifah bin Al-Yaman (May Allah be pleased with them). Abu Mas`ud said to him: &#8220;Tell us what you heard from the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) about Dajjal (the Antichrist).&#8221; Hudaifah said: He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Dajjal will appear, and with him will be water and fire. That which people consider to be water will in fact be a burning fire, and that which people will consider to be fire will in fact be cool and sweet water. He who from amongst you happens to face him, should jump into that which he sees as fire for that will be nice and sweet water.</span>&#8221; Abu Mas`ud said: &#8220;I have also heard this from the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam).&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1810.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Dajjal (the Antichrist) will appear in my Ummah and he will stay in the world for forty. I do not know whether this will be forty days or forty months or forty years. Allah will then send (Prophet) `Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary). `Isa will pursue him and slaughter him. Then people will survive for seven years (i.e., after the demise of `Isa) in the state that there will be no rancour between two persons. Then Allah will send a cool breeze from the side of Ash-Sham. None will remain upon the face of the earth having the smallest particle of good or Faith in him but he will die, so much so that even if someone amongst you will enter the innermost part of a mountain, this breeze will reach that place also and will cause him to die. Only the wicked people will survive and they will be as fast as birds (i.e., to commit evil) and as ferocious towards one another as wild beasts. They will never appreciate the good, nor condemn evil. Then Shaitan (Satan) will come to them in the garb of a man and will say: `Will you not obey me?&#8217; They will say: `What do you order us to do?&#8217; He will command them to worship idols. They will have abundance of sustenance and will lead comfortable lives. Then the Trumpet will be blown. Every one hearing it, will turn his neck towards it and will raise it. The first one to hear that Trumpet will be a man who will be busy repairing the basin for his camels. He will become unconscious. Allah will send, or will cause to send, rain which will be like dew and there will grow out of it (like wild growth) the bodies of the people. Then the second Trumpet will be blown and they will stand up and begin to look around. Then it will be said: `O people! Go to your Rubb.&#8217; Then there will be a command: `Make them stand there.&#8217; After it they will be called to account. Then it will be said: `Separate from them the share of the Fire.&#8217; It will be asked: `How much?&#8217; It will be said: `Nine hundred and ninety-nine out of every thousand.&#8217; That will be the Day which will make children hoary-headed men because of its terror and that will be the Day when the Shin will be uncovered</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1811.</b> Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">There will be no land which will not be trampled by Dajjal (the Antichrist) but Makkah and Al-Madinah; and there will be no passage leading to them which will not be guarded by the angels, arranged in rows. Dajjal will appear in a barren place adjacent to Al-Madinah and the city will be shaken three times. Allah will expel from it every disbeliever and hypocrite.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1812.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Dajjal (the Antichrist) will be followed by seventy thousand Jews of Isfahan and will be dressed in robes of green coloured satin</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1813.</b> Umm Sharik (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: I heard the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">People will run away from Dajjal (the Antichrist) seeking shelter in the mountains.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1814.</b> `Imran bin Hussain (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Between time of the creation of Adam and the Resurrection Day, there is nothing greater than the mischief of Dajjal (the Antichrist).</span>&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1815.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Dajjal (the Antichrist) will come forth and a person from amongst the believers will go towards him and the armed watchmen of Dajjal will meet him and they will say to him: `Where do you intend to go?&#8217; He will say: `I intend to go to this one who has appeared.&#8217; They will say to him: `Don&#8217;t you believe in our lord (meaning Dajjal)?&#8217; He will say: `There (i.e., we know Him to be Allah, Alone, without any partners) is nothing hidden about our Rubb.&#8217; Some of them will say: `Let us kill him&#8217;, but some others will say: `Has your lord (Dajjal) not forbidden you to kill anyone without his consent?&#8217; So they will take him to Dajjal. When the believer will see him, he will say: `O people! This is Dajjal about whom the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) has informed us.&#8217; Dajjal will have him laid on his stomach and have his head. He will be struck on his back and on his stomach. Dajjal will ask him: `Don&#8217;t you believe in me?&#8217; He will say: `You are the false Messiah.&#8217; He will then give his order to have him sawn with a saw into two from the parting of his hair up to his legs. After that Dajjal will walk between the two halves and will say to him: `Stand up&#8217;, and he will stand on his feet. He will then say to him: `Don&#8217;t you believe in me?&#8217; The person will say: `It has added to my insight that you are Dajjal&#8217;. He will add: `O people! He will not be able to behave with anyone amongst people in such a manner after me.&#8217; Dajjal will try to kill him. The space between his neck and collarbone will turn into copper and he will find no way to kill him. So he will catch hold of him by his hand and feet and throw him into (what appears to be the fire). The people will think that he has been thrown into the fire whereas he will be thrown into Jannah.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) added, &#8220;He will be the most eminent amongst the people with regard to martyrdom near the Rubb of the worlds</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1816.</b> Al-Mughirah bin Shu`bah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: No one asked the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) more about Dajjal than I asked him. He said to me, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He will not harm you</span>.&#8221; I said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, it is reported that he will have with him a mountain of bread and a river full of water.&#8221; Thereupon he said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He (Dajjal) is far too worthless and insignificant near Allah (to let him deceive the believers).</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1817.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">There has not been a Prophet who has not warned his Ummah of that one-eyed liar (Dajjal). Behold, he is blind in one eye and your Rubb (Allah) is not blind. On his forehead are the letters: (K.F.R.) (meaning Kafir- disbeliever</span>).&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1818.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Let me tell you something about Dajjal (the Antichrist) which no Prophet had told his people. He is blind (in one eye) and will bring with him something like Jannah and Hell; but what he calls Jannah will be in fact Hell</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1819.</b> `Abdullah bin `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said: One day the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) mentioned Al-Masih Dajjal (the Antichrist) in the presence of the people and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Verily, Allah is not one-eyed but Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal is blind in the right eye which looks like a swollen grape</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1820.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah(sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The Last Hour will not come until the Muslims fight against the Jews, until a Jew will hide himself behind a stone or a tree, and the stone or the tree will say: `O Muslim, there is a Jew behind me. Come and kill him,&#8217; but Al-Gharqad tree will not say so, for it is the tree of the Jews.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1821.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, the world will not come to an end until a man passes by a grave and will lie over it saying, `Would that I were in this grave (i.e., dead)!&#8217; Not he will say so because of religious reasons but because of widespread mischief and severe trials of this world</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1822.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The Hour will not come to pass before the River Euphrates dries up to unveil the mountain of gold, for which people will fight. Ninety-nine out of one hundred will die (in the fighting) and every man amongst them will say: `Perhaps I may be the only one to remain alive</span>.&#8221;&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The time is near when the River Euphrates will dry up to unveil a treasure of gold. Whosoever may be alive at that time, should not take anything of it</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1823.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">People will desert Al-Madinah in spite of it being in better condition except for wild beasts and birds. The Last Hour will happen upon two shepherds of the tribe of Muzainah. They will enter Al-Madinah driving their sheep but will find it full of wild beasts and would turn away.

I am not afraid that you will associate anything with Allah in worship after (my demise), but I apprehend that you will vie with one another for the life of the world.</span>&#8221; The narrator said: It was the last time that I saw the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam).<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are some more narrations with very minor changes in its wording.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1861.</b> Abu Zaid `Amr bin Akhtab Al-Ansari (May Allah be pleased with him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) led us in the morning (Fajr) prayer and he ascended the pulpit and addressed us until it was the time for the Zuhr prayer. He then came down the pulpit and led us in Salat (prayer). Again he ascended the pulpit and addressed until it was the time for the `Asr prayer. He then again came down, led us in Salat and again ascended the pulpit and addressed us until sunset. He informed us of everything that lay hidden in the past and what will happen in the future; and the most learned amongst us is the one who has preserved it in his memory.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1862.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who vows to obey Allah, should obey Him. But he who vows to disobey Allah, should not disobey Him</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1863.</b> Umm Sharik (May Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) ordered me to kill chameleon. He also said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">It blew (fire) on Prophet Ibrahim.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1864.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who kills a chameleon at the first blow, such and such number of good deeds will be awarded to him; whoever kills it at the second blow, such and such number of merits will be recorded for him. And if he kills it at the third blow, he will get such and such merits.</span>&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If anyone kills a chameleon with the first blow, a hundred good deeds will be recorded for him; less than that will be recorded for him if he kills it at the second blow, and still less rewards will be recorded for him if he kills it at the third blow</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1865.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A man (from amongst the people before you) said: `Indeed! I will give in charity.&#8217; So he took his Sadaqah out and placed it in a thief&#8217;s hand. In the morning the people were talking (about this incident) and saying: `Sadaqah was given to a thief last night.&#8217; The man said: `O Allah! Praise be to You. I have given Sadaqah to a thief. Indeed, I will give in charity!&#8217; So he took his Sadaqah out and he placed it in a prostitute&#8217;s hand. In the morning the people were talking (about this incident) and saying: `Sadaqah was given to a prostitute last night.&#8217; On hearing this, the man said: `Praise be to You, O Allah! I gave Sadaqah to a prostitute. Indeed, I will give in charity!&#8217; So he took his Sadaqah out and placed it in a rich man&#8217;s hand. In the morning the people were talking (about this incident) and saying: `Sadaqah was given to a rich man last night.&#8217; The man said: `O Allah! Praise be to You (for helping me) give charity to a thief, a prostitute and a rich man.&#8217; Then he had a dream in which he was told that his Sadaqah to the thief might result in his refraining from his theft, his Sadaqah to the prostitute might help her abstain from her immorality, and his Sadaqah to the rich man might help him pay heed and spend from what Allah had bestowed upon him</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1866.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: We accompanied the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) to a banquet. The meat of the forearm was presented to him as he was very fond of it. The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) ate a morsel of it and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">I will be the master of all the people on the Day of Resurrection. Do you know why? Allah will gather all human beings, past and present generations on the same ground so that the announcer may be able to make them all hear his voice and the onlookers may be able to see all of them. The sun will come very close to the people, they will suffer such distress and trouble as they will not be able to bear. Then the people will say: `Do you see our (miserable) condition? You should look for someone who can intercede for you with your Rubb.&#8217; Some people will say to the others: `Go to your father, Adam.&#8217; So they will go to Adam and say to him: `You are the father of mankind; Allah created you with His Own Hand, and breathed into you of His spirit, ordered the angels to prostrate before you and He made you dwell in Jannah. So (please) intercede for us with your Rubb. Do you not see our (miserable) condition?&#8217; Adam will say: `Today my Rubb has become so angry as He has never been before, nor will He ever become angry after this. He forbade me to approach the tree, but I disobeyed Him. I am worried about myself. Go to someone else. Go to (Prophet) Nuh (Noah).&#8217; They will come to Nuh and will say to him: `O Nuh! You are the first of Messenger of Allah to the people on the earth, and Allah has named you a grateful slave. Please intercede for us with your Rubb. Do you not see our (miserable) condition?&#8217; He will say: `Today my Rubb his become so angry as He has never been before, nor will He become angry hereafter. I was granted the right to make one definitely accepted invocation. I availed of this opportunity and made it against my nation. I am worried about myself. Go to someone else. Go to (Prophet) Ibrahim (Abraham).&#8217; They will go to Ibrahim and say to him: `O Ibrahim, you are Messenger of Allah and His Khalil (the intimate friend of Allah) from among the people of the earth; so please intercede for us with your Rubb. Don&#8217;t you see our (miserable) condition?&#8217; He will say to them: `Today my Rubb has become so angry as He has never been before; nor will he ever be so hereafter. I had told three lies. I am worried about myself. Go to someone else. Go to (Prophet) Musa (Moses).&#8217; The people will then go to Musa and say to him: `O Musa! You are Messenger of Allah and Allah gave you superiority above the others with His Message and with His direct Talk to you, so intercede for us with your Rubb. Do you not see our (miserable) condition?&#8217; Musa will say: `Today my Rubb has become so angry as he has never been before, nor will He ever be hereafter. I killed a man whom I had not been ordered to kill. I am worried about myself. Go to someone else. Go to (Prophet) `Isa (Jesus).&#8217; So they will go to `¦sa and say to him: `O `Isa! You are Messenger of Allah and His Word (i.e., &#8220;Be&#8221;-and he was) which he bestowed on Maryam (Mary) and a spirit created by Him; and you talked to the people while you were in the cradle. Please intercede for us with your Rubb. Do you not see our (miserable) condition?&#8217; `¦sa will say: `Today my Rubb has become so angry as He has never been before, nor will He ever be like this hereafter.&#8217; `Isa will not mention any sin, but will say: `I am worried about myself. Go to someone else. Go to Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam).</span>&#8221;&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Another narration is: The Messenger of Allah said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">They will come to me and say: `O Muhammad! You are the Messenger of Allah and the Last of Prophets, and Allah has forgiven your past and future sins. Please intercede for us with your Rubb. Do you not see our (miserable) condition?&#8221;&#8217; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) added, &#8220;Then I will proceed under Allah&#8217;s Throne and fall down in prostration before my Rubb. Then, He will bestow upon me knowledge of such praises and glorification to Him as He has never bestowed upon anybody else before me. Then I will be addressed: `O Muhammad! Raise your head. Ask, and your request will be granted. Intercede, and your intercession will be accepted.&#8217; So I will raise my head and say: `My followers, O my Rubb! My followers, O my Rubb! My followers, O my Rubb!&#8217; It will be said: `O Muhammad! Admit into Jannah such people as are not subjected to reckoning through the right gate of Jannah.&#8217; The rest of them will be admitted along with the rest of mankind through the various gates of Jannah.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) further said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is! The distance between every two sides of the gates of Jannah is like the distance between Makkah and Hajar, or that between Makkah and Busra (Syria).</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1867.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Ibrahim (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) brought his wife and her son Isma`il (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka`bah under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. In those days, there was no human being in Makkah, nor was there any water. So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Isma`il&#8217;s mother followed him saying: &#8220;O Ibrahim! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?&#8221; She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her. Then she asked him: &#8220;Has Allah commanded you to do so?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Yes.&#8221; She said: &#8220;Then He will not neglect us.&#8221; She returned while Ibrahim proceeded onwards. Having reached the Thaniya, where they could not see him, he faced Ka`bah, raised his both hands and supplicated: &#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">O our Rubb! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in an uncultivable valley by Your Sacred House (the Ka`bah at Makkah) in order, O our Rubb, that they may perform As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat). So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits so that they may give thanks.</span>&#8221; (14:37).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Isma`il&#8217;s mother went on suckling Isma`il and drinking from the water which she had. When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at Isma`il, tossing in agony. She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of As-Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from As-Safa, and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble till she crossed the valley and reached Al-Marwah mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between As-Safa and Al-Marwah) seven times.&#8221; Ibn `Abbas further related: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">This is the source of the tradition of the Sa`y &#8211; i.e., the going of people between the two mountains. When she reached Al-Marwah (for the last time), she heard a voice and she exclaimed: `Shshs!&#8217; (Silencing herself) and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said: `O (whoever you may be) You have made me hear your voice; have you any succour for me?&#8217; And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or with his wing), till water flowed out from that place. She started to make something like of a basin around it, using her hands in this way and began to fill her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out until she had scooped some of it</span>.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) further said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">May Allah bestow mercy on Isma&#8217;il&#8217;s mother! Had she let the Zamzam flow without trying to control it (or had she not scooped in that water) while filling her water-skin, Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth</span>.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) further added, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her: `Do not be afraid of being neglected, for this is the site on which the House of Allah will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah will never let neglected His people.&#8217; The House of Allah (the Ka`bah) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She continued living in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum passed by her and her child. As they were coming from through the way of Kada`, in the lower part of Makkah where they saw a bird that had a habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said: `This bird must be flying over water, though we know that there is no water in this valley.&#8217; They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came towards the water</span>.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) added, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Isma`il&#8217;s mother was sitting near the water. They asked her: `Do you allow us to stay with you?&#8217; She replied: `Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water.&#8217; They agreed to that</span>.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) further said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Isma`il&#8217;s mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them. The child (i.e., Isma`il) grew up and learnt Arabic from them (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty, they gave him one of their daughters in marriage. After Isma`il&#8217;s mother had died, Ibrahim came after Isma`il&#8217;s marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Isma`il there. When he asked Isma`il&#8217;s wife about him, she replied: `He has gone in search of our livelihood.&#8217; Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied complaining to him: `We are living in hardship, misery and destitution.&#8217; He said: `When your husband returns, convey my salutations to him and tell him to change the threshold of the door of his house.&#8217; When Isma`il came, he seemed to have perceived something unusual. He asked his wife: `Did anyone visit you?&#8217; She replied: `Yes, an old man of such and such description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and, I told him that we were living in hardship and poverty.&#8217; Thereupon Isma`il said: `Did he advise you anything?&#8217; She replied: `Yes, he told me to convey his salutations to you and to change the threshold of your door.&#8217; Isma`il said: `That was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family.&#8217; So Isma`il divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (Jurhum). Then Ibrahim stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them again but did not find Isma`il. So he came to Isma`il&#8217;s wife and asked her about him. She said: `He has gone in search of our livelihood.&#8217; Ibrahim asked her about their sustenance and living: `How are you getting on?&#8217; She replied: `We are prosperous and well off.&#8217; Then she praised Allah, the Exalted. Ibrahim asked: `What kind of food do you eat?&#8217; She said: `Meat.&#8217; He said: `What do you drink?&#8217; She said: `Water.&#8217; He said, `O Allah! Bless their meat and water!</span>&#8221;&#8217; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) added, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it</span>.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) further said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected because these things do not suit him unless he lives in Makkah</span>.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) added, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Then Ibrahim said to Isma`il&#8217;s wife, `When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his door.&#8217; When Isma`il came back, he asked his wife: `Did anyone call on you?&#8217; She replied: `Yes, a good looking old man came to me.&#8217; She praised him and added: `He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in good condition.&#8217; Isma`il asked her: `Did he give you a piece of advice?&#8217; She said: `Yes, he told me to convey his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your door.&#8217; On that Isma`il said: `He was my father and you are the threshold of the door. He has ordered me to keep you with me.&#8217; Then Ibrahim stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them afterwards. He saw Isma`il under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Ibrahim, he rose up to welcome him, and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father. Ibrahim said: `O Isma`il! Allah has given me an order.&#8217; Isma`il said: `Do what your Rubb has commanded you to do.&#8217; Ibrahim asked: `Will you help me?&#8217; Isma`il said: `I will help you.&#8217; Ibrahim said: `Allah has ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it</span>.&#8221;&#8217; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) added, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e., Ka`bah). Isma`il brought the stones and Ibrahim was building (the house). When the walls became high, Isma`il brought stone and placed it for Ibrahim who stood over it and carried on building the House, while Isma`il was handing over the stones to him, both of them prayed: `O our Rubb! Accept this service from us! Verily, You are the All-Hearer and the All-Knower</span>.&#8221;&#8217;<br />

Chapter 361<br />
Undesirability of departing from or coming to a Place stricken by a Epidemic</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Wheresoever you may be, death will overtake you even if you are in fortresses built up strong and high!</b></span><b>&#8221; (4:78)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>And do not throw yourselves into destruction.</b></span><b>&#8221; (2:195)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1791.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: `Umar bin Al-Khattab (May Allah be pleased with him) set out for Ash-Sham (the region comprising Syria, Palestine, Lebanon and Jordan). As he reached at Sargh (<span style="color:#800000;">a town by the side of Hijaz</span>) he came across the governor of <span style="color:#800000;">Al-Ajnad</span>, Abu<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';"> `</span>Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah (May Allah be pleased with him) and his companions. They informed him that an                                                                                                                                                                             had broken out in Syria. Ibn `Abbas relates: `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) said to me: &#8220;Call to me the earliest Muhajirun (Emigrants).&#8221; So I called them. He sought their advice and told them that an epidemic had broken out in Ash-Sham. There was a difference of opinion whether they should proceed further or retreat to their homes in such a situation. Some of them said: &#8220;You have set forth to fight the enemy, and therefore you should not go back;&#8221; whereas some of them said: &#8220;As you have along with you many eminent Companions of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), we would not advice you to set forth to the place of the plague (and thus expose them deliberately to a danger).&#8221; `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;You can now go away.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Call to me the Ansar (the Helpers).&#8221; So I called them to him, and he consulted them and they differed in their opinions as well. He said: &#8220;Now, you may go.&#8221; He again said: &#8220;Call the old (wise people) of the Quraish who had emigrated before the conquest of Makkah.&#8221; I called them. `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) consulted them in this issue and not even two persons among them differed in the opinions. They said: &#8220;We think that you should go back along with the people and do not take them to this scourge. `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) made an announcement to the people, saying: &#8220;In the morning I intend to go back, and I want you to do the same.&#8221; Abu &#8216;Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;Are you going to run away from the Divine Decree?&#8221; Thereupon `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;O Abu &#8216;Ubaidah ! Had it been someone else to say this.&#8221; (&#8216;Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) did not like to differ with him). He said: &#8220;Yes, we are running from the Divine Decree to the Divine Decree. What do you think if you have camels and you happen to get down a valley having two sides, one of them covered with foliage and the other being barren, will you not act according to the Divine Decree if you graze them in vegetative land? In case you graze them in the barren land, even then you will be doing so according to the Divine Decree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There happened to come `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf who had been absent for some of his needs. He said: I have knowledge about it. I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If you get wind of the outbreak of plague in a land, you should not enter it; but if it spreads in the land where you are, you should not depart from it</span>.&#8221; Thereupon `Umar bin Khattab (May Allah be pleased with him) praised Allah and went back.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1775.</b> Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) forbade that a person in the city should make a deal on behalf of a villager on commission even if he is his real brother</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1776.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do not meet the merchandise till they arrive in the market</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1777.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The caravans carrying merchandise should not be met on the way to purchase from them; a man in the city should not sell for a man of the desert.</span>&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tawus asked him (Ibn `Abbas): &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">What do these words really imply?</span>&#8221; He said<span style="color:#008000;">: &#8220;He should not work as an agent on his behalf.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1778.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) forbade that a man in the city should be the commission agent of a man from the desert and prohibited the practice of Najsh (i.e., offering a high price for something in order to allure another customer who is interested in the thing); and that a man should make an offer while the offer of his brother is pending; or that he should make a proposal of marriage while that of his brother is pending; or that a woman should try that a sister of hers might be divorced so that she might take her place</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">     Another narration is: <span style="color:#008000;">The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) forbade the people from meeting the caravan on the way for entering into business transaction with them; and the selling of the goods by a dweller of the city on behalf of a man of the desert; and the seeking by a woman the divorce of her sister (from her husband); and the practice of Najsh and leaving the animals unmilked (for sometime for the purpose of accumulation of milk to deceive the buyer)</span>.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1779.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A person should not enter into a transaction when his (Muslim) brother has already negotiated, nor should he make a proposal of marriage when that of his brother is pending, except with the permission of the latter</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1780.</b> `Uqbah bin `Amir (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A Mu&#8217;min is the brother of another Mu&#8217;min; and thus it is not permissible for a Mu&#8217;min to make an offer while the offer of his brother is pending, nor should he make a proposal of marriage while that of his brother is pending till he withdraws his proposal</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>

Chapter 356<br />
Prohibition of Squandering Wealth</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1781.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Verily, Allah likes three things for you and disapproves three things for you. He likes that you should worship Him Alone, not to associate anything with Him (in worship) and to hold fast to the Rope of Allah and not to be divided among yourselves; and He disapproves for you irrelevant talk, persistent questioning and the squandering of the wealth.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1782.</b> Warrad, the scribe of Al-Mughirah bin Shu`bah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: Al-Mughirah bin Shu`bah dictated a letter to me addressed to Mu`awiyah  (May Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to supplicate at the end of each obligatory Salat (prescribed prayer): &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">La ilaha illallahu, wahadahu la sharika lahu, lahul-mulku, wa lahul-hamdu, wa Huwa `ala kulli shai&#8217;in Qadir. Allahumma la mani`a lima a`taita, wa la mu`tiya lima mana`ta, wa la yanfa`u dhal-jaddi mink-al-jaddu. (There is no true god except Allah, the One, Who has no partner. His is the sovereignty and His is the praise, and He is Able to do everything. O Allah! Nobody can withhold what You give; and nobody can give what You withhold; and the high status of a person is of no avail against Your Will)</span>.&#8221; He also wrote to him that the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to forbid irrelevant talk, wasteful expenditure, persistent questioning, disobedience of parents (especially mothers), infanticide of daughters by burying them alive, depriving others of their rights and acquisition of property wrongfully.<br />

Chapter 367<br />
Prohibition of attributing wrong Fatherhood</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1802.</b> Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who (falsely) attributes his fatherhood to anyone besides his real father, knowing that he is not his father, will be forbidden to enter Jannah.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1803.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do not turn away from your fathers, for he who turns away from his father, will be guilty of committing an act of disbelief.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1804.</b> Yazid bin Sharik bin Tariq (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I saw `Ali (May Allah be pleased with him) giving a Khutbah (sermon) from the pulpit and I heard him saying: &#8220;By Allah, we have no book to read except Allah&#8217;s Book and what is written in this scroll. He unrolled the scroll which showed a list of what sort of camels to be given as blood-money, and other legal matters relating to killing game in the sanctuary of Makkah and the expiation thereof. In it was also written: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: `<span style="color:#0000ff;">Al-Madinah is a sanctuary from `Air to Thaur (mountains). He who innovates in this territory new ideas in Islam, commits a sin therein, or shelters the innovators, will incur the Curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, and Allah will accept from him neither repentance nor a ransom on the Day of Resurrection. The asylum (pledge of protection) granted by any Muslim (even of the) lowest status is to be honoured and respected by all other Muslims, and whoever betrays a Muslim in this respect (by violating the pledge) will incur the Curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people; and Allah will accept from him neither repentance nor a ransom on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever attributes his fatherhood to someone other than his (real) father, and takes someone else as his master other than his (real) master without his permission, will incur the Curse of Allah, the angels and all the people, and Allah will accept from him neither repentance nor a ransom on the Day of Resurrection</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1805.</b> Abu Dharr (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A person who attributes his fatherhood to anyone other than his real father, knowing that he is not his father, commits an act of disbelief. And he who makes a claim of anything which in fact does not belong to him, is none of us. He should make his abode in Hell, and he who labels anyone as disbeliever or calls him the enemy of Allah and he is in fact not so, his charge will revert to him</span>.&#8221;<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1801.</b> Qais bin Abu Hazim ¨(May Allah be pleased with him)<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">(</span>c) said: <span style="color:#008000;">Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) came upon a woman named Zainab from the Ahmas tribe and noticed that she was observing total silence. He said: &#8220;What has happened to her? Why does she not speak?&#8221; People informed him that she had sworn to remain silent. He then said to her: &#8220;You should speak, it is not permissible (to observe silence), for it is an act of the Days of Ignorance (Jahiliyyah).&#8221; (After hearing this) she started speaking</span>.<br />

Chapter 371<br />
Seeking Forgiveness</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">And ask forgiveness for your sin&#8230;</span>&#8221; (47:19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">And seek the forgiveness of Allah. Certainly, Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</span>&#8221; (4:106)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">And declare the freedom of your Rubb from imperfection beginning with His praise, and ask His forgiveness. Verily, He is the One Who accepts the repentance and Who forgives.</span>&#8221; (110:3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">For Al-Muttaqun (the pious) there are Gardens (Jannah) with their Rubb, underneath which rivers flow. Therein (is their) eternal (home) and Azwajun Mutahharatun (purified mates or wives). And Allah will be pleased with them. And Allah is All-Seer of the (His) slaves. Those who say: `Our Rubb! We have indeed believed, so forgive us our sins and save us from the punishment of the Fire. (They are) those who are patient, those who are true (in Faith, words, and deeds), and obedient with sincere devotion in worship to Allah. Those who spend (give the Zakat and alms in the way of Allah) and those who pray and beg Allah&#8217;s Pardon in the last hours of the night.</span>&#8221; (3:15-17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">And whoever does evil or wrongs himself but afterwards seeks Allah&#8217;s forgiveness, he will find Allah Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</span>&#8221; (4:110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">And Allah would not punish them while you (Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) are amongst them, nor will He punish them while they seek (Allah&#8217;s) forgiveness.</span>&#8221; (8:33)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">And those who, when they have committed Fahishah (illegal sexual intercourse) or wronged themselves with evil, remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their sins; &#8211; and none can forgive sins but Allah &#8211; and do not persist in what (wrong) they have done, while they know</span>.&#8221; (3:135)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;anic Ayat on the subject are many and well-known<b>.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1869.</b>  Al-Agharr Al-Muzani (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Sometimes I perceive a veil over my heart, and I supplicate Allah for forgiveness a hundred times in a day</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1870.</b>  Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">I swear by Allah that I seek Allah&#8217;s Pardon and turn to Him in repentance more than seventy times a day</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1871.</b>  Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;By the One in Whose Hand my soul is! If you do not commit sins, Allah would replace you with a people who would commit sins and seek forgiveness from Allah; and Allah will certainly forgive them</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1872.</b>  Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said: We counted Messenger&#8217;s saying a hundred times during one single sitting:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> Rabb-ighfir li</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span><span style="color:#0000ff;"> wa tubb `alayya, innaka Antat-Tawwabur-Rahim.

[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1873.</b>  Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If anyone constantly seeks pardon (from Allah), Allah will appoint for him a way out of every distress and a relief from every anxiety, and will provide sustenance for him from where he expects not</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1874.</b>  Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who says: `Astaghfir ullah-alladhi la ilaha illa Huwal-Haiyul-Qayyumu, wa atubu ilaihi (I seek the forgiveness of Allah, there is no true god except Allah, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting, and I turn to Him in repentance),&#8217; his sins will be forgiven even if he should have run away from the battlefield (while he was engaged in fighting for the Cause of Allah)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and Al-Hakim (on conditions of Al-Bukhari and Muslim for accepting Hadith)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1875.</b>  Shaddad bin Aus (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The best supplication for seeking forgiveness (Syed-ul-Istighfar) is to say: `Allahumma Anta Rabbi</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span><span style="color:#0000ff;"> la ilaha illa Anta, khalaqtani wa ana `abduka, wa ana `ala `ahdika wa wa`dika mastata`tu, a`udhu bika min sharri ma sana`tu, abu</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">&#8216;</span><span style="color:#0000ff;">u laka bini`matika `alayya, wa abu</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">&#8216;</span><span style="color:#0000ff;">u bidhanbi faghfir li</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span><span style="color:#0000ff;"> fa innahu la yaghfirudh-dhunuba illa Anta. (O Allah! You are my Rubb. There is no true god except You. You have created me, and I am Your slave, and I hold to Your Covenant as far as I can. I seek refuge in You from the evil of what I have done. I acknowledge the favours that You have bestowed upon me, and I confess my sins. Pardon me, for none but You has the power to pardon).&#8217; He who supplicates in these terms during the day with firm belief in it and dies on the same day (before the evening), he will be one of the dwellers of Jannah; and if anyone supplicates in these terms during the night with firm belief in it and dies before the morning, he will be one of the dwellers of Jannah</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1876.</b> Thauban (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Whenever the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) finished his Salat (prayer), he would beg forgiveness three times [by saying, `Astaghfirullah&#8217; (3 times)] and then he would say: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allahumma Antas-Salamu, wa minkas-Salamu, tabarakta ya Dhal-Jalali wal-Ikram. (O Allah! You are the Bestower of security and security comes from You; Blessed are You. O Possessor of glory and honour).&#8221; Imam Al-Auza`i</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';"> (</span><span style="color:#0000ff;">one of the subnarrators) of this Hadith was asked: &#8220;How forgiveness should be sought?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;I say: Astaghfirullah, Astaghfirullah (I seek forgiveness from Allah. I seek forgiveness from Allah)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1877.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: Prior to his demise, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to supplicate frequently:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> Subhan Allahi wa bihamdihi; Astaghfirullaha wa atubu ilaihi (Allah is free from imperfection, and I begin with praising Him. I beg forgiveness from Allah and I turn to Him in repentance</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1878.</b>  Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allah, the Exalted, has said: `O son of Adam! I shall go on forgiving you so long as you pray to Me and aspire for My forgiveness whatever may be your sins. O son of Adam! I do not care even if your sins should pile up to the sky and should you beg pardon of Me, I would forgive you. O son of Adam! If you come to Me with an earthful of sins and meet Me, not associating anything with Me in worship, I will certainly grant you as much pardon as will fill the earth.</span>&#8221;&#8217;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1879.</b>  Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">O women folk! You should give charity and be diligent in seeking Allah&#8217;s forgiveness because I have seen (i.e., on the Night of the Ascension to the highest heavens) that dwellers of the Hell are women.&#8221; A woman amongst them said: &#8220;Why is it that the majority of the dwellers of Hell are women?&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;You curse frequently and are ungrateful to your husbands. In spite of your lacking in wisdom and failing in religion, you are depriving the wisest of men of their intelligence.&#8221; Upon this the woman asked: &#8220;What is the deficiency in our wisdom and in our religion?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;Your lack of wisdom can be well judged from the fact that the evidence of two women is equal to that one man. You do not offer Salat (prayer) for some days and you do not fast (the whole of) Ramadan sometimes, it is a deficiency in religion</span>.&#8221;<br />

Undesirability of Praising a Person in his Presence</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1788.</b> Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) heard a person lauding another person or praising him too much. Thereupon he said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">You killed the man,</span>&#8221; or he said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">You ruined the man</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1789.</b> Abu Bakrah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Mention of a man was made to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and someone praised him whereupon he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, <span style="color:#0000ff;">&#8220;Woe be to you! You have broken the neck of your friend!</span>&#8221; He repeated this several times and added, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If one of you has to praise his friend at all, he should say: `I reckon him to be such and such and Allah knows him well&#8217;, if you think him to be so-and-so, you will be accountable to Allah because no one can testify the purity of others against Allah.</span>&#8221;<br />

Chapter 372<br />
Some of the Bounties which Allah has prepared for the Believers in Paradise</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Truly, the Muttaqun (the pious and righteous persons) will be amidst Gardens and water-springs (Jannah). (It will be said to them): `Enter therein (Jannah), in peace and security.&#8217; And We shall remove from their breasts any deep feeling of bitterness (that they may have). (So they will be like) brothers facing each other on thrones. No sense of fatigue shall touch them, nor shall they (ever) be asked to leave it</b></span><b>.&#8221; (15:45-48)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>(It will be said to the believers of Islamic Monotheism): `My slaves! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve. (You) who believed in Our Ayat (proofs, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and were Muslims (i.e., who submit totally to Allah&#8217;s Will, and believe in the Oneness of Allah). Enter Jannah, you and your wives, in happiness.&#8217; Trays of gold and cups will be passed round them; (there will be) therein all that inner-selves could desire, and all that eyes could delight in and you will abide therein forever. This is the Jannah which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds which you used to do (in the life of the world). Therein for you will be fruits in plenty, of which you will eat (as you desire).</b></span><b>&#8221; (43:68-73)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Verily, the Muttaqun (the pious), will be in place of security (Jannah). Among Gardens and springs. Dressed in fine silk and (also) in thick silk, facing each other. So (it will be). And We shall marry them to Hur (fair females) with wide, lovely eyes. They will call therein for every kind of fruit in peace and security. They will never taste death therein except the first death (of this world), and He will save them from the torment of the blazing Fire. As a bounty from your Rubb! That will be the supreme success!</b></span><b>&#8221; (44:51-57)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Verily, Al-Abrar (the pious and righteous) will be in Delight (Jannah). On thrones, looking (at all things). You will recognise in their faces the brightness of delight. They will be given to drink of pure sealed wine. The last thereof (that wine) will be the smell of musk, and for this let (all) those strive who want to strive (i.e., hasten earnestly to the obedience of Allah). It (that wine) will be mixed with Tasnim. A spring whereof drink those nearest to Allah</b></span><b>.&#8221; (83:22-28)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;anic Ayat on the subject are many and well-known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1880.</b> Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The inhabitants of Jannah will eat and drink therein, but they will not have to pass excrement, to blow their noses or to urinate. Their food will be digested producing belch which will give out a smell like that of musk. They will be inspired to declare the freedom of Allah from imperfection and proclaim His Greatness as easily as you breathe</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1881.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allah, the Exalted, has said: `I have prepared for my righteous slaves what no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and the mind of no man has conceived.&#8217; If you wish, recite</span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`<span style="color:#ff0000;">No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do</span>.&#8221;&#8217; (32:17)<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1882.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The first group (of people) to enter Jannah will be shining like the moon on a full-moon night. Then will come those who follow them who will be like the most shining planet in the sky. They will not stand in need of urinating or relieving of nature or of spitting or blowing their noses. Their combs will be of gold and their sweat will smell like musk; in their censers the aloes-wood will be used. Their wives will be large eyed maidens. All men will be alike in the form of their father `Adam, sixty cubits tall</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Their utensils will be of gold, their perspiration will smell like musk; everyone of them will have two wives; the marrow of the bones of the wives&#8217; legs will be seen through the flesh out of excessive beauty. They (i.e., the people of Jannah) will neither have difference, nor enmity (hatred) amongst themselves; their hearts will be as if one heart, and they will be glorifying Allah in the morning and in the afternoon</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1883.</b> Al-Mughirah bin Shu`bah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Musa (Moses) (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) asked his Rubb: `Who amongst the inhabitants of Jannah will be the lowest in rank?&#8217; He said: `It will be a person who will be admitted into Jannah last of all when all the dwellers of Jannah have entered Jannah. It will be said to him: Enter Jannah. But he will say: O my Rubb! How should I enter while the people have settled in their apartments and taken their shares? It will be said to him: Will you be satisfied and pleased if you have a kingdom like that of a monarch of the world? He will say: I will be content, my Rubb. Allah will say: For you is that, and like that and like that and like that and like that. He will say at the fifth time: I am well-pleased, my Rubb. Allah will say: It is for you and ten times more like it. You will have whatever your soul desires and whatever your eyes could delight in. He will say: I am well-pleased, my Rubb.&#8217; Musa (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: `Who will be of the highest rank in Jannah.&#8217; Allah said: `They are those whom I chose and I established their honour with My Own Hand. I attest with My Seal that they will be blessed with such bounties as no eye has seen, no ear has heard and no human mind has perceived.&#8221;&#8217;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1884.</b> `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">I know of the last of the inhabitants of the Hell to be taken out from there and the last one to enter Jannah. He is a man who will come out of the Fire, crawling on all fours. Allah, the Rubb of glory and honour will say to him: `Go and enter Jannah.&#8217; He will go to it and think that it is full up. He will then come back and say: `O my Rubb, it is full up.&#8217; Allah  will say to him: `Go and enter Jannah.&#8217; He will again go to it and think that it is full up. So he will turn back. Allah will again say: `Go and enter Jannah. For you have what is equal to ten times the world.&#8217; He will say: `Are You making fun of me while You are the King?&#8221; At this I (i.e., the narrator) saw the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) laugh till his premolars were visible and he said, &#8220;Such man will be the last dweller of Jannah in its lowest rank</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1885.</b> Abu Musa (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">In Jannah the believer will have a tent made of a single hollowed pearl of which the length will be sixty miles in the sky. The believer will have his wives with him and he will visit them and they will not be able to see one another</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration from Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) is: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A rider will not be able to cross its (the tree&#8217;s) shade even after travelling for one hundred years</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1887.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The dwellers of Jannah will look at those in the upper abodes above them as you look at a shining star which remains in the eastern or western horizon; such will be the difference in superiority which some of them have over others.&#8221; </span>The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was asked: &#8220;Will those be the dwellings of the Prophets which no one else will be able to reach?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, <span style="color:#0000ff;">&#8220;Yes, but by Him in Whose Hand my soul is! men who believed in Allah and acknowledged the truthfulness of the Messengers will reach them.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1888.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A space in Jannah equal to the distance between the middle and the end of a bow will be better than all that upon which the sun rises and sets</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1889.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">In Jannah there is a market to which the people will come every Friday. The northern wind will blow and shower fragrance on their faces and clothes and, consequently, it will enhance their beauty and loveliness. They will then return to their wives who will also have increased in their beauty and loveliness, and their families will say to them: `We swear by Allah that you have been increased in beauty and loveliness since leaving us.&#8217; Thereupon they will reply: `We swear by Allah that you have also been increased in beauty and loveliness since we left you</span>.&#8221;&#8217;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1890.</b> Sahl bin Sa`d (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The dwellers of Jannah will see the upper abodes of Jannah as you see the stars in the sky</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1891.</b> Sahl bin Sa`d (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I was in the company of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). He gave a description of Jannah and concluded with these words, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">There will be bounties which no eye has seen, no ear has heard and no human heart has ever perceived</span>.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) then recited this Verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">Their sides forsake their beds, to invoke their Rubb in fear and hope, and they spend (in charity in Allah&#8217;s Cause) out of what We have bestowed on them. No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy&#8230;</span>&#8221; (32:16,17)<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1892.</b> Abu Sa`id and Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When the dwellers of Jannah enter Jannah, an announcer will call: (You have a promise from Allah that) you will live therein and you will never die; you will stay healthy therein and you will never fall ill; you will stay young and you will never become old; you will be under a constant bliss and you will never feel miserable</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1893.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The lowest place of any of you in Jannah will be that Allah will tell him to express his wish. He will wish and wish again. Allah will then ask him: `Have you expressed your wish?&#8217; He will answer: `Yes, I have.&#8217; Allah will say: `You will have what you have wished for and the like thereof along with it</span>.&#8221;&#8217;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1894.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allah, the Rubb of honour and glory, will say to the inhabitants of Jannah: `O inhabitants of Jannah!&#8217; They will respond: `Here we are! At Your service, O our Rubb. All good is in Your Hand!&#8217; He will ask them: `Are you pleased?&#8217; They will reply: `Why should we not be pleased, O Rubb, when You have given us what You have not given to any of Your creatures?&#8217; Allah will say: `Shall I not give you something better than that?&#8217; They will ask: `O Rubb! What can be better than that?&#8217; Allah will say: `I shall bestow My Pleasure upon you and I shall never be displeased with you</span>.&#8221;&#8217;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1895.</b> Jarir bin `Abdullah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: We were sitting with the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) when he looked at the full moon and observed, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">You shall see your Rubb in the Hereafter as you are seeing this moon; and you will not feel the slightest inconvenience in seeing Him</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1896.</b> Suhaib (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When the inhabitants of Jannah enter Jannah, Allah, the Glorious and Exalted, will say to them: `Do you wish me to give you anything more?&#8217; They will reply: `Have You not made our faces bright? Have You not brought us into Jannah and delivered us from the Hell?&#8217; And Allah will remove the Veil. The (dwellers of Jannah) will feel that they have not been awarded anything dearer to them than looking at their Rubb</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">Verily, those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, their Rubb will guide them through their Faith; under them will flow rivers in the Gardens of Delight (Jannah). Their way of request therein will be Subhanaka Allahumma (Glory to You, O Allah!) and Salam (peace, safety from evil) will be their greetings therein (Jannah)! and the close of their request will be: Al-hamdu lillahi Rabbil-`Alamin [All the praises and thanks are to Allah, the Rubb of `Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists)]</span>.&#8221; (10:9,10)</p>

Prohibition of Mourning beyond Three Days (For Women)</h5>

Prohibition of raising one&#8217;s Eyes towards the sky during As-Salat (The Prayer)</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1754.</b> Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">How is it that some people raise their eyes towards the sky during As-Salat (the prayer)?</span>&#8221; He stressed (this point) and added, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">People must refrain from raising their eyes towards heaven in Salat (prayer), or else their sights will certainly be snatched away</span>.&#8221;<br />

Abomination of saying: &#8220;Forgive me if you wish, O Allah!&#8221;</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1743.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">You must not supplicate: `O Allah! forgive me if You wish; O Allah bestow mercy on me if You wish.&#8217; But beg from Allah with certitude for no one has the power to compel Allah.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration of Muslim is: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A supplication should be made in full confidence and one should persistently express his desire (before Allah) in his supplication, for no bounty is too great for Allah to bestow (upon his slaves).</span>&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1744.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When one of you supplicates, let him be decisive and he should not say: `O Allah, bestow upon me such and such if You wish&#8217;, because no one has the power to compel Him</span>.&#8221;<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1746.</b> Abu Barzah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) disliked going to bed before the `Isha&#8217; (night) prayer and indulging in conversation after it.</span>&#8221;<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1747.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said: Once, towards the end of his life, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) concluded the `Isha&#8217; (night) prayer and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">After one hundred years from tonight none of the people on the surface of the earth will survive</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1748.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: Once the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) delayed the `Isha&#8217; (night) prayer till midnight. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) turned to us after the prayer and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">All the people slept after offering their prayers, but you who waited, will be accounted as if you were engaged in your prayer throughout the period.</span>&#8221;</p>

Undesirability of Glancing in one Direction of the other during Prayer</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1755.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) said: I asked the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) about random looks in Salat (prayer), and he replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">It is something which Satan snatches from the slave&#8217;s Salat.</span>&#8221;<br />

Chapter 353<br />
Prohibition of giving preference to Children over one another in giving Gifts,<br />
etc.</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1773.</b>  An-Nu`man bin Bashir (May Allah be pleased with them) said: My father took me to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said to him: &#8220;I have gifted one of my slaves to this son of mine.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Have you given such gift to every son of yours?</span>&#8221; He replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; Thereupon he said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Take this gift back</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">     Another narration is: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Be mindful of your obligation to Allah and do justice in respect of your children.</span>&#8221; My father came back and revoked his gift.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">     Another narration is: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) asked, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Have you other children besides this one?</span>&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) asked, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Have you awarded a gift like this to all of them</span>.&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">I am not going to bear witness to this act of injustice</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">    Another narration is: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) asked, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do you not except goodness from all of them as you except from him?</span>&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, of course.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Then don&#8217;t do this (i.e., do not give a gift to one son only)</span>.&#8221;<br />

Chapter 345<br />
Abomination of Selecting Friday for Fasting</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1760.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do not choose the Friday night among all other nights for standing in (Tahajjud) prayer, and do not choose Friday among all other days for Saum (fasting) except that one you have accustomed to</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1761.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) as saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">None of you should observe fast on Friday except that he should observe fast either one day before it or one day after it.&#8217;</span>&#8216;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1762.</b> Muhammad bin `Abbad (May Allah be pleased with him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">I asked Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him). Did the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) prohibit fasting on Friday?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1763.</b> Juwairiyah bint Al-Harith (May Allah be pleased with her), the Mother of the Believers, said that the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) visited her on a Friday and she was observing fast. He asked, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Did you observe fast yesterday?</span>&#8221; She said, &#8220;No.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do you intend to observe fast tomorrow?</span>&#8221; She said, &#8220;No.&#8221; He said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">In that case, give up your fast today</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>

Chapter 350<br />
Undesirability of Intercession in Hudud</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>The woman and the man guilty of illegal sexual intercourse, flog each of them with a hundred stripes. Let not pity withhold you in their case, in a punishment prescribed by Allah, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day.</b></span><b>&#8221; (24:2)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1770.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: The Quraish were anxious about a woman from Banu Makhzum who had committed theft and asked : &#8220;Who will speak to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) about her?&#8221; Then they said: &#8220;No one will be bold enough to do so except Usamah bin Zaid, the (Companion who was) dearly loved by the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam).&#8221; So Usamah (May Allah be pleased with him) spoke to him and the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) (angrily) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Are you interceding regarding one of the punishments prescribed by Allah?</span>&#8221; He then got up and delivered an address in which he said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Indeed what destroyed the people before you was just that when a person of high rank among them committed a theft, they spared him; but if the same crime was done by a poor person they inflicted the prescribed punishment on him. I swear by Allah that if Fatimah daughter of Muhammad should steal, I would have her hand cut off.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">     In another narration `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) said: (Upon hearing the intercession of Usamah), the face of the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) changed color (because of anger) and he said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do you dare to intercede in matters prescribed by Allah?</span>&#8221; Usamah pleaded: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Pray for my forgiveness.&#8221; `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) added: Thereafter the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) gave orders to have that woman&#8217;s hand cut off.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="Center"><b>Chapter 290<br />
Prohibition of gazing at women and Beardless Handsome Boys except in Exigency</b></h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things).</b></span><b>&#8221; (24:30)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Verily, the hearing, and the sight, and the heart, of each of those ones will be questioned (by Allah)</b></span><b>.&#8221; (17:36)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Allah knows the fraud of the eyes, and all that the breasts conceal</b></span><b>.&#8221; (40:19)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Verily, your Rubb is Ever Watchful (over them)</b></span><b>.&#8221; (89:14)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1622.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allah has written the very portion of Zina which a man will indulge in. There will be no escape from it. The Zina of the eye is the (lustful) look, the Zina of the ears is the listening (to voluptuous songs or talk), the Zina of the tongue is (the licentious) speech, the Zina of the hand is the (lustful) grip, the Zina of the feet is the walking (to the place where he intends to commit Zina), the heart yearns and desires and the private parts approve all that or disapprove it</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the wording in Muslim; Al-Bukhari wording is a bit short.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1623.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Avoid sitting on roadsides</span>.&#8221; His Companions said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), there is no other alternative but to sit there to talk.&#8221; Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If you have to sit at all, then fulfill the rights of the road</span>.&#8221; They asked: &#8220;What are their rights?&#8221; Thereupon he said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Lowering the gaze (so that you may not stare at unlawful things); refraining from doing some harm to others, responding to greeting (i.e., saying `Wa`alaikumus-salam&#8217; to one another) and commanding the good and forbidding the evil.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1624.</b> Abu Talhah Zaid bin Sahl (May Allah be pleased with him) said: We were sitting and talking on a platform in front of our house when the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) stopped by us and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Why do you sit on roads? Avoid sitting in them.</span>&#8221; We replied: &#8220;We sit there intending no harm. We only sit and discuss (religious) knowledge and talk.&#8221; He said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If you have to sit, you should fulfill the rights of the road: Lower your gaze, respond to greetings and talk in a good manner</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1625.</b> Jarir bin `Abdullah (May Allah be pleased with him) said:<span style="color:#008000;"> I asked the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) about (the Islamic ruling on) accidental glance (i.e., at a woman one is not Islamically allowed to look at) and he ordered me to turn my eyes away.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1626.</b> Umm Salamah (May Allah be pleased with her) said: I was with the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) along with Maimunah (May Allah be pleased with him) when Ibn Umm Maktum (May Allah be pleased with him) (who was blind) came to visit him. (This incident took place after the order of Hijab). The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) told us to hide ourselves from him (i.e., observe Hijab). We said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), he is blind and is unable to see us, nor does he know us.&#8221; He replied; &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Are you also blind and unable to see him?</span>&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1627.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A man must not look at a man&#8217;s private parts nor must a woman look at a woman&#8217;s private parts; neither should two men lie naked under one cover, nor should two women lie naked under the same cover</span>.&#8221;<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">The narration in Muslim is: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who has eaten garlic should not come to our mosques</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1702.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who has eaten from this plant (i.e., garlic) should not approach us and should not offer Salat (prayer) along with us</span>.&#8221;<br />

He who wants to eat any of these, should cook them till their odour dies out</span>.<br />

[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1658.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who (on befalling a calamity) slaps his cheeks, tears his clothes and follows the ways and traditions of the Days of Ignorance is none of us</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1659.</b> Abu Burdah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: <span style="color:#008000;">(My father) Abu Musa got seriously ill and lost his consciousness. His head was in the lap of a woman of the family and she began to wail. When Abu Musa recovered his consciousness, he said: &#8220;I am innocent of those from whom Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) is innocent. Verily, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) declared himself free of (the responsibility) for a woman who wails, shaves her head and tears up her clothes</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1660.</b> Al-Mughirah bin Shu`bah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who allows (others) to wail over his death, will be punished for it on the Day of Resurrection.&#8217;</span>&#8216;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>

[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1662.</b> An-Nu`man bin Bashir (May Allah be pleased with them) said: <span style="color:#008000;">When `Abdullah bin Rawahah (May Allah be pleased with him) became unconscious, his sister began to weep and shout: &#8220;Alas! For the mountain among men. Alas! for such and such (mentioning his virtuous qualities).&#8221; When he recovered his consciousness, he said: &#8220;I was asked (disapprovingly, by the angels) about everything you said concerning me whether I am as you said</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1663.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) visited Sa`d bin `Ubadah during his illness. He was accompanied by `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf, Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas and `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with them). When they entered his house, they found him unconscious. The Messenger of Allah asked, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Has he died?</span>&#8221; They replied: &#8220;No, O Messenger of Allah.&#8221; Hearing this the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) began to weep. When his Companions saw this, they also began to weep too. He said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Listen attentively: Allah does not punish for the shedding of tears or the grief of the heart, but takes to task or show mercy because of the utterances of this (and he pointed to his tongue).</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1664.</b> Abu Malik Al-Ash`ari (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If the wailing woman does not repent before she dies, she will be made to stand on the Day of Resurrection wearing a garment of pitch and a garment of scabies (Allah knows the nature thereof)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1665.</b>  Asid bin Abu Usaid reported: A woman who had taken a pledge of allegiance at the hand of the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Among the matters in respect of which we gave the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) the pledge not to disobey him in any Ma`ruf [i.e., all that Islam ordains (V:60:12)] was that we should not slap our faces, bewail, tear our clothes up and tear out our hair (in grief)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1666.</b> Abu Musa (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If anyone dies and the mourner gets up and says: `Alas! For the mountain among men. Alas! For the chief &#8230;&#8217; and such like, Allah will put two angels in charge of him who will beat on the breast and ask him (disapproving): `Were you like that?</span>&#8216; &#8221;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1667.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Two things are signs of disbelief on the part of those who indulge in them: Slandering one&#8217;s lineage and wailing over the dead</span>.&#8221;<br />

Chapter 303<br />
Prohibition of Consultation with Soothsayers</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1668.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) said: Some people asked the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) about soothsayers. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">They are of no account</span>.&#8221; Upon this they said to him, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! But they sometimes make true predictions.&#8221; Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">That is a word pertaining to truth which a jinn snatches (from the angels) and whispers into the ears of his friend (the soothsayers) who will then mix more than a hundred lies with it</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narration in Al-Bukhari is: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The angels descend in the clouds and mention matters which has been decreed in heaven; Satan steals a hearing (listens to it stealthily) and communicates it to the soothsayers who tell along with it a hundred lies</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1669.</b> Narrated Safiyyah, daughter of Abu<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';"> `</span>Ubaid, on the authority of some of the wives of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) who said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who goes to one who claims to tell about matters of the Unseen and believes in him, his Salat (prayers) will not be accepted for forty days</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1670.</b> Qabisah bin Al-Mukhariq (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The practice of `Iyafah, the interpretation of omens from the flight of birds, the practice of divination by drawing lines on the ground and taking evil omens are all practices of Al-Jibt (the idol, the diviner, or sorcerer)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1671.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who acquires a branch of the knowledge of astrology, learns a branch of magic (of which he acquires more as long as) he continues to do so</span>.&#8221;<br />

Illegality of Swearing Falsely</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1712.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who takes oath to acquire the property of a Muslim unjustly will meet Allah and He will be angry with him</span>&#8221; then he recited:<br />
&#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">Verily, those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah&#8217;s Covenant and their oaths, they shall have no portion in the Hereafter. Neither will Allah speak to them nor look at them on the Day of Resurrection nor will He purify them, and they shall have a painful torment.</span>&#8221; (3:77)<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1713.</b> Abu Umamah Iyas bin Tha`labah Al-Harithi (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who misappropriates the right of a Muslim by taking a false oath, Allah will condemn him to the fire of Hell and will forbid Jannah for him.</span>&#8221; A person asked: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, even if it is something insignificant?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Yes, even if it is the twig of the Arak tree</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1714.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-As (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Of the major sins are: Associating anything in worship with Allah, disobedience to the parents, killing without justification and taking a false oath (intentionally).</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: A bedouin came to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and asked him: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, what are the cardinal sins?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Associating anything with Allah in worship</span>.&#8221; The man asked: &#8220;(What is) next?&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Al-Yamin Al-Ghamus.</span>&#8221; He asked: &#8220;What do you mean by Al-Yamin Al-Ghamus?&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Swearing falsely to usurp the property of a Muslim.</span>&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1653.</b> Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari (May Allah be pleased with him) said: A house in Al-Madinah was burnt with its occupants inside it one night.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him).</b></span><b>&#8221; (98:5)</b></p>

He who does a thing for the sake of someone else beside Me, I discard him and his polytheism.</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1617.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The first to be judged on the Day of Resurrection will be a man who had died as a martyr. He will be brought forward. Allah will remind him of the favours He had bestowed upon him and the man will acknowledge them. Then He will ask him: `What did you do to express gratitude for it?&#8217; The man will reply: `I fought for Your Cause till I was martyred.&#8217; Allah will say: `You have lied. You fought so that people might call you courageous; and they have done so.&#8217; Command will then be issued about him and he will be dragged on his face and thrown into Hell. Next a man who had acquired and imparted knowledge and read the Qur&#8217;an will be brought forward, Allah will remind him of the favours He had bestowed upon him and the man will acknowledge them. Then He will ask him: `What did you do to express gratitude for it?&#8217; The man will reply: `I acquired knowledge and taught it, and read the Qur&#8217;an for Your sake.&#8217; Allah will say to him: `You have lied. You acquired knowledge so that people might call you a learned (man), and you read the Qur&#8217;an so that they might call you a reciter, and they have done so.&#8217; Command will then be issued about him, and he will be dragged on his face and thrown into Hell. Next a man whom Allah had made affluent and to whom Allah had given plenty of wealth, will be brought forward, Allah will remind him of the favours He had bestowed upon him and the man will acknowledge them. He will ask him: `What did you do to express gratitude for it?&#8217; The man will reply: `I did not neglect any of the ways You liked wealth to be spend liberally for Your sake&#8217;. Allah will say to him: `You have lied. You did it so that people might call you generous, and they have done so.&#8217; Command will then be issued about him and he will be dragged on his face and thrown into Hell.</span>&#8221;<br />

[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1619.</b> Jundub (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who so acts to show off, Allah will disgrace him on the Day of Resurrection, and he who does good deeds so that people (may hold him in high esteem), Allah will expose his hidden evil intentions before the people on the Day of Resurrection.</span>&#8221;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="Center"><b>Chapter 287<br />
Prohibition of taking Ar-Riba (The Usury)</b></h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Those who eat Ar-Riba (the usury) will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaitan (Satan) leading him to insanity. That is because they say: `Trading is only like Ar-Riba, whereas Allah has permitted trading and forbidden Ar-Riba. So whosoever receives an admonition from his Rubb and stops eating Ar-Riba, shall not be punished for the past; his case is for Allah (to judge); but whoever returns (to Ar-Riba), such are the dwellers of the Fire &#8211; they will abide therein. Allah will destroy Ar-Riba and will give increase for Sadaqat (deeds of charity, alms). And Allah likes not the disbelievers, sinners. Truly, those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness, and perform As-Salat (Iqamat-As-Salat), and give Zakat, they will have their reward with their Rubb. On them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. O you who believe! Be afraid of Allah and give up what remains (due to you) from Ar-Riba (from now onward)</b></span><b>.&#8221; (2:275-279)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahadith on the subject are many, including Hadith No. 1615.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1615.</b> `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: <span style="color:#008000;">The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) cursed the one who accepts Ar-Riba (the usury) and the one who pays it.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narration in At-Tirmidhi adds: And the one who records it, and the two persons who stand witness to it.</p>

Undesirability of giving a Gift and then ask back for it</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1612.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who gives something (to someone) as a gift and then gets it back (from him or her) is like a dog which eats its own vomit</span>.&#8221;</p>

I asked the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) about it, whereupon he said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do not buy it and do not get back your charity, for one who gets back the charity is like a dog that eats its own vomit</span>.&#8221;<br />

Chapter 296<br />
Prohibition of Wearing False Hair, Tattooing and Filling of Teeth</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>They (all those who worship others than Allah) invoke nothing but female deities besides Him (Allah), and they invoke nothing but Shaitan (Satan), a persistent rebel! Allah cursed him. And he [Shaitan (Satan)] said: `I will take an appointed portion of your slaves. Verily, I will mislead them, and surely, I will arouse in them false desires; and certainly, I will order them to slit the ears of cattle, and indeed I will order them to change the nature created by Allah&#8217;&#8230;</b></span><b>&#8221; (4:117-119)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1642.</b> Asma&#8217; (May Allah be pleased with her) said: A woman came to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! I have a daughter who had an attack of small pox and her hair fell off. Now I want to celebrate her marriage. Can I get her a wig?&#8221; Thereupon the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allah has cursed the maker and wearer of a wig</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1643.</b> Humaid bin `Abdur-Rahman (May Allah be pleased wth him) said: I saw Mu`awiyah (May Allah be pleased with him) during the Hajj (pilgrimage) standing on the pulpit. He took from the guard a bunch of hair, and said: &#8220;O people of Al-Madinah! Where are your scholars? (Why do they do not prohibit you) I heard the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) prohibiting from using this (false hair) and saying, `<span style="color:#0000ff;">The people of Bani Israel were ruined when their women wore such hair</span>.&#8221;&#8217;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1644.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said: <span style="color:#008000;">The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) cursed the maker and wearer of a wig and the tattooer and the one who is tattooed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1645.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) said: Allah has cursed those women who practise tattooing and those women who have themselves tattooed, and those women who get their hair removed from their eyebrows and faces (except the beard and the mustache), and those who make artificial spaces between their teeth for beauty, whereby they change Allah&#8217;s creation. A woman started to argue with him, saying: &#8220;What is all this?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;Why should I not curse those whom the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) cursed and who are cursed in Allah&#8217;s Book? Allah, the Exalted, has said in His Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">And whatsoever the Messenger  (Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it).</span>&#8221; (59:7)<br />

Chapter 314<br />
Prohibition of Swearing in the name of anything besides Allah</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1707.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#000080;">Allah has prohibited you from taking an oath by your fathers. He who must take an oath, may do so by swearing in the Name of Allah or he should remain silent.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1708.</b> `Abdur-Rahman bin Samurah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Swear neither by the name of Taghut (i.e., false deities, false leaders, etc.) nor by your fathers.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1709.</b> Buraidah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who swears by Amanah (trust) is not one of us.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud with authentic Isnad].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1710.</b> Buraidah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If anyone swears that in such and such case he will be free from Islam and afterwards he turns out to be a liar, he will be as he has sworn; but if he is speaking the truth, he will not revert safely to Islam.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1711.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said: I heard a man saying: &#8220;No, by the Ka`bah.&#8221; I admonished him: &#8220;Do not swear by any thing besides Allah, for I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, `<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who swears by anyone or anything other than Allah, has indeed committed an act of Kufr or Shirk&#8217;</span>.&#8221;<br />

Desirability of Expiating the Oath taken by a Person who afterwards Breaks it<br />
for a better Alternative</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1715.</b> `Abdur-Rahman bin Samurah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to me, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When you take an oath and consider something else to be better than it, make expiation for your oath and choose the better alternative.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1716.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When you swear an oath and consider something else to be better than it, make expiation for your oath and do the thing that is better</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1717.</b> Abu Musa (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Verily, I swear by Allah, if Allah wills, I shall not swear to do something but that if I consider something else to be better than it, then I shall make expiation for my oath and adopt the thing that is better.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1718.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Persistence in respect of his oath about his family is more sinful with Allah than the payment of its expiation prescribed by Allah</span>.&#8221;<br />

Chapter 291<br />
Prohibition of Meeting a non-Mahram Woman in Seclusion</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen</b></span><b>.&#8221; (33:53)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1628.</b> `Uqbah bin `Amir (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Avoid (entering a place) in which are women (uncovered or simply to mix with them in seclusion)</span>.&#8221; A man from the Ansar said, &#8220;Tell me about the brother of a woman&#8217;s husband.&#8221; He replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The brother of a woman&#8217;s husband is death</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1629.</b> Ibn Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">No one of you should meet a woman in privacy unless she is accompanied by a Mahram (i.e., a relative within the prohibited degrees)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1630.</b> Buraidah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The sanctity of the wives of Mujahidun (i.e., those who strive hard and fight in the way of Allah) for those who remain at home (i.e., those who do not go to the battlefield to fight Jihad) is like the sanctity of their own mothers. Anyone who remains behind to look after the family of a Mujahid and betrays his trust, will be made to stand on the Day of Resurrection before the Mujahid who will take away from his meritorious deeds whatever he likes till he is satisfied</span>.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) turned toward us and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Now, what do you think (i.e., will he leave anything with him)?</span>&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>

Chapter 253<br />
Superiority of Auliya&#8217; and their Marvels</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Allah, the Exalted, says:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>No doubt! Verily, the Auliya&#8217; of Allah [i.e., those who believe in the Oneness of Allah and fear Allah much (abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which He has forbidden), and love Allah much (perform all kinds of good deeds which He has ordained)], no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve. Those who believed (in the Oneness of Allah &#8211; Islamic Monotheism), and used to fear Allah much (by abstaining from evil deeds and sins and by doing righteous deeds). For them are glad tidings, in the life of the present world (i.e., through a righteous dream seen by the person himself or shown to others), and in the Hereafter. No change can there be in the Words of Allah. This is indeed the supreme success.</b></span><b>&#8221; (10: 62-64)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>And shake the trunk of date-palm towards you, it will let fall fresh ripe-dates upon you. So eat and drink.</b></span><b>&#8221; (19: 25,26)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Every time he (Zakariya) entered Al-Mihrab to (visit) her, he found her supplied with sustenance. He said: `O Maryam (Mary)! From where have you got this?&#8217; She said, `This is from Allah.&#8217; Verily, Allah provides sustenance to whom He wills, without limit.&#8221; </b></span><b>(3:37)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;(The young men said to one another): `And when you withdraw from them, and that which they worship, except Allah, then seek refuge in the Cave; your Rubb will open a way for you from His Mercy and will make easy for you your affair (i.e., will give you what you will need of provision, dwelling). And you might have seen the sun, when it rose, declining to the right from their Cave, and when it set, turning away from them to the left&#8230;</b></span><b>&#8221; (18:16,17)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1503.</b> `Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Companions of As-Suffah were poor people. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Whoever has food enough for two people, should take a third one (from among them), and whoever has food enough for four persons, should take a fifth or sixth (or said something similar)</span>.&#8221; Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) took three people with him while Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) took ten. Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) took his supper with the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and stayed there till he offered the `Isha&#8217; prayers. After a part of the night had passed, he returned to his house. His wife said to him: &#8220;What has detained you from your guests?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Have you not served supper to them?&#8221; She said: &#8220;They refused to take supper until you come.&#8221; [Abdur-Rahman (Abu Bakr&#8217;s son) or the servants] presented the meal to them but they refused to eat. I (the narrator) hid myself out of fear. Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) (my father) rebuked me. Then he said to them: &#8220;Please eat. By Allah! I will never eat the meal.&#8221; `Abdur-Rahman added: Whenever we took a morsel of the meal, the meal grew from underneath more than that morsel we had till everybody ate to his satisfaction; yet the remaining food was more than what was in the beginning. On seeing this, Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) called his wife and said: &#8220;O sister of Banu Firas! What is this?&#8221; She said: &#8220;O pleasure of my eyes! The food has increased thrice in quantity.&#8221; Then Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) started eating. He said: &#8220;My oath not to take the meal was because of Satan.&#8221; He took a morsel handful from it and carried the rest to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). That food remained with him. In those days there was a treaty between us and the pagans and when the period of that treaty elapsed, he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) divided us into twelve groups and every group was headed by a man. Allah knows how many men were under the command of each leader. Anyhow, all of them ate of that meal.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">    There are some more narrations in both Al-Bukhari and Muslim with very minor differences in wordings and in details.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1504.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">There were Muhaddithun (the recipients of Divine inspiration) among the nations before you. If there is any of such Muhaddith among my followers, he must be `Umar.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">     In Muslim, this Hadith is narrated by `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her), and in both these narrations Ibn Wahb has said that the meaning of Muhaddithun is recipients of Divine inspiration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1505.  </b>Jabir bin Samurah (May Allah be pleased with them) said: <span style="color:#008000;">The inhabitants of Kufah complained to `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) against Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas (May Allah be pleased with him) and `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) appointed `Ammar (May Allah be pleased with him) as Governor of Kufah in his place. Their complaint was that he did not even conduct As-Salat (the prayers) properly. `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) sent for Sa`d and said to him: &#8220;O Abu Ishaq, the people claim that you do not offer the Salat properly.&#8221; Sa`d replied: &#8220;By Allah! I observe Salat according to the Salat of the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), and I make no decrease in it. I prolong Qiyam (standing) in the first two Rak`ah in Maghrib and `Isha&#8217; prayers and shorten in the last ones.&#8221; `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;This is what I thought of you, O Abu Ishaq!&#8221; Then he sent with him a man (or some men) to Kufah to investigate the matter about him (from the people of Kufah). The inquiry was conducted in every mosque and all the people in these mosques praised him; but in the mosque of the Banu `Abs, a man, with the name of Usamah bin Qatadah and surname Abu Sa`dah, stood up and said, &#8220;Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas did not participate in Jihad and he did not distribute the spoils equitably and did not judge justly.&#8221; On this Sa`d said: &#8220;I shall make three supplications in respect of him: O Allah! If this slave of Yours is a liar and seeker of notoriety, please prolong his life and lengthen his period of adversity and afflict him with trials.&#8221; (And so did it happen.) Thereafter, when the man was asked about his condition he would say, &#8220;I am an old man afflicted with trials and overtaken by the curses of Sa`d.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">`Abdul-Malik bin `Umair (a subnarrator) said: I saw this man with eyebrows hung over his eyes as a result of his old age and he walked aimlessly, following young girls and winking at them</span>.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1506.</b> `Urwah bin Az-Zubair (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Arwa bint Aus brought a suit against Sa`id bin Zaid bin `Amr bin Nufail (May Allah be pleased with him). She complained to Marwan bin Al-Hakam that he had wrongfully taken possession of a portion of her land. Sa`id said: &#8220;How can I take a portion out of her land while I have heard a denunciation from the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam).&#8221; Marwan asked him: &#8220;What did you hear from the Messenger of Allah?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, `<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who takes a span of land unjustly will be made to wear seven earths round his neck on the Day of Ressurection&#8217;</span>.&#8221; Marwan said to him: &#8220;I don&#8217;t seek proof from you after this.&#8221; Sa`id supplicated: &#8220;O Allah! If she is a liar, deprive her of her eye sight and cause her to die in her land.&#8221; `Urwah said: &#8220;She did not die till she became blind. While she was walking in her land (concerning which the dispute arose) she fell down into a pit and died.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">      In another narration of Muslim, Muhammad bin Zaid bin `Abdullah bin `Umar said that he had seen Arwa blind, feeling for on the walls with her hand and saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">I am ruined by the curse of Sa`id.</span>&#8221; Later she fell in a well in the same disputed land and died.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1507.</b> Jabir bin `Abdullah (May Allah be pleased with them) said: <span style="color:#008000;">My father called me on the evening before (the battle of) Uhud and said: &#8220;I perceive that I shall be among the first from among the Companions of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) to be martyred, and after him you are the dearest to me. I am under the burden of debt. Pay it and treat your sisters well.&#8221; Next morning he was among the first to be killed, so I buried him along with another in the same grave. Thereafter, I did not like that I should leave him with another in the grave. So I dug up his corpse after six months and he was in the same condition in which he was on the day when I buried him, except that there was a scratch on his ear. Then I buried him in a separate grave.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1508.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: <span style="color:#008000;">Two Companions of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) left his home in a very dark night with something like lights in front of them; when they separated, each of them had one light in front of him till they arrived home</span>.<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Other narrations reported in Al-Bukhari say that the two men were Usaid bin Hudhair and `Abbad bin Bishr (May Allah be pleased with them).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1509.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: <span style="color:#008000;">The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) sent an espionage mission of ten men under the leadership of `Asim bin Thabit Al-Ansari (May Allah be pleased with him). They proceeded till they reached Al-Had&#8217;ah, a place between `Usfan and Makkah and the news of their arrival reached a section of the tribe of Hudhail, called Banu Lihyan. About one hundred men, who were all archers, hurried to follow their tracks. When `A   sim and his companions came to know of their pursuers, they took refuge in a safe place. The infidels encircled them and said to them: &#8220;Come down and surrender, and we promise and guarantee you that we will not kill anyone of you.&#8221; `Asim bin Thabit (May Allah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;By Allah! I will not come down to be under the protection of disbelievers. O Allah! convey this news to our Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam).&#8221; Then the infidels shot arrows at them till they killed `Asim. Three men came down relying on their promise and covenant. They were Khubaib, Zaid bin Ad-Dathinah and another man. When the disbelievers captured them, they tied them up with the strings of their bows. The third of the captives said: &#8220;This is the beginning of first betrayal. By Allah! I will not go with you. I have a good example in these (martyrs).&#8221; So they dragged him and tried to compel him to accompany them, but he refused. At last they killed him. They took Khubaib and Zaid bin Ad-Dathina with them and sold them as slaves in Makkah. This incident took place after the battle of Badr.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Khubaib was bought by the sons of Al-Harith bin `Amir bin Naufal bin `Abd Manaf. It was Khubaib who had killed Al-Harith in the battle of Badr. Khubaib remained a prisoner with those people for a few days till the sons of Al-Harith resolved to kill him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">When Khubaib (May Allah be pleased with him) got wind of this plot, he borrowed a razor from one of Al-Harith&#8217;s daughters in order to remove his pubic hair. Her little son crawled towards Khubaib because of her carelessness. Later on, she saw her son on his thigh and the razor was in his hand. She got scared so much that Khubaib noticed the agitation on her face and said: &#8220;Are you afraid that I will kill him? No, I will never do that.&#8221; She later remarked (after Al-Khubaib got martyred): &#8220;By Allah! I never saw a prisoner better than Khubaib.&#8221; She added: &#8220;By Allah! I saw him once eating of a bunch of grapes in his hand while he was chained and there was no such fruit at that time in Makkah. Probably it was a boon which Allah bestowed upon Khubaib.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">When they took him out of the Haram of Makkah to kill him outside its boundaries, Khubaib requested them to let him offer two Rak`ah of voluntary prayer. They allowed him and he offered two Rak`ah prayer. Then he said: &#8220;Had I not apprehended that you would think that I was afraid of death, I would have prolonged the prayer. O Allah! Count their number; slay them one by one and spare not one of them.&#8221; He then recited these poetic verses:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">`I do not care how they kill me as long as I get martyred in the Cause of Allah as a Muslim. I received my death for Allah&#8217;s sake. If Allah so desires, He will bless, the amputated limbs of the torn body.&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Then the son of Al-Harith killed him. It was Khubaib who set the tradition for any Muslim sentenced to death in captivity to offer two Rak`ah of voluntary prayer. On that day the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) informed his Companions of the martyrdom of Khubaib. Later on, when some disbelievers from Quraish were informed that `Asim had been martyred, they sent some people to fetch a significant part of his body to ascertain his death. (This was because) `Asim had killed one of their chiefs. So Allah sent a swarm of wasps, resembling a shady cloud, to hover over the body of `Asim and to shield him from their messengers, and thus they could not cut off anything from his body.</span><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1510.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: <span style="color:#008000;">I never heard `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) relating anything that he conceived it to be so-and-so, but that it proved to be as he had conceived it.</span>&#8221;</p>

Prohibition of Chastisement with Fire</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1609.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) sent us on an expedition and said to us, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If you find so-and-so (he named two persons belonging to the Quraish) commit them to the fire.</span>&#8221; When we were on the verge of departure, he said to us, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">I ordered you to burn so-and-so, but it is Allah Alone Who punishes with the fire. So if you find them put them to death</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1610.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: We were with the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in a journey when he drew apart (to relieve nature). In his absence, we saw a red bird which had two young ones with it. We caught them and the red mother bird came, beating the earth with its wings. In the meantime the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) returned and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Who has put this bird to distress on account of its young? Return them to her</span>.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) also noticed a mound of ants which we had burnt up. He asked, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Who has set fire to this?</span>&#8221; We replied: &#8220;We have done so.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">None can chastise with fire except the Rubb of the fire</span>.&#8221;<br />

He who kills himself with something, will be tormented with it on the Day of Resurrection. A person is not bound to fulfill a vow about something which he does not possess. Cursing a believer is like murdering him</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1552.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8220;I<span style="color:#0000ff;">t does not befit a Siddiq (righteous Muslim) to frequently curse others</span>.&#8221;<br />

[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1554.</b> Samurah bin Jundub (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do not curse one another, invoking Curse of Allah or Wrath of Allah or the fire of Hell.&#8217;</span>&#8216;<br />
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1555.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A true believer is not involved in taunting, or frequently cursing (others) or in indecency or abusing.</span>&#8221;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>

Then it comes down to the earth and its gates get closed. Then it turns right and left, and if it does not find an entrance to go anywhere, it returns to the person or thing that was cursed; if he or it deserves to be cursed; otherwise it returns to the person who uttered it.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>

The young woman said to the she-camel: &#8220;Go ahead.&#8221; When it did not move, she said, &#8220;O Allah! Curse it.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The she-camel that has been cursed should not accompany us.</span>&#8221;<br />

Prohibition of two Holding Secret Counsel to the Exclusion of Conversing<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Secret counsels (conspiracies) are only from Shaitan (Satan)</b></span><b>.&#8221; (58:10)</b></p>

[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">   In Abu Dawud, Abu Salih related: I asked Ibn `Umar: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">What if there are four people.</span>&#8221; He said, &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">There is no harm in that.</span>&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Malik reported in Al-Muwatta that `Abdullah bin Dinar related: Ibn `Umar and I were together in Khalid bin `Uqbah&#8217;s house which was situated in the market place. A man came to consult Ibn `Umar. None besides me was present. Ibn `Umar called another man in and we became four and said to me and the man he had called: Move away a bit because I have heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;The two people should not hold secret counsel together excluding the third.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1599.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When three of you are together, two of you must not converse privately ignoring the third till the number increases, lest the third should be grieved</span>.&#8221;<br />

[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Another narration of Muslim is: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) happened to pass by a heap of corn. He thrust his hand in that (heap) and his fingers felt wetness. He said to the owner of that heap of corn, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">What is this?</span>&#8221; He replied: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! These have been drenched by rainfall.&#8221; He remarked, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Why did you not place this (the drenched part of the heap) over the corn so that people might see it? He who deceives is not of us</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1580.</b>  Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do not practise Najsh (to cheat)</span>.&#8221;<br />

[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1582.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said: A man mentioned to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) that he was often deceived in dealings. The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to him, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When you enter into a transaction you should say: &#8220;There should be no deception.</span>&#8221;&#8217;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1583.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who deceives another&#8217;s wife or his slave is none of us</span>.&#8221;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="Center"><span style="color:#000080;"><b>Chapter 260<br />
Condemnation and Prohibition of Falsehood</b></span></h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>And follow not (O man, i.e., say not or do not or witness not) that of which you have no knowledge.</b></span><b>&#8221; (17:36)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Not a word does he (or she) utter, but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it).</b></span><b>&#8221; (50:18)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1542.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Truth leads to piety and piety leads to Jannah. A man persists in speaking the truth till he is recorded with Allah as a truthful man. Falsehood leads to transgression and transgression leads to the Hell-fire. A man continues to speak falsehood till he is recorded with Allah as a great liar</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1543.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Whosoever possesses these four characteristics, is a sheer hypocrite; and anyone who possesses one of them, possesses a characteristic of hypocrisy till he gives it up. (These are:) When he talks, he tells a lie; when he makes a covenant, he acts treacherously; and when he quarrels, he utters foul language</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1544.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who narrates a dream which he has not seen will be put to trouble to join into a knot two barley seeds which he will not be able to do; and he who seeks to listen to the talk of a people (secretly) will have molten lead poured into his ears on the Day of Resurrection; and he who makes a picture (of people or other creatures with a soul, such as animals and insects) will be (severely punished), and he will be asked to infuse spirit therein, which he will not be able to do.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1545.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) as saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The worst of lies is to pretend to have seen something which he has not seen.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1546.</b> Sumurah bin Jundub (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) very often used to ask his Companions, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do any one of you has seen a dream</span>?&#8221; So dreams would be narrated to him by those whom Allah willed to relate. One day he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Last night I had a vision in which two men (angels) came to me and woke me up and said to me, `Proceed!&#8217; I set out with them and we came across a man lying down, and behold, another man was standing over his head, holding a big rock. Behold, he was throwing the rock at the man&#8217;s head, smashing it. When he struck him, the stone rolled away and he went after it to get it, and no sooner had he returned to this man, his head was healed and restored to its former condition. The thrower (of the rock) then did the same as he had done before. I said to my two companions, `Subhan-Allah! Who are these?&#8217; They said: `Proceed, proceed.&#8217; So we proceeded and came to a man lying in a prone position and another man standing over his head with an iron hook, and behold, he would put the hook in one side of the man&#8217;s mouth and tear off that side of his face to the back (of the neck), and similarly tear his nose from front to back, and his eyes from front to back. Then he turned to the other side of the man&#8217;s face and did just as he has done with the first side. He had hardly completed that (second) side when the first returned to its normal state. I said to my two companions, `Subhan-Allah! Who are these?&#8217; They said, `Proceed, proceed.&#8217; So we proceeded and came across something like a Tannur (a kind of baking oven, a pit usually clay-lined for baking bread)</span>.&#8221; I (the narrator) think the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">In that oven there was much noise and voices</span>.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) added, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">We looked into it and found naked men and women, and behold, a flame of fire was reaching to them from underneath, and when it reached them they cried loudly. I asked, `Who are these?&#8217; They said to me, `Proceed, proceed.&#8217; And so we proceeded and came across a river.&#8221; I (the narrator) think he said, </span>&#8220;&#8211; red like blood.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) added, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">And behold, in the river there was a man swimming, and on the bank there was a man who had collected many stones. Behold, while the other man was swimming, he went near him. The former opened his mouth and the latter (on the bank) threw a stone into his mouth whereupon he went swimming again. Then again he (the former) returned to him (the latter), and every time the former returned, he opened his mouth, and the latter threw a stone into his mouth, (and so on) the performance was repeated. I asked my two companions, `Who are these?&#8217; They replied, `Proceed, proceed.&#8217; And we proceeded till we came to a man with a repulsive appearance, the most repulsive appearance you ever saw a man having! Beside him there was a fire, and he was kindling it and running around it. I asked my two companions, `Who is this (man).&#8217; They said to me, `Proceed, proceed!&#8217; So we proceeded till we reached a garden of deep green dense vegetation, having all sorts of spring colours. In the midst of the garden there was a very tall man, and I could hardly see his head because of his great height, and around him there were children in such a large number as I have never seen! I said to my two companions, `Who is this?&#8217; They replied, `Proceed, proceed.&#8217; So we proceeded till we came to a majestic, huge garden, greater and better than any garden I have ever seen! My two companions said to me, `Ascend up&#8217; and I ascended up</span>.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) added, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">So we ascended till we reached a city built of gold and silver bricks, and we went to its gate and asked (the gatekeeper) to open the gate, and it was opened; and we entered the city and found in it men with one side of their bodies as handsome as the most handsome person you have ever seen, and the other side as ugly as the ugliest person you have ever seen! My two companions ordered those men to throw themselves into the river. Behold, there was a river flowing across (the city), and its water was like milk in whiteness. Those men went and threw themselves in it and then returned to us after the ugliness (of their bodies) had disappeared, and they came in the best shape</span>.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) further added, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">My two companions said to me: `This place is the `Adn Jannah, and that is your place.&#8217; I raised up my sight, and behold, there I saw a palace like a white cloud! My two companions said to me, `That palace is your place,&#8217; I said to them, `May Allah bless you both! Let me enter it.&#8217; They replied, `As for now, you will not enter it, but you shall enter it (one day).&#8217; I said to them, `I have seen many wonders tonight. What does all that mean which I have seen?&#8217; They replied, `We will inform you: As for the first man you came upon, whose head was being smashed with the rock, he is the symbol of the one who studies the Qur&#8217;an and then neither recites it nor acts on its orders, and sleeps, neglecting the enjoined prayers. As for the man you came upon, whose sides of mouth, nostrils and eyes were torn off from front to back, he is the symbol of the man who goes out of his house in the morning and tells lies that are spread all over the world. And those naked men and women whom you saw in a construction resembling an oven, they are the adulterers and the adulteresses. And the man who was given a stone to swallow is the eater of Ar-Riba (usury), and the bad-looking man whom you saw near the fire, kindling it and going around it, is Malik, the gatekeeper of Hell, and the tall man you saw in the garden is (Prophet) Abraham, and the children around him are those who died upon Al-Fitrah (the Islamic Faith of Monotheism)</span>.&#8221;&#8217; The narrator added: Some Muslims asked the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) , &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! What about the children of Al-Mushrikun (i.e., polytheists, pagans, idolaters, and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah and in His Messenger Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam))?&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">And also the children of Al-Mushrikun</span>.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) added: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">My two companions added, `The men you saw half handsome and half ugly were these people who had mixed an act that was good with another that was bad, but Allah forgave them</span>&#8216;.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration of Al-Bukhari is: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">One night two men came to me and took me to a blessed land</span>.&#8221; (The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) told of the same incident as above) and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">After a while of walking we came upon a pit like an oven, narrow at the top and wide at the bottom with fire raging in it. When the flames rose up (the people in it) also rose up till they were about to come out; and when the fire subsided they, too, would go down with it. In it were naked men and women.</span>&#8221; (The remainder of the Hadith is the same as the above Hadith except that at the end of it, the Messenger of Allah said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">We came upon a river of blood in the middle of which there was a man standing, and at the bank of the river there was a man with plenty of stones before him.</span>..&#8221; In this narration we also find: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">They made me climb the tree and they made me enter an abode so beautiful the like of which I have never seen before. There (I saw) old men and youth</span>.&#8221; In this narration we also find: &#8220;`<span style="color:#0000ff;">The first house you entered was the abode of the believers in general, and the other house was the abode of the martyrs. I am Jibril (Gabriel), and this is Mika&#8217;il. Raise your head.&#8217; I looked up and saw something like clouds. They said to me, `That is your abode.&#8217; I said, `Shall I enter it?&#8217; They said, `You have not completed your term of life yet. When you do, you will certainly enter it</span>.&#8221;&#8217;<br />

Chapter 271<br />
Prohibition of Spying on Muslims and to be Inquisitive about Others</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>And spy not.</b></span><b>&#8221; (49:12)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>And those who annoy believing men and women undeservedly, bear on themselves the crime of slander and plain sin</b></span><b>.&#8221; (33:58)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1570.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Beware of suspicion, for suspicion is the worst of false tales. Do not look for other&#8217;s faults. Do not spy one another, and do not practise Najsh (means to offer a high price for something in order to allure another customer who is interested in the thing). Do not be jealous of one another and do not nurse enmity against one another. Do not sever ties with one another. Become the slaves of Allah, and be brothers to one another as He commanded. A Muslim is the brother of a Muslim. He should neither oppress him nor humiliate him. The piety is here! The piety is here!</span>&#8221; While saying so he pointed towards his chest. &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">It is enough evil for a Muslim to look down upon his Muslim brother. All things of a Muslim are inviolable for his brother in Faith: his blood, his wealth and his honour. Verily, Allah does not look to your bodies nor to your faces but He looks to your hearts and your deeds</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do not feel envy against one another; do not nurse enmity; do not spy on one another and do not cheat one another. Be Allah&#8217;s slaves, brethren to one another</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do not have estranged relations with one another. Do not nurse enmity and do not feel envy against one another. O Allah&#8217;s worshippers! Be brothers!</span>&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do not estrange mutual relations and do not intervene into the transaction which is likely to be settled with another person</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1571.</b> Muawiyah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If you find faults with Muslims, you will corrupt them</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1572.</b> It has been reported that a man was brought before Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) because his beard was giving out smell of wine. Ibn Mas`ud said: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">We have been prohibited from spying (on Muslims) and finding faults (with them). But we can take to task only and only if the sin is overt</span>.<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>

Prohibition of Despising Muslims</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>O you who believe! Let not a group scoff at another group; it may be that the latter are better than the former. Nor let (some) women scoff at other women; it may be that the latter are better than the former. Nor defame one another, nor insult one another by nicknames. How bad is it to insult one&#8217;s brother after having Faith [i.e., to call your Muslim brother (a faithful believer) as: `O sinner&#8217;, or `O wicked&#8217;]. And whosoever does not repent, then such are indeed Zalimun (wrongdoers).</b></span><b>&#8221; (49:11)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Woe to every slanderer and backbiter</b></span><b>.&#8221; (105:1)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1574.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">It is enough evil for a Muslim to look down upon his (Muslim) brother</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1575.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The haughty, even with pride equal to a mustard seed in his heart, will not enter Jannah</span>.&#8221; A man enquired: &#8220;What about that a person likes fine dress and fine shoes?&#8221; He said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allah is Beautiful and likes beauty. Pride amounts to disclaiming truth out of self-esteem, and despising people</span>                                                                                               .&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1576.</b> Jundub bin `Abdullah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Once someone said: `By Allah! Allah will not forgive such and such (a person).&#8217; Thereupon Allah, the Exalted and the Glorious, said: `Who is he who takes an oath in My Name that I will not grant pardon to so-and-so? I have granted pardon to so-and-so and rendered your good deeds fruitless</span>.&#8221;&#8217;<br />
[Muslim].</p>

Chapter 282<br />
Prohibition of Cruelty</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>And do good to parents, kinsfolk, orphans, Al-Masakin (the poor), the neighbour who is near of kin, the neighbour who is a stranger, the companion by your side, the wayfarer (you meet), and those (slaves) whom your right hands possess. Verily, Allah does not like such as are proud and boastful.</b></span><b>&#8221; (4:36)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1600.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A woman was punished in Hell because of a cat which she had confined until it died. She did not give it to eat or to drink when it was confined, nor did she free it so that it might eat the vermin of the earth</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1601.</b>  Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: <span style="color:#008000;">I happened to pass by some lads of the Quraish who had tied a bird at which they have been shooting arrows. Every arrow that they missed came into the possession of the owner of the bird. No sooner had they seen Ibn `Umar, they dispersed. Thereupon, Ibn `Umar said: &#8220;Who has done this? May Allah curse him who has done so. Verily, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) has cursed anyone who makes a live thing the target (of one&#8217;s marksmanship)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1602.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) forbade animals being tied (as targets)</span>.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1603.</b> Abu Ali Suwaid bin Muqarrin (May Allah be pleased with him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">I was the seventh child of Banu Muqarrin and we had only one slave-girl. When the youngest of us once happened to slap her (on the face) the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) ordered us to set her free</span>.<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1604.</b> Abu Mas`ud Al-Badri (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I was beating my slave with a whip when I heard a voice behind me which said: &#8220;Abu Mas`ud! Bear in mind&#8230;&#8221; I did not recognize the voice for the intense anger I was in. Abu Mas`ud added: As he came near me, I found that he was the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) who was saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Abu Mas`ud! Bear in mind that Allah has more dominance upon you than you have upon your slave.</span>&#8221; Then I said: &#8220;I will never beat any slave in future.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: The whip dropped from my hand in awe of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Still another narration is: I said: &#8220;He is free for the sake of Allah.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If you had not done this, you would have been singed by the Fire</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1605.</b>  Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The expiation for beating or slapping a slave on the face for something he has not done is to set him free</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1606.</b> It has been narrated that Hisham bin Hakim bin Hizam (May Allah be pleased with them) happened to pass by some (non-Arab) farmers of Syria who had been made to stand in the sun, and olive oil was poured on their heads. He said: &#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; He was told that they had been detained for the non-payment of Jizyah. (Another narration says that they were being tortured for not having paid Al-Kharaj). Thereupon Hisham said: &#8220;I bear testimony to the fact that I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, `<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allah will torment those who torment people in the world</span>.&#8221;&#8217; Then he proceeded towards their Amir and reported this Hadith to him. The Amir then issued orders for their release.<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1607.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) said: <span style="color:#008000;">The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saw an ass which had been branded on the face. He disapproved of it. Upon this Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) said, &#8220;By Allah, I shall not brand (the animal) but on a part at a distance from the face.&#8221; Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) then commanded branding on the hips; he was the first person to brand the animals on hips</span>.<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1608.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) said: An ass with a brand on the face happened to pass before the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). Thereupon he said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">May Allah curse the one who has branded it (on the face)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration in Muslim is: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) prohibited us from hitting across the face and branding on the face (of an animal).</span>&#8221;</p>

Chapter 257<br />
Prohibition of Calumny</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>A slanderer, going about with calumnies.</b></span><b>&#8221; (68:11)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Not a word does he (or she) utter, but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it)</b></span><b>.&#8221; (50:18)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1536.</b> Hudhaifah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The person who goes about with calumnies will never enter Jannah</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1537.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) passed by two graves and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Both of them (the persons in these graves) are being tortured, and they are not being tortured for a cardinal sin. But indeed they are great sins. One of them used not to save himself from being soiled with his urine, and the other one used to go about with calumnies (among the people to rouse hostilities, e.g., one goes to a person and tells him that so-and-so says about him such and such evil things)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1538.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Shall I tell you what `Al-`Adhu&#8217; (falsehood and slandering) is? It is calumny which is committed among the people</span>.&#8221;<br />

Chapter 254<br />
The Prohibition of Backbiting and the Commandment of Guarding one&#8217;s Tongue</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>And backbite not one another. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? You would hate it (so hate backbiting). And fear Allah. Verily, Allah is the One Who forgives and accepts repentance, Most Merciful.</b></span><b>&#8221; (49:12)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>And follow not (O man, i.e., say not or do not or witness not) that of which you have no knowledge. Verily, the hearing, and the sight, and the heart, of each of those ones will be questioned (by Allah).</b></span><b>&#8221; (17:36)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Not a word does he (or she) utter, but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it)</b></span><b>.&#8221; (50:18)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1511.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who believes in Allah and the Last Day must either speak good or remain silent</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1512.</b> Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I asked the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam): &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Who is the most excellent among the Muslims?&#8221; He said, &#8220;One from whose tongue and hands the other Muslims are secure</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1513.</b> Sahl bin Sa`d (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Whosoever gives me a guarantee to safeguard what is between his jaws and what is between his legs, I shall guarantee him Jannah.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1514.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A person utters a word thoughtlessly (i.e., without thinking about its being good or not) and, as a result of this, he will fall down into the fire of Hell deeper than the distance between the east and the west</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1515.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A man utters a word pleasing to Allah without considering it of any significance for which Allah exalts his ranks (in Jannah); another one speaks a word displeasing to Allah without considering it of any importance, and for this reason he will sink down into Hell.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1516.</b> Abu &#8216;Abdur-Rahman Bilal bin Al-Harith Al-Muzani (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A man speaks a good word without knowing its worth, Allah records for him His Good Pleasure till the day he will meet Him; and a man utters an evil word without realizing its importance, Allah records for him His displeasure till the day he will meet Him</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Imam Malik and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1517.</b> Sufyan bin `Abdullah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I asked: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Tell me, of something to which I may remain steadfast.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Say: My Rubb is Allah and then remain steadfast</span>.&#8221; Then I said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! What do you fear most about me?&#8221; He took hold of his own tongue and said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">This.</span>&#8221;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1518.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do not indulge in excessive talk except when remembering Allah. Excessive talking without the Remembrance of Allah hardens the heart; and those who are the farthest from Allah are those whose hearts are hard.</span>&#8221;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1519.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He whom Allah saves from the evil of that which is between his jaws and the evil of that which is between his legs will enter Jannah</span>.&#8221;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1520.</b> &#8216;Uqbah bin `Amir (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I asked the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">How can salvation be achieved?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Control your tongue, keep to your house, and weep over your sins</span>.&#8221;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1521.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When the son of Adam gets up in the morning, all the limbs humble themselves before the tongue and say: `Fear Allah for our sake because we are with you: (i.e., we will be rewarded or punished as a result of what you do) if you are straight, we will be straight; and if you are crooked, we will become crooked.</span>&#8221;&#8217;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1522.</b> Mu`adh bin Jabal (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I asked the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam): &#8220;Inform me of an act which will cause me to enter Jannah and keep me far from Hell.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">You have asked me about a matter of great importance, but it is easy for one for whom Allah makes it easy</span>.&#8221; He added, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Worship Allah, associate nothing with Him in worship, offer As-Salat (the prayer), pay the Zakat, observe Saum (fasting) during Ramadan and perform Hajj (pilgrimage) to the House of Allah, if you can afford it.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) further said, &#8220;Shall I not guide you to the gates of goodness? Fasting is a screen (from Hell), charity extinguishes (i.e., removes) the sins as water extinguishes fire, and standing in prayers by a slave of Allah during the last third part of the night</span>.&#8221; Then he recited: &#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">Their sides forsake their beds, to invoke their Rubb in fear and hope, and they spend (in charity in Allah&#8217;s Cause) out of what We have bestowed on them. No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do</span>.&#8221; (32:17,18) Then he added, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Shall I tell you of the root of the matter, its pillar and its highest point?</span>&#8221; I replied: &#8220;Yes! Certainly, O Prophet of Allah.&#8221; He said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The root of this matter (foundation) is Islam, its pillar (mainstay is) As-Salat (the prayer) and its highest point is Jihad (fighting in the Cause of Allah)</span>.&#8221; Then he asked, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Shall I tell you of that which holds all these things?</span>&#8221; I said: &#8220;Yes, O Messenger of Allah.&#8221; So he took hold of his tongue and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Keep this in control</span>.&#8221; I asked: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Shall we really be accounted for what we talk about?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">May your mother lose you! People will be thrown on their faces into the Hell on account of their tongues.</span>&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1523.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do you know what is backbiting?</span>&#8221; The Companions said: &#8220;Allah and His Messenger know better.&#8221; Thereupon he said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Backbiting is talking about your (Muslim) brother in a manner which he dislikes.</span>&#8221; It was said to him: &#8220;What if my (Muslim) brother is as I say.&#8221; He said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If he is actually as you say, then that is backbiting; but if that is not in him, that is slandering.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1524.</b> Abu Bakrah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: Delivering the sermon during the Farewell Pilgrimage on the day of Sacrifice at Mina, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Verily your blood, your property and your honour are as sacred and inviolable as the sanctity of this day of yours, in this month of yours and in this town of yours. Verily! I have conveyed this message to you</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1525.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) said: I said to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam): &#8220;Such and such thing of Safiyyah (May Allah be pleased with her) is sufficient for you.&#8221; (She means to say that she was a woman with a short stature). He said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">You have indeed uttered a word which would pollute the sea if it were mixed in it.</span>&#8221; She further said: I imitated a person before him and he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I do not like that I should imitate someone even (if I am paid) in return such and such</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1526.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">During the Mi`raj (the Night of Ascension), I saw a group of people who were scratching their chests and faces with their copper nails. I asked, `Who are these people, O Jibril?&#8217; Jibril replied: `These are the people who ate flesh of others (by backbiting) and trampled people&#8217;s honour.</span>&#8221;&#8217;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1527.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The blood, honour and property of a Muslim is inviolable for another Muslim.</span>&#8221;<br />
