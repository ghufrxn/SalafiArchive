										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 1</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">source: silsilat ul-hudā wa nnūr ~ the series of guidance and light ~ tape no. 8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Question #5: “What is the ruling on the one who abandons the prayer? And what is the difference between al-kufr ul-ʽamalī [1] (the disbelief related to actions) and al-kufr ul-ʽitiqādī [2] (the disbelief related to faith)?”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albānī answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The one who abandons the prayer has two states: either he believes in its legislation, or he denies its legislation. So regarding this second state, he is a disbeliever by the consensus of the Muslims. And likewise, whoever denies a matter from the religion that a Muslim cannot be ignorant about – for example, whoever denies (the legislation of) fasting, Hajj and whatever else there is of matters known by all the Muslims to be necessities of the religion – then he is a disbeliever. So there is no difference of opinion about this: whoever denies the legislation of the prayer is a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
But if there is a man who does not deny (the legislation) of the prayer and who acknowledges its legislation, but with respect to action, he does not perform it, he does not pray – maybe he does not pray at all and maybe he prays sometimes – so in this case, if we said that this man has disbelieved, this statement would not apply to him at all, because kufr (disbelief) is denial, and he is not denying the legislation of the prayer, as (Allāh), the Most High, said with regard</p>
<p>to the disbelievers: {And they denied them (those Āyāt)…, though their ownselves were convinced thereof}. [3]<br />
So if we take as an example so-and-so from the people who does not pray, but when he is asked ‘Why don’t you pray O my brother?’, he says to you, ‘Allāh will forgive me, by Allāh the worldly life has kept me busy, these children have kept me busy,’ and this type of talk. Of course, this talk is not an excuse for him at all, but he presents us a benefit which we didn’t know because we can’t know what is in his heart. He presents us a benefit that the man believes in the legislation of the prayer, as opposed to if the answer was, may Allāh forbid: ‘O my brother, the time for this prayer is gone; this was during a time when the people were not educated, they were unclean, they were in need of a specific nature of cleanliness, purity and exercise, and now the time for this has gone; now there are new means that free us of prayer’ – this (man) has disbelieved and thus (goes) to {Hell, and worst indeed is that destination}. [4]  As for if the answer is the first (example): ‘Why don’t you pray?’ (and he says,) ‘Allāh will forgive us, may Allāh curse the shaytān,’ and this type of talk that informs us that the man is not denying the legislation of the prayer, then if we said that this man is a disbeliever, we would be contradicting the reality, because this man is a believer, a believer in the legislation of the prayer and a believer in all of Islām, so how can we declare him a disbeliever?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, we say that there is no difference between the one who abandons the prayer and the one who abandons fasting and the one who abandons Hajj and the one who abandons anything from the acts of worship related to actions – (there is no difference) with regard to (judging whether) he is to be declared a disbeliever or not. When is he declared a disbeliever? If he denies. When is he not declared a disbeliever? If he believes. So it is not allowed – by consensus – to declare the believer to be a disbeliever. And many narrations have come in accordance with this…: ‘(Allāh will say:) Make whoever (sincerely) said lā ilāha illAllāh (none has the right to be worshiped but Allāh) enter Paradise,’ while he does not have a (good) deed equal to the weight of an atom, but he has the weight of an atom of īmān (faith), so this īmān is what prevents him from dwelling in the Fire forever, and he enters Paradise even if it is after he becomes a black coal. [5] However, this is the one who bears witness that none has the right to be worshiped but Allāh and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allāh, and he believes in all that has come from Allāh and His Messenger ; but he does not pray, or does not fast or does not perform Hajj or the like, or he steals or fornicates – there is no difference with regard to all these affairs when placed on the scales of disbelief related to actions and disbelief related to faith [because since he has faith, these impermissible actions do not fall under disbelief related to faith / major kufr].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For instance, a man commits fornication; do we declare him a disbeliever? You will say, no. I say, no. Don’t be hasty. We have to see, does he say that zinā (fornication) is prohibited? Does he say as some of the ignorant ones say: ‘there is no harām and there is no halāl’? If he says to me (such a) statement, he has disbelieved. Likewise, the one who steals and any (other) sin – for example, the man who backbites people, and we say to him: ‘Fear Allāh, the Messenger (of Allāh) said: ‘Backbiting is you mentioning about</p>
<p>your brother that which he dislikes,’6 and he says: ‘There is no ‘the Messenger said’ and such-and-such,’ (then) he has disbelieved. In this manner, (the same applies to) all the Islamically legislated rulings, whether it is a positive ruling, i.e., one of the obligatory duties, or a negative ruling, i.e., the prohibitions that he must keep away from. So, if he regards any of these prohibitions to be permissible in his heart, he has disbelieved. But if he falls into it by way of action while believing that he is disobeying (Allāh), he has not disbelieved.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there is no difference with regard to this between all the Islamically legislated rulings, whether they are from the obligatory duties or prohibitions. The obligatory duties must be carried out and it is not permissible to leave them off, but whoever leaves them out of laziness, it is not allowed to declare him a disbeliever. Whoever leaves them out of denial has disbelieved; whoever regards any of the forbidden things to be permissible has likewise disbelieved. There is no difference with regard to this at all between the obligations and prohibitions.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">source: <em>silsilat ul-ahaadeeth is-saheeha – </em>the series of authentic narrations <em>– hadeeth</em> no. 87</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hudhaifa bin al-Yamaan (<em>radiAllaahu ‘anhu</em>) said that the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “Islaam will be erased just as the decoration of a garment is (worn out and) erased, until it will not be known what is fasting, nor prayer, nor the rituals of Hajj, nor charity; and the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, (i.e., the Qur’aan) will be taken away (from the <em>mus-hafs</em>[1] and breasts of the people)[2] in one night such that not (even) an <em>aayah</em> from it will remain on earth. And groups of people will remain – the old people – saying: ‘We saw our forefathers upon this statement: ‘<em>laa ilaaha illAllaah </em>(none has the right to worshiped but Allaah),’ so we also say it.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then), Silah bin Zufar said to Hudhaifa: ‘What will ‘<em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>’ benefit them when they don’t know what is prayer, nor fasting, nor the rituals of Hajj, nor charity?’ Hudhaifa turned away from him. Then (Silah) repeated it to (Hudhaifa) three times, and every time Hudhaifa would turn away from him. Then he turned toward him on the third time and said three times: ‘O Silah! It will save them from the Fire.’”[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~*~*~*~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) comments:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There is an important benefit of <em>fiqh </em>in the <em>hadeeth</em>, which is that bearing witness that <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah </em>(none has the right to be worshiped but Allaah) saves the one who says it (sincerely) from dwelling forever in the Fire on the Day of Resurrection, even if he didn’t use to perform any of the other pillars of Islaam at all, such as prayer and so on. And it is known that the scholars have differed about the ruling on the one who abandons the prayer especially while believing in its legislation. So<strong> the majority was of the opinion that he has not disbelieved</strong>by that, but rather disobeyed Allaah; and Ahmad – in a report – was of the opinion that he has disbelieved, and that he is to be killed due to apostasy, not as a prescribed punishment. And it is has been authentically narrated from the Companions that they did not consider leaving any of the actions to be disbelief except the prayer; at-Tirmithee and al-Haakim reported it.[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I believe that that which is correct is the view of the majority, and that<strong> what was mentioned from the Companions does not clearly state that they meant by ‘disbelief’ here to be the disbelief which will make its possessor dwell forever in the Fire and for which it is not possible that Allaah will forgive him</strong>. How can that be when this is Hudhaifa bin al-Yamaan – who is one of the foremost of those Companions – responding to Silah bin Zufar, who was about to understand the affair as Ahmad’s understanding of it. So (Silah) said: ‘What will ‘<em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>’ benefit them when they don’t know what is prayer. . .,’ then Hudhaifa replied to him after his turning away from him, saying three times: ‘O Silah! It will save them from the Fire.’ Therefore, this is a clear statement from Hudhaifa (<em>radiAllaahu ‘anhu</em>) that the one who abandons the prayer is not a disbeliever [if he believes in its legislation], but rather a Muslim who will be saved from dwelling forever in the Fire on the Day of Resurrection. So be mindful of this, for indeed you may not find it in other than this place.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Question #10: “What about the <em>hadeeth</em>: ‘whoever abandons the prayer has disbelieved’?”[1]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>This is not the first <em>hadeeth</em> in which it is said that whoever does such-and-such has disbelieved</strong>. You have the famous <em>hadeeth</em> ‘whoever swears by other than Allaah has disbelieved,’[2] but we don’t say that whoever says ‘by the life of my father’ has apostatized from his religion.[3] And you know, for example, the<em>hadeeth</em> of ‘Umar bin al-Khattaab in Saheeh al-Bukhaari when the Messenger (of Allaah) (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) heard him swearing by his father, so he (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) said: ‘Don’t swear by your fathers; whoever of you swears, then let him swear by Allaah or keep silent.’[4] And in the <em>hadeeth</em> of (‘Umar’s) son ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Umar, he said that the Messenger (of Allaah) (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: ‘Whoever swears by other than Allaah has associated partners with Him,’[5] and in another narration, ‘he has disbelieved.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not necessary for the occurrence of the expression ‘whoever does such-and-such has disbelieved’ to mean that he has disbelieved with the disbelief of apostasy. Rather, it can have many meanings, such as for example: ‘he has disbelieved’ can mean that he is close to disbelieving, that he has disbelieved with the disbelief related to (only) actions (i.e., minor <em>kufr</em>), and such meanings that the people of knowledge were obliged to (apply) in order to reconcile between the texts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever abandons the prayer has disbelieved.’ (But also) we say, ‘whoever says<em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>[6] (sincerely) will enter Paradise;’[7] ‘whoever says <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> (sincerely), it will benefit him some day,’[8] [9] as mentioned in the<em>hadeeth</em> of al-Bazzaar and others. (Another <em>hadeeth</em> mentions that) ‘whichever slave runs away from his master has disbelieved.’[10] These expressions are very numerous: ‘he has disbelieved, he has disbelieved.’ And there isn’t any <em>hadeeth</em>that is interpreted like this upon its apparent meaning if it comes with the expression: ‘he has disbelieved.’ This <em>hadeeth</em> – ‘whoever abandons the prayer has disbelieved’ – is treated the same way as the other narrations which share the saying ‘he has disbelieved’ with the <em>hadeeth</em> about prayer. So here, many interpretations can occur for this text as for many (other) narrations. For example, ‘the tale-carrier[11] will not enter Paradise,’[12] (but) does that mean that he has disbelieved because of his tale-carrying? The answer is: if he considers that to be permissible by his heart, then Paradise has been forbidden for him. And if he acknowledges the forbiddance of that, and admits that he is wrong, a sinner and an evildoer, then his affair is with Allaah, as He, the Mighty and Majestic, said: ‘Verily, Allaah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills.’[13] So abandoning the prayer is an action that leads its doer to die upon other than<em>eemaan</em> (faith) – and Allaah’s protection is sought. And abandoning the prayer is from the characteristics of the disbelievers who don’t pray and don’t give the<em>zakaah</em> (obligatory charity). Hence, if the Muslim does not pray, he has resembled the disbelievers. So his disbelief here is the disbelief related to actions [as long as he believes in the legislation of the prayer]. And the narrations which must be explained (with regard to their true meanings) are very numerous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For instance, during the farewell pilgrimage, (the Prophet) (<em>‘alayhi ssalaat was salaam</em>) ordered Jareer bin ‘Abdillaah al-Bajalee to quiet the people down and make them listen, and he (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) said while addressing them: ‘Do not return to being disbelievers after me by striking the necks of one another.’[14]And he (<em>‘alayhi ssalaat was salaam</em>) said: ‘Insulting a Muslim is disobedience (to Allaah), and fighting him is disbelief.’[15] But if a Muslim kills or fights another Muslim, has this (person) apostatized from his religion? The answer is: no, because Allaah said: {And if two parties or groups among the believers fall to fighting, then make peace between them both. But if one of them outrages against the other, then fight you (all) against the one that which outrages till it complies with the Command of Allah}.[16] <strong>He considered each of the two groups – the one outraging and the one being outraged – to be from the believers, although the Messenger (of Allaah) said in the previous <em>hadeeth</em> that ‘insulting a Muslim is disobedience (to Allaah) and fighting him is disbelief.</strong>’ So how is disbelief interpreted here? It is minor disbelief; it is disbelief related to actions. And the narrations about prayer – which declare that the one who abandons the prayer has disbelieved – are also (interpreted) likewise: either it is said that he is close to the disbelief related to faith (i.e., major <em>kufr</em>), that he is close to dying upon other than the religion of Islaam, or (it is said) that he has disbelieved with the disbelief related to actions. This interpretation is necessary so that we don’t contradict the narrations of the Messenger (of Allaah) (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) with one another.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Question #23: “Our Shaykh, I am asking you about the issue of proofs with regard to the ruling on the one who abandons the prayer. In the treatise ‘The ruling on the one who abandons prayer’ by Shaykh Muhammad Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, he is of the opinion that the one who abandons the prayer is a disbeliever, and he has many proofs, such as Allaah’s statement about the <em>mushrikoon</em>:[1] {But if they repent, perform <em>salaah</em> (the prayer), and give <em>zakaah</em> (obligatory charity), then they are your brethren in religion}.[2] So he says that what is understood from the <em>aayah</em> is that if they don’t do that, they are not our brethren; and the religious brotherhood isn’t negated by sins even if they are great, but it is negated when one leaves Islaam”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Yet he is not saying that if the person prays but doesn’t give the <em>zakaah</em> that he is (likewise) not a Muslim and that he has disbelieved by that. May Allaah guide you, you are bringing his proof but I would like to turn your attention to (the fact) that<strong>there is no proof in it because he is not saying about the one who abandons the<em>zakaah</em> the same as he is saying about the one who abandons the prayer.</strong> You didn’t just narrate his opinion, rather you narrated (both) his opinion and his proof, but I would like to turn your attention to (the fact) that this is not a proof for him, because the <em>aayah</em> includes <em>zakaah</em> along with the prayer, [yet he is differentiating between the one who abandons the former and the one who abandons the latter].”</p>
<div>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Question #23 (continued): “What is the ruling on this man who has abandoned the prayer, not out of denying (its legislation) but out of laziness? And what is the<em>daleel </em>(evidence)?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This (man) is one who is rebellious and disobedient (to Allaah), and not a disbeliever. The<em> daleel</em> is that ‘Whoever says <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>[3] (sincerely) will enter Paradise,’[4] and the <em>daleel</em> is that ‘Allaah has prescribed five prayers upon (His) slaves, so whoever performs them and does them well, and completes their<em>rukoo</em>’ (bowing), <em>sujood </em>(prostration) and <em>khushoo</em>’ (submissive humility and attentiveness), then he has a covenant with Allaah that He will enter him into Paradise, and whoever does not perform them and does not complete their <em>rukoo</em>’,<em>sujood</em> and <em>khushoo</em>’, then he does not have a covenant with Allaah;<strong> If He wills, He will punish him and if He wills, He will forgive him</strong>,’[5] <strong>and if he was a disbeliever, He would not forgive him</strong> because Allaah says: ‘Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills.’”[6]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <em>silsilat ul-hudaa wa nnoor – </em>the series of guidance and light &#8211; tape no. 206 (a), tape no. 664 (b), tape no. 426 (c)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">*Question #10: (a) “What should the one making <em>istikhaara</em>[1] prayer say if he has two affairs on the same level and does not have an inclination toward either one, meaning 50-50?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) answers: “What I understand from your question is that he does not have an<strong> intention (to do something)</strong><em>,</em>[2] therefore there is no<em> istikhaara </em>prayer upon him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">*Question #10: (a) “Is the <em>istikhaara</em> prayer legislated for one who is confused about doing something or is it legislated for one who has made up his mind to do so?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani answers: “No, the <em>istikhaara</em> prayer does not remove confusion. <strong><em>Istikhaara</em> prayer is (done) after a person has made up his mind to do something</strong>; so here, <em>istikhaara</em> is performed. <em>Istikhaara </em>prayer is not legislated for removing doubt and uncertainty regarding a matter which the Muslim has not made up his mind about.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">*Question #5: (b) “Is the <em>du’aa</em> (supplication) of <em>istikhaara</em> prayer before the<em>tasleem</em> or after it?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani answers: “<strong>After</strong> the <em>tasleem.</em>“</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">*Question #12: (c) “Is it allowed to repeat the <em>istikhaara</em> prayer?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani answers: “It is allowed if his<em> istikhaara</em> prayer was not (performed in the way in which it is) legislated, and it is enough for it to be not legislated if he makes <em>istikhaara</em> to his Lord by (merely) his words, and not by his heart. And he himself is aware of this inattentiveness, so then he is forced to repeat (the <em>istikhaara</em> prayer). As for if he himself did not feel any of that, <strong>then he has innovated (if he repeats it)</strong>.”</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<hr size="1"/>
<div>
<p>[1] <em>istikhaara</em> means to seek (from Allaah) that which is best regarding something<br />
[2] this is in reference to the actual wording of the <em>hadeeth</em> in which the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “If one of you <em>intends to do something</em>, then let him pray two <em>ra’kah</em>, then say [the <em>du&#8217;aa</em> of <em>istikhaara</em>]“; Saheeh al-Bukhaari #6382</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <em>bidaayat us-sool fi tafdheel ir-rasool </em>&#8211; …the superiority of the Messenger (of Allaah) (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) – page no. 5-7</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh al-Albaani</em> (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) says in his introduction:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Know, O <em>Muslim</em> brother, that it is not possible for anyone to rise to this station of loving Allaah and His Messenger [<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>] except by<em>tawheed</em> (singling out) of Allaah, the Most High, alone in His worship, and by singling out the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) alone for following from among the servants of Allaah, due to (Allaah’s) statement: ‘He who obeys the Messenger (Muhammad (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>)) has indeed obeyed Allaah’[1] and His statement ‘Say (O Muhammad (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em>to mankind): ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me (i.e. accept Islamic Monotheism, follow the Qur’aan and the Sunnah), Allaah will love you.’’[2] And (the Prophet) (‘<em>alayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>) said: ‘No, by the One in whose Hand my soul is, if <em>Moosaa</em> was alive, he would have no choice but to follow me.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: so <strong>if someone like <em>Moosaa</em>, the one who Allaah spoke to (directly), cannot follow other than the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>), then can anyone else do that?</strong> Hence, this is one of the definite evidences of the obligation of singling out the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) in following, which is one of the requirements of the<em> shahaada </em>(testimony): ‘<em>anna muhammad ar-rasoolullaah</em> (that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah)’ [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>]. Therefore, Allaah, the Blessed and Most High, in the before-mentioned <em>aayah</em>, made following him (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) alone to be a proof of Allaah’s love for (the follower). And there is no doubt that <strong>whoever Allaah loves, Allaah is with him in everything</strong>, as occurs in the authentic<em>hadeeth al-Qudsi</em>:[4] ‘(Allaah says), ‘My slave does not come near to me with anything more beloved to me than that which I have made obligatory upon him, and My slave continues to come near me with supererogatory deeds until I love him; and when I love him, I am his hearing with which he hears, his sight with which he sees, his hand with which he grasps and his leg with which he walks.[5]And if he asks me, I will surely give him, and if he seeks refuge in Me, I will surely protect him . . .’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if this divine care is only for the beloved slave of Allaah, it is obligatory upon every Muslim to take the means which will make him beloved to Allaah, namely following the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) alone; and just by that, he will attain special care from his Mawlaa[7], the Blessed and Most High. Don’t you see that it is not possible to know the obligatory duties and distinguish them from the supererogatory acts except by following him (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) alone? And indeed there is no doubt that the more the Muslim learns about the biography of the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) and knows of his pleasant nature and virtues, the more his love for him [<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>] will be and the more extensive and comprehensive his following of him [<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>] will be.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Question #2: “What is the authenticity of adding <em>wa maghfiratuh</em>[1] in offering the<em>salaam</em> and responding to it?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh al-Albaani</em> (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There is no addition (of <em>wa maghfiratuh</em>) in the <em>hadeeth </em>with respect to offering the <em>salaam</em>; i.e., if a person starts with offering the <em>salaam</em>, he ends at <em>wa barakaatuh</em>: <em>asalaamu ‘alaykum wa rahmatullaahi wa barakaatuh.</em> And the<em>hadeeth</em> that has come – or in more precise words, (the <em>hadeeth</em>) that was narrated – (stating) that at the fourth time, the fourth of them said, <em>asalaamu ‘alaykum wa rahmatullaahi wa barakaatuh wa maghfiratuh</em>, then this is a weak narration. As for the addition (of <em>wa maghfiratuh</em>) in the response to <em>wa barakaatuh</em>, then it is established; i.e., a man says, <em>asalaamu ‘alaykum wa rahmatullaahi wa barakaatuh</em>, then we add <em>wa maghfiratuh</em> in the response…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is in agreement with the noble <em>Qur’aan</em> (with) the saying ‘When you are greeted with a greeting, greet in return with what is better than it, or (at least) return it equally.’[2] So if the greeter gives the <em>salaam</em>, saying <em>asalaamu ‘alaykum wa rahmatullaahi wa barakaatuh</em>, the <em>aayah</em> that stated ‘greet in return with what is better than it’ is not invalidated; this command still exists, which is (followed by saying) <em>wa maghfiratuh</em>. This addition (with respect to responding) has also been mentioned in…narrations established from some of the Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we have brought out a conclusion whose summary is that<strong> adding <em>wa maghfiratuh</em> in the response is allowed and starting (the <em>salaam</em> with it) is not allowed</strong>.”</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>[1] saying ‘and His Forgiveness’ after the greeting ‘may Peace, Mercy and Blessings of Allaah be upon you’<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh al-Albaani</em> (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) comments:[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say, it is<strong> not</strong> part of the permissible lying that (the man) promises (his wife) something that he does not intend to fulfill for her, or he tells her that he bought such and such thing for her with such and such price – i.e., more than the real (price) – for the purpose of pleasing her, because that may be revealed to her; then it will be a reason for her to think badly of her husband, and that is part of corruption, not rectification.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Question #11: “Are good deeds multiplied in general during <em>Ramadhaan</em> and likewise evil deeds?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh al-Albaani</em> (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This question is also often brought up regarding Makkah and the one residing in Makkah, whether he is a foreigner or a Makkan; are good deeds and evil deeds multiplied over there? The answer: t<strong>here isn’t any text in the Islamic legislation clearly (stating) that good deeds are multiplied, and likewise evil deeds, due to the excellence of a (certain) place or the excellence of a (certain) time</strong>; excellence of a place like <em>Makkah</em> and <em>Madinah</em> for example (and) excellence of a time like this month of ours, the month of <em>Ramadhaan</em>. There isn’t any clear text about good deeds or evil deeds being multiplied (in such cases). But some of the scholars, by way of deduction, say that they are multiplied – by way of deduction, i.e., not based on a text but rather by way of<em> ijtihaad</em>.[1] So if someone says that good deeds are multiplied, there is no harm in that because it is the saying of some of the scholars. But it is not allowed to be absolutely certain about that due to the nonexistence of (relevant evidence mentioned in) the holy text which ‘falsehood cannot come to from before it or behind it.’”[2]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaani: “Even if it is a <i>sunnah</i>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">* * *</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: “Are the prostrations of forgetfulness before the <i>tasleem</i> or after the <i>tasleem</i>?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“For all prostrations of forgetfulness, one has the <strong>choice </strong>between prostrating<strong>before</strong> the <i>tasleem</i> <strong>or after </strong>the <i>tasleem</i>. And the detailed explanation mentioned in some, especially Hanbali, books that it is before the <i>tasleem</i> for additions and after the <i>tasleem</i> for omissions – this is baseless. Those who say so saw some cases to which such an explanation can be applied, however there are also cases that nullify this explanation. Therefore, one has the choice between performing the <i>tasleem</i> then prostrating, or prostrating then performing the<i> tasleem</i> of exiting the prayer.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"> * *</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“…When all the<em> hadeeth</em>s are gathered together, it becomes clear that one who forgets in prayer has a choice: if he wants, he <strong>(first) performs the <i>tasleem</i></strong> and that is <strong>absolutely better</strong>; or if he wants, he does not perform the <i>tasleem</i> except after completing the two prostrations of forgetfulness.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: “The same as these i.e. <i>tasbeeh</i> and <i>rabb-ighfir lee</i>.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">source: fataawaa jeddah, tape no. 13/4<br />
<em>asaheeha translations</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: “How do we reconcile between the Prophet’s (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) prohibition of praying in the graveyard and his praying over the grave of the woman who used to sweep the mosque?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaikh al-Albaani</strong> (<em>rahimahullaah</em>):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There is no contradiction between the two<em> hadeeth</em>s, and all praise is due to Allaah. The first <em>hadeeth</em> with the prohibition of praying in the graveyard is as his  (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) saying in Saheeh Muslim: ‘Don’t sit on graves and don’t pray towards them.’[1] So the prohibition of praying in the graveyard, i.e. praying towards the graves, is because <strong>prayer must be sincerely for the Face of Allaah (<em>tabaarak wa ta’aala</em>) without any glorification for other than Allaah corrupting it or being mixed with it,  as that is one type of <em>shirk</em></strong>.[2] So if a Muslim begins to pray to Allaah while facing the grave, there is an obvious suspicion that this person at least intends – as many of the ignorant people do in this era – to seek blessing from this dead person by means of his prayer and by means of his seeking nearness to Allaah (<em>‘azza wa jal</em>) with his prayer. Thus, he has fallen into some <em>shirk</em>,  and he may go too far into it such that his situation reaches the point where it would expel him from the circle of Islaam, and refuge is sought in Allaah. This meaning is what should be considered with regard to the Messenger’s (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) prohibition of praying in the graveyard or praying towards the grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for praying over the dead person while he is in his grave, then this is something else. It has no connection with (the previous situation of) praying to Allaah – Who is alone with no partner – while facing the grave of the dead person, the intention of which is not so that Allaah forgives him, has mercy on him, as is the implied purpose when supplicating over the dead person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, <strong>praying over the dead person while he is in his grave is one thing, and praying to Allaah (<em>‘azza wa jal</em>) while facing the grave is another thing</strong>.<strong> This (the latter) is what is prohibited and that (the former) is what is allowed</strong>, so there is no contradiction between this and that.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <em>silsilat ul-hudaa wa nnoor – </em>the series of guidance and light &#8211; tape no. 697</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question #3: “Is it allowed for the woman to put on make-up if she leaves her house wearing the<em> hijaab</em>?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh al-Albaani </em>(<em>rahimahullaah</em>) answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>It is not permissible for the woman who does not wear <em>hijaab</em>, let alone who wears <em>hijaab</em>, to use the makeup of the disbeliever, the make-up of the rebellious and disobedient (to Allaah). </strong>When were you aware of some women’s adornment called by a name for which Allaah did not send down an authority: ‘make-up’? This is a word that we don’t know, not us nor your forefathers from before. Rather, it is a foreign word expressing an adornment for the rebellious and disobedient women of Europe; and our women – except those of them whom Allaah protects – unfortunately imitate decorating themselves with this adornment which the Islamic society is being affected by, namely make-up. So it is not permissible for the woman. And this reality is one of the strange ironies: in the road we see a woman wearing a decent <em>hijaab</em> (but) I don’t say the Islamically legislated <em>hijaab</em>; she ties what they call the ‘<em>ishaarb</em>’ – or <em>khimaar</em> which is the (correct) Arabic word – covering her hair, her neck and so on, but she has face powder and lipstick on. This (wearing the <em>hijaab</em>) is against this (wearing make-up): two contradictory, conflicting matters that do not go together. What is the reason (for this type of occurrence)? It is one of two things: either ignorance and heedlessness of the Islamically legislated ruling or it is due to the women’s following of the whisperings of <em>shaytaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, we firstly remind the women who suffer from this make-up. Then secondly, we remind the guardians of women such as a father or a husband or a brother, due to the fact that (the Prophet) (<em>‘alayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>) said: ‘Everyone of you is a shepherd and everyone of you is responsible for his flock. So the man is a shepherd and he is responsible for his flock-’[1] to the end of the<em>hadeeth</em>. Thus, the Arabic or general proverb states: ‘The horse is from the horseman.’ So you, the husband of the woman, it is not permissible for you to allow her to go out in this manner which puts to trial the middle-aged men, let alone the young men! And you, O man, O father, O brother, are supposed to be very jealous. Why? Because the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa aalihi wa sallam</em>) used to say: ‘<strong>A <em>duyyooth </em>will not enter Paradise</strong>.’[2] Why? Who is a <em>duyyooth</em>? He is the one who does not guard his womenfolk jealously.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="entry-title" style="text-align:center;"><strong>We should not eat while standing</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: “Is it allowed to eat while standing?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say, there is no text about the prohibition of eating while standing like there occurs the text prohibiting drinking while standing. But there is a narration from Anas bin Maalik رضي الله عنه that when he narrated to those around him in a gathering that the Prophet ﷺ prohibited drinking while standing, someone said to him: ‘What about eating (while standing)?’ He replied: ‘It is worse.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say here, we should follow this Companion because we don’t have anything with which we can contradict him. But what is the distinction between eating while standing and eating while walking? <strong>Eating while walking is allowed</strong>, because there is text clearly stating that they used to eat while walking during the time of the Prophet ﷺ. As for eating while standing, there is no text regarding it from the Prophet ﷺ, neither negative nor positive. All we have is this authentic narration from Anas bin Maalik and this is what we act upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, maybe some of you noticed in these times that it has become a fashion for the disbelievers to eat while standing although chairs are present; but they don’t sit on them out of pride. So then, the previous ruling is further strengthened. <strong>I say, we are with the narration of Anas, because Anas knew what we don’t know, and because the disbelievers nowadays and the Muslims who imitate them eat while standing, so we differ from them</strong>.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question #6: “Is it <em>sunnah</em> to eat with three fingers generally with respect to all food or specifically with <em>thareed</em>[1] only?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh al-Albaani </em>(<em>rahimahullaah</em>) answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There isn’t, in the <em>Sunnah</em> mentioned from the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa aalihi wa sallam</em>), that which will help us to answer this question. All there is, is that the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa aalihi wa sallam</em>) used to eat with three fingers; but that which is necessary for us to say about this <em>hadeeth</em> with regard to its<em> fiqh</em> (understanding) is that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Firstly, <strong>this <em>hadeeth</em> does not mean to determine that it is not permissible for the Muslim to eat by other means like the well-known spoons today</strong>. Rather, it only means that if the Muslim eats a food that can be eaten with three fingers, then he (should) not show that he is greedy with the food such that he eats with the whole handful while he is able to eat like the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa aalihi wa sallam</em>) used to eat, with three fingers. Secondly, it is known that gravy of meat, for example, cannot be eaten with three fingers; so there it is necessary (to use) other means to eat it. And this is from the worldly affairs and not from the affairs of the religion, which the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa aalihi wa sallam</em>) was assigned that he conveys all the rulings of the religion to the people. He (<em>‘alayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>) has said (regarding) worldly affairs: ‘You are more knowledgeable about your worldly affairs than me.’”[2]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: “Is it allowed for a resident to combine Dhuhr and `Asr prayers without any excuse?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Imaam Muslim reported in his Saheeh<i> </i>the <i>hadeeth</i> from<i> </i>Ibn `Abbaas who said: ‘The Messenger of Allaah ﷺ combined Dhuhr with `Asr and Maghrib with<i></i>`Ishaa in Madeenah without being in a state of traveling or the presence of rain.’ They said: ‘Why did he do that O Abu l-`Abbaas?’<a>[1]</a> This was `Abdullaah bin `Abbaas’s <i>kunyah</i>. He replied: ‘So he would not put his <i>ummah</i> to difficulty.’’<a>[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is apparent from the <i>hadeeth</i> is that it is permissible to combine two prayers while being a resident and without the excuse of rain, as rain is a Legislated excuse that allows the combining of two prayers. And here Ibn `Abbaas says that the Prophet ﷺ combined while he was a resident and combined without the excuse of rain, and he confirmed that when he was asked the previous question ‘Why did he do that?’ by saying: ‘So he would not put his<i>ummah</i> to difficulty.’ This is the <i>hadeeth</i> and it is in Saheeh Muslim, not al-Bukhaari. The same meaning is found in al-Bukhaari: that he combined prayers in Madeenah as eight <i>rak`ah</i>s,<a>[3]</a> but it does not have this detail that Imaam Muslim reported from Ibn `Abbaas which contains this important subtlety – i.e. his <sub>رضي الله عنه</sub> statement ‘So he would not put his <i>ummah</i> to difficulty’ in answer to that question.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So some scholars of both old and recent times hold that this combining is permissible for a resident without any excuse, and I don’t consider this correct because<strong> the narrator of the <i>hadeeth</i> justifies the Messenger’s ﷺ combining without an excuse with another excuse: which is to legislate and explain to the people, as Ibn `Abbaas said, ‘So he ﷺ<sub> </sub>would not put his <i>ummah</i> to difficulty.’</strong>This means that the ruling of combining as a resident is restricted to the presence of difficulty if one were to not combine. So when there is difficulty in performing the prayers in their known appointed times, it is permissible to combine to avoid the difficulty, which Allaah عز وجل negated in the likes of His Statement: {He has not placed upon you in the religion any difficulty}.<a>[4]</a> But if there is no difficulty, it is obligatory to maintain performing the five prayers, each prayer in its time, because there is no difficulty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, I am sitting here and I hear the <i>adhaan</i> there in the nearby mosque and I am able to go out without any difficulty, then it is not permissible for me to combine. And vice versa: when I came on this trip I found that this electric elevator wasn’t working, and it is very difficult for me as you see because of a pain in my knees to go down or up by way of stairs. So some prayers went by and I didn’t go out to the mosque. But when the electric elevator was fixed and saved me the difficulty of going up and down, it became obligatory upon me to pray every prayer in the mosque because I did not find this difficulty that I had found when I just settled here. Therefore combining is only allowed to avoid difficulty; and when there is no difficulty, there is no combining. <strong>They are two inseparable matters: when there is no difficulty, there is no combining; when there is<i></i>difficulty, there is combining.</strong> And this is the best that can be said to reconcile between this authentic <i>hadeeth</i> and the <i>hadeeth</i>s clearly stating that every prayer is to be prayed in its appointed time and that it is not allowed to distract oneself from it – especially since in most circumstances, combining necessitates leaving prayer with the congregation, as I described to you my previous situation.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">source:<em> Silsilat ul-ahaadeeth us-saheeha</em> – the series of authentic narrations – <em>hadeeth </em>no. 43<br />
assaheeha translations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “O <em>‘Aaisha</em>, if your people had not recently been polytheists (and new converts to <em>Islaam</em>), and if I had enough means to reconstruct it, I would have spent the treasure of the <em>Ka’bah</em> in the way of Allaah, and I would have demolished the <em>Ka’bah</em> and made it at a level with the ground. Then I would have rebuilt it on its original foundations laid by <em>Ibraaheem</em> (Abraham) and made two doors for it – a door facing the east, for the people to enter, and a door facing the west, for their exit… And I would expand (the <em>Ka’bah</em>) by six cubits (around three meters) of area from <em>al-Hijr</em> (the unroofed portion of the <em>Ka’bah</em> which is at present in the form of a semi-circular, wall-surrounded area in the north side of the <em>Ka’bah</em>); (in [another] narration: I would have included the space of <em>al-Hijr</em> in it ), for when the <em>Quraish</em> had rebuilt the<em> Ka’bah</em>, they reduced its (area). And if your people would take initiative after me in rebuilding it, then come along with me so that I could show you what they have left out of it.” He [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] showed her about seven cubits (three and a half meters) of area (from the side of <em>al-Hijr</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In [another] narration from her (<em>‘Aaisha</em>), she said: “I asked the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) about the wall (i.e., <em>al-Hijr</em>): ‘Is it regarded as part of the House (the <em>Ka’bah</em>)?’ He [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] replied, ‘Yes.’ I said: ‘Then why did they not include it in the House?’ He [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] said, ‘Your people ran short of the means/money (to do so).’ I said: ‘Why is it that the level of its door is raised high?’ He [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] said, ‘Your people did it to admit whomever they liked, and prevent whomever they disliked; (in [another] narration: (They did it) out of vanity so that (they might be in a position) to grant admittance to only whom they wished. So when a person intended to enter it, they called him to climb (the stairs), and when he was about to enter, they pushed him and he fell down). Were your people not close to the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance (i.e. they have recently embraced<em> Islaam</em>) and were I not afraid that their hearts might deny (my action), then surely I would have included the (area of the) wall inside (the building of) the House and I would have made its gate touch the ground.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, when <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> ruled, he demolished it and made two doors for it. (In [another] narration: That was what urged <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr </em>to demolish (the <em>Ka’bah</em>). <em>Yazeed bin Rumaan</em> said: ‘I saw <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> when he demolished it, rebuilt it and included <em>al-Hijr </em>in it. And I saw the original foundations of <em>Ibraaheem</em> (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) which were of stones joined together resembling the humps of camels.’)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>*</strong>the translation of the above <em>hadeeth</em>, for the most part, was taken directly from the already translated text of <em>saheeh al-bukhaari </em>and<em> saheeh muslim</em><strong>*</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>shaykh al-albaani </em>(<em>rahimahullaah</em>) summarizes a number of benefits from the above narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This <em>hadeeth</em> indicates two things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First: that it is obligatory to delay carrying out rectification, if an evil greater than [its good] results from it. And from it, the scholars of <em>fiqh</em> took their famous principle: ‘<strong>Repelling the evil [comes] before bringing the good</strong>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: that the honorable <em>Ka’bah</em> is now in need of the reconstructions that the <em>hadeeth</em> includes, due to the disappearance of the reason for the sake of which the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) left that – and (the reason) is that the hearts of those who were recently polytheists in his time (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) would have a dislike [for it]. And <em>Ibn Battaal </em>has reported from some of the scholars that: ‘the dislike that he (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) feared was that they would accuse him of boasting by himself over them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible to list those reconstructions in what follows:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>1- Expanding the <em>Ka’bah</em> and building it upon the foundation of <em>Ibraaheem </em>(<em>‘alayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>), and that is by adding approximately six cubits (three meters) of <em>al-Hijr</em></li>
<li>2- Leveling its ground with the surface of the <em>Haram</em> (<em>Al-Masjid ul-Haraam</em>)</li>
<li>3- Opening another door for it from the Western side</li>
<li>4 – Making the two doors low with the ground to organize and facilitate entering it and exiting from it for everyone who wishes</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed,<em> ‘Abdullaah bin uz-Zubayr </em>(<em>radi Allaahu ‘anhumaa</em>) had carried out the fulfillment of this reconstruction completely during his rule in <em>Makkah</em>, but the unjust political administration returned the <em>Ka’bah</em> after him to its previous state!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the<em> shaykh </em>then mentions the following <em>hadeeth</em> as narrated by <em>Muslim</em> and <em>Abu Nu’aym</em> on the authority of <em>‘Ataa</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The House was burnt during the time of <em>Yazeed bin Mu’aawiya</em> when the people of <em>Shaam</em> had fought (in <em>Makkah</em>), and it happened with it (the<em> Ka’bah</em>) what was (in store for it). <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> left it (in the same state) until the people came in the season (of <em>Hajj</em>) – he wanted to encourage them or urge them on (to war) against the people of <em>Shaam</em>. When the people had arrived, he said to them, ‘O people, advise me about the <em>Ka’bah</em>. Should I demolish it and then build it from its very foundation, or should I repair whatever has been damaged of it?’ <em>Ibn ‘Abbaas</em> [<em>radi Allaahu &#8216;anhu</em>] said, ‘An idea has occurred to me, according to which I think that you should only repair whatever has been damaged for it, and leave the House (in the same state) in which people embraced<em> Islaam</em>, (and leave) the stones (in the same state) in which people embraced<em> Islaam</em> and upon which the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) was sent.’ So, <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr </em>said, ‘If the house of any one of you was burnt, he would not be pleased until he had reconstructed it, then how about the House of your Lord (which is far more important than your house)?! Indeed, I will seek good advice from my Lord thrice and then I will make up my mind about this affair.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After seeking good advice thrice, he made up his mind to demolish it. The people were suspicious and fearful that calamity might fall from heaven on those persons who would be first to climb over it (for the purpose of demolishing it), until a man climbed it and threw down one of its stones. When the people saw no calamity befalling him, they followed him and demolished it until they leveled it to the ground. Then, <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> erected pillars and hung curtains on them until the walls were raised. And <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr </em>said, ‘Indeed I heard<em> ‘Aaisha </em>say that the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: (he then mentioned the first portion of the <em>hadeeth</em> [mentioned in the beginning], then he said) – I today have the means to spend and I don’t fear the people (that they would protest against this change).’ So he expanded it by five cubits (around two and a half meters) of area from the side of <em>al-Hijr</em> until it appeared as the original foundation (upon which <em>Ibraaheem</em> had built the <em>Ka’bah</em>), and the people saw it; and it was upon this foundation that he raised the wall. The length of the <em>Ka’bah</em> was eighteen cubits (around nine meters), and when he had expanded it, he found it to be short (since the addition was made to its width, so naturally the length appeared to be small compared to its width). Therefore, he expanded its length by ten cubits (around five meters). He also constructed two doors, one of which (was meant) for entrance and the other one for exit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, when <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> was killed, <em>al-Hajjaaj </em>wrote to <em>‘Abd ul-Malik bin Marwaan </em>informing him about it, and telling him that <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> had built (the<em> Ka’bah</em>) on the very foundation (which was laid by <em>Ibraaheem</em>) and which reliable persons among the people of <em>Makkah</em> had seen. Then, <em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em> wrote to him: ‘Indeed, we are not concerned with disgracing <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> in anything. As for what he added in the side of its length, keep it intact; and as for what he added from the side of <em>al-Hijr</em>, return it to its (previous) foundation, and close up the door which he opened.’ Thus, he (<em>al-Hajjaaj</em>) demolished it (that portion) and rebuilt it on its (previous) foundation.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>*</strong>the translation of the above <em>hadeeth</em>, for the most part, was taken directly from the already translated text of <em>saheeh</em><em> muslim</em><strong>*</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>shaykh al-albaani</em> continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“That is what <em>al-Hajjaaj</em> the oppressor did by the command of<em> ‘Abd ul-Malik</em> the mistaken one, and I don’t think that his regret later on clears him of his mistake. <em>Muslim</em> and <em>Abu Na’eem</em> have also narrated from <em>‘Abdullaah bin ‘Ubayd</em> who said: <em>Al-Haarith bin ‘Abdillaah</em> came to <em>‘Abd ul-Malik bin Marwaan</em> as an envoy during his <em>Khilaafa</em> (Caliphate), and<em> ‘Abd ul-Malik</em> said, ‘I don’t think that<em> Abu Habeeb</em> (i.e., <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em>) heard from<em> ‘Aaisha</em> that which he claimed to hear from her.’ <em>Al-Haarith</em> said: ‘But yes, I [myself] heard it from her.’ He (<em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em>) said, ‘You heard her saying what?’ He (<em>Al-Haarith</em>) said, ‘She said: the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: (he then mentioned the <em>hadeeth</em>).’ <em>‘Abd ul-Malik </em> said to <em>Al-Haarith</em>, ‘You heard her saying this?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ Then, he (<em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em>) scratched the ground with his staff for a while and then said, ‘I wish that I had left it and not changed [the reconstructions carried out by<em> Ibn uz-Zubayr</em>].’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is in [another] narration from them both (<em>Muslim and Abu Na’eem</em>) from <em>Abu Qaz’ah </em>that: While <em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em> <em>bin Marwaan </em>was going around the House, he at that time said, ‘May Allaah fight <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> since he uttered a lie upon the mother of the believers, saying: I heard her say: (he then mentioned the <em>hadeeth</em>).’ So, <em>Al-Haarith bin ‘Abdillaah bin Rabee’ah</em> said, ‘Don’t say this O leader of the believers, for I [myself] heard the mother of the believers saying this.’ He (<em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em>) said, ‘If I had heard it before I demolished it (the <em>Ka’bah</em>), I would have left it upon what <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> had built.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (<em>Shaykh al-Albaani</em>) say: it was (obligatory) upon him, before the demolition, to verify and to <strong>ask the people of knowledge</strong> about that, whether it was allowed for him to criticize <em>‘Abdullaah bin uz-Zubayr</em> and accuse him of uttering a lie upon the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>). And his truthfulness (<em>radi Allaahu ‘anhu</em>) became clear to<em> ‘Abd ul-Malik</em> by <em>Al-Haarith</em>‘s agreeing with it, as many a group from <em>‘Aaisha</em> (<em>radi Allaahu ‘anhaa</em>) agreed with it. And I have collected their narrations…in this <em>hadeeth</em>, and the <em>hadeeth</em> is detailed from<em> ‘Aaisha</em>. Therefore, I indeed fear that <em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em> had prior knowledge about the <em>hadeeth</em> before he demolished the House, but he pretended that he did not hear about it except through <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em>. So when <em>Al-Haarith bin ‘Abdillaah</em> opposed him, that he also had heard it (the <em>hadeeth</em>) from <em>‘Aaisha</em>, he (<em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em>) showed regret at what he had done, [but] it was too late for regrets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, it has reached us that there is an idea or plan to expand the area of <em>tawaaf </em>(circumambulation) around  the <em>Ka’bah</em> and transfer the <em>Maqaam Ibraaheem</em> (the Standing Place of <em>Ibraaheem</em>) (<em>‘alayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>) to another place. So in relation to this, <strong>I suggest to those responsible (for the <em>Ka’bah</em>) that they hasten to expand the <em>Ka’bah</em> before everything (else) and rebuilt it upon the foundation of <em>Ibraaheem </em>(<em>‘alayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>)</strong>, fulfilling the noble, honorable Prophetic wish in this<em> hadeeth</em>, and saving the people from the problems of crowding at the door of the <em>Ka’bah</em> which is witnessed every year, and from the domination of the guard over the door who prevents whoever he wishes from entering and allows whoever he wishes, for the sake of a few dirhams!”</p>

Shaykh al-Albaani<br />
source: silsilat ul-hudaa wa nnoor, 97/6<br />
<em>asaheeha translations</em></p>
<p>Q: <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“How does one perform<em> sujood ash-shukr</em> (the prostration of thankfulness)?”</span></strong></p>
<p>Shaykh al-Albaani (<em>rahimahullaah</em>):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It comprises of <strong>one</strong> prostration, and none of the preconditions needed for prayer are stipulated for it. So it is like <em>sujood at-tilaawah,</em> they both have the same ruling. <strong>Neither of them have a precondition such as being in a state of purification, facing the <em>qiblah</em>, making the <em>takbeer</em>, making the <em>tasleem</em>, and so on</strong>. Rather, if he is surprised by some blessing, he prostrates immediately the way he is and praises Allaah with whatever (words) he can for that blessing that He gave him, out of thanks to Him. Likewise if he recites a verse of prostration from the Book of Allaah (<em>‘azza wa jal</em>), he prostrates immediately, whether he has<em>wudhoo</em> or not, whether he is facing the <em>qiblah</em> or not, without making<em> takbeer al-ihraam</em> and without making any<em> tashahhud</em> or <em>salaam</em>.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: “Should a woman cover her feet when she prays?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>It is not permissible for her to pray with her feet uncovered, indeed it is not permissible for her to walk in the streets with her feet uncovered, because the feet are part of a woman’s <em>`awrah</em></strong><strong> </strong>based on Allaah’s عز وجل Statement: {And let them not stamp their feet to make known what they conceal of their adornment}.[1] The woman during the Days of Ignorance used to wear what is known in the Arabic language as<em> khalkhaal</em> (anklet), meaning a bracelet with small bells. So when the woman walked, she – in order to turn the men’s attention to her – would strike the ground with her feet so the anklet would make a noise and the men would hear that; and such was due to <em>shaitaan’</em>s whisperings to her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that the feet used to be covered. Because of what? Because of the<em>jilbaab</em> that the women were commanded to cast down from over their heads, according to Allaah’s Statement: {O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their outer garments  (<em>jilbaab</em>s) close upon themselves}.[2] And it is mentioned in the authentic <em>hadeeth</em> that the Prophet ﷺ said one day during a gathering in which there were also women: ‘Whoever drags his garment out of pride, Allaah عز وجل will not look at him on the Day of Resurrection.’ One of the women said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, then our feet will be exposed.’ He ﷺ said: ‘let the women lengthen (their garments) by a hand-span.’ She said: ‘Then a wind will come and uncover (their feet).’ He ﷺ said: ‘let them add another hand-span, i.e. (a total of) one cubit, and not go beyond that.’[3] [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this manner, the<em> jilbaab</em> of the Muslim woman – at the time of the revelation of the above-mentioned verse: {to draw their outer garments (<em>jilbaab</em>s) close upon themselves} – used to cover the feet since the socks that are widespread nowadays among both women and men were not widespread at that time. The woman used to cover her shins and feet with the long<em> jilbaab</em> that resembles the <em>`</em><em>abaa.ah</em>. Therefore it is not permissible for a Muslim woman to uncover her feet while she is on the street, and it is even more impermissible for her to pray with her feet uncovered.”</p>

</strong> sources: silsilat ul-hudaa wa nnoor, 340/8 &amp; nudhum al-fawaaid, 21<br />
<em>asaheeha translations<br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~ Explanation of the <em>hadeeth</em>: ‘Actions are only judged by intentions’ [Saheeh al-Bukhaari #1] ~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaani (rahimahullaah):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This <em>hadeeth</em> means that<strong> righteous actions are only (sound/accepted/rewarded) by sincere intentions</strong>,<em><strong> not</strong></em> <strong>that actions opposing the Legislation turn into righteous legislated actions due to coupling them with righteous intentions.</strong> No one will say that except someone ignorant or pursuing his own interests!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many people know this <em>hadeeth</em> in wording but don’t understand its meaning. Why? Because oftentimes we turn (to some people) and say: ‘<em>Yaa akhi</em>, this action that you are doing, or this statement that you are uttering, is not a righteous action.’ What is the answer? ‘<em>Yaa akhi</em>, the Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: ‘Actions are only judged by intentions’ and my intention is good! My intention is righteous!’</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is the meaning of the <em>hadeeth</em>? Does the <em>hadeeth</em> mean that evil actions are only (sound/accepted/rewarded) by righteous intentions? Or does it mean that righteous actions are only (sound/accepted/rewarded) by righteous intentions? This latter statement is the meaning. As for if one’s actions are not righteous but intention is righteous – this is not enough. Likewise it is also not enough if it is vice versa: i.e. if one’s actions are righteous but intention is not righteous. So the <em>hadeeth</em> gives us two opposites: just like it is a condition for righteous action that there be righteous intention,<strong> it is likewise a condition for righteous intention that there be righteous action</strong>. So either one is not enough without the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You hear many people nowadays swearing by their fathers for example, saying: ‘.’ Sometimes you may find a person coming to a grave and praying there – a grave of a prophet or righteous person or the like – then when they are prohibited from that, he tells you: ‘My intention is not to worship him, my intention is to seek nearness to Allaah (<em>tawassul</em>) through him.’ Ok, your coming to this grave – granted that the intention is righteous – is an action, so is this a righteous action? The answer is no, because the Messenger (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) used to say: ‘Don’t sit on the graves nor pray toward them.’ And <em>du’aa</em> is part of prayer, in fact <em>du’aa</em> is worship as he (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) said. Hence turning to the grave with <em>du’aa</em> is like turning to it with prayer: it is an action that is not righteous, and this unrighteous action is not justified by the intention being righteous, <em>if</em> we grant that the intention is righteous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, <strong>for our actions to be righteous, they must be in agreement with the Legislation</strong>. This is what our Lord (<em>‘azza wa jal</em>) pointed to with His Statement in the Noble Qur’aan: {<span style="color:#008000;">whoever hopes for the meeting with his Lord, let him do righteous work and not associate any partner in the worship of his Lord</span>}.”</p>

<p><strong>Shaykh ‘Abd ur-Razzaaq al-Badr</strong> (hafidhahullaah) comments:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“All of these Names are mentioned in the Qur’aan, and the most-mentioned one is al-Qadeer, then al-Qaadir, then al-Muqtadir. And all of them demonstrate that Power is established as an Attribute of Allaah, and that He, subhaanah, has <span style="color:#008000;"><strong><em>Absolute Power</em></strong></span>; so by His Power He brought the creation into being, and by His Power He gives life and gives death, and will resurrect the slaves for recompense, and He will reward the one who did good for his doing good, and the one who did evil for his doing evil,<em> the One who if He wills something, He says to it: Be – and it is</em>; and <em>by His Power He turns the hearts to whatever He wills</em>, and He guides whoever He wills and leads astray whoever He wills.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And due to His Absolute Power, no one can compass any of His Knowledge except what He wills to teach him, and due to His Absolute Power, He created the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them in six days and no fatigue touched Him; and <em>no one from His creation can make Him incapable</em>, the One whose Power is free from fatigue and inability to do what He wants; and due to His Absolute Power,<em> everything</em> is under His disposal, so whatever He wills will be and whatever He doesn’t will will never be.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed for having eemaan (faith) in the Power of Allaah, ‘azza wa jal – which His Names ‘Al-Qadeer, Al-Qaadir, Al-Muqtadir’ demonstrate – there are great effects and blessed fruits that return to the slave in his worldly life and hereafter. Hence, <span style="color:#993300;"><em>part of its blessed fruits is that it strengthens – in the slave – seeking the help of Allaah; and part of its effects is having complete patience and being well-pleased with Allaah</em></span>. Ibn ul-Qayyim, rahimahullaah, said: ‘Whoever fills his heart with <strong>ridhaa</strong> (being pleased) with the <strong>Qadr</strong> (Decree), Allaah will fill his chest with contentment and He will free his heart for loving Him, turning to Him in repentance and putting his trust in Him; and whoever misses his portion of ridhaa, his heart will be filled with the opposite of that, and he will be distracted from what his happiness and success are in.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And part of its effects is a person’s safety from the diseases of the hearts such as rancor, envy and the like, because of his belief that <em>all the affairs are by the decree of Allaah</em>, ‘azza wa jal, and that<em> He</em>, subhaanah, is the One who gives His slaves and decrees their provisions for them. So He gives whoever He wills and prevents whoever He wills, as the grace is<em> His Grace</em>, subhaanah, and the gift is<em> His Gift</em>, and<em> this is why it is said about the envious one that he is the enemy of Allaah’s blessing upon His slaves</em>. And part of its effects is always asking Allaah and making a lot of du’aa to Him, because all the affairs are in His Hand.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dharr al-Ghifārī said that the Messenger of Allāh (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“The seven heavens in comparison to the Kursī is nothing but like a ring thrown in a desert, and the excellence of the ʽArsh (Throne of Allāh) over the Kursī is like the excellence of that desert over that ring.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albānī comments:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The hadīth comes forth as an explanation of (Allāh’s) statement, the Most High: ‘His Kursī extends over the heavens and the earth,’[1] and it is clear with regard to the existence of the Kursī being the greatest of creations after the Throne (of Allāh), and that it is an independent, physical entity and not something abstract. Therefore, there is a refutation in (this hadīth) against the one who interprets (the Kursī) to mean ‘dominion’ and ‘extent of rule,’ as mentioned in some explanations of the Qur’ān. And it was not narrated from Ibn Abbās that (the Kursī) is ‘knowledge,’ so it is not correct to attribute it to him because it is from the narration of Jaʽfar bin Abi l-Mughīra from Saʽīd bin Jubayr from (Ibn ʽAbbās). Ibn Jarīr reported it. Ibn Mandah said: ‘Ibn Abi l-Mughīra is not strong with regard to (narrating from) Ibn Jubayr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And know that it is not correct to describe the Kursī…as in some narrations that…four angels carry it, each angel having four faces, and their feet are upon the rock that is under the seventh earth, etc. So all of this is not correct in being attributed to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and some of (these narrations) are more severe in weakness than others.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s Note: Shaykh Al-Albānī after this however, did grade the following narration as authentic:<br />
Abu Mūsā al-Ashʽarī said: “The Kursī is the place of the two Feet and it has a groaning like that of a camel saddle.”[2]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>source</strong>:  <em>silsilat ul-ahaadeeth idh-dha&#8217;eefa – </em>the series of weak narrations <em>– hadeeth</em> no. 163</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“If the Arabs are humiliated, Islaam is also humiliated&#8221; &#8211; grading of<em> hadeeth</em>: <em>mawdoo&#8217;</em> (fabricated)</p>
<p><strong>Shaykh al-Albaani</strong> (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) comments:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The glory of Islaam is not connected with Arabs only; rather Allaah may give it glory by other than them from the believers, as that happened during the time of the Ottoman Empire especially in its beginning. So Allaah had given glory to Islaam through them until its authority spread to the middle of Europe. Then, when they started to abandon the Sharee’ah (Islamic Legislation) and incline toward the European laws &#8211; taking that which is lower in exchange for that which is better &#8211; their authority diminished from those countries and others until it had disappeared from their (own) countries as well! Hence, only something little remained there of the manifestations that could indicate their Islaam! So by that, all of the Muslims were humiliated after their glory, and the disbelievers entered most of their countries and concentrated on humiliating them. And even if these (countries) were apparently freed from (the disbelievers’) colonization, they colonize them in secret under the screen of many projects such as the economy and the like! Therefore, it is established that Islaam is given glory and humiliated by the glory and humiliation of its people whether they are Arabs or non-Arabs, and ‘there is no superiority of an Arab over a non-Arab except by<em> taqwaa</em>.’[1] So O Allaah! Give glory to the Muslims and inspire them to return to Your Book and the Sunnah of Your Prophet [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] until You give glory to Islaam by them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, that does not negate the Arab race being better than the race of the rest of the nations; rather, this is what I believe in – even though I am Albanian but indeed I am Muslim, all praises and thanks are to Allaah – because the precedence of the Arab race that I have mentioned is that which <em>ahl us-sunnah wal jamaa’ah</em>[2] are upon, and a group of mentioned narrations about this matter indicates (this), such as (the Prophet’s) (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) statement: ‘…Indeed Allaah chose Bani Kinaanah from the offspring of Ismaa’eel, and chose Quraysh from Bani Kinaanah, and chose Bani Haashim from Quraysh, and chose me from Bani Haashim.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But this should not cause the Arab to boast of his race – because it is from the affairs of<em> jaahiliyyah</em> which our Prophet Muhammad (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>), the Arab, had abolished, as clarified earlier – just as<strong> we should not be ignorant of the reason why the Arabs deserve precedence</strong>, which is what they were distinguished with in regard to their understanding, language, manners and works, and that qualified them to be the carriers of the Islamic <em>da’wah</em> to the other nations. So indeed if the Arab knows this and follows it, it will enable him to be – like his predecessors – a righteous member in carrying the Islamic da’wah. As for<strong> if he gives that up, then he doesn’t have any excellence at all; rather, the non-Arab who possesses the Islaamic manners is better than him no doubt</strong>, since true excellence is only following the <em>eemaan</em> (faith) and knowledge with which Muhammad (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) was sent. So whoever is stronger in it, he is better. And excellence is only by defined names in the Book and the Sunnah, such as Islaam, <em>eemaan</em> (faith), <em>birr</em> (righteousness), <em>taqwaa</em>, knowledge, righteous deeds, <em>ihsaan </em>and the like, and (it is) not by a person merely being an Arab or non-Arab, as Shaykh ul-Islaam ibn Taimiyah (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said, and this is what (the Prophet) (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) pointed out with his saying: ‘Whoever’s deeds slow him down, his lineage will not make him go faster.’ Muslim narrated it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In summary</strong>: Indeed the excellence of the Arabs is only due to virtues that are realized amongst them, but if (these virtues) disappear because of their negligence of their Islaam, their excellence will also disappear, and whoever from the non-Arabs adheres to (these virtues) will be better than them; ‘there is no superiority of the Arab over the non-Arab except by<em> taqwaa</em>.’ Therefore, the going astray of the one who calls to Arabism becomes clear, (who calls to it) while he does not possess any of its excellent characteristics at all; rather, he is a European inwardly and outwardly!”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <em>silsilat ul-hudaa wa nnoor – </em>the series of guidance and light &#8211; tape no. 727</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question #7: “Is every <em>mushrik</em> (one who associates partners with Allaah) a <em>kaafir</em>(disbeliever), but not every <em>kaafir</em> is a <em>mushrik</em>? Or are they the same?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is the established understanding in people’s minds, except few of them. I will explain that with an example: a man bears witness that none has the right to be worshiped but Allaah and that Muhammad [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] is the Messenger of Allaah, and he prays, fasts and so on, but he rejects an<em> aayah</em>from the Qur’aan. This (man) has disbelieved or not disbelieved? He has disbelieved. Has he associated partners with Allaah? That which is correct is that he has associated partners with Allaah. <strong>Every <em>kaafir</em> is a <em>mushrik</em> and every<em>mushrik</em> is a <em>kaafir</em></strong>; there is absolutely no difference between the two words…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever disbelieves has associated partners with Allaah, and whoever associates partners with Allaah has disbelieved; there is no confusion about that. The evidence for this is if we remember the conversation of the believer and the disbeliever in Surat ul-Kahf: {And put forward to them the example of two men: unto one of them We had given two gardens of grapes, and We had surrounded both with date-palms; and had put between them green crops (cultivated fields) / Each of those two gardens brought forth its produce, and failed not in the least therein, and We caused a river to gush forth in the midst of them / And he had property (or fruit) and he said to his companion, in the course of mutual talk: ‘I am more than you in wealth and stronger in respect of men’}[1] – pay attention now – {And he went into his garden while in a state (of pride and disbelief) unjust to himself. He said: ‘I think not that this will ever perish / And I think not the Hour will ever come-}.[2] According to your <strong>wrong</strong> understanding, this (man) has disbelieved but not associated partners with Allaah and he (only) denied the Resurrection. He (then) said: {-and if indeed I am brought back to my Lord, (on the Day of Resurrection), I surely shall find better than this when I return to Him’ / His companion said to him during the talk with him:-}[3] {-‘If you see me less than you in wealth, and children, / It may be that my Lord will give me something better than your garden, and will send on it Husbaan (torment, bolt) from the sky, then it will be a barren slippery earth / Or the water thereof (of the gardens) becomes deep-sunken (underground) so that you will never be able to seek it’ / So his fruits were encircled (with ruin). And he remained clapping his hands (with sorrow) over what he had spent upon it, while it was all destroyed on its trellises, and he could only say: ‘<strong>Would that I had ascribed no partners to my Lord</strong>!’}[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Therefore, when he denied the Resurrection, he associated partners with Allaah. </strong>So, whoever disbelieves in something that has come in the Book (Qur’aan) or the Sunnah, then he is (also) a <em>mushrik</em> during his state of disbelief; this is with respect to the Qur’aanic text. So what is the intellectual reason (for this)? The answer is that (Allaah), the Most High, said: {Have you seen him who takes his own lust (vain desires) as his<em> ilah</em> (god)?}[5] Therefore, whoever disbelieves with any type of disbelief is (also) a <em>mushrik</em>, because <strong>he himself made his logic to be a partner with His Lord</strong>, the Blessed and Most High. Thus, do not differentiate between <em>kufr </em>(disbelief) and <em>shirk</em> (associating partners with Allaah)…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, another <em>hadeeth</em> (mentions): ‘Whoever swears by other than Allaah has<strong>disbelieved</strong>’ and ‘whoever swears by other than Allaah has<strong> associated partners with Him</strong>.’[6] He has committed <em>kufr</em>, he has committed <em>shirk</em>. He has committed<em>shirk</em>, he has committed <em>kufr</em>. There is no difference between the two words with regard to terminology in the Islamic legislation. With regard to linguistic terminology, there is a difference no doubt, but the Islamic legislation opens our insight, thinking and understanding. Why is everyone who disbelieves in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, with any type of disbelief (also) a <em>mushrik</em>? Because he has made his logic to be a partner with His Lord, the Mighty and Majestic.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">source: <em>alkhawf wa rrajaa</em> – fear and hope (of Allaah) – tape no. 1 <strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Abu Huraira </em>(<em>radi Allaahu ‘anhu</em>) said that the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “Whoever fears (Allaah) sets out at nightfall,[1] and whoever sets out at nightfall will reach the goal. Indeed, the goods of Allaah are expensive; indeed, the goods of Allaah is Paradise.”[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh al-Albaani</em> (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) comments:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The meaning of this is that there is a price for entering Paradise and that entering it does not happen by feeling safe (from the plan of Allaah) and <em>at-tawaakul</em> (not taking any means and saying ‘Allaah will provide for me’), but rather it happens by (doing) righteous deeds and <em>at-tawakkul</em> (taking the means and putting one’s trust) in Allaah, the Blessed and Most High; as Allaah, the Might and Majestic, said: ‘And say (O Muhammad (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>)) ‘Do deeds! Allaah will see your deeds, and (so will) His Messenger [<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>].’’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in this <em>hadeeth</em>, there is an indication of the noble <em>aayah</em> that says: ‘<strong>This is the Paradise which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds which you used to do (in the life of the world)</strong>,’[4] and in the other <em>aayah</em>: ‘<strong>Enter you Paradise because of that (the good) which you used to do (in the world)</strong>.’[5] And here, it occurs to many students who have some participation in studying the<em>Sunnah</em>, as they read or at least hear the statement of the Messenger (of Allaah) (<em>‘alayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>) which is established in the <em>saheehayn</em>[6] that he [<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>] said:  “‘<strong>None of you will enter Paradise by his (good) deeds, but rather by the Favor of Allaah and His Mercy</strong>.’ They said, ‘Not even you O Messenger of Allaah?’ He [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] said, ‘Not even myself, unless Allaah encompasses me with His Favor and His Mercy.’”[7] So it seems that there is a contradiction between this <em>hadeeth</em> and the previous<em>aayah</em> along with our <em>hadeeth </em>in this book of ours where (the Prophet) <em>(‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) said: ‘Indeed, the goods of Allaah are expensive; indeed, the goods of Allaah is Paradise.’ Hence, there is a price (that one must pay) for Paradise and the two previous <em>aayaat</em> indicate that the price of Paradise is righteous deeds, and there is no doubt that good deeds do not benefit the one who does them at all except if he is truly a believer in Allaah and His Messenger [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>]. So therefore, the price of Paradise is <em>eemaan</em> (faith) and righteous deeds. Then how does one reconcile between these three texts – this reality that we learned from our <em>hadeeth</em> tonight, ‘Indeed, the goods of Allaah are expensive’ and from the two previous <em>aayaat</em> – and between this <em>hadeeth</em>: ‘None of you will enter Paradise by his (good) deeds, but rather by the Favor of Allaah and His Mercy’?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reconciliation between (these two) is that… that which is negated in the last<em>hadeeth</em> ‘None of you will enter Paradise by his (good) deeds’ is one thing and that which is confirmed in the <em>aayah</em> ‘Enter you Paradise because of that (the good) which you used to do (in the world)’ is something else.<strong> That which is established in the <em>aayah</em> and the like is merely the entrance (into Paradise)</strong>, i.e., the key to Paradise, as mentioned in some narrations from <em>Wahb bin Munabbih</em> in <em>Saheeh al-Bukhaari</em>: ‘…the key to Paradise is <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> (none has the right to be worshiped but Allaah).’[8]<strong> So the key to Paradise is this <em>eemaan</em> (faith) and righteous deeds. But, if this Muslim enters Paradise and he enjoys in it, </strong>as mentioned in some authentic narrations, that which ‘no eye has seen, no ear has heard and (that which) has not come to the mind of a human being,’[9] <strong>then this type of enjoyment is not by means of a price that this enjoyer presented, but rather (it is) by the Favor of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and His Mercy.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the price of merely entering (into Paradise) is<em> eemaan</em> (faith) and righteous deeds. As for, part of the specific nature of enjoyment in Paradise which we pointed to previously – there is in it what ‘no eye has seen, no ear has heard and (what) has not come to the mind of a human being’ – then there is no price for this; it is impossible for a price to be determined for it. Why?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been mentioned in <em>Saheeh Muslim</em> from the <em>hadeeth</em> of <em>‘Abdullaah bin Mas’ood</em> (<em>radi Allaahu ‘anhu</em>) that the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:[10] ‘Indeed, I know the last man to come out from the Fire and the last man to enter Paradise. A man will come out of the Fire crawling.’ The meaning of this is that he comes out of the Fire being the most punished in it from the Muslims,and he comes out destroyed, exhausted (and) fatigued. Therefore, he is not able to walk straight as Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, created him. But rather, he crawls until his life returns to him and his limbs are energetic and active. So he walks in this manner until Allaah, the Blessed and Most High, shows him a very great tree from far such that he is captivated by its beauty and splendor. And he wished for the Favor of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and His Mercy after He saved him from the His severe punishment. Thus, he says: ‘O my Lord! Bring me to this tree so that I may be shaded by its shade, eat from its fruit[11] and drink from its water.’ Then Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, says, while having more knowledge of His slave: ‘Would you ask me for other than it?’ (The man) says: ‘No O Lord, I will not ask you for other than it.’ So Allaah, the Blessed and Most High, brings him to that tree such that he is shaded by its shade, eats from its fruit and drinks from its water. Then, he continues on his way toward Paradise. Meanwhile, another tree appears to him which is more radiant, more beautiful and greater than the first one. So he hopes again and wishes more and more for the Favor of Allaah, so he asks Him and says: ‘O my Lord! Bring me to this tree’- and repeats the previous saying, then he is shaded by its shade and so on. Then Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, says: ‘Would you ask me for other than it?’ (The man) says: ‘I will not ask you for other than it,’ while (Allaah) is more knowledgeable of him; our Lord knows that he will wish and wish until he enters Paradise. So He brings him to that tree such that he is shaded by its shade, eats from its fruit[12] and drinks from its water. Then, he continues on his way until he comes near the door of Paradise such that part of its refreshment, scent and joy come to him and he hears the voices of the people of Paradise. Thus, he says: ‘O my Lord! Let me enter Paradise,’ and maybe he says ‘Let me enter past the door of Paradise.’ So Allaah, the Blessed and Most High, says: ‘Enter Paradise, and there is for you the like of the world and ten times as much.’ So, the slave – almost not believing in the like of this divine favor when (Allaah) says to him ‘there is for you in Paradise the like of the world and ten times as much’ – says: ‘Are you mocking me while you are the Lord?’ And here, the narrator of the <em>hadeeth</em> laughed, who was <em>‘Abdullaah bin Mas’ood</em> as we mentioned. So he was asked by the one to whom he was narrating this <em>hadeeth</em>: ‘Why did you laugh?’ He said: ‘Because when the Messenger (of Allaah) (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) narrated the statement of the slave to His Lord ‘Are you mocking me while you are the Lord,’ he <em>(‘alayhi ssalaat was salaam</em>) had also laughed.’ They had asked the Messenger (of Allaah) (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) himself (about his reason for laughing), so he [<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>] said: ‘Because Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, laughed at His slave when he said ‘Are you mocking me while you are the Lord.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is clear from the <em>hadeeth</em> is that this person is the last to come out from the Fire and the last to enter Paradise, and he will have the like of the world and ten times as much. So does this destroyed person, who was the last to come out of the Fire, deserve this vast dominion in Paradise for his (good) deeds? No, this is by the Favor of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and His Mercy…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, if we regard this detailed explanation, the contradiction disappears between this <em>hadeeth</em> and the two <em>aayaat</em>. And this is one of the many examples in which some contradiction appears to some people, even the sincere ones amongst them, between some texts, whether from the <em>Qur’aan </em>and <em>Sunnah </em>or from each of them individually. So, the Muslim must not be hasty and he must reflect on both texts, and if the way for reconciling between the two is not possible for him, he (should) ask the one who is above him, as our Lord, the Blessed and Most High, said: ‘So ask the people of the Reminder if you do not know.’”[13]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">source: <em>silsilat ul-hudaa wa nnoor – </em>the series of guidance and light &#8211; tape no. 247</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question #2<em>: </em>Why did you complete (your prayer)? [The <em>shaykh</em> was led in prayer during his journey, then the <em>imaam</em> shortened but the <em>shaykh</em> did not shorten (the prayer), so he was asked about that]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh al-Albaani</em> (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The matter of being considered a traveler, in my understanding, does not depend on crossing a fixed distance as much as it depends on two things, the foundation of which is the intention, and the other is leaving the city/country. <strong>So if there is the intention to travel, and he leaves the city/country, the rulings of traveling are applicable (to him); and after that, the distance that he crosses is not regarded, whether long or short.</strong> As for (if) the fundamental principle is not present, which is the intention, then this (person) who left (the city/country) is not a traveler even if he crossed a long distance or less or more, because traveling is one of the rulings that are linked with this<em> hadeeth</em>, about which some of the scholars of <em>Islaam</em> have said that it is a third of<em> Islaam</em>: ‘Actions are only by (their) intentions and every person will have only that which he intended.’[1] And the truth is that this is a very sensitive issue about which the views of the scholars have differed and they did not agree on something completely clear such that it would be possible for someone to say: ‘This is the truth, it is quite obvious, so leave the side issues off of me.’ No one can say this, but all that he can say is: ‘I chose such and such.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I chose – what I understood from the treatise of <em>Ibn Taimiyah</em> (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) regarding this matter. He has a special treatise about the rulings of traveling. Indeed he struck a very wonderful example, from which the researcher and student of knowledge understand that traveling has nothing to do with crossing a long distance over a short distance. As for (saying) that it has nothing to do with crossing a short distance, then I think this is not an area of debate, because it is established from the Messenger (of Allaah) (<em>‘alayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>) that he [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] used to leave from <em>Madinah </em>to <em>al-Baqee’</em>(graveyard); then he [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] would greet them (the dead) with the <em>salaam</em>, then return. He [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] used to go out to the martyrs, to <em>Uhud;</em> he [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] would greet them with the <em>salaam</em>, then return. He [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] did not consider himself a traveler although he [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] left the city. And the opposite of that as well – if he crossed a long distance, that does not mean that he became a traveler merely because of crossing this distance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The example that (<em>Ibn Taimiyah</em>) struck is as the following. He was from Damascus like me, and there are well-known towns around Damascus, so he struck an example with a city known up to this time as Duma. He said, if a man seeking game[2] left from Damascus to Duma (which is) 15 kilometers (away) – there is no doubt that (crossing) this distance is (considered) traveling according to our custom if the fundamental condition exists, which is the intention to travel – (<em>Ibn Taimiyah</em>) says that this man is not considered a traveler because he had left for hunting then for returning. But what happened was that he did not find the game that he was looking for, so he continued on the journey, and continued and continued, and kept going on until he reached where? – Aleppo; and there are approximately 400 kilometers between Aleppo and Damascus today by car. (<em>Ibn Taimiyah</em>) says this (man) is not a traveler – although he had crossed (many) distances of the traveler, not just one distance – because the first condition, which is the intention to travel, was not there in this person. Thus, we can say that a car driver leaves early in the morning from ‘<em>Ammaan</em> for instance to reach <em>Ma’aa</em><em>n</em>(then) to <em>al</em>-‘<em>Aqabah,</em>[3] returning by evening; this (person) is not a traveler because he, due to his work, does not intend to travel; rather he intends to carry out this work to make a living.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, regarding the subject of traveling, we must take into consideration the fundamental condition, which is the intention. <strong>And by us taking into consideration this intention, the ruling differs for two persons who cross one and the same distance, but one of them is a traveler and the other is not considered a traveler because of the difference in their intentions</strong>. And in this manner, there also occur rulings related to the ruling of residency, i.e. residency that is planned for a specific time. (For example), two men left a city, both as travelers; they landed in another city. The staying of one of them is that of a traveler (but) the other one is a resident. Why? Because (this second man) has another wife there, so he (goes) from one wife to another wife. Thus, because of there being a wife for him who causes him to be chaste, gives him a home and arranges his accommodations for him, he takes a ruling other than that of his companion because the situation differed in some ways.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, we learn of a very important conclusion, which is that <strong>the exact rulings of traveling differ from one person to another. So, we don’t assign to a person the ruling of another (person)</strong>, and also the opposite likewise.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Polygyny </strong>: The condition or practice of having more than one wife at one time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">source: silsilat ul-hudaa wa nnoor, tape no. 787/3<br />
<em>asaheeha translations</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question: “Is it allowed for a woman to come between her husband and polygyny?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaani (<em>rahimahullaah</em>):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Of course, I believe that this is not allowed for her because of two reasons: 1) she is hindering (her husband) from the (lawful) path of Allaah, and 2) she is opposing the command of her husband. Because you know that the obedience of a woman to her husband is obligatory as is the case with the obedience of a member of a nation to the Muslim ruler – I don’t say blind obedience, but rather complete obedience – except that which the Legislation has made an exception, i.e. except if it is in disobedience to Allaah. And based on this there are Legislated rulings: that if the Muslim ruler commands something that is fundamentally allowed, this command becomes obligatory upon the one who is commanded with it to carry out, because it is the command of the <em>Walee ul-Amr</em> (Muslim ruler). Exactly likewise is the affair with respect to the wife with her husband.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a husband commands his wife to do something which is fundamentally allowed in the Legislation and which the woman is able to carry out, then it is obligatory upon her to obey him. And if she does not obey him, she has disobeyed Allaah and His Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em>. <strong>Therefore when a woman sets up obstacles that may come between her husband and the thing he wants to attain which Allaah (<em>‘azza wa jal</em>) has allowed, let alone if the allowed matter is something desired and legislated, then no doubt she will be disobedient two times</strong>: 1) as I mentioned previously, she is hindering (her husband) from the (lawful) path, and 2) she is opposing her husband in something that is not for her to oppose because she is able (to carry it out) and he is not wanting to do an act of disobedience to Allaah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">PS : Webster’s New World Dictionary defines <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Polygamy </strong></span>as &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">the practice of having two or more wives or husbands at the same time</span>.&#8221;  Since Muslim women are not allowed to have two or more husbands at the same time, let’s find a better word:  <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Polygyny</strong></span>.  The same dictionary defines <strong>polygyny </strong>as &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">a practice of having two or more wives at the same time</span>.&#8221; <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Polyandry </strong></span>(Greek: poly- many, andros- man) refers to a form of marriage in which a woman has two or more husbands at the same time</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">Q: “If a woman passes in front of someone praying she invalidates the prayer, so does she also invalidate the prayer of a woman?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>Yes</strong>, a woman invalidates the prayer of another woman (if she passes in front of her) under the condition mentioned in some established narrations: <strong>if she has reached puberty</strong>. And there is no difference in rulings of the Legislation between men and women unless there is a text excepting women from the men; and there is no (such) text here. Rather the text is general: ‘one’s prayer is invalidated if a woman (who has reached puberty), a donkey or a black dog passes in front of him, if there isn’t something like the rear part of a camel saddle in front of him.’<a>[1]</a> So there is no difference in the ruling.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Women Wearing Hijab And Make-up In Public: Two Conflicting Contradictions In Islam &#8211; Shaykh Albanee </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="font-family:times;">source: silsilat ul-hudaa wa nnoor &#8211; the series of guidance and light &#8211; tape no. 697</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">maa shaa Allaah this is truly a much needed clarification of the ruling on makeup, about which many are unaware. shaykh al-albaani (rahimahullaah) advises both women and men in this regard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question #3: “Is it allowed for the woman to put on make-up if she leaves her house wearing the<em> hijaab</em>?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh al-Albaani </em>(<em>rahimahullaah</em>) answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>It is not permissible for the woman who does not wear <em>hijaab</em>, let alone who wears <em>hijaab</em>, to use the makeup of the disbeliever, the make-up of the rebellious and disobedient (to Allaah). </strong>When were you aware of some women’s adornment called by a name for which Allaah did not send down an authority: ‘make-up’? This is a word that we don’t know, not us nor your forefathers from before. Rather, it is a foreign word expressing an adornment for the rebellious and disobedient women of Europe; and our women – except those of them whom Allaah protects – unfortunately imitate decorating themselves with this adornment which the Islamic society is being affected by, namely make-up. So it is not permissible for the woman. And this reality is one of the strange ironies: in the road we see a woman wearing a decent <em>hijaab</em> (but) I don’t say the Islamically legislated <em>hijaab</em>; she ties what they call the ‘<em>ishaarb</em>’ – or <em>khimaar</em> which is the (correct) Arabic word – covering her hair, her neck and so on, but she has face powder and lipstick on. This (wearing the <em>hijaab</em>) is against this (wearing make-up): two contradictory, conflicting matters that do not go together. What is the reason (for this type of occurrence)? It is one of two things: either ignorance and heedlessness of the Islamically legislated ruling or it is due to the women’s following of the temptations of <em>shaytaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, we firstly remind the women who suffer from this make-up. Then secondly, we remind the guardians of women such as a father or a husband or a brother, due to the fact that (the Prophet) (<em>‘alayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>) said: ‘Everyone of you is a shepherd and everyone of you is responsible for his flock. So the man is a shepherd and he is responsible for his flock-’[1] to the end of the <em>hadeeth</em>. Thus, the Arabic or general proverb states: ‘The horse is from the horseman.’ So you, the husband of the woman, it is not permissible for you to allow her to go out in this manner which puts to trial the middle-aged men, let alone the young men! And you, O man, O father, O brother, are supposed to be very jealous. Why? Because the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa aalihi wa sallam</em>) used to say: ‘<strong>A <em>duyyooth </em>will not enter Paradise</strong>.’[2] Why? Who is a <em>duyyooth</em>? He is the one who does not guard his womenfolk jealously.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source:<em> silsilat ul-ahaadeeth is-saheeha</em> – the series of authentic narrations –<em>hadeeth </em>no. 16</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of <em>Abu Huraira</em>: “when the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) used to say farewell to someone, he [<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>] would say:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>أَسْتَوْدِعُ اللهَ دِينَكَ وَأَمَانَتَكَ وَخَوَاتِيمَ عَمَلِكَ<br />
</strong>(I entrust your religion, your family and belongings (that you are leaving behind), and the last of your deeds to Allaah).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh al-Albaani</em> (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) comments:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“A number of benefits are gained from this authentic <em>hadeeth</em>. First: the permissibility of saying farewell with the mentioned saying in it:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>أَسْتَوْدِعُ اللهَ دِينَكَ وَأَمَانَتَكَ وَخَوَاتِيمَ عَمَلِكَ</strong>,’ and the traveler responds to him and says:‘<strong>أَسْتَوْدِعُكُمُ اللهَ الَّذِي لاَ تَضِيعُ وَدَائِعُهُ</strong>’ (I entrust you to Allaah, whose trusts are not lost).[1]Refer to ‘<em>Al-Kalim At-Tayyib</em>.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: (the permissibility of) taking hold of one hand during handshaking, which has been mentioned in many narrations, and this <em>hadeeth</em> indicates the derivation of this word (‘handshaking’) in the (Arabic) language. According to<em>Lisaan ul-‘Arab:</em>[3] ‘<em>al-musaafaha</em> (handshaking) is taking hold of the hand, the same as <em>at-tasaafuh</em>. A man handshakes another man when he places the side of his palm in the side of the other’s palm, and the sides of their palms are the front of them – like the <em>hadeeth</em> of handshaking upon meeting, which is done with one another by joining the side of a palm with another palm and turning face-to-face.’ I (<em>Shaykh al-Albaani</em>) say: there is that which reports this meaning as well in some of the previously mentioned narrations, such as the <em>marfoo’ hadeeth</em>[4] of<em>Hudhaifa</em>: ‘Indeed, if the believer meets another believer, then gives him the<em>salaam</em> and takes hold of his hand and handshakes him, their sins fall off as the leaves of trees fall off.’[5] <em>Al-Mundhuri</em> said: ‘<em>At-Tabaraani</em> narrated it in ‘<em>Al-Awsat</em>’ and I don’t know of anyone who was criticized among its narrators.’ I (<em>Shaykh al-Albaani</em>) say: it has evidences by which it rises to the rank of being authentic, such as (that which was reported) on the authority of <em>Anas </em>by<em> Ad-Dhiyaa Al-Maqdisee</em> in ‘<em>Al-Mukhtaara</em>,’ which <em>al-Mundhuri </em>attributed to <em>Ahmad</em>and others. So all these narrations indicate that <strong>the <em>sunnah</em> in handshaking is taking hold of one hand</strong>; therefore, the handshaking with <strong>both</strong> hands that some of the scholars do is <strong>against the <em>Sunnah</em></strong>, so let this be known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third benefit: that handshaking is legislated at the time of parting as well… The reason for inferring, rather quoting (this) becomes clear by remembering the permissibility of (giving) the <em>salaam</em> when parting as well due to his (the Prophet’s) saying (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>): ‘If one of you enters the gathering then let him give the<em> salaam</em>, and if he leaves then let him give the<em>salaam</em>, as the first one is not more deserving (to be said) than the other one,’[6]<em>Abu Daawood</em>, <em>at-Tirmidhi</em> and others narrated it with a <em>hasan</em> (good) chain of narration. So the saying of some (people) is that handshaking at the time of parting is an innovation which has no truth. Yes, indeed the one who reads the mentioned narrations about handshaking when meeting will find them to be more in number and stronger than the mentioned narrations about handshaking when parting; and the one who is intelligent will conclude from that, that the permissibility of the second handshaking is not like that of the first (handshaking) in rank. <strong>Therefore,</strong> <strong>the first one is <em>sunnah</em> and the second one is recommended.</strong> As for (the latter) being an innovation, then no (this is not true) due to the evidence that we mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And<strong> as for handshaking immediately after the prayers, then it is undoubtedly an innovation</strong>, except if (the handshaking) takes place between two persons who have not met before that, then it is <em>sunnah</em> as you learned.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><em><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Allaah says [to the angels], &#8216;If My slave intends to do a bad deed then do not write it against him until he does it; if he does it, then write it as it is, but if he leaves it for My sake, then write it as a good deed for him. And if he intends to go a good deed, but does not do it, then write it as a good deed for him; and if he does it, then write it for him as ten good deeds up to seven-hundred times as much up to many more times&#8221;</span></em> &#8211; [Saheeh al-Bukhaari]</p>
<p>The shaykh comments and speaks on the many favors of Allaah upon His believing slave:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;&#8230;First, if he does a good deed it [the count of the deeds] is multiplied &#8211; as for a bad deed, then it [the count of the deeds] is not multiplied.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Second, if he did not do a bad deed, and had intended to do it, nothing is written against him, as opposed to [gaining a] good deed: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">if he intended to do (a bad deed), then did not do it, a good deed is written for him. Why? &#8211; because he left it fearing Allaah &#8216;azza wa jal. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">And the [understanding of] this is that if he intends to do a bad deed, then leaves it and does not act upon it for some reason, and it is not (because of) his fear of Allaah, the Blessed and Most High, then nothing is written upon him, neither a bad deed nor a good deed.</span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">As for if his motive for leaving this bad deed was his fear of Allaah &#8216;azza wa jal, then this bad deed, because of his leaving it, turns into a good deed. Hence, fearing Allaah &#8216;azza wa jal pushes its possessor (the possessor of the quality of fearing Allaah) to have many good deeds. Every time he intends to do a bad deed and he leaves it fearing Allaah, the bad intention turns into a good deed.&#8221;</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: “Does a woman raise her voice when saying ‘<i>aameen</i>’ during prayer, and does she also give the <i>adhaan</i> and <i>iqaamah</i>?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>“</i>If she is praying with women, then yes she raises her voice when saying ‘<i>aameen</i>,’ but if she is praying with men who are not her <i>mahram</i>, then no. Because <strong>I do not say that the voice of a woman is `<i>awrah</i></strong>, as many say, since the Mothers of the believers and the wives of the Companions from the early times used to speak and discuss with men. And oftentimes the woman would come to the Prophet ﷺ and ask him something in front of the men, and he ﷺ would answer her question.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>But</strong> (here), it is not from the etiquette of a woman to raise her voice when reciting the Qur&#8217;aan. We are often asked if it is permissible for a woman – when she is learning the recitation from a Shaikh, a <em>Muqri</em> – to repeat the recitation to him so that he may correct her. The answer is no. Although she learns, her learning is restricted to listening only, like the women of all the Companions learned from the Messenger of Allaah ﷺ by listening to his recitation during prayer or outside of prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a woman prays with women while she is the <i>imaam</i>, she raises her voice and the women behind her also raise their voices. That is due to his ﷺ statement: ‘<em>Indeed women are the counterparts of men</em>’<a>[1]</a> i.e. every ruling in which the men are being addressed, the women are also included in this address, except that which is made an exception. For example, it is best for a woman, in other than the <i>taraaweeh</i> prayer – please pay attention – in other than the <i>taraaweeh</i> prayer, to pray in her house, whereas it is obligatory upon a man to pray the five prayers in the <i>masjid</i> with the congregation. So here, the woman is not like the man. But the fundamental principle is as he ﷺ said: ‘Indeed women are the counterparts of men.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <strong>if a woman leads women in prayer as an <i>imaam</i>, she does just as a man would do as an<i> imaam</i></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: she raises her voice when reciting and when saying ‘<i>aameen</i>,’ and the women behind her also raise their voices when saying ‘<i>aameen</i>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: not only does the woman lead women in prayer as an <i>imaam</i>, indeed she gives the <i>adhaan</i> and<i> iqaamah </i>too. Why? Because of the previous <i>hadeeth</i>: ‘Indeed women are the counterparts of men.’ Moreover, Aa.ishah – the Mother of the believers and the foremost of the Mothers of the believers in <i>fiqh</i>, knowledge and <i>da`wah</i>, may Allaah bless her and her father – used to give the<i>adhaan</i> and <i>iqaamah</i> when she led women in prayer as an <i>imaam</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And here I would like to draw your attention to something that wasn’t asked about: <strong>the woman here is also different from the man</strong> as she does not step up before the women’s row, but rather she stands in the middle as if she is one of those in the row. She does not step up before them. There is text regarding this also, and thus a woman in this case is not included in the generality of his ﷺ statement: ‘Indeed women are the counterparts of men.’”</p>
