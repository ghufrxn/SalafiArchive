TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah.Com<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this treatise, the author dispels many of the false claims and accusations that are spread and circulated about Imaam Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdil-Wahhaab died 1206H] by using the Imaam&#8217;s own testimony from statements he made in his writings. The author brings seven of the most popular misconceptions that surround Imaam Ibn Abdil-Wahhaab and his da&#8217;wah and refutes them through the words of the Imaam, as has been recorded in his writings and collected by reliable sources into compilations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By doing this we clearly see the Imaam&#8217;s position with regard to these fundamental issues based on his own testimony and not having to rely on someone else&#8217;s explanation in his defense. We hope that through this treatise, those who have doubt about Imaam Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdil-Wahhaab and his call, can gain clarity about the true state of affairs and not listen to the lies and slander of his opponents who seek and strive to discredit the tremendous efforts of this great reformer.</p>

<p><strong>Read the Book Below:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">INTRODUCTION</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For many years and long decades now, there has been much talk and debate going on about Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (rahimahullaah) and his da’wah between those who agree and those who disagree, and those who accuse him and those who defend him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But anyone who looks at the words of those who oppose the Shaikh, those who attach all kinds of accusations to him, will find that their words are void of any proof. This is since there can’t be found any basis for what they claim either in his statements or in his books. Rather, they are just allegations mentioned by those in the past and repeated by those in later times, nothing more.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I think a fair and just person would only agree that the best and most correct way to find out the truth about him would be by returning to and taking from the main source (i.e. the Shaikh himself).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the books of the Shaikh are present and his words are preserved. And by looking into them, one can find out the truth or falsehood of what is being spread about him. And as for the claims that are void of evidences then they are just a mirage and not real.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In these following pages, I will present brief excerpts from the speech of Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab, using quotes from him, which I relied on from the trustworthy books that have collected all of his statements. And I have not added anything to them except for arranging them in order.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These quotes consist of responses from the Shaikh himself against the most popular accusations that his opponents launch against him, in which he asserts the opposite of what they claim. I am certain that, by Allaah’s Guidance, these responses will suffice in clarifying the truth to those who seek it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who reject the Shaikh and oppose his Da’wah, those who spend their time spreading falsehood and circulating lies, then I say to them: Lie against your own selves for indeed the truth is clear and indeed the Religion of Allaah is victorious, and the sun shines bright, one cannot cover it with his hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So here is the speech of the Shaikh, which disproves these claims and refutes all of your accusations. So if you have some speech from him that contradicts it then bring it out in the open and do not conceal it. And if you can’t do this, and you will not be able to do it, then I counsel you with one piece of advice: That you stand up for Allaah, free from every vain desire or bigotry, and ask Him sincerely to show you the truth and to guide you to it. Then reflect on what this man said – did he bring forth something better than the Speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then reflect a second time: Is there any other way to salvation than speaking the truth and believing in the truth? So if the truth becomes clear to you, then return to your guidance and go back to the truth, for that is better than lingering upon falsehood. And to Allaah return all the affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">THE REALITY OF THE DA’WAH OF SHAIKH MUHAMMAD BIN ‘ABDIL-WAHHAAB</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is proper to begin this discussion by relaying some brief words from Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab, may Allaah have mercy on him, in which he explains the reality of what he was calling to, far removed from the dark clouds of propaganda that his opponents have placed as an obstacle between many people and that Da’wah. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say, and to Allaah belongs the Praise and the Blessing, and all might is by Him, that my Lord has guided me to a Straight Path, an upright religion, the pure monotheistic way of Ibraaheem, and he wasn’t from the polytheists. And I, all praise be to Allaah, do not call to a madh-hab (way) of Sufism or (a madh-hab) of a Fiqh scholar or a speaker or one of the Imaams that they magnify.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the contrary, I call to Allaah alone and with no partner. And I call to the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger, which he advised the first part of his ummah and the last part of it to abide by. And I hope that I will not reject the truth if it comes to me. In fact, I call on Allaah, His angels and all of His creation to bear witness that if one of you brings one word of truth to me that I should accept it immediately and throw against the wall everything that opposes it, from the statements of my Imaams, with the exception of Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) for indeed he doesn’t speak anything but the truth.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/37-38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And I, all praise be to Allaah, am a follower (muttabi’) and not an innovator (mubtadi’).” [Mu’allafaat ash-Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab: 5/36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The correct representation of the affair is that I say: No one should be supplicated to except Allaah, alone and with no partner, as Allaah says in His Book: ‘So do not call unto anyone along with Allaah.’ [Surah Al-Jinn: 18] And He said about the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Say: It is not in my power to cause you harm or to bring you to the Right Path.’ [Surah Al-Jinn: 21] So this is the Speech of Allaah, which the Messenger of Allaah mentioned to us and counseled us with. And this is what stands between me and you, for if he mentioned something besides this, then it is a lie and a slander.” [Ad-Durar as- Saniyyah: 1/90-91]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">THE FIRST ISSUE: THE SHAIKH’S BELIEF WITH REGARD TO THE PROPHET</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh is charged by his enemies with terrible accusations related to his belief concerning the Prophet. These accusations are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First: That he didn’t believe he was the last of the Prophets. This is what is claimed (!), but yet all the books of the Shaikh are filled with a refutation of this misconception and they testify that this claim is a lie. Some examples are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I believe that our Prophet Muhammad (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) is the seal (last) of the prophets and messengers. And the Eemaan (Faith) of a servant (person) is not valid unless he believes in his messengership and bears witness to his prophethood.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So the most prosperous of creatures and those who will have the greatest blessing and highest level are those who are foremost in following him (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and in conforming with him in knowledge and action.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 2/21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: That he violates the right of the Prophet and doesn’t give him the position he deserves. In order to find out the reality of this claim, I will quote some of his statements in which he clearly asserts what his belief is with regard to the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Because Allaah wanted His Tawheed to be supreme and His Religion to be completed and because He wanted His Word to be the highest and the Word of the disbelievers to be the lowest, He sent Muhammad (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), the last of the prophets and the loved one of the Lord of creation. So he did not cease to be known throughout every generation, being mentioned in the Torah of Moosaa and the Gospel of ‘Eesaa, until Allaah brought forth that pearl from between the tribes of Kinaanah and Zahra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he brought him out during a period of time that was void of messengers, and guided him to the most upright of paths. So he had signs and indicators that proved his prophethood before he was even sent forth (with the message), which amazed the people of his time. And Allaah brought him up in a good manner. That’s why he was the noblest, the best mannered, the nicest neighbor, the most lenient and the most truthful in speech amongst his people. This was such that his people would call him ‘Al-Ameen’ (The Trustworthy One), because of what Allaah gave him from righteous conditions and praiseworthy characteristics.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 2/19, 90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He is the chief of the intercessors, possessor of the most praiseworthy station, and Aadam as well as those besides him will be under his banner.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/86]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The first of the messengers was Nooh, and the last and most virtuous of them was Muhammad.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/143]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He clarified with the most profound of clarifications (i.e. the Religion) and he completed and finalized it. He was the most sincere of creatures towards the servants of Allaah, and he was compassionate and merciful to the believers. He conveyed the message and fulfilled the trust, and he made true Jihaad in the Cause of Allaah. And he worshipped Allaah until certainty (i.e. death) reached him.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 2/21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, he (rahimahullaah) mentioned that one of the benefits derived from the Prophet’s statement: “None of you truly believes until I become more beloved to him than his father, his son, and all of mankind” is the obligation of loving him above loving one’s self, family and wealth. [Kitaab at-Tawheed: 108]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Third: They claim that he rejected the Prophet’s intercession. The Shaikh responds to this misconception by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“They claim that we reject the Prophet’s intercession. Far removed is Allaah from imperfections, this is a great slander. Rather, we bear witness before Allaah that the Messenger of Allaah is the intercessor and possessor of the praiseworthy station. We ask Allaah, the Most Generous, Lord of the Mighty Throne, that He allow him to intercede for us and that he resurrect us under his banner.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/63-64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“No one rejects the Prophet’s intercession except for the people of innovation and misguidance. However, the intercession will not occur unless permission is granted first (by Allaah) and He is pleased with it, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And no one will intercede except for he whom He is pleased with.’ [Surah Al- Anbiyaa: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Who is it that will intercede in His presence except by His permission.’ [Surah Al-Baqarah: 255]” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh explains the reason why this false claim was spread about him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“These people, when I mentioned to them what Allaah and His Messenger, as well as the scholars from all the groups, stated about the obligation of making the worship solely for Allaah and the prohibition of resembling the People of the Scripture who came before us in the aspect of taking their priests and rabbis as lords besides Allaah, they said to us: ‘You have degraded the status of the prophets, righteous people and the awliyaa (friends of Allaah)!’” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 2/50]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">THE SECOND ISSUE: THE PROPHET’S HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the many accusations directed at the Shaikh is that he didn’t love the members of the Prophet’s Household and that he violated their rights. The response to this is that what is claimed is in contradiction to the true state of affairs. In fact, he, may Allaah have mercy on him, fully acknowledged the right that they had of being loved and honored, and he abided by it. In fact, he would even rebuke those who didn’t abide by this, as he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah has obligated certain rights for the members of the household of Allaah’s Messenger, which they have over the people. So it is not permissible for a Muslim to abandon their rights thinking that to be part of Tawheed. Rather this is from extremism. The only thing we reject is honoring them for the sake of the (false) claim that they have the right to be worshipped, as well as honoring those who claim this.” [Mu’allafaat ash-Shaikh: 5/284]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever reflects on the life and history of the Shaikh will realize the truthfulness of what he stated here. It is enough to know that the Shaikh named six of his seven children with names from the Prophet’s Household, may Allaah be pleased with them: ‘Alee, ‘Abdullaah, Husayn, Hasan, Ibraaheem and Faatimah. This is a clear proof of the great love and respect he had for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">THE THIRD ISSUE: THE WONDROUS OCCURRENCES OF THE AWLIYAA</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people spread around that Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab denied the extraordinary occurrences (karaamaat) of the awliyaa (close friends of Allaah). What disproves this false claim is that the Shaikh has clearly affirmed in several places of his Creed the opposite of what is spread around about him concerning this issue. An example of this is the statements he makes in some of his speech in which he explains his belief and creed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And I affirm the karaamaat (wondrous occurrences) of the awliyaa.” [Ad-Durar As- Saniyyah: 1/32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I wonder how the Shaikh can be accused of such a claim when he is the one who described those who deny the wondrous occurrences of the awliyaa as people of innovation and misguidance, when he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And no one rejects the wondrous occurrences of the awliyaa except for the people of innovation and misguidance.” [Ad-Durar As-Saniyyah: 1/32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE FOURTH ISSUE: TAKFEER</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the greatest of misconceptions that are spread about the Shaikh and his followers is that they declare the general masses of Muslims to be disbelievers (i.e. takfeer), and that they claim that marrying them is not valid except for those who are part of them or those who join their group.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh has refuted this misconception in numerous places, amongst them are: “The statement that we declare the Muslims to be disbelievers generally is from the lies of the enemies who wish to prevent people from this Religion. So we say: ‘Glorified and far removed are You (O Allaah), this is a tremendous slander!’ [Surah An-Noor: 16]” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/100]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“They have ascribed to us various lies, and so the fitnah has increased. Amongst these lies are: Spreading slander, which any sane person would be shy to transmit, not to mention be fooled by. An example of this is what you have mentioned that I deem all people to be disbelievers except for those who follow me, and that I claim that marrying them is not valid! How strange that such a notion could enter into the mind of a sane person! Would a Muslim say such a thing?! I absolve myself before Allaah from this claim, which only emanates from one with deficient intellect and no understanding. So may Allaah curse the people of evil and false objectives.” [Ad- Durar As-Saniyyah: 1/80]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The person I deem to be a disbeliever is the one who knows the Religion of the Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), but then after coming to know it, turns to reviling it and forbidding the people from it and making enmity with those who adhere to it. This is the person that I declare to be a disbeliever. And the majority of the ummah (i.e. Muslims), all praise be to Allaah, are not like this.” [Ad-Durar As-Saniyyah: 1/73]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE FIFTH ISSUE: THE WAY OF THE KHAWAARIJ </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are some people who accuse the Shaikh of being upon the beliefs of the Khawaarij, those who declare Muslims disbelievers because of sins. The response to this from the words of the Shaikh is as follows: He, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “I do not testify for any of the Muslims that he is in Paradise or the Hellfire except for those who Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) testified it for. However, I wish well for the good-doer and I fear for the evildoer. And I do not deem anyone amongst the Muslims to be a disbeliever due to a sin, nor do I extract him from the fold of Islaam.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE SIXTH ISSUE: TAJSEEM</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is also spread about the Shaikh is that he was a mujassim, i.e. that he likened Allaah’s attributes to the creation’s attributes.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh has mentioned his belief concerning this aspect, and he is far removed from the lies his opponents accuse him of. He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“From the Belief (Eemaan) in Allaah, is that one believes in what Allaah has described Himself with in His Book and upon the tongue of His Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), without committing tahreef (distortion) or ta’teel (denial). Rather, he must believe that there is nothing equal to Allaah and that he is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer. So he must not negate what Allaah described Himself with, nor should he distort the words from their true state, nor should he deny His Names and Attributes, nor should he say how Allaah’s Attributes are or resemble them to the creation’s attributes. This is because Allaah has no equals or rivals or similars, nor can He be compared to His creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah is the most knowledgeable about Himself and about others, and He is the most truthful in words and the best in speech. So He has removed Himself from what His opponents from the people who commit takyeef and tamtheel have described Him with, and from what those who commit tahreef and ta’teel have negated from Him, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Far removed is your Lord, the Lord of Glory and Might, from what they ascribe to Him, and peace be on the Messengers. And all praise belongs to Allah, Lord of all that is created.’ [Surah As-Saafaat: 180-182]” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/29] “It is well known that ta’teel is the opposite of tajseem, and those who commit this (ta’teel) are enemies of those who commit that (tajseem). The truth lies in between these two (extremes).” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 3/11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">THE SEVENTH ISSUE: OPPOSING THE SCHOLARS</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people say that Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab opposed the rest of the scholars in what he called to, not turning to their statements or relying on their books. Rather, he introduced something new and brought forth a fifth madh-hab. The best person to clarify the reality of this issue is the Shaikh himself. He (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“We are blind followers of the Book and the Sunnah and the righteous predecessors of this ummah, as well as what is relied on from the opinions of the four Imaams: Abu Haneefah An-Nu’maan bin Thaabit, Maalik bin Anas, Muhammad bin Idrees and Ahmad bin Hanbal, may Allaah have mercy on all of them.” [Mu’allafaat ash-Shaikh: 5/96]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So if you hear that I have issued a ruling on something that does not conform with the unanimous agreement of the scholars, then reject my opinion.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“If you claim that the scholars are upon something different than what I am upon, then here are their books present.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 2/58]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I challenge the follower of Abu Haneefah with the opinions of the old Hanafee scholars and also the followers of Maalik, Shaafi’ee and Hanbal with the opinions of the previous scholars of each madh-hab, who are relied upon.” [Ad-Durar as- Saniyyah: 1/82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“In summary, the thing that I forbid is when one believes that someone other than Allaah can do things that it is not possible for anyone to do except Allaah. So if I said something to this effect from myself, then accuse me of that, or in a book you find, which doesn’t adhere to this, then accuse me with that also. Or if I quoted it from the people of my madh-hab, then accuse me of that. But if I stated it based on the Command of Allaah and His Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and based on what the scholars in every madh-hab have unanimously agreed on, then it is not appropriate for a person who believes in Allaah and the Last Day to reject it due to the people of his time or the people of his country or because most of the people in his time reject it.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/76]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To conclude this discussion, we present two pieces of advice from the Shaikh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First: For those who strive against this da’wah and its followers, conspiring against it and attaching all kinds of accusations and falsehoods to it, the Shaikh says to these people:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I remind those who oppose me that the obligation upon the people is to follow what the Prophet counseled his ummah with (i.e. the Sunnah). And I say to them: The books are with you. Look in them and do not take any of my speech. However, when you come to know the words of Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) that are in your books then follow it even though most of the people oppose it…Do not (unconditionally) obey me or anyone else except for the command of Allaah’s Messenger, which is found in your books. And know that nothing can save you except for following Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). This worldly life is temporary and it is not proper for someone with common sense to be forgetful about Paradise and Hell.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/89-90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I call those who oppose me to four things: Either the Book of Allaah or the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger or to the Ijmaa’ (consensus) of the scholars. And if he refuses this then I call him to a mubaahalah.” [2] [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: To those who are confused about this matter, the Shaikh says: “You must constantly supplicate to Allaah and humble yourself before Him, especially during the times in which the invocations are answered, such as: the last part of the night, the last portion of the prayer and after the Adhaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you must also use the supplications reported in the texts, especially the one that has been reported in the Saheeh, that he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) would say: ‘O Allaah, Lord of Jibraa’eel, Mikaa’eel and Israa’eel, Originator of the heavens and the earth, All-Knower of the Hidden and the Apparent, You will judge between Your servants in those matters which they differed on. Guide me in that which is differed on from the truth, by Your Will. Verily, You guide whom You will to a Straight Path.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You must be persistent in saying this supplication before the One who answers the call of the distressed when he calls, and the One who guided Ibraaheem to oppose all of the people. And say: ‘O teacher of Ibraaheem, teach me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you find difficulty in opposing the people, then reflect on Allaah’s statement: ‘Then we placed you upon a Legislation from Our Command, so follow it, and do not follow the vain desires of those who know not. Verily, they can avail you nothing before Allaah.’ [Surah Al-Jaathiyah: 18-19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And if you obey most of those on the earth, they will mislead you far away from Allaah’s Path.’ [Surah Al-An’aam: 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And reflect on the Prophet’s words found in the Saheeh: ‘Islaam began strange and it will return to being strange as it began’ and his (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) statement: ‘Verily Allaah will not snatch away knowledge…’ and his statement: ‘Stick to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided Khaleefahs who come after me’ and his statement: ‘And beware of newly invented matters, for indeed every innovation is a misguidance.’” [Ad-Durar As-Saniyyah: 1/42-43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And if it becomes clear to you that this is the truth in which there is no doubt, and that it is an obligation to spread it amongst the people and to teach it to the women and men, then may Allaah have mercy on the one fulfills his duty, repents to Allaah and acknowledges this to himself, for indeed a person who repents from a sin is like one who has no sin at all. May Allaah guide us and you and our brothers to that which He loves and is pleased with, and peace be on you.” [Ad-Durar As-Saniyyah: 2/43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah send His peace and blessings on His slave and messenger, our prophet and loved one, Muhammad, as well as His family and all of his Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s Note: Tajseem comes from the word jism (body), and it literally means to make something into a body. This is the term applied when someone gives anthropomorphic (i.e. human-like) qualities to Allaah, by saying His hand is like my hand, and His seeing is like my seeing, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s Note: A Mubaahalah is when two people who are in opposition to one another come together to invoke Allaah’s curses on the one who is lying and upon falsehood between the two disputants.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillaah Al-Hamdulillaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[The following represents much of the notes from <strong>Shaykh Saalih as-Sindee</strong>&#8216;s heart-felt nasihah, obtained from salaficast.net]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After praising Allaah, and sending the salaam upon the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam), the sahaba, and those who follow them until the Day of Judgment, the shaykh then greeted the Muslims with &#8220;as-salamu &#8216;alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatu,&#8221; and then welcomed to Madinah a group of Muslims in front of him, and gave glad tidings to them for what they set out for: to visit the haramain, and for packing their bags and travelling to seek knowledge. And he made a du&#8217;aa to Allaah to give them and us jannah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said in surat Ash-Shura: He (Allaah) has ordained for you the same religion (Islam) which He ordained for Nuh (Noah), and that which We have inspired in you (O Muhammad), and that which We ordained for Ibrahim (Abraham), Musa (Moses) and &#8216;Iesa (Jesus) saying you should establish religion and make no divisions in it (religion). &#8230;(Ash-Shura 42:13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at this command from Allaah (subhanahu wa taa&#8217;ala). In this ayah is a command that Allaah gave to ulul &#8216;azaam, the five Messengers of great determination, and they are Nuh, Muhammad, Ibrahmn, Musa and &#8216;Iesa. Allaah commanded them with these two things: to establish the religion and not divide. So this ayah requires, ya ikhwan, that we look at this command, and that we open our ears and hearts and minds so we can understand and implement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first affair is Iqqamat u-Deen, establishing the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Iqqamat u-Deen means we should establish the religion in ourselves first, be upright, then help others to be upright in the Deen. The first issue &#8211; and it is the most important &#8211; is that we establish Islam in ourselves first. This establishing the religion in ourselves requires that one implement the Tawheed of Allaah, and this comes about in three levels: the first is that one implements the base level, which is one leaves shirk and kufr, and moves into Islam. This level itself has three levels: belief in the heart, saying upon tongue the shahadatain [la illaaha il Allaah Muhammad RasulAllaah], and then he should do action that supports his claim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The next level is implementing that which is wajib from Tawheed. The one who implements and completes that which is wajib then also does and fulfills that which he is commanded and leaves off the prohibitted. Thirdly, doing the mustahaabat (recommended) and leaving off the makruhat (disliked) even though it may not be haram, and likewise he leaves off the doubtful matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Talking about these levels is easier said than done. The base level is Tawheed; to remove oneself from kufr (disbelief) is easy for one to do, but to rise to the second level and then the third level is not easy. One must have extreme patience. If one reaches it, then he enters the Jannah (Paradise) &#8211; and will not be taken to account. As you all know by reading Kitab at-Tawheed, you have come across the proofs of the one who implements [completes and applies] Tawheed, then he enters into Jannah without accounting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first affair is that you learn the Deen. It&#8217;s not possible to establish the religion until you learn the religion. How can you establish Islam in yourself if you do not know what Islam is? For that reason, the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said: &#8220;Whoever Allaah wants good for, Allaah gives him understanding of the Deen.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Seeking knowledge has to be done in a certain way. Many of the people love knowledge and love to listen to knowledge, but because they have not done so systematically (correctly), their gains of knowledge is little. So the correct way to seek the knowledge of this religion is to begin with the Mega Principles of that science and then, after mastering these big principles, following the smaller principles, then the branches of knowledge, the more detailed affairs. This is how one gains knowledge. But as it relates to the actual topic of seeking knowledge, this is a long topic and will be dealt with on another day inshaAllaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second thing required to establish Islam in himself is that he nurtures himself, cultivates himself and gets himself used to the obedience of Allaah (subhanahu wa taa&#8217;ala). Break yourself as it relates to obeying Allaah, in following His commands. That&#8217;s because if you don&#8217;t push yourselves to do good, then your nafs will overtake you until you fall little by little into corruption, such as leaving off the wajibat or doing the impremissible, and this is a dangerous stage as this is the stage of the people threatened with the punishment of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is because we are like a baby; if you leave it (a baby) to suckle on his mother, he would love to do this and he willl not be weaned until you force him to be weaned. Likewise, the adults, if you let your nafs do what it wants, it will get used to it. But if you wean it, you will eventually [adapt] fall in line.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For this reason, brothers and sisters, we have to strive against ourselves to be the best we can be, raise ourselves upon the obedience of Allaah and to be upon good character, and strive to be better today than we were yesterday, and tomorrow better than today. The salaf used to say that whoever finds that his two days are the same, then he is maghdum (he has cheated himself), because he wasted a day. If you learn something new, strive to implement it immediately.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have to get yourself used to worshipping Allaah (subhanahu wa taa&#8217;ala). You should have a portion of the night for praying, a portion of the [week] for fasting, making adhkar in the morning, at night, before going to bed, worshipping Allaah. The issue here is that we implement what we learn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We find that many people enter into the Deen of Allaah and they love to be around knowledge and the students of knowledge, and get themselves used to going here and there [for lessons], but they have not cultivated themselves to eeman. They have not cultivated themselves to the &#8216;ibaada of Allaah. You find that their portion of really having eeman is really small. So you find that when the wind of fitan blows, many of these people fall back on their heels, and some of them even leave Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This life is as Allaah (subhanahu wa taa&#8217;ala) described it in the Qur&#8217;an, mataa&#8217; ghurur &#8211; something one can be fooled by. It is just a short period of time. The Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said: mali wali dunya (&#8220;What do I have to do with this world? My relationship with this world is like that of a traveler&#8230;who seeks shade under a tree&#8230;then moves on.&#8221;) Meaning that shade is just like the dunya.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this life is just a few breaths, then it&#8217;s over. And in the next life, there are only two abodes: Paradise and Hellfire. And what you do in this life will determine your abode in the next life. You have the ability to determine which path you want. The path of the people of the good and bad &#8211; jazza bi makuntu ta&#8217;laamun (as a reward for what you used to do).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is upon every individual to strive against himself and be firm in obedience and leave off disobedience, but it becomes more emphasized in the places where fitan (trials and tribulations) are prevelant. More emphasized in the places. Any time a person lives among the kufaar (disbelievers), where the fitan are many, he has to increase his protection against these fitan. He has to strive harder to pray at night and fast &#8211; he has to. In the land of the kufaar, he must be stronger. He has to make his relationhsip with the Qur&#8217;an stronger in the land of the kufaar. Shaytan there is stronger and more diligent, and this [Muslim] individual has to put a barrier between him and that evil. Get your ammunition together against those things and put up your protective barrier against those things that are going to go to war against your eeman, and put them up against those things that will try to weaken your eeman or try to destroy it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Remain steadfast upon worshipping Allaah when the obedient are few and the disobedient to Allaah are many. The person who does this has a great reward with Allaah, because the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alaihiwasallam) said, &#8220;Worship performed during time of harj is like making hijra to me (the Prophet).&#8221; The one who worships during harj (times when killing, fitna, and fear is widespread, and those who obey Allaah are few, and those who disobey Allaah are many) his reward is like the one who made hijrah to the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alaihiwasallam) &#8211; a reward that only some of the companions (the Muhajjirun) received.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is upon the individual to remain steadfast on the obedience of Allaah. The one who does this and strives to worship Allaah, his reward is greater than the one who everything around him assists him in worshipping Allaah (like here in Madinah, where you hear the adhaan, you stop and pray in the masjid to the end of it). The one who obeys Allaah where the reasons to disobey Allaah are many and the bad places are many, and the bad companions are many. The one who controls himself when everyone else is disobeying Allaah, he reads a mushaf, directs himself to the Qiblah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From those things that assists the individual in establishing Islam in himself in his obedience to Allaah is his home, his family (a spouse, children, proper environment, far from what Allaah dislikes), as the husband should steer his wife in a correct direction, he should want good for her as he wants for himself since she is his wife and the mother of his children. This also helps him. The effect the woman has on her husband is great. If she is saliha (righteous), wants to learn the Deen, give da&#8217;wah, and the likes, then he likewise will do the same; and the opposite is true. Likewise, he has to take extreme concern for the children, especially where you brothers are from [land of the kufaar] &#8211; where the trials and tribulations come from every angle. We have to take extreme and diligent concern for the children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many of the youth have some concern for the da&#8217;wah, and spend much time giving da&#8217;wah, yet they are negligent of those nearest to them, the people of their home.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: And enjoin As-Salat on your family, and be patient upon that&#8230; (Ta-Ha &#8211; 20:132)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people who have the most right to your knowledge, time, and attempts at rectification are those closest to you &#8211; the people of your home, your wife and children. And you will benefit from this, since they have an effect upon you, as mentioned earlier. This is as it relates to (Iqqamat-a-Deen) establishing the religion within ourselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now we look at establishing the religion with other than ourselves, and this is comprised of two categories: Muslims, and disbelievers (non-Muslims):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; We should establish the religion on the Muslims, whom we should give da&#8217;wah, attempt to direct to the right Path, advise them, command them to good and forbid them from evil in a beautiful manner and a style that is beloved because the purpose is that the da&#8217;wah is accepted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This issue of giving da&#8217;wah to Muslims themselves requires us to advise them. The Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alaihiwasallam) said: &#8220;None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Especially, in the du&#8217;aat (those who give da&#8217;wah) and students of knowledge, you find that there is a lack in giving advise to one another. You find that they&#8217;ve been close for years upon years, yet not once has one said to the other &#8220;baarakaAllaahu fik, ya akhee; perhaps you should do this this way.&#8221; We should love good for our brother and not want them to fall into [even] one mistake. That would lead to our community being one that is built upon khair (goodness).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alaihiwasallam) said: &#8220;The strongest handhold of eeman is to love for Allaah and hate for Allaah.&#8221; This issue of love for Allaah is not just a statement. It has requirements. From the greatest of those requirements is that two (who claim they love each other for Allaah&#8217;s sake) advise one another, taking one by the hand away from the disobedience of Allaah and advising him, and vice versa. This is the true love. As for the saying of some that they love each other for Allaah&#8217;s sake and they are laughing, talking about (other than the Deen) and not advising each other, this is a weak love. This advise and level of respect should reach a point that if I see my brother fall into something, that not advising that brother who needs it should prevent you from sleeping at night, worrying about him, thinking, &#8220;how can I not have advised my brother.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a hadeeth Qudsee: Allaah said: &#8220;My love is obligatory for those who love each other for My sake.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; And we should also establish the religion on the non-Muslims:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah revealed this Deen to be general for all of mankind and Jinn. For this reason, you find the first command of the Qur&#8217;an is [you can open your mushaf right now]: Oh mankind (all of mankind), worship the Lord Who created you. (Al-Baqarah 2:21) This is the first command in the Qur&#8217;an, and this is for all of mankind. And the first prohibition is: Then do not set up rivals unto Allaah (in worship) while you know (that He Alone has the right to be worshipped). (Al-Baqarah 2:22) The first command is Tawheed, and the first prohibition is shirk (setting up partners to Allaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the true meaning of La illaaha il Allaah Muhammad RasulAllaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This call is for all of mankind to worship Allaah alone, and to make that worship sincere for Allaah &#8211; and Allaah alone. Allaah did not say here: Oh you who believe. He said: Oh Mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who has not entered into the fold of Islam, it is his right upon us that we call him to Islam. We must strive to establish the proofs, and have this Deen conveyed to every single individual, and this is from the most important issues.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh brothers, this kaafir (disbeliever) you see in front of you. Do you know what his abode is? Right now, you see him, eating, drinking, walking, etc&#8230; If his soul was separated from his body, his abode would be the hellfire forever on top of forever on top of forever. Upon him is the curse of Allaah, the angels and all of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are three feelings we should have when seeing a kaafir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- You recognize the fadhl (blessing) upon you that Allaah guided you to Islam. Allaah had (has) the ability to make you be in his position, from among the people in a church worshipping a cross, instead of making you a Muslim in the Prophet&#8217;s Masjid. This has to make you love Allaah. We should also have hope in Allaah. This has to make you have hope in Allaah, that the One who wants good for you in this world that He wants good for you in the akhira. We should also fear Allaah; our hearts are between the fingers of Ar-Rahman. He turns the hearts as He pleases. [The shaikh recited a poem of Ibnul Qayyim (rahimahullaah): make for your heart two eyes, both these eyes make them cry from fear of Allaah. If your Lord had wished, He would have made you like them. And the hearts are between the fingers of Ar-Rahman.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- Also that you hate the kaafir for the sake of Allaah, from that which eeman requires of you, as Allaah commands: Oh you who believe, do not take My enemies and your enemies as helpers in opposition to Allaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- Also have pity on him, because this miskeen (sad individual), if he were to die upon [his state] after having received the message of Islam, then indeed he would be among the inhabitants of the hellfire. For that reason, we have to have in our hearts some type of mercy and pity and concern for those who have gone astray and those who disbelieve.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So for these reasons, it is upon us to be diligent and work hard to get them to enter Islam to (help) save them from the punishment of Allaah, should they die upon what they&#8217;re upon. Some [of the Muslims] are lazy in this regard. They say, &#8220;These people are kufaar, so what about them, forget about them, their hearts are sealed.&#8221; So they don&#8217;t strive to give them da&#8217;wah. This is wrong. Many of the people who have entered into the Deen of Al-Islam, Wallaahi [the shaykh swore by Allaah], we find that there&#8217;s nothing but half-an-hour (30 minutes) between them being a disbeliever and them entering Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wallaahi [the shaikh again swore by Allaah], it is upon us to seek Allaah&#8217;s assistance in opening the hearts of these people, advising them, calling them to the truth in a way that is better, in a way that is more likely to be accepted by them. It is upon us to have something in our hearts [in the way of] being eager to see the people guided.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (rahimahullaah) said: &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t mind myself be cut up with scissors if it would help the people being guided to the Deen of Allaah.&#8221; He made himself rakhisa. In other words, he would rather see himself cut up if by that, it would help the people be guided to Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I am amazed at people who may have a neighbor who is kaafir, or a colleague at work, or a customer [upon kufr]. I am amazed at those brothers who don&#8217;t have anything in their hearts to help them be guided to Islam. Only a few steps or breaths separate him (the kaafir) and the fire. Ya ikhwan, give this person da&#8217;wah! Maybe, Allaah will guide him at your hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Right now, we have a great opportunity. The Media left and right is talking about Islam, Islam, Islam. People want to know about Islam from you, and not just from the media, because they see you as a speaker from the inside. We should take this opportunity to teach people about Islam, and use this opportunity. There are people who want to know Islam more than they ever wanted to know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do you know the reward that you get by Allaah (subhanahu wa taa&#8217;ala) guiding one person by your hands?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said, &#8220;By Allaah, for Allaah to guide by your hands one individual is better for you than the red camels.&#8221; The red camels were the most expensive, valuable type of wealth they had [then]. For Allaah to guide one person by your hands is greater for you than the greatest wealth in this world. It is better for you than palaces, cars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Da&#8217;wah is in need of perseverance. You will not find a red carpet, or a path laid out with roses, and the people glorifying you to the end of it. It is a path that requires great patience and perseverance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard about a da&#8217;ee (caller) in Egypt. He freed himself &#8211; free his time up &#8211; to write to people about Islam by way of mail. At one point, this da&#8217;ee corresponded with [this one particular] kaafir for a time period you cannot imagine &#8211; 26 years. And he did not despair. And the result of this: this kaafir announced Islam. &#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Firstly,] everything is related to (Iqqamat-a-Deen) establishing the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Second affair, do not be divided or separated in that establishment of the religion. From the greatest goals/objectives of this Deen is that its people who attribute themselves to it are together, have a working relationship, and be as upon the heart of one individual. If this affair is required of the Muslims everywhere, then this even a greater requirement in the land of kufaar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is upon us to strive, implement and manifest this principle and goal of being together, of having togetherness, and that we narrow the differences between ourselves, and shut off the path that shaytan would like to use to bring between us differences, hatred and envy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This [part of the] talk right now is for you brothers, the one whom Allaah brought your hearts together upon Tawheed upon the Sunnah of the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) with the correct understanding of the Salaf (may Allaah have mercy on them).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that shaytan is extremely diligent in trying to bring about separation between people who follow the correct manhaj. And for this reason, we hear many times about the differences and the separation amongst the Salafees in the lands of the West, in the lands of the kufaar. This requires that we come together and work together to solve this problem.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the greatest things required from us all, so we can solve this problem, is that we get rid of something we may have in our hearts, and this is evil thoughts (suspicion), or suu-a-dhan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have to have good thoughts about our brothers, and not have evil suspicion. If we see something from our brother that is incorrect or could [go] either way, we should strive to get this thought out of our heads. This is the only way we can kill the fitna that shaytan will want to cause between us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We claim that we follow the way of the Salaf. Then, let us look at the brotherhood they had [and those who followed them], and you can base your conditions upon this example.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At one point, Imam Shafi&#8217;ee (may Allaah have mercy on him) became sick, and one of his students &#8211; his most famous student al-Muzanee &#8211; made du&#8217;aa: &#8220;may Allaah make your weakness stronger.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Shafi&#8217;ee said: &#8220;If my weakness became stronger, I would die.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The student said: Wallaahi, I didn&#8217;t intend anything except good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{Shaikh as-Sindee commented: &#8220;And look how the Imam Ash-Shafi&#8217;ee dealt with his students&#8221;}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Shafi&#8217;ee said: If you had cursed me explicitly, I (still) would have known that you really didn&#8217;t mean it. [Source later supplied by Shaikh as-Sindee: In Shaikh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah&#8217;s refutation upon al-Bakri, and Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) called it &#8220;a well-known story.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is Husn-u-dhan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I would like to close by welcoming you to the city of the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alaihiwasallam), and I ask Allaah to welcome you, and ask Allaah to make our acts righteous, and that they be purely for His Face, and that no one has any portion of our actions (meaning that Allaah is singled out in them). And we ask Allaah to bless this gathering. Allaah knows best. And may the peace and blessings be upon our Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question to Shaikh as-Sindee:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is the reward greater for being used (by Allaah) to guide an astray Muslim to The Straight Path, or a kaafir to Islam?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Shaikh answered</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Without a doubt, guiding a kaafir to Islam &#8211; that they leave from the fold of kufr &#8211; is a greater reward. And the greatest of the levels of this is that Allaah (subhanahu wa taa&#8217;ala) gives you the guidance to guide this one and that one, that Allaah gives you the ability to guide them both (the Muslim and the kaafir).&#8221;</p>
