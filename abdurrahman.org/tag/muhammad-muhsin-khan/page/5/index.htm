<h3 align="center">Witr Prayer</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.016.105"></a>Volume 2, Book 16, Number 105:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once a person asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about the night prayer. Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;The night prayer is offered as two Rakat followed by two Rakat and so on and if anyone is afraid of the approaching dawn (Fajr prayer) he should pray one Raka and this will be a Witr for all the Rakat which he has prayed before.&#8221; Nafi&#8217; told that &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar used to say Taslim between (the first) two Rakat and (the third) odd one in the Witr prayer, when he wanted to attend to a certain matter (during that interval between the Rakat).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 106:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once I passed the night in the house of Maimuna (his aunt). I slept across the bed while Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his wife slept length-wise. The Prophet slept till midnight or nearly so and woke up rubbing his face and recited ten verses from Surat &#8220;Aal-Imran.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle went towards a leather skin and performed ablution in the most perfect way and then stood for the prayer. I did the same and stood beside him. The Prophet put his right hand on my head, twisted my ear and then prayed two Rakat five times and then ended his prayer with Witr. He laid down till the Muadh-dhin came then he stood up and offered two Rakat (Sunna of Fajr prayer) and then went out and offered the Fajr prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(See Hadith No. 183, Vol. 1)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 107:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Night prayer is offered as two Rakat followed by two Rakat and so on, and if you want to finish it, pray only one Raka which will be Witr for all the previous Rakat.&#8221; Al-Qasim said, &#8220;Since we attained the age of puberty we have seen some people offering a three-Rakat prayer as Witr and all that is permissible. I hope there will be no harm in it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 108:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to pray eleven Rakat at night and that was his night prayer and each of his prostrations lasted for a period enough for one of you to recite fifty verses before Allah&#8217;s Apostle raised his head. He also used to pray two Rakat (Sunna) before the (compulsory) Fajr prayer and then lie down on his right side till the Muadh-dhin came to him for the prayer.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 109:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Sirin:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Ibn &#8216;Umar, &#8220;What is your opinion about the two Rakat before the Fajr (compulsory) prayer, as to prolonging the recitation in them?&#8221; He said, &#8220;The Prophet (p.b.u.h) used to pray at night two Rakat followed by two and so on, and end the prayer by one Raka Witr. He used to offer two Rakat before the Fajr prayer immediately after the Adhan.&#8221; (Hammad, the sub-narrator said, &#8220;That meant (that he prayed) quickly.)&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 110:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle offered Witr prayer at different nights at various hours extending (from the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer) up to the last hour of the night.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 111:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (p.b.u.h) used to offer his night prayer while I was sleeping across in his bed. Whenever he intended to offer the Witr prayer, he used to wake me up and I would offer the Witr prayer too.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 112:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;Make s your last prayer at night.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 113:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin Yasar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was going to Mecca in the company of &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar and when I apprehended the approaching dawn, I dismounted and offered the Witr prayer and then joined him. &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Where have you been?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I apprehended the approaching dawn so I dismounted and prayed the Witr prayer.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it sufficient for you to follow the good example of Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Yes, by Allah.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to pray Witr on the back of the camel (while on a journey).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 114:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to offer (Nawafil) prayers on his Rahila (mount) facing its direction by signals, but not the compulsory prayer. He also used to pray Witr on his (mount) Rahila.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 115:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Muhammad bin Sirin:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas was asked, &#8220;Did the Prophet recite Qunut in the Fajr prayer?&#8221; Anas replied in the affirmative. He was further asked, &#8220;Did he recite Qunut before bowing?&#8221; Anas replied, &#8220;He recited Qunut after bowing for some time (for one month).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 116:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Asim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Anas bin Malik about the Qunut. Anas replied, &#8220;Definitely it was (recited)&#8221;. I asked, &#8220;Before bowing or after it?&#8221; Anas replied, &#8220;Before bowing.&#8221; I added, &#8220;So and so has told me that you had informed him that it had been after bowing.&#8221; Anas said, &#8220;He told an untruth (i.e. &#8220;was mistaken,&#8221; according to the Hijazi dialect). Allah&#8217;s Apostle recited Qunut after bowing for a period of one month.&#8221; Anas added, &#8220;The Prophet sent about seventy men (who knew the Quran by heart) towards the pagans (of Najd) who were less than they in number and there was a peace treaty between them and Allah&#8217;s Apostles (but the Pagans broke the treaty and killed the seventy men). So Allah&#8217;s Apostle recited Qunut for a period of one month asking Allah to punish them.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 117:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet recited Qunut for one month (in the Fajr prayer) asking Allah to punish the tribes of Ral and Dhakwan.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 118:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qunut used to be recited in the Maghrib and the Fajr prayers.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abbas bin Tamim&#8217;s uncle: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet (p.b.u.h) went out to offer the Istisqa&#8217; prayer  and turned (and put on) his cloak inside out. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.017.120"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 17, Number 120: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever the Prophet (p.b.u.h) lifted his head from the  bowing in the last Raka he used to say: &#8220;O Allah! Save &#8216;Aiyash bin Abi Rabi&#8217;a. O  Allah! Save Salama bin Hisham. O Allah! Save Walid bin Walid. O Allah! Save the weak  faithful believers. O Allah! Be hard on the tribes of Mudar and send (famine) years on  them like the famine years of (Prophet) Joseph .&#8221; The Prophet further said,  &#8220;Allah forgive the tribes of Ghifar and save the tribes of Aslam.&#8221; Abu Az-Zinad  (a sub-narrator) said, &#8220;The Qunut used to be recited by the Prophet in the Fajr  prayer.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 17, Number 121: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Masruq: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were with &#8216;Abdullah and he said, &#8220;When the Prophet  saw the refusal of the people to accept Islam he said, &#8220;O Allah! Send (famine) years  on them for (seven years) like the seven years (of famine during the time) of (Prophet)  Joseph.&#8221; So famine overtook them for one year and destroyed every kind of life to  such an extent that the people started eating hides, carcasses and rotten dead animals.  Whenever one of them looked towards the sky, he would (imagine himself to) see smoke  because of hunger. So Abu Sufyan went to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Muhammad! You order  people to obey Allah and to keep good relations with kith and kin. No doubt the people of  your tribe are dying, so please pray to Allah for them.&#8221; So Allah revealed:  &#8220;Then watch you For the day that The sky will bring forth a kind Of smoke Plainly  visible &#8230; Verily! You will return (to disbelief) On the day when We shall seize You with  a mighty grasp. (44.10-16) Ibn Masud added, &#8220;Al-Batsha (i.e. grasp) happened in the  battle of Badr and no doubt smoke, Al-Batsha, Al-Lizam, and the verse of Surat Ar-Rum have  all passed . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Dinar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My father said, &#8220;I heard Ibn &#8216;Umar reciting the poetic  verses of Abu Talib: And a white (person) (i.e. the Prophet) who is requested to pray for  rain and who takes care of the orphans and is the guardian of widows.&#8221; Salim&#8217;s father  (Ibn &#8216;Umar) said, &#8220;The following poetic verse occurred to my mind while I was looking  at the face of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) while he was praying for rain. He did not get down  till the rain water flowed profusely from every roof-g utter: And a white (person) who is  requested to pray for rain and who takes care of the orphans and is the guardian of widows  . . . And these were the words of Abu Talib.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 17, Number 123: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever drought threatened them, &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab,  used to ask Al-Abbas bin &#8216;Abdul Muttalib to invoke Allah for rain. He used to say, &#8220;O  Allah! We used to ask our Prophet to invoke You for rain, and You would bless us with  rain, and now we ask his uncle to invoke You for rain. O Allah ! Bless us with  rain.&#8221;(1) And so it would rain. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Zaid </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet went towards the Musalla and invoked Allah for  rain. He faced the Qibla and wore his cloak inside out, and offered two Rakat. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 17, Number 126: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sharik bin &#8216;Abdullah bin Abi Namir: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Anas bin Malik saying, &#8220;On a Friday a person  entered the main Mosque through the gate facing the pulpit while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was  delivering the Khutba. The man stood in front of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! The livestock are dying and the roads are cut off; so please pray to Allah for  rain.&#8217; &#8221; Anas added, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) raised both his hands and said,  &#8216;O Allah! Bless us with rain! O Allah! Bless us with rain! O Allah! Bless us with rain!&#8217;  &#8221; Anas added, &#8220;By Allah, we could not see any trace of cloud in the sky and  there was no building or a house between us and (the mountains of) Sila.&#8221; Anas added,  &#8220;A heavy cloud like a shield appeared from behind it (i.e. Sila&#8217; Mountain). When it  came in the middle of the sky, it spread and then rained.&#8221; Anas further said,  &#8220;By Allah! We could not see the sun for a week. Next Friday a person entered through  the same gate and at that time Allah&#8217;s Apostle was delivering the Friday&#8217;s Khutba. The man  stood in front of him and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The livestock are dying and the roads  are cut off, please pray to Allah to with-hold rain.&#8217; &#8221; Anas added, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s  Apostle I raised both his hands and said, &#8216;O Allah! Round about us and not on us. O Allah!  On the plateaus, on the mountains, on the hills, in the valleys and on the places where  trees grow.&#8217; So the rain stopped and we came out walking in the sun.&#8221; Sharik asked  Anas whether it was the same person who had asked for the rain (the last Friday). Anas  replied that he did not know. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Anas bin Malik said, &#8220;A person entered the Mosque on a  Friday through the gate facing the Daril-Qada&#8217; and Allah&#8217;s Apostle was standing delivering  the Khutba (sermon). The man stood in front of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle, livestock are dying and the roads are cut off; please pray to Allah for rain.&#8217; So  Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) raised both his hands and said, &#8216;O Allah! Bless us with rain. O  Allah! Bless us with rain. O Allah! Bless us with rain!&#8221; Anas added, &#8220;By Allah,  there were no clouds in the sky and there was no house or building between us and the  mountain of Silas&#8217;. Then a big cloud like a shield appeared from behind it (i.e. Silas  Mountain) and when it came in the middle of the sky, it spread and then rained. By Allah!  We could not see the sun for a week. The next Friday, a person entered through the same  gate and Allah&#8217;s Apostle was delivering the Friday Khutba and the man stood in front of  him and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The livestock are dying and the roads are cut off;  Please pray to Allah to withhold rain.&#8217; &#8221; Anas added, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle raised  both his hands and said, &#8216;O Allah! Round about us and not on us. O Allah!&#8217; On the  plateaus, on the mountains, on the hills, in the valleys and on the places where trees  grow.&#8217; &#8221; Anas added, &#8220;The rain stopped and we came out, walking in the  sun.&#8221; Sharik asked Anas whether it was the same person who had asked for rain the  previous Friday.

Rain is  scarce; please ask Allah to bless us with rain.&#8217; So he invoked Allah for it, and it rained  so much that we could hardly reach our homes and it continued raining till the next  Friday.&#8221; Anas further said, &#8220;Then the same or some other person stood up and  said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Invoke Allah to withhold the rain.&#8217; On that, Allah&#8217;s Apostle I  said, &#8216;O Allah! Round about us and not on us.&#8217; &#8221; Anas added, &#8220;I saw the clouds  dispersing right and left and it continued to rain but not over Medina.&#8221; </font></p>

The same person came  again and said, &#8220;Houses have collapsed, roads are cut off, and the livestock are  destroyed. Please pray to Allah to withhold the rain.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle (stood up and)  said, &#8220;O Allah!

(Let it rain) on the tops of the mountains, on the plateaus,  in the valleys and over the places where trees grow.&#8221; So the clouds cleared away from  Medina as clothes are taken off. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 17, Number 133: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Masruq: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>One day I went to Ibn Masud who said, &#8220;When Quraish  delayed in embracing Islam, the Prophet I invoked Allah to curse them, so they were  afflicted with a (famine) year because of which many of them died and they ate the  carcasses and Abu Sufyan came to the Prophet and said, &#8216;O Muhammad! You came to order  people to keep good relation with kith and kin and your nation is being destroyed, so  invoke Allah I ? So the Prophet I recited the Holy verses of Sirat-Ad-Dukhan: &#8216;Then watch  you For the day that The sky will Bring forth a kind Of smoke Plainly visible.&#8217; (44.10)  When the famine was taken off, the people renegade once again as nonbelievers. The  statement of Allah, (in Sura &#8220;Ad-Dukhan&#8221;-44) refers to that: &#8216;On the day when We  shall seize You with a mighty grasp.&#8217; (44.16) And that was what happened on the day of the  battle of Badr.&#8221; Asbath added on the authority of Mansur, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle  prayed for them and it rained heavily for seven days. So the people complained of the  excessive rain. The Prophet said, &#8216;O Allah! (Let it rain) around us and not on us.&#8217; So the  clouds dispersed over his head and it rained over the surroundings.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 17, Number 134: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle I was delivering the Khutba (sermon) on a  Friday when the people stood up, shouted and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! There is no  rain (drought), the trees have dried and the livestock are destroyed; Please pray to Allah  for rain.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle said twice, &#8220;O Allah! Bless us with rain.&#8221; By  Allah, there was no trace of cloud in the sky and suddenly the sky became overcast with  clouds and it started raining. The Prophet came down the pulpit and offered the prayer.  When he came back from the prayer (to his house) it was raining and it rained continuously  till the next Friday. When the Prophet started delivering the Friday Khutba (sermon), the  people started shouting and said to him, &#8220;The houses have collapsed and the roads are  cut off; so please pray to Allah to withhold the rain.&#8221; So the Prophet smiled and  said, &#8220;O Allah! Round about us and not on us.&#8221; So the sky became clear over  Medina but it kept on raining over the outskirts (of Medina) and not a single drop of rain  fell over Median. I looked towards the sky which was as bright and clear as a crown. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet never raised his hands for any invocation  except for that of Istisqa&#8217; and he used to raise them so much that the whiteness of his  armpits became visible. (Note: It may be that Anas did not see the Prophet raising his  hands, but it is narrated that the Prophet used to raise his hands for invocations other  than Istisqa.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the life-time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) the people  were afflicted with a (famine) year. While the Prophet was delivering the Khutba (sermon)  on the pulpit on a Friday, a Bedouin stood up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The  livestock are dying and the families (offspring) are hungry: please pray to Allah to bless  us with rain.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle raised both his hands towards the sky and at that time  there was not a trace of cloud in they sky. Then the clouds started gathering like  mountains. Before he got down from the pulpit I saw rain-water trickling down his beard.  It rained that day, the next day, the third day, the fourth day and till the next Friday,  when the same Bedouin or some other person stood up (during the Friday Khutba) and said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The houses have collapsed and the livestock are drowned. Please  invoke Allah for us.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle raised both his hands and said, &#8220;O  Allah! Around us and not on us.&#8221; Whichever side the Prophet directed his hand, the  clouds dispersed from there till a hole (in the clouds) was formed over Medina. The valley  of Qanat remained flowing (with water) for one month and none, came from outside who  didn&#8217;t talk about the abundant rain. </font></p>

Bless our Sham and Yemen.&#8221; They said again, &#8220;Our Najd as well.&#8221; On  that the Prophet said, &#8220;There will appear earthquakes and afflictions, and from there  will come out the side of the head of Satan.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle led the morning prayer in Al-Hudaibiya and  it had rained the previous night. When the Prophet (p.b.u.h) had finished the prayer he  faced the people and said, &#8220;Do you know what your Lord has said?&#8221; They replied,  &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; (The Prophet said), &#8220;Allah says, &#8216;In  this morning some of My worshipers remained as true believers and some became  non-believers; he who said that it had rained with the blessing and mercy of Allah is the  one who believes in Me and does not believe in star, but he who said it had rained because  of such and such (star) is a disbeliever in Me and is a believer in star.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<h3 align="center">Rubbing hands and feet with dust(Tayammum)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.007.330"></a>Volume 1, Book 7, Number 330:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) We set out with Allahs Apostle on one of his journeys till we reached Al-Baida&#8217; or Dhatul-Jaish, a necklace of mine was broken (and lost). Allah&#8217;s Apostle stayed there to search for it, and so did the people along with him. There was no water at that place, so the people went to Abu- Bakr As-Siddiq and said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see what &#8216;Aisha has done? She has made Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the people stay where there is no water and they have no water with them.&#8221; Abu Bakr came while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was sleeping with his head on my thigh, He said, to me: &#8220;You have detained Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the people where there is no water and they have no water with them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he admonished me and said what Allah wished him to say and hit me on my flank with his hand. Nothing prevented me from moving (because of pain) but the position of Allah&#8217;s Apostle on my thigh. Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up when dawn broke and there was no water. So Allah revealed the Divine Verses of Tayammum. So they all performed Tayammum. Usaid bin Hudair said, &#8220;O the family of Abu Bakr! This is not the first blessing of yours.&#8221; Then the camel on which I was riding was caused to move from its place and the necklace was found beneath it.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 331:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;I have been given five things which were not given to any one else before me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Allah made me victorious by awe, (by His frightening my enemies) for a distance of one month&#8217;s journey.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The earth has been made for me (and for my followers) a place for praying and a thing to perform Tayammum, therefore anyone of my followers can pray wherever the time of a prayer is due.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The booty has been made Halal (lawful) for me yet it was not lawful for anyone else before me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. I have been given the right of intercession (on the Day of Resurrection).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Every Prophet used to be sent to his nation only but I have been sent to all mankind.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 332:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Urwa&#8217;s father:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aisha said, &#8220;I borrowed a necklace from Asma&#8217; and it was lost. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent a man to search for it and he found it. Then the time of the prayer became due and there was no water. They prayed (without ablution) and informed Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it, so the verse of Tayammum was revealed.&#8221; Usaid bin Hudair said to &#8216;Aisha, &#8220;May Allah reward you. By Allah, whenever anything happened which you did not like, Allah brought good for you and for the Muslims in that.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Jurf and the time for the &#8216;Asr prayer became due while he was at Marbad-AnNa&#8217;am (sheep-fold), so he (performed Tayammum) and prayed there and then entered Medina when the sun was still high but he did not repeat that prayer.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 333:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Juhaim Al-Ansari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet came from the direction of Bir Jamal. A man met him and greeted him. But he did not return back the greeting till he went to a (mud) wall and smeared his hands and his face with its dust (performed Tayammum) and then returned back the greeting.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 334:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin Abza:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab and said, &#8220;I became Junub but no water was available.&#8221; &#8216;Ammar bin Yasir said to &#8216;Umar, &#8220;Do you remember that you and I (became Junub while both of us) were together on a journey and you didn&#8217;t pray but I rolled myself on the ground and prayed? I informed the Prophet about it and he said, &#8216;It would have been sufficient for you to do like this.&#8217; The Prophet then stroked lightly the earth with his hands and then blew off the dust and passed his hands over his face and hands.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 335:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin Abza:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(on the authority of his father who said) &#8216;Ammar said so (the above Statement). And Shu&#8217;ba stroked lightly the earth with his hands and brought them close to his mouth (blew off the dust) and passed them over his face and then the backs of his hands. &#8216;Ammar said, &#8220;Ablution (meaning Tayammum here) is sufficient for a Muslim if water is not available.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 336:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin Abza:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that while he was in the company of &#8216;Umar, &#8216;Ammar said to &#8216;Umar, &#8220;We were in a detachment and became Junub and I blew the dust off my hands (performed the rolling over the earth and prayed.)&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 337:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin Abza:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ammar said to &#8216;Umar &#8220;I rolled myself in the dust and came to the Prophet who said, &#8216;Passing dusted hands over the face and the backs of the hands is sufficient for you.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 338:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ammar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">as above.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 339:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ammar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet stroked the earth with his hands and then passed them over his face and the backs of his hands (while demonstrating Tayammum).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 340:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Imran:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once we were traveling with the Prophet and we carried on traveling till the last part of the night and then we (halted at a place) and slept (deeply). There is nothing sweeter than sleep for a traveler in the last part of the night. So it was only the heat of the sun that made us to wake up and the first to wake up was so and so, then so and so and then so and so (the narrator &#8216;Auf said that Abu Raja&#8217; had told him their names but he had forgotten them) and the fourth person to wake up was &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab. And whenever the Prophet used to sleep, nobody would wake up him till he himself used to get up as we did not know what was happening (being revealed) to him in his sleep. So, &#8216;Umar got up and saw the condition of the people, and he was a strict man, so he said, &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221; and raised his voice with Takbir, and kept on saying loudly till the Prophet got up because of it. When he got up, the people informed him about what had happened to them. He said, &#8220;There is no harm (or it will not be harmful). Depart!&#8221; So they departed from that place, and after covering some distance the Prophet stopped and asked for some water to perform the ablution. So he performed the ablution and the call for the prayer was pronounced and he led the people in prayer. After he finished from the prayer, he saw a man sitting aloof who had not prayed with the people. He asked, &#8220;O so and so! What has prevented you from praying with us?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I am Junub and there is no water. &#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Perform Tayammum with (clean) earth and that is sufficient for you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Prophet proceeded on and the people complained to him of thirst. Thereupon he got down and called a person (the narrator &#8216;Auf added that Abu Raja&#8217; had named him but he had forgotten) and &#8216;Ali, and ordered them to go and bring water. So they went in search of water and met a woman who was sitting on her camel between two bags of water. They asked, &#8220;Where can we find water?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;I was there (at the place of water) this hour yesterday and my people are behind me.&#8221; They requested her to accompany them. She asked, &#8220;Where?&#8221; They said, &#8220;To Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; She said, &#8220;Do you mean the man who is called the Sabi, (with a new religion)?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes, the same person. So come along.&#8221; They brought her to the Prophet and narrated the whole story. He said, &#8220;Help her to dismount.&#8221; The Prophet asked for a pot, then he opened the mouths of the bags and poured some water into the pot. Then he closed the big openings of the bags and opened the small ones and the people were called upon to drink and water their animals. So they all watered their animals and they (too) all quenched their thirst and also gave water to others and last of all the Prophet gave a pot full of water to the person who was Junub and told him to pour it over his body. The woman was standing and watching all that which they were doing with her water. By Allah, when her water bags were returned the looked like as if they were more full (of water) than they had been before (Miracle of Allah&#8217;s Apostle) Then the Prophet ordered us to collect something for her; so dates, flour and Sawiq were collected which amounted to a good meal that was put in a piece of cloth. She was helped to ride on her camel and that cloth full of food-stuff was also placed in front of her and then the Prophet said to her, &#8220;We have not taken your water but Allah has given water to us.&#8221; She returned home late. Her relatives asked her: &#8220;O so and so what has delayed you?&#8221; She said, &#8220;A strange thing! Two men met me and took me to the man who is called the Sabi&#8217; and he did such and such a thing. By Allah, he is either the greatest magician between this and this (gesturing with her index and middle fingers raising them towards the sky indicating the heaven and the earth) or he is Allah&#8217;s true Apostle.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Afterwards the Muslims used to attack the pagans around her abode but never touched her village. One day she said to her people, &#8220;I think that these people leave you purposely. Have you got any inclination to Islam?&#8221; They obeyed her and all of them embraced Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu &#8216;Abdultah said: The word Saba&#8217;a means &#8220;The one who has deserted his old religion and embraced a new religion.&#8221; Abul &#8216;Ailya said, &#8220;The Sabis are a sect of people of the Scripture who recite the Book of Psalms.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 341:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Wail:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Muisa said to&#8217;Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud, &#8220;If one does not find water (for ablution) can he give up the prayer?&#8221; Abdullah replied, &#8220;If you give the permission to perform Tayammum they will perform Tayammum even if water was available if one of them found it cold.&#8221; Abu Musa said, &#8220;What about the statement of &#8216;Ammar to &#8216;Umar?&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah replied, &#8220;Umar was not satisfied by his statement.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 342:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Shaqiq bin Salama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was with &#8216;Abdullah and Abu Musa; the latter asked the former, &#8220;O Abu AbdurRahman! What is your opinion if somebody becomes Junub and no water is available?&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah replied, &#8220;Do not pray till water is found.&#8221; Abu Musa said, &#8220;What do you say about the statement of &#8216;Ammar (who was ordered by the Prophet to perform Tayammum). The Prophet said to him: &#8220;Perform Tayammum and that would be sufficient.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah replied, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see that &#8216;Umar was not satisfied by &#8216;Ammar&#8217;s statement?&#8221; Abu- Musa said, &#8220;All right, leave &#8216;Ammalr&#8217;s statement, but what will you say about this verse (of Tayammum)?&#8221; &#8216;Abqiullah kept quiet and then said, &#8220;If we allowed it, then they would probably perform Tayammum even if water was available, if one of them found it (water) cold.&#8221; The narrator added, &#8220;I said to Shaqrq, &#8220;Then did &#8216;Abdullah dislike to perform Tayammum because of this?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 343:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-A&#8217;mash:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaqiq said, &#8220;While I was sitting with &#8216;Abdullah and Abu Musa Al-Ash-&#8216;ari, the latter asked the former, &#8216;If a person becomes Junub and does not find water for one month, can he perform Tayammum and offer his prayer?&#8217; (He applied in the negative). Abu Musa said, &#8216;What do you say about this verse from Surat &#8220;Al-Ma&#8217;ida&#8221;: When you do not find water then perform Tayammum with clean earth? &#8216;Abdullah replied, &#8216;If we allowed it then they would probably perform Tayammum with clean earth even if water were available but cold.&#8217; I said to Shaqiq, &#8216;You then disliked to perform Tayammum because of this?&#8217; Shaqiq said,&#8217;Yes.&#8217; (Shaqiq added), &#8220;Abu Musa said, &#8216;Haven&#8217;t you heard the statement of &#8216;Ammar to &#8216;Umar? He said: I was sent out by Allah&#8217;s Apostle for some job and I became Junub and could not find water so I rolled myself over the dust (clean earth) like an animal does, and when I told the Prophet of that he said, &#8216;Like this would have been sufficient.&#8217; The Prophet (saying so) lightly stroked the earth with his hand once and blew it off, then passed his (left) hand over the back of his right hand or his (right) hand over the back of his left hand and then passed them over his face.&#8217; So &#8216;Abdullah said to Abu- Musa, &#8216;Don&#8217;t you know that &#8216;Umar was not satisfied with &#8216;Ammar&#8217;s statement?&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Shaqiq: While I was with &#8216;Abdullah and Abu Musa, the latter said to the former, &#8220;Haven&#8217;t you heard the statement of &#8216;Ammar to &#8216;Umar? He said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent you and me out and I became Junub and rolled myself in the dust (clean earth) (for Tayammum). When we came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle I told him about it and he said, &#8216;This would have been sufficient,&#8217; passing his hands over his face and the backs of his hands once only.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 344:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Imran bin Husain Al-Khuza&#8217;i:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw a person sitting aloof and not praying with the people. He asked him, &#8220;O so and so! What prevented you from offering the prayer with the people?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I am Junub and there is no water.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Perform Tayammum with clean earth and that will be sufficient for you.&#8221;</p>

<h3 align="center">Prayers (Salat)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.008.345"></a>Volume 1, Book 8, Number 345:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Dhar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;While I was at Mecca the roof of my house was opened and Gabriel descended, opened my chest, and washed it with Zam-zam water. Then he brought a golden tray full of wisdom and faith and having poured its contents into my chest, he closed it. Then he took my hand and ascended with me to the nearest heaven, when I reached the nearest heaven, Gabriel said to the gatekeeper of the heaven, &#8216;Open (the gate).&#8217; The gatekeeper asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel answered: &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; He asked, &#8216;Is there anyone with you?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Yes, Muhammad I is with me.&#8217; He asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217; Gabriel said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; So the gate was opened and we went over the nearest heaven and there we saw a man sitting with some people on his right and some on his left. When he looked towards his right, he laughed and when he looked toward his left he wept. Then he said, &#8216;Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious son.&#8217; I asked Gabriel, &#8216;Who is he?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;He is Adam and the people on his right and left are the souls of his offspring. Those on his right are the people of Paradise and those on his left are the people of Hell and when he looks towards his right he laughs and when he looks towards his left he weeps.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he ascended with me till he reached the second heaven and he (Gabriel) said to its gatekeeper, &#8216;Open (the gate).&#8217; The gatekeeper said to him the same as the gatekeeper of the first heaven had said and he opened the gate. Anas said: &#8220;Abu Dhar added that the Prophet met Adam, Idris, Moses, Jesus and Abraham, he (Abu Dhar) did not mention on which heaven they were but he mentioned that he (the Prophet ) met Adarn on the nearest heaven and Abraham on the sixth heaven. Anas said, &#8220;When Gabriel along with the Prophet passed by Idris, the latter said, &#8216;Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious brother.&#8217; The Prophet asked, &#8216;Who is he?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;He is Idris.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;I passed by Moses and he said, &#8216;Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious brother.&#8217; I asked Gabriel, &#8216;Who is he?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;He is Moses.&#8217; Then I passed by Jesus and he said, &#8216;Welcome! O pious brother and pious Prophet.&#8217; I asked, &#8216;Who is he?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;He is Jesus.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I passed by Abraham and he said, &#8216;Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious son.&#8217; I asked Gabriel, &#8216;Who is he?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;He is Abraham. The Prophet added, &#8216;Then Gabriel ascended with me to a place where I heard the creaking of the pens.&#8221; Ibn Hazm and Anas bin Malik said: The Prophet said, &#8220;Then Allah enjoined fifty prayers on my followers when I returned with this order of Allah, I passed by Moses who asked me, &#8216;What has Allah enjoined on your followers?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;He has enjoined fifty prayers on them.&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;Go back to your Lord (and appeal for reduction) for your followers will not be able to bear it.&#8217; (So I went back to Allah and requested for reduction) and He reduced it to half. When I passed by Moses again and informed him about it, he said, &#8216;Go back to your Lord as your followers will not be able to bear it.&#8217; So I returned to Allah and requested for further reduction and half of it was reduced. I again passed by Moses and he said to me: &#8216;Return to your Lord, for your followers will not be able to bear it. So I returned to Allah and He said, &#8216;These are five prayers and they are all (equal to) fifty (in reward) for My Word does not change.&#8217; I returned to Moses and he told me to go back once again. I replied, &#8216;Now I feel shy of asking my Lord again.&#8217; Then Gabriel took me till we &#8221; reached Sidrat-il-Muntaha (Lote tree of; the utmost boundry) which was shrouded in colors, indescribable. Then I was admitted into Paradise where I found small (tents or) walls (made) of pearls and its earth was of musk.&#8221;</p>

What has brought you here?&#8217; I told him what I wanted. When I finished, he asked, &#8216;O Jabir! What is this garment which I have seen and with which you covered your shoulders?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;It is a (tight) garment.&#8217; He said, &#8216;If the garment is large enough, wrap it round the body (covering the shoulders) and if it is tight (too short) then use it as an Izar (tie it around your waist only.)&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Aziz:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas said, &#8216;When Allah&#8217;s Apostle invaded Khaibar, we offered the Fajr prayer there yearly in the morning) when it was still dark. The Prophet rode and Abu Talha rode too and I was riding behind Abu Talha. The Prophet passed through the lane of Khaibar quickly and my knee was touching the thigh of the Prophet . He uncovered his thigh and I saw the whiteness of the thigh of the Prophet. When he entered the town, he said, &#8216;Allahu Akbar! Khaibar is ruined. Whenever we approach near a (hostile) nation (to fight) then evil will be the morning of those who have been warned.&#8217; He repeated this thrice. The people came out for their jobs and some of them said, &#8216;Muhammad (has come).&#8217; (Some of our companions added, &#8220;With his army.&#8221;) We conquered Khaibar, took the captives, and the booty was collected. Dihya came and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! Give me a slave girl from the captives.&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;Go and take any slave girl.&#8217; He took Safiya bint Huyai. A man came to the Prophet and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostles! You gave Safiya bint Huyai to Dihya and she is the chief mistress of the tribes of Quraiza and An-Nadir and she befits none but you.&#8217; So the Prophet said, &#8216;Bring him along with her.&#8217; So Dihya came with her and when the Prophet saw her, he said to Dihya, &#8216;Take any slave girl other than her from the captives.&#8217; Anas added: The Prophet then manumitted her and married her.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thabit asked Anas, &#8220;O Abu Hamza! What did the Prophet pay her (as Mahr)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Her self was her Mahr for he manumitted her and then married her.&#8221; Anas added, &#8220;While on the way, Um Sulaim dressed her for marriage (ceremony) and at night she sent her as a bride to the Prophet . So the Prophet was a bridegroom and he said, &#8216;Whoever has anything (food) should bring it.&#8217; He spread out a leather sheet (for the food) and some brought dates and others cooking butter. (I think he (Anas) mentioned As-SawTq). So they prepared a dish of Hais (a kind of meal). And that was Walrma (the marriage banquet) of Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221;</p>

When he turned his face to us he said, &#8220;If there had been anything changed in the prayer, surely I would have informed you but I am a human being like you and liable to forget like you.

So came the Divine Inspiration: And take you (people) the station of Abraham as a place of prayer (for some of your prayers e.g. two Rakat of Tawaf of Ka&#8217;ba)&#8221;. (2.125)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. And as regards the (verse of) the veiling of the women, I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I wish you ordered your wives to cover themselves from the men because good and bad ones talk to them.&#8217; So the verse of the veiling of the women was revealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Once the wives of the Prophet made a united front against the Prophet and I said to them, &#8216;It may be if he (the Prophet) divorced you, (all) that his Lord (Allah) will give him instead of you wives better than you.&#8217; So this verse (the same as I had said) was revealed.&#8221; (66.5).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Prophet said, &#8220;If anyone of you stands for prayer, he should not spit in front of him because in prayer he is speaking in private to Allah and he should not spit on his right as there is an angel, but he can spit either on his left or under his left foot and bury it (i.e. expectoration).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet saw expectoration (on the wall of the mosque) in the direction of the Qibla and scraped it off with his hand. It seemed that he disliked it and the sign of disgust was apparent from his face. He said, &#8220;If anyone of you stands for the prayer, he is speaking in private to his Lord, (or) his Lord is between him and his Qibla, therefore he should not spit towards his Qibla, but he could spit either on his left or under his foot.&#8221; Then he took the corner of his sheet and spat in it, folded it and said, &#8220;Or do like this.&#8221;</p>

The Prophet ordered the people to spread them in the mosque &#8211;it was the biggest amount of goods Allah&#8217;s Apostle had ever received. He left for prayer and did not even look at it. After finishing the prayer, he sat by those goods and gave from those to everybody he saw. Al-&#8216;Abbas came to him and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! give me (something) too, because I gave ransom for myself and &#8216;Aqil&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle told him to take. So he stuffed his garment with it and tried to carry it away but he failed to do so. He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Order someone to help me in lifting it.&#8221; The Prophet refused. He then said to the Prophet: Will you please help me to lift it?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle refused. Then Al-&#8216;Abbas threw some of it and tried to lift it (but failed). He again said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle Order someone to help me to lift it.&#8221; He refused. Al-&#8216;Abbas then said to the Prophet: &#8220;Will you please help me to lift it?&#8221; He again refused. Then Al-&#8216;Abbas threw some of it, and lifted it on his shoulders and went away. Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on watching him till he disappeared from his sight and was astonished at his greediness. Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not get up till the last coin was distributed.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">who was one of the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and one of the Ansar&#8217;s who took part in the battle of Badr: I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle I have weak eyesight and I lead my people in prayers. When it rains the water flows in the valley between me and my people so I cannot go to their mosque to lead them in prayer. O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I wish you would come to my house and pray in it so that I could take that place as a Musalla. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said. &#8220;Allah willing, I will do so.&#8221; Next day after the sun rose high, Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr came and Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked for permission to enter. I gave him permission and he did not sit on entering the house but said to me, &#8220;Where do you like me to pray?&#8221; I pointed to a place in my house. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood there and said, &#8216;Allahu Akbar&#8217;, and we all got up and aligned behind him and offered a two-Rak&#8217;at prayer and ended it with Taslim. We requested him to stay for a meal called &#8220;Khazira&#8221; which we had prepared for him. Many members of our family gathered in the house and one of them said, &#8220;Where is Malik bin Al-Dukhaishin or Ibn Al-Dukhshun?&#8221; One of them replied, &#8220;He is a hypocrite and does not love Allah and His Apostle.&#8221; Hearing that, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Do not say so. Haven&#8217;t you seen that he said, &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah&#8217; for Allah&#8217;s sake only?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better. We have seen him helping and advising hypocrites.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah has forbidden the (Hell) fire for those who say, &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah&#8217; for Allah&#8217;s sake only.&#8221;</p>

Then he sent for Bani An-Najjar and they came armed with their swords. As if I am looking (just now) as the Prophet was sitting over his Rahila (Mount) with Abu Bakr riding behind him and all Banu An-Najjar around him till he dismounted at the courtyard of Abu Aiyub&#8217;s house. The Prophet loved to pray wherever the time for the prayer was due even at sheep-folds. Later on he ordered that a mosque should be built and sent for some people of Banu-An-Najjar and said, &#8220;O Banu An-Najjar! Suggest to me the price of this (walled) piece of land of yours.&#8221; They replied, &#8220;No! By Allah! We do not demand its price except from Allah.&#8221; Anas added: There were graves of pagans in it and some of it was unleveled and there were some date-palm trees in it. The Prophet ordered that the graves of the pagans be dug out and the unleveled land be level led and the date-palm trees be cut down . (So all that was done). They aligned these cut date-palm trees towards the Qibla of the mosque (as a wall) and they also built two stone side-walls (of the mosque). His companions brought the stones while reciting some poetic verses. The Prophet was with them and he kept on saying, &#8220;There is no goodness except that of the Hereafter, O Allah! So please forgive the Ansars and the emigrants. &#8220;</p>

When he enters the mosque he is considered in prayer as long as he is waiting for the prayer and the angels keep on asking for Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for him and they keep on saying: &#8216;O Allah! Be Merciful to him, O Allah! Forgive him, as long as he keeps on sitting at his praying place and does not pass wind. (See Hadith No. 620).</p>

The people who were in haste left the mosque through its gates. They wondered whether the prayer was reduced. And amongst them were Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar but they hesitated to ask the Prophet. A long-handed man called Dhul-Yadain asked the Prophet, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Have you; forgotten or has the prayer been reduced?&#8217; The Prophet replied, &#8216;I have neither forgotten nor has the prayer been reduced&#8217; The Prophet added, &#8216;Is what Dhul Yadain has said true?&#8217; They (the people) said, &#8216;Yes, it is true.&#8217; The Prophet stood up again and led the prayer, completing the remaining prayer, forgotten by him, and performed Talsrm, and then said, &#8216;Allahu Akbar.&#8217; And then he did a prostration as he used to prostrate or longer than that. He then raised his head saying, &#8216;Allahu Akbar; he then again said, &#8216;Allahu Akbar&#8217;, and prostrated as he used to prostrate or longer than that. Then he raised his head and said, &#8216;Allahu Akbar.&#8217; &#8221; (The subnarrator added, &#8220;I think that they asked (Ibn Sirin) whether the Prophet completed the prayer with Taslim.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.010.500"></a>Volume 1, Book 10, Number 500:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Shihab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once&#8217;Umar bin &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Aziz delayed the prayer and &#8216;Urwa bin Az-Zubair went to him and said, &#8220;Once in &#8216;Iraq, Al-MughTra bin Shu&#8217;ba delayed his prayers and Abi Mas&#8217;ud Al-Ansari went to him and said, &#8216;O Mughira! What is this? Don&#8217;t you know that once Gabriel came and offered the prayer (Fajr prayer) and Allah&#8217;s Apostle prayed too, then he prayed again (Zuhr prayer) and so did Allah&#8217;s Apostle and again he prayed (&#8216;Asr prayers and Allah&#8217;s Apostle did the same; again he prayed (Maghrib-prayer) and so did Allah&#8217;s Apostle and again prayed (&#8216;Isha prayer) and so did Allah&#8217;s Apostle and (Gabriel) said, &#8216;I was ordered to do so (to demonstrate the prayers prescribed to you)?'&#8221; &#8216;Umar (bin &#8216;Abdul &#8216;AzTz) said to &#8216;Urwa, &#8220;Be sure of what you Say. Did Gabriel lead Allah&#8217;s Apostle at the stated times of the prayers?&#8221; &#8216;Urwa replied, &#8220;Bashir bin Abi Mas&#8217;ud narrated like this on the authority of his father.&#8221; Urwa added, &#8220;Aisha told me that Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to pray &#8216;Asr prayer when the sun-shine was still inside her residence (during the early time of &#8216;Asr).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 10, Number 501:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Once a delegation of &#8216;Abdul Qais came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;We belong to such and such branch of the tribe of Rab&#8217;a and we can only come to you in the sacred months. Order us to do something good so that we may (carry out) take it from you and also invite to it our people whom we have left behind (at home).&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8221; I order you to do four things and forbid you from four things. (The first four are as follows):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. To believe in Allah. (And then he: explained it to them i.e.) to testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and (Muhammad) am Allah&#8217;s Apostle</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. To offer prayers perfectly (at the stated times):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. To pay Zakat (obligatory charity)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. To give me Khumus</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The other four things which are forbidden are as follows):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Dubba</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Hantam</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Muqaiyat</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Naqir (all these are utensils used for the preparation of alcoholic drinks).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">that he had heard Hudhaifa saying, &#8220;Once I was sitting with &#8216;Umar and he said, &#8216;Who amongst you remembers the statement of Allah&#8217;s Apostle about the afflictions?&#8217; I said, &#8216;I know it as the Prophet had said it.&#8217; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;No doubt you are bold.&#8217; I said, &#8216;The afflictions caused for a man by his wife, money, children and neighbor are expiated by his prayers, fasting, charity and by enjoining (what is good) and forbidding (what is evil).&#8217; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;I did not mean that but I asked about that affliction which will spread like the waves of the sea.&#8217; I (Hudhaifa) said, &#8216;O leader of the faithful believers! You need not be afraid of it as there is a closed door between you and it.&#8217; &#8216;Umar asked, Will the door be broken or opened?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;It will be broken.&#8217; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;Then it will never be closed again.&#8217; I was asked whether &#8216;Umar knew that door. I replied that he knew it as one knows that there will be night before the tomorrow morning. I narrated a Hadith that was free from any mis-statement&#8221; The subnarrator added that they deputed Masruq to ask Hudhaifa (about the door). Hudhaifa said, &#8220;The door was &#8216;Umar himself.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">And offer prayers perfectly At the two ends of the day And in some hours of the night (i.e. the five compulsory prayers). Verily! good deeds remove (annul) the evil deeds (small sins) (11.114). The man asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8220;Is it for me?&#8221; He said, &#8220;It is for all my followers.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked the Prophet &#8220;Which deed is the dearest to Allah?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;To offer the prayers at their early stated fixed times.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What is the next (in goodness)?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;To be good and dutiful to your parents&#8221; I again asked, &#8220;What is the next (in goodness)?&#8221; He replied, &#8216;To participate in Jihad (religious fighting) in Allah&#8217;s cause.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah added, &#8220;I asked only that much and if I had asked more, the Prophet would have told me more.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Az-Zuhri that he visited Anas bin Malik at Damascus and found him weeping and asked him why he was weeping.

The Hell-fire of Hell complained to its Lord saying: O Lord! My parts are eating (destroying) one another. So Allah allowed it to take two breaths, one in the winter and the other in the summer.

He then said, &#8220;Whoever likes to ask me about anything he can do so and I shall reply as long as I am at this place of mine. Most of the people wept and the Prophet said repeatedly, &#8220;Ask me.&#8221; Abdullah bin Hudhafa As-Sahmi stood up and said, &#8220;Who is my father?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Your father is Hudhafa.&#8221; The Prophet repeatedly said, &#8220;Ask me.&#8221; Then Umar knelt before him and said, &#8220;We are pleased with Allah as our Lord, Islam as our religion, and Muhammad as our Prophet.&#8221; The Prophet then became quiet and said, &#8220;Paradise and Hell-fire were displayed in front of me on this wall just now and I have never seen a better thing (than the former) and a worse thing (than the latter).&#8221;</p>

After finishing from the prayer, he addressed the people present there saying, &#8220;Be patient! Don&#8217;t go away. Have the glad tiding. It is from the blessing of Allah upon you that none amongst mankind has prayed at this time save you.&#8221; Or said, &#8220;None except you has prayed at this time.&#8221; Abu Muisa added, &#8216;So we returned happily after what we heard from Alllah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221;</p>

The Prophet came out and said, &#8216;None amongst the dwellers of the earth but you have been waiting for the prayer.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar did not find any harm in praying it earlier or in delaying it unless he was afraid that sleep might overwhelm him and he might miss the prayer, and sometimes he used to sleep before the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer. Ibn Juraij said, &#8220;I said to &#8216;Ata&#8217;, &#8216;I heard Ibn &#8216;Abbas saying: Once Allah&#8217;s Apostle delayed the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer to such an extent that the people slept and got up and slept again and got up again.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar came cursing the disbelievers (of Quraish) on the day of Al-Khandaq (the battle of Trench) and said, &#8220;I could not offer the &#8216;Asr prayer till the sun had set. Then we went to Buthan and he offered the (&#8216;Asr) prayer after sunset and then he offered the Maghrib prayer.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 10, Number 573:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu-l-Minhal:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My father and I went to Abi Barza Al-Aslami and my father said to him, &#8220;Tell us how Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to offer the compulsory congregational prayers.&#8221; He said, &#8220;He used to pray the Zuhr prayer, which you call the first prayer, as the sun declined at noon, the &#8216;Asr at a time when one of US could go to his family at the farthest place in Medina while the sun was still hot. (The narrator forgot what Abu Barza had said about the Maghrib prayer), and the Prophet preferred to pray the &#8216;Isha&#8217; late and disliked to sleep before it or talk after it. And he used to return after finishing the morning prayer at such a time when it was possible for one to recognize the person sitting by his side and he (the Prophet) used to recite 60 to 100 &#8216;Ayat&#8217; (verses) of the Qur&#8217;an in it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 10, Number 574:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Qurra bin Khalid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once he waited for Al-Hasan and he did not show up till it was about the usual time for him to start his speech; then he came and apologized saying, &#8220;Our neighbors invited us.&#8221; Then he added, &#8220;Narrated Anas, &#8216;Once we waited for the Prophet till it was midnight or about midnight. He came and led the prayer, and after finishing it, he addressed us and said, &#8216;All the people prayed and then slept and you had been in prayer as long as you were waiting for it.&#8221; Al-Hasan said, &#8220;The people are regarded as performing good deeds as long as they are waiting for doing good deeds.&#8221; Al-Hasan&#8217;s statement is a portion of Anas&#8217;s Hadith from the Prophet .</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 10, Number 575:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet prayed one of the&#8217;lsha&#8217; prayer in his last days and after finishing it with Taslim, he stood up and said, &#8220;Do you realize (the importance of) this night? Nobody present on the</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">surface of the earth to-night would be living after the completion of one hundred years from this night.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people made a mistake in grasping the meaning of this statement of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and they indulged in those things which are said about these narrators (i.e. some said that the Day of Resurrection will be established after 100 years etc.) But the Prophet said, &#8220;Nobody present on the surface of earth tonight would be living after the completion of 100 years from this night&#8221;; he meant &#8220;When that century (people of that century) would pass away.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 10, Number 576:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu &#8216;Uthman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdur Rahman bin Abi Bakr said, &#8220;The Suffa Companions were poor people and the Prophet said, &#8216;Whoever has food for two persons should take a third one from them (Suffa companions). And whosoever has food for four persons he should take one or two from them&#8217; Abu Bakr took three men and the Prophet took ten of them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdur Rahman added, my father my mother and I were there (in the house). (The sub-narrator is in doubt whether &#8216;Abdur Rahman also said, &#8216;My wife and our servant who was common for both my house and Abu Bakr&#8217;s house). Abu Bakr took his supper with the Prophet and remained there till the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer was offered. Abu Bakr went back and stayed with the Prophet till the Prophet took his meal and then Abu Bakr returned to his house after a long portion of the night had passed. Abu Bakr&#8217;s wife said, &#8216;What detained you from your guests (or guest)?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Have you not served them yet?&#8217; She said, &#8216;They refused to eat until you come. The food was served for them but they refused.&#8221; &#8216;Abdur Rahman added, &#8220;I went away and hid myself (being afraid of Abu Bakr) and in the meantime he (Abu Bakr) called me, &#8216;O Ghunthar (a harsh word)!&#8217; and also called me bad names and abused me and then said (to his family), &#8216;Eat. No welcome for you.&#8217; Then (the supper was served). Abu Bakr took an oath that he would not eat that food. The narrator added: By Allah, whenever any one of us (myself and the guests of Suffa companions) took anything from the food, it increased from underneath. We all ate to our fill and the food was more than it was before its serving.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr looked at it (the food) and found it as it was before serving or even more than that. He addressed his wife (saying) &#8216;O the sister of Bani Firas! What is this?&#8217; She said, &#8216;O the pleasure of my eyes! The food is now three times more than it was before.&#8217; Abu Bakr ate from it, and said, &#8216;That (oath) was from Satan&#8217; meaning his oath (not to eat). Then he again took a morsel (mouthful) from it and then took the rest of it to the Prophet. So that meal was with the Prophet. There was a treaty between us and some people, and when the period of that treaty had elapsed the Prophet divided us into twelve (groups) (the Prophet&#8217;s companions) each being headed by a man. Allah knows how many men were under the command of each (leader). So all of them (12 groups of men) ate of that meal.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.004.137"></a>Volume 1, Book 4, Number 137:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The prayer of a person who does ,Hadath (passes, urine, stool or wind) is not accepted till he performs (repeats) the ablution.&#8221; A person from Hadaramout asked Abu Huraira, &#8220;What is &#8216;Hadath&#8217;?&#8221; Abu Huraira replied, &#8221; &#8216;Hadath&#8217; means the passing of wind from the anus.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 4, Number 138:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nu&#8217;am Al-Mujmir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once I went up the roof of the mosque, along with Abu Huraira.

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 4, Number 139:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abbas bin Tamim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My uncle asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about a person who imagined to have passed wind during the prayer. Allah&#8217; Apostle replied: &#8220;He should not leave his prayers unless he hears sound or smells something.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 4, Number 140:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Kuraib:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;The Prophet slept till he snored and then prayed (or probably lay till his breath sounds were heard and then got up and prayed).&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas added: &#8220;I stayed overnight in the house of my aunt, Maimuna, the Prophet slept for a part of the night, (See Fateh-al-Bari page 249, Vol. 1), and late in the night, he got up and performed ablution from a hanging water skin, a light (perfect) ablution and stood up for the prayer. I, too, performed a similar ablution, then I went and stood on his left. He drew me to his right and prayed as much as Allah wished, and again lay and slept till his breath sounds were heard. Later on the Mua&#8217;dhdhin (callmaker for the prayer) came to him and informed him that it was time for Prayer. The Prophet went with him for the prayer without performing a new ablution.&#8221; (Sufyan said to &#8216;Amr that some people said, &#8220;The eyes of Allah&#8217;s Apostle sleep but his heart does not sleep.&#8221; &#8216;Amr replied, &#8220;I heard &#8216;Ubaid bin &#8216;Umar saying that the dreams of Prophets were Divine Inspiration, and then he recited the verse: &#8216;I (Abraham) see in a dream, (O my son) that I offer you in sacrifice (to Allah).&#8221; (37.102) (See Hadith No. 183)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle proceeded from &#8216;Arafat till when he reached the mountain pass, he dismounted, urinated and then performed ablution but not a perfect one. I said to him, (&#8220;Is it the time for) the prayer, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; He said, &#8220;The (place of) prayer is ahead of you.&#8221; He rode till when he reached Al-Muzdalifa, he dismounted and performed ablution and a perfect one, The (call for) Iqama was pronounced and he led the Maghrib prayer. Then everybody made his camel kneel down at its place. Then the Iqama was pronounced for the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer which the Prophet led and no prayer was offered in between the two . prayers (&#8216;Isha&#8217; and Maghrib).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ata&#8217; bin Yasar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbas performed ablution and washed his face (in the following way): He ladled out a handful of water, rinsed his mouth and washed his nose with it by putting in water and then blowing it out. He then, took another handful (of water) and did like this (gesturing) joining both hands, and washed his face, took another handful of water and washed his right forearm. He again took another handful of water and washed his left forearm, and passed wet hands over his head and took another handful of water and poured it over his right foot (up to his ankles) and washed it thoroughly and similarly took another handful of water and washed thoroughly his left foot (up to the ankles) and said, &#8220;I saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle performing ablution in this way.&#8221;</p>

I saw you doing four things which I never saw being done by anyone of you companions?&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;What are those, O Ibn Juraij?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I never saw you touching any corner of the Ka&#8217;ba except these (two) facing south (Yemen) and I saw you wearing shoes made of tanned leather and dyeing your hair with Hinna; (a kind of dye).

So I love to wear similar shoes. And about the dyeing of hair with Hinna; no doubt I saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle dyeing his hair with it and that is why I like to dye (my hair with it). Regarding Ihlal, I did not see Allah&#8217;s Apostle assuming Ihlal till he set out for Hajj (on the 8th of Dhul-Hijja).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 4, Number 237:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Maimuna:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet was asked regarding ghee in which a mouse had fallen. He said, &#8220;Take out the mouse and throw away the ghee around it (and use the rest.)&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 4, Number 238:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;A wound which a Muslim receives in Allah&#8217;s cause will appear on the Day of Resurrection as it was at the time of infliction; blood will be flowing from the wound and its color will be that of the blood but will smell like musk.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 4, Number 239:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;We (Muslims) are the last (people to come in the world) but (will be) the foremost (on the Day of Resurrection).&#8221; The same narrator told that the Prophet had said, &#8220;You should not pass urine in stagnant water which is not flowing then (you may need to) wash in it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 4, Number 240:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While Allah&#8217;s Apostle was prostrating (as stated below).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 4, Number 241:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once the Prophet was offering prayers at the Ka&#8217;ba. Abu Jahl was sitting with some of his companions. One of them said to the others, &#8220;Who amongst you will bring the abdominal contents (intestines, etc.) of a camel of Bani so and so and put it on the back of Muhammad, when he prostrates?&#8221; The most unfortunate of them got up and brought it. He waited till the Prophet prostrated and then placed it on his back between his shoulders. I was watching but could not do any thing. I wish I had some people with me to hold out against them. They started laughing and falling on one another. Allah&#8217;s Apostle was in prostration and he did not lift his head up till Fatima (Prophet&#8217;s daughter) came and threw that (camel&#8217;s abdominal contents) away from his back. He raised his head and said thrice, &#8220;O Allah! Punish Quraish.&#8221; So it was hard for Abu Jahl and his companions when the Prophet invoked Allah against them as they had a conviction that the prayers and invocations were accepted in this city (Mecca). The Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah! Punish Abu Jahl, &#8216;Utba bin Rabi&#8217;a, Shaiba bin Rabi&#8217;a, Al-Walid bin &#8216;Utba, Umaiya bin Khalaf, and &#8216;Uqba bin Al Mu&#8217;it (and he mentioned the seventh whose name I cannot recall). By Allah in Whose Hands my life is, I saw the dead bodies of those persons who were counted by Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the Qalib (one of the wells) of Badr.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 4, Number 242:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet once spat in his clothes.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 4, Number 243:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;All drinks that produce intoxication are Haram (forbidden to drink).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 4, Number 244:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Hazim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sahl bin Sa&#8217;d As-Sa&#8217;idi, was asked by the people, &#8220;With what was the wound of the Prophet treated? Sahl replied, &#8220;None remains among the people living who knows that better than I. &#8216;Ah used to bring water in his shield and Fatima used to wash the blood off his face. Then straw mat was burnt and the wound was filled with it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 4, Number 245:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Burda:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My father said, &#8220;I came to the Prophet and saw him carrying a Siwak in his hand and cleansing his teeth, saying, &#8216;U&#8217; U&#8217;,&#8221; as if he was retching while the Siwak was in his mouth.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 4, Number 246:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hudhaifa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever the Prophet got up at night, he used to clean his mouth with Siwak.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 4, Number 247:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara &#8216;bin &#8216;Azib:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said to me, &#8220;Whenever you go to bed perform ablution like that for the prayer, lie or your right side and say, &#8220;Allahumma aslamtu wajhi ilaika, wa fauwadtu amri ilaika, wa alja&#8217;tu Zahri ilaika raghbatan wa rahbatan ilaika. La Malja&#8217; wa la manja minka illa ilaika. Allahumma amantu bikitabika-l-ladhi anzalta wa bina-biyika-l ladhi arsalta&#8221; (O Allah! I surrender to You and entrust all my affairs to You and depend upon You for Your Blessings both with hope and fear of You. There is no fleeing from You, and there is no place of protection and safety except with You O Allah! I believe in Your Book (the Qur&#8217;an) which You have revealed and in Your Prophet (Muhammad) whom You have sent). Then if you die on that very night, you will die with faith (i.e. or the religion of Islam). Let the aforesaid words be your last utterance (before sleep).&#8221; I repeated it before the Prophet and when I reached &#8220;Allahumma amantu bikitabika-l-ladhi anzalta (O Allah I believe in Your Book which You have revealed).&#8221; I said, &#8220;Wa-rasulika (and your Apostle).&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;No, (but say): &#8216;Wanabiyika-l-ladhi arsalta (Your Prophet whom You have sent), instead.&#8221;</p>

<h3 align="center">Eclipses</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.018.150"></a>Volume 2, Book 18, Number 150:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were with Allah&#8217;s Apostle when the sun eclipsed. Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up dragging his cloak till he entered the Mosque. He led us in a two-Rakat prayer till the sun (eclipse) had cleared. Then the Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of someone&#8217;s death. So whenever you see these eclipses pray and invoke (Allah) till the eclipse is over.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 151:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Masud:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of the death of someone from the people but they are two signs amongst the signs of Allah. When you see them stand up and pray.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 152:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of the death or life (i.e. birth) of someone but they are two signs amongst the signs of Allah. When you see them offer the prayer.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 153:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The sun eclipsed in the life-time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the day when (his son) Ibrahim died. So the people said that the sun had eclipsed because of the death of Ibrahim. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of the death or life (i.e. birth) of some-one. When you see the eclipse pray and invoke Allah.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 154:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the life-time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) the sun eclipsed, so he led the people in prayer, and stood up and performed a long Qiyam, then bowed for a long while. He stood up again and performed a long Qiyam but this time the period of standing was shorter than the first. He bowed again for a long time but shorter than the first one, then he prostrated and prolonged the prostration. He did the same in the second Raka as he did in the first and then finished the prayer; by then the sun (eclipse) had cleared. He delivered the Khutba (sermon) and after praising and glorifying Allah he said, &#8220;The sun and the moon are two signs against the signs of Allah; they do not eclipse on the death or life of anyone. So when you see the eclipse, remember Allah and say Takbir, pray and give Sadaqa.&#8221; The Prophet then said, &#8220;O followers of Muhammad! By Allah! There is none who has more ghaira (self-respect) than Allah as He has forbidden that His slaves, male or female commit adultery (illegal sexual intercourse). O followers of Muhammad! By Allah! If you knew that which I know you would laugh little and weep much.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 155:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When the sun eclipsed in the life-time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle an announcement was made that a prayer was to be offered in congregation.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 156:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) In the lifetime of the Prophet the sun eclipsed and he went to the Mosque and the people aligned behind him. He said the Takbir (starting the prayer) and prolonged the recitation (from the Quran) and then said Takbir and performed a prolonged bowing; then he (lifted his head and) said, &#8220;Sami allahu liman hamidah&#8221; (Allah heard him who sent his praises to Him). He then did not prostrate but stood up and recited a prolonged recitation which was shorter than the first recitation. He again said Takbir and then bowed a prolonged bowing but shorter than the first one and then said, &#8220;Sami &#8216;a-l-lahu Lyman hamidah Rabbana walak-lhamd, (Allah heard him who sent his praises to Him. O our Sustainer! All the praises are for You)&#8221; and then prostrated and did the same in the second Raka; thus he completed four bowing and four prostrations. The sun (eclipse) had cleared before he finished the prayer. (After the prayer) he stood up, glorified and praised Allah as He deserved and then said, &#8220;The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Allah. They do not eclipse because of the death or the life (i.e. birth) of someone. When you see them make haste for the prayer.&#8221; Narrated Az-Zuhri: I said to &#8216;Ursa, &#8220;When the sun eclipsed at Medina your brother (&#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair) offered only a two-Rakat prayer like that of the morning (Fajr) prayer.&#8221; &#8216;Ursa replied, &#8220;Yes, for he missed the Prophet&#8217;s tradition (concerning this matter).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 157:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) On the day when the sun Khasafat (eclipsed) Allah&#8217;s Apostle prayed; he stood up and said Takbir and recited a prolonged recitation, then he performed a prolonged bowing, then he raised his head and said, &#8220;Sami&#8217;a-l-lahu Lyman Hamidah,&#8221; and then remained standing and recited a prolonged recitation which was shorter than the first. Then he performed a prolonged bowing which was shorter than the first. Then he prostrated and prolonged the prostration and he did the same in the second Raka as in the first and then finished the prayer with Taslim. By that time the sun (eclipse) had cleared He addressed the people and said, &#8220;The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Allah; they do not eclipse (Yakhsifan) because of the death or the life (i.e. birth) of someone. So when you see them make haste for the prayer.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 158:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said: &#8220;The sun and the moon are two signs amongst the signs of Allah and they do not eclipse because of the death of someone but Allah frightens His devotees with them.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 159:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amra bint &#8216;AbdurRahman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Jewess came to ask &#8216;Aisha (the wife of the Prophet) about something. She said to her, &#8220;May Allah give you refuge from the punishment of the grave.&#8221; So &#8216;Aisha &#8216; asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle &#8220;Would the people be punished in their graves?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle after seeking refuge with Allah from the punishment of the grave (and thus replied in the affirmative). Then one day, Allah&#8217;s Apostle rode to go to some place but the sun eclipsed. He returned in the forenoon and passed through the rear of the dwellings (of his wives) and stood for the (eclipse) prayer, and the people stood behind him. He stood up for a long period and then performed a prolonged bowing which was shorter than the first bowing. Then he raised his head and prostrated. Then he stood up (for the second Raka) for a long while but the standing was shorter than that of the first Raka. Then he performed a prolonged bowing which was shorter than the first one. Then he raised his head and prostrated. Then he stood up for a long time but shorter than the first. Then he performed a prolonged bowing but shorter than the first. Then he raised his head and prostrated and finished the prayer and (then delivered the sermon and) said as much as Allah wished. And then he ordered the people to seek refuge with Allah from the punishment of the grave.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 160:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the sun eclipsed in the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and an announcement was made that the prayer was to be held in congregation. The Prophet performed two bowing in one Raka. Then he stood up and performed two bowing in one Raka. Then he sat down and finished the prayer; and by then the (eclipse) had cleared &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;I had never performed such a long prostration.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 161:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sun eclipsed in the life-time of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) . Allah&#8217;s Apostle offered the eclipse prayer and stood for a long period equal to the period in which one could recite Surat-al-Baqara. Then he bowed for a long time and then stood up for a long period which was shorter than that of the first standing, then bowed again for a long time but for a shorter period than the first; then he prostrated twice and then stood up for a long period which was shorter than that of the first standing; then he bowed for a long time which was shorter than the previous one, and then he raised his head and stood up for a long period which was shorter than the first standing, then he bowed for a long time which was shorter than the first bowing, and then prostrated (twice) and finished the prayer. By then, the sun (eclipse) had cleared. The Prophet then said, &#8220;The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Allah. They eclipse neither because of the death of somebody nor because of his life (i.e. birth). So when you see them, remember Allah.&#8221; The people say, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We saw you taking something from your place and then we saw you retreating.&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;I saw Paradise and stretched my hands towards a bunch (of its fruits) and had I taken it, you would have eaten from it as long as the world remains. I also saw the Hell-fire and I had never seen such a horrible sight. I saw that most of the inhabitants were women.&#8221; The people asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Why is it so?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Because of their ungratefulness.&#8221; It was asked whether they are ungrateful to Allah. The Prophet said, &#8220;They are ungrateful to their companions of life (husbands) and ungrateful to good deeds. If you are benevolent to one of them throughout the life and if she sees anything (undesirable) in you, she will say, &#8216;I have never had any good from you.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 162:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Fatima bint Al-Mundhir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Asma&#8217; bint Al Bakr said, &#8220;I came to &#8216;Aisha the wife of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) during the solar eclipse. The people were standing and offering the prayer and she was also praying too. I asked her, &#8216;What has happened to the people?&#8217; She pointed out with her hand towards the sky and said, &#8216;Subhan-Allah&#8217;. I said, &#8216;Is there a sign?&#8217; She pointed out in the affirmative.&#8221; Asma&#8217; further said, &#8220;I too then stood up for the prayer till I fainted and then poured water on my head. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle had finished his prayer, he thanked and praised Allah and said, &#8216;I have seen at this place of mine what I have never seen even Paradise and Hell. No doubt, it has been inspired to me that you will be put to trial in the graves like or nearly like the trial of (Masih) Ad-Dajjal. (I do not know which one of the two Asma&#8217; said.) (The angels) will come to everyone of you and will ask what do you know about this man (i.e. Muhammad). The believer or a firm believer (I do not know which word Asma&#8217; said) will reply, &#8216;He is Muhammad, Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) who came to us with clear evidences and guidance, so we accepted his teachings, believed and followed him.&#8217; The angels will then say to him, &#8216;Sleep peacefully as we knew surely that you were a firm believer.&#8217; The hypocrite or doubtful person (I do not know which word Asma&#8217; said) will say, &#8216;I do not know. I heard the people saying something so I said it (the same).&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 163:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Asma:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amra bint &#8216;AbdurRahman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Jewess came to &#8216;Aisha to ask her about something and then she said, &#8220;May Allah give you refuge from the punishment of the grave.&#8221; So &#8216;Aisha asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8220;Would the people be punished in their graves?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked Allah&#8217;s refuge from the punishment of the grave (indicating an affirmative reply). Then one day Allah&#8217;s Apostle rode (to leave for some place) but the sun eclipsed. He returned on the forenoon and passed through the rear of the dwellings (of his wives) and stood up and started offering the (eclipse) prayer and the people stood behind him. He stood for a long period and then performed a long bowing and then stood straight for a long period which was shorter than that of the first standing, then he performed a prolonged bowing which was shorter than the first bowing, then he raised his head and prostrated for a long time and then stood up (for the second Raka) for a long while, but the standing was shorter than the standing of the first Raka. Then he performed a prolonged bowing which was shorter than that of the first one. He then stood up for a long time but shorter than the first, then again performed a long bowing which was shorter than the first and then prostrated for a shorter while than that of the first prostration. Then he finished the prayer and delivered the sermon and) said what Allah wished; and ordered the people to seek refuge with Allah from the punishment of the grave.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 165:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Masud:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of someone&#8217;s death or life but they are two signs amongst the signs of Allah, so pray whenever you see them.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 166:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">In the lifetime of the Prophet the sun eclipsed and the Prophet (p.b.u.h) stood up to offer the prayer with the people and recited a long recitation, then he performed a prolonged bowing, and then lifted his head and recited a prolonged recitation which was shorter than the first. Then he performed a prolonged bowing which was shorter than the first and then lifted his head and performed two prostrations. He then stood up for the second Raka and offered it like the first. Then he stood up and said, &#8220;The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of someone&#8217;s life or death but they are two signs amongst the signs of Allah which He shows to His worshipers. So whenever you see them, make haste for the prayer.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 167:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sun eclipsed and the Prophet got up, being afraid that it might be the Hour (i.e. Day of Judgment). He went to the Mosque and offered the prayer with the longest Qiyam, bowing and prostration that I had ever seen him doing. Then he said, &#8220;These signs which Allah sends do not occur because of the life or death of somebody, but Allah makes His worshipers afraid by them. So when you see anything thereof, proceed to remember Allah, invoke Him and ask for His forgiveness.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 168:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the day of Ibrahim&#8217;s death, the sun eclipsed and the people said that the eclipse was due to the death of Ibrahim (the son of the Prophet). Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The sun and the moon are two signs amongst the signs of Allah. They do not eclipse because of someone&#8217;s death or life. So when you see them, invoke Allah and pray till the eclipse is clear.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 169:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the life-time of the Prophet the sun eclipsed and then he offered a two Rakat prayer.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 170:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the life-time of the Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) the sun eclipsed and he went out dragging his clothes till he reached the Mosque. The people gathered around him and he led them and offered two Rakat. When the sun (eclipse) cleared, he said, &#8220;The sun and the moon are two signs amongst the signs of Allah; they do not eclipse because of the death of someone, and so when an eclipse occurs, pray and invoke Allah till the eclipse is over.&#8221; It happened that a son of the Prophet called Ibrahim died on that day and the people were talking about that (saying that the eclipse was caused by his death).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 171:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet led us and performed four bowing in two Rakat during the solar eclipse and the first Raka was longer.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 172:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (p.b.u.h) recited (the Quran) aloud during the eclipse prayer and when he had finished the eclipse prayer he said the Takbir and bowed. When he stood straight from bowing he would say &#8220;Sami &#8216;al-l-ahu Lyman hamidah Rabbana walaka-l-hamd.&#8221; And he would again start reciting. In the eclipse prayer there are four bowing and four prostrations in two Rakat. Al-Auza&#8217;i and others said that they had heard Az-Zuhi from &#8216;Ursa from &#8216;Aisha saying, &#8220;In the life-time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle the sun eclipsed, and he made a person to announce: &#8216;Prayer in congregation.&#8217; He led the prayer and performed four bowing and four prostrations in two Rakat.&#8221; Narrated Al-Walid that &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Namir had informed him that he had heard the same. Ibn Shihab heard the same. Az-Zuhrl said, &#8220;I asked (&#8216;Ursa), &#8216;What did your brother &#8216;Abdullah bin AzZubair do? He prayed two Rakat (of the eclipse prayer) like the morning prayer, when he offered the (eclipse) prayer in Median.&#8217; &#8216;Ursa replied that he had missed (i.e. did not pray according to) the Prophet&#8217;s tradition.&#8221; Sulaiman bin Kathir and Sufyan bin Husain narrated from Az-Zuhri that the prayer for the eclipse used to be offered with loud recitation.</p>

<h3 align="center">Prostration During Recital of Qur&#8217;an</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.019.173"></a>Volume 2, Book 19, Number 173:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Masud :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet recited Suratan-Najm (103) at Mecca and prostrated while reciting it and those who were with him did the same except an old man who took a handful of small stones or earth and lifted it to his forehead and said, &#8220;This is sufficient for me.&#8221; Later on, I saw him killed as a non-believer.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 19, Number 174:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On Fridays the Prophet used to recite Alf Lam Mim Tanzil-As-Sajda (in the first Raka) and Hal ata&#8217;alal-lnsani i.e. Suratad-Dahr (LXXVI) (in the second Raka), in the Fajr prayer.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Masud:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet recited Surat-an-Najm (53) and prostrated while reciting it and all the people prostrated and a man amongst the people took a handful of stones or earth and raised it to his face and said, &#8220;This is sufficient for me.&#8221; Later on I saw him killed as a non-believer.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 19, Number 177:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet I prostrated while reciting An-Najm and with him prostrated the Muslims, the pagans, the jinns, and all human beings.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 19, Number 178:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ata&#8217; bin Yasar:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Salma:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I saw Abu Huraira reciting Idha-Sama&#8217; un-Shaqqat and he prostrated during its recitation. I asked Abu Huraira, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I see you prostrating?&#8221; Abu Huraira said, &#8220;Had I not seen the Prophet prostrating, I would not have prostrated.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 19, Number 181:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet recited a Sura that contained the prostration he would prostrate and we would do the same and some of us (because of the heavy rush) could not find a place for prostration.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 19, Number 182:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet recited Surat As-Sajda and we were with him, he would prostrate and we also would prostrate with him and some of us (because of the heavy rush) would not find a place (for our foreheads) to prostrate on.</p>
<hr>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab recited Surat-an-Nahl on a Friday on the pulpit and when he reached the verse of Sajda he got down from the pulpit and prostrated and the people also prostrated. The next Friday &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab recited the same Sura and when he reached the verse of Sajda he said, &#8220;O people! When we recite the verses of Sajda (during the sermon) whoever prostrates does the right thing, yet it is no sin for the one who does not prostrate.&#8221; And &#8216;Umar did not prostrate (that day). Added Ibn &#8216;Umar &#8220;Allah has not made the prostration of recitation compulsory but if we wish we can do it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 19, Number 184:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Rafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I offered the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer behind Abu Huraira and he recited Idhas-Sama&#8217; Un-Shaqqat, and prostrated. I said, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; Abu Huraira said, &#8220;I prostrated behind Abu-l-Qasim and I will do the same till I meet him.&#8221;</p>
<hr>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;The  reward of deeds depends upon the intentions and every person will get the reward according  to what he has intended. So whoever emigrated for worldly benefits or for a woman to  marry, his emigration was for what he emigrated for.&#8221; </font></p>

<p>  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the mother of the faithful believers)  Al-Harith bin Hisham asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! How is the Divine  Inspiration revealed to you?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;Sometimes it is  (revealed) like the ringing of a bell, this form of Inspiration is the hardest of all and  then this state passes &#8216; off after I have grasped what is inspired. Sometimes the Angel  comes in the form of a man and talks to me and I grasp whatever he says.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha  added: Verily I saw the Prophet being inspired Divinely on a very cold day and noticed the  Sweat dropping from his forehead (as the Inspiration was over). </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.001.003"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 1, Number 3: </font></p>
<p>  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the mother of the faithful believers) The  commencement of the Divine Inspiration to Allah&#8217;s Apostle was in the form of good dreams  which came true like bright day light, and then the love of seclusion was bestowed upon  him. He used to go in seclusion in the cave of Hira where he used to worship (Allah alone)  continuously for many days before his desire to see his family. He used to take with him  the journey food for the stay and then come back to (his wife) Khadija to take his food  like-wise again till suddenly the Truth descended upon him while he was in the cave of  Hira. The angel came to him and asked him to read. The Prophet replied, &#8220;I do not  know how to read. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet added, &#8220;The angel caught  me (forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it any more. He then released  me and again asked me to read and I replied, &#8216;I do not know how to read.&#8217; Thereupon he  caught me again and pressed me a second time till I could not bear it any more. He then  released me and again asked me to read but again I replied, &#8216;I do not know how to read (or  what shall I read)?&#8217; Thereupon he caught me for the third time and pressed me, and then  released me and said, &#8216;Read in the name of your Lord, who has created (all that exists)  has created man from a clot. Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous.&#8221; (96.1, 96.2,  96.3) Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned with the Inspiration and with his heart beating  severely. Then he went to Khadija bint Khuwailid and said, &#8220;Cover me! Cover me!&#8221;  They covered him till his fear was over and after that he told her everything that had  happened and said, &#8220;I fear that something may happen to me.&#8221; Khadija replied,  &#8220;Never! By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you. You keep good relations with your  Kith and kin, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guests generously and assist the  deserving calamity-afflicted ones.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Khadija then accompanied him to her cousin  Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Uzza, who, during the PreIslamic Period became a  Christian and used to write the writing with Hebrew letters. He would write from the  Gospel in Hebrew as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost his  eyesight. Khadija said to Waraqa, &#8220;Listen to the story of your nephew, O my  cousin!&#8221; Waraqa asked, &#8220;O my nephew! What have you seen?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle  described whatever he had seen. Waraqa said, &#8220;This is the same one who keeps the  secrets (angel Gabriel) whom Allah had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and could live  up to the time when your people would turn you out.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked,  &#8220;Will they drive me out?&#8221; Waraqa replied in the affirmative and said,  &#8220;Anyone (man) who came with something similar to what you have brought was treated  with hostility; and if I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then  I would support you strongly.&#8221; But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine  Inspiration was also paused for a while. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah Al-Ansari  while talking about the period of pause in revelation reporting the speech of the Prophet  &#8220;While I was walking, all of a sudden I heard a voice from the sky. I looked up and  saw the same angel who had visited me at the cave of Hira&#8217; sitting on a chair between the  sky and the earth. I got afraid of him and came back home and said, &#8216;Wrap me (in  blankets).&#8217; And then Allah revealed the following Holy Verses (of Quran): </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;O you (i.e. Muhammad)! wrapped up in  garments!&#8217; Arise and warn (the people against Allah&#8217;s Punishment),&#8230; up to &#8216;and desert  the idols.&#8217; (74.1-5) After this the revelation started coming strongly, frequently and  regularly.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 1, Number 4: </font></p>
<p>  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Said bin Jubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Abbas in the explanation of the  Statement of Allah. &#8216;Move not your tongue concerning (the Quran) to make haste  therewith.&#8221; (75.16) Said &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to bear the revelation with great  trouble and used to move his lips (quickly) with the Inspiration.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas moved  his lips saying, &#8220;I am moving my lips in front of you as Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to move  his.&#8221; Said moved his lips saying: &#8220;I am moving my lips, as I saw Ibn &#8216;Abbas  moving his.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas added, &#8220;So Allah revealed &#8216;Move not your tongue  concerning (the Qur&#8217;an) to make haste therewith. It is for us to collect it and to give  you (O Muhammad) the ability to recite it (the Qur&#8217;an) (75.16-17) which means that Allah  will make him (the Prophet ) remember the portion of the Qur&#8217;an which was revealed at that  time by heart and recite it. The Statement of Allah: And &#8216;When we have recited it to you  (O Muhammad through Gabriel) then you follow its (Qur&#8217;an) recital&#8217; (75.18) means &#8216;listen  to it and be silent.&#8217; Then it is for Us (Allah) to make It clear to you&#8217; (75.19) means  &#8216;Then it is (for Allah) to make you recite it (and its meaning will be clear by itself  through your tongue). Afterwards, Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to listen to Gabriel whenever he  came and after his departure he used to recite it as Gabriel had recited it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p>  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle was the most generous of  all the people, and he used to reach the peak in generosity in the month of Ramadan when  Gabriel met him. Gabriel used to meet him every night of Ramadan to teach him the Qur&#8217;an.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle was the most generous person, even more generous than the strong  uncontrollable wind (in readiness and haste to do charitable deeds). </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.001.006"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 1, Number 6: </font></p>
<p>  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Sufyan bin Harb informed me that  Heraclius had sent a messenger to him while he had been accompanying a caravan from  Quraish. They were merchants doing business in Sham (Syria, Palestine, Lebanon and  Jordan), at the time when Allah&#8217;s Apostle had truce with Abu Sufyan and Quraish infidels.  So Abu Sufyan and his companions went to Heraclius at Ilya (Jerusalem). Heraclius called  them in the court and he had all the senior Roman dignitaries around him. He called for  his translator who, translating Heraclius&#8217;s question said to them, &#8220;Who amongst you  is closely related to that man who claims to be a Prophet?&#8221; Abu Sufyan replied,  &#8220;I am the nearest relative to him (amongst the group).&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Heraclius said, &#8220;Bring him (Abu  Sufyan) close to me and make his companions stand behind him.&#8221; Abu Sufyan added,  Heraclius told his translator to tell my companions that he wanted to put some questions  to me regarding that man (The Prophet) and that if I told a lie they (my companions)  should contradict me.&#8221; Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;By Allah! Had I not been afraid of my  companions labeling me a liar, I would not have spoken the truth about the Prophet. The  first question he asked me about him was: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;What is his family status amongst you?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I replied, &#8216;He belongs to a good (noble)  family amongst us.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Heraclius further asked, &#8216;Has anybody  amongst you ever claimed the same (i.e. to be a Prophet) before him?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I replied, &#8216;No.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>He said, &#8216;Was anybody amongst his ancestors  a king?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I replied, &#8216;No.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Heraclius asked, &#8216;Do the nobles or the poor  follow him?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I replied, &#8216;It is the poor who follow him.&#8217;  </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>He said, &#8216;Are his followers increasing  decreasing (day by day)?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I replied, &#8216;They are increasing.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>He then asked, &#8216;Does anybody amongst those  who embrace his religion become displeased and renounce the religion afterwards?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I replied, &#8216;No.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Heraclius said, &#8216;Have you ever accused him  of telling lies before his claim (to be a Prophet)?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I replied, &#8216;No. &#8216; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Heraclius said, &#8216;Does he break his  promises?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I replied, &#8216;No. We are at truce with him  but we do not know what he will do in it.&#8217; I could not find opportunity to say anything  against him except that. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Heraclius asked, &#8216;Have you ever had a war  with him?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I replied, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then he said, &#8216;What was the outcome of the  battles?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I replied, &#8216;Sometimes he was victorious and  sometimes we.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Heraclius said, &#8216;What does he order you to  do?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I said, &#8216;He tells us to worship Allah and  Allah alone and not to worship anything along with Him, and to renounce all that our  ancestors had said. He orders us to pray, to speak the truth, to be chaste and to keep  good relations with our Kith and kin.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Heraclius asked the translator to convey to  me the following, I asked you about his family and your reply was that he belonged to a  very noble family. In fact all the Apostles come from noble families amongst their  respective peoples. I questioned you whether anybody else amongst you claimed such a  thing, your reply was in the negative. If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would  have thought that this man was following the previous man&#8217;s statement. Then I asked you  whether anyone of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the negative, and if it had  been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man wanted to take back his  ancestral kingdom. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I further asked whether he was ever accused  of telling lies before he said what he said, and your reply was in the negative. So I  wondered how a person who does not tell a lie about others could ever tell a lie about  Allah. I, then asked you whether the rich people followed him or the poor. You replied  that it was the poor who followed him. And in fact all the Apostle have been followed by  this very class of people. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or  decreasing. You replied that they were increasing, and in fact this is the way of true  faith, till it is complete in all respects. I further asked you whether there was anybody,  who, after embracing his religion, became displeased and discarded his religion. Your  reply was in the negative, and in fact this is (the sign of) true faith, when its delight  enters the hearts and mixes with them completely. I asked you whether he had ever  betrayed. You replied in the negative and likewise the Apostles never betray. Then I asked  you what he ordered you to do. You replied that he ordered you to worship Allah and Allah  alone and not to worship any thing along with Him and forbade you to worship idols and  ordered you to pray, to speak the truth and to be chaste. If what you have said is true,  he will very soon occupy this place underneath my feet and I knew it (from the scriptures)  that he was going to appear but I did not know that he would be from you, and if I could  reach him definitely, I would go immediately to meet him and if I were with him, I would  certainly wash his feet.&#8217; Heraclius then asked for the letter addressed by Allah&#8217;s Apostle  </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>which was delivered by Dihya to the  Governor of Busra, who forwarded it to Heraclius to read. The contents of the letter were  as follows: &#8220;In the name of Allah the Beneficent, the Merciful (This letter is) from  Muhammad the slave of Allah and His Apostle to Heraclius the ruler of Byzantine. Peace be  upon him, who follows the right path. Furthermore I invite you to Islam, and if you become  a Muslim you will be safe, and Allah will double your reward, and if you reject this  invitation of Islam you will be committing a sin by misguiding your Arisiyin (peasants).  (And I recite to you Allah&#8217;s Statement:) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;O people of the scripture! Come to a word  common to you and us that we worship none but Allah and that we associate nothing in  worship with Him, and that none of us shall take others as Lords beside Allah. Then, if  they turn away, say: Bear witness that we are Muslims (those who have surrendered to  Allah).&#8217; (3:64). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Sufyan then added, &#8220;When Heraclius  had finished his speech and had read the letter, there was a great hue and cry in the  Royal Court. So we were turned out of the court. I told my companions that the question of  Ibn-Abi-Kabsha) (the Prophet Muhammad) has become so prominent that even the King of Bani  Al-Asfar (Byzantine) is afraid of him. Then I started to become sure that he (the Prophet)  would be the conqueror in the near future till I embraced Islam (i.e. Allah guided me to  it).&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The sub narrator adds, &#8220;Ibn An-Natur  was the Governor of llya&#8217; (Jerusalem) and Heraclius was the head of the Christians of  Sham. Ibn An-Natur narrates that once while Heraclius was visiting ilya&#8217; (Jerusalem), he  got up in the morning with a sad mood. Some of his priests asked him why he was in that  mood? Heraclius was a foreteller and an astrologer. He replied, &#8216;At night when I looked at  the stars, I saw that the leader of those who practice circumcision had appeared (become  the conqueror). Who are they who practice circumcision?&#8217; The people replied, &#8216;Except the  Jews nobody practices circumcision, so you should not be afraid of them (Jews). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Just Issue orders to kill every Jew  present in the country.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While they were discussing it, a messenger  sent by the king of Ghassan to convey the news of Allah&#8217;s Apostle to Heraclius was brought  in. Having heard the news, he (Heraclius) ordered the people to go and see whether the  messenger of Ghassan was circumcised. The people, after seeing him, told Heraclius that he  was circumcised. Heraclius then asked him about the Arabs. The messenger replied, &#8216;Arabs  also practice circumcision.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(After hearing that) Heraclius remarked  that sovereignty of the &#8216;Arabs had appeared. Heraclius then wrote a letter to his friend  in Rome who was as good as Heraclius in knowledge. Heraclius then left for Homs. (a town  in Syrian and stayed there till he received the reply of his letter from his friend who  agreed with him in his opinion about the emergence of the Prophet and the fact that he was  a Prophet. On that Heraclius invited all the heads of the Byzantines to assemble in his  palace at Homs. When they assembled, he ordered that all the doors of his palace be  closed. Then he came out and said, &#8216;O Byzantines! If success is your desire and if you  seek right guidance and want your empire to remain then give a pledge of allegiance to  this Prophet (i.e. embrace Islam).&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(On hearing the views of Heraclius) the  people ran towards the gates of the palace like onagers but found the doors closed.  Heraclius realized their hatred towards Islam and when he lost the hope of their embracing  Islam, he ordered that they should be brought back in audience. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(When they returned) he said, &#8216;What already  said was just to test the strength of your conviction and I have seen it.&#8217; The people  prostrated before him and became pleased with him, and this was the end of Heraclius&#8217;s  story (in connection with his faith). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle rode a horse and fell down and the right side of his body was injured. On that day he prayed one of the prayers sitting and we also prayed behind him sitting. When the Prophet finished the prayer with Taslim, he said, &#8220;The Imam is to be followed and if he prays standing then pray standing, and bow when he bows, and raise your heads when he raises his head; prostrate when he prostrates; and if he says &#8220;Sami&#8217;a-l-lahu Liman hamida&#8221;, you should say, &#8220;Rabbana wa-laka-l hamd.:</p>

And then he stood up for a long time and then did a prolonged bowing and then stood up straight again and kept on standing for a long time. Then he bowed a long bowing and then stood up straight and then prostrated a prolonged prostration and then lifted his head and went for a prolonged prostration. On completion o the prayer, he said, &#8220;Paradise became s near to me that if I had dared, I would have plucked one of its bunches for you and Hell became so near to me that said, &#8216;O my Lord will I be among those people?&#8217; Then suddenly I saw a woman and a cat was lacerating her with it claws.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 12, Number 719:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 12, Number 720:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet saw expectoration in the direction of the Qibla of the mosque while he was leading the prayer, and scratched it off.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While the Muslims were offering the Fajr prayer, Al lah&#8217;s Apostle suddenly appeared before them by living the curtain of the dwelling place of &#8216;Aisha, looked towards the Muslims who were standing in rows. He smiled with pleasure. Abu Bakr started retreating to join the row on the assumption that the Prophet wanted to come out for the prayer. The Muslims intended to leave the prayer (and were on the verge of being put to trial), but the Prophet beckoned them to complete their prayer and then he let the curtain fall. He died in the last hours of that day.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 12, Number 722:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin Samura:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The People of Kufa complained against Sa&#8217;d to &#8216;Umar and the latter dismissed him and appointed &#8216;Ammar as their chief . They lodged many complaints against Sa&#8217;d and even they alleged that he did not pray properly. &#8216;Umar sent for him and said, &#8220;O Aba Ishaq! These people claim that you do not pray properly.&#8221; Abu Ishaq said, &#8220;By Allah, I used to pray with them a prayer similar to that of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I never reduced anything of it. I used to prolong the first two Rakat of &#8216;Isha prayer and shorten the last two Rakat.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Aba Ishaq, this was what I thought about you.&#8221; And then he sent one or more persons with him to Kufa so as to ask the people about him. So they went there and did not leave any mosque without asking about him. All the people praised him till they came to the mosque of the tribe of Bani &#8216;Abs; one of the men called Usama bin Qatada with a surname of Aba Sa&#8217;da stood up and said, &#8220;As you have put us under an oath; I am bound to tell you that Sa&#8217;d never went himself with the army and never distributed (the war booty) equally and never did justice in legal verdicts.&#8221; (On hearing it) Sa&#8217;d said, &#8220;I pray to Allah for three things: O Allah! If this slave of yours is a liar and got up for showing off, give him a long life, increase his poverty and put him to trials.&#8221; (And so it happened). Later on when that person was asked how he was, he used to reply that he was an old man in trial as the result of Sa&#8217;d&#8217;s curse. &#8216;Abdul Malik, the sub narrator, said that he had seen him afterwards and his eyebrows were over-hanging his eyes owing to old age and he used to tease and assault the small girls in the way.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 12, Number 723:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ubada bin As-Samit:</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 12, Number 724:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle entered the mosque and a person followed him. The man prayed and went to the Prophet and greeted him. The Prophet returned the greeting and said to him, &#8220;Go back and pray, for you have not prayed.&#8221; The man went back prayed in the same way as before, returned and greeted the Prophet who said, &#8220;Go back and pray, for you have not prayed.&#8221; This happened thrice. The man said, &#8220;By Him Who sent you with the Truth, I cannot offer the prayer in a better way than this. Please, teach me how to pray.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;When you stand for Prayer say Takbir and then recite from the Holy Qur&#8217;an (of what you know by heart) and then bow till you feel at ease. Then raise your head and stand up straight, then prostrate till you feel at ease during your prostration, then sit with calmness till you feel at ease (do not hurry) and do the same in all your prayers</p>

I used to prolong the first two Rakat and shorten the last two Rak&#8217;at.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said to Sa&#8217;d &#8220;This was what we thought about you.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Saiyar bin Salama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My father and I went to Abu Barza-al-Aslami to ask him about the stated times for the prayers. He replied, &#8220;The Prophet used to offer the Zuhr prayer when the sun just declined from its highest position at noon; the &#8216;Asr at a time when if a man went to the farthest place in Medina (after praying) he would find the sun still hot (bright). (The sub narrator said: I have forgotten what Abu Barza said about the Maghrib prayer). The Prophet never found any harm in delaying the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer to the first third of the night and he never liked to sleep before it and to talk after it. He used to offer the morning prayer at a time when after finishing it one could recognize the person sitting beside him and used to recite between 60 to 100 verses in one or both the Rakat.&#8221;</p>

If you recite &#8220;Al-Fatiha&#8221; only it is sufficient but if you recite something else in addition, it is better.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet set out with the intention of going to Suq &#8216;Ukaz (market of &#8216;Ukaz) along with some of his companions. At the same time, a barrier was put between the devils and the news of heaven. Fire commenced to be thrown at them. The Devils went to their people, who asked them, &#8220;What is wrong with you?&#8221; They said, &#8220;A barrier has been placed between us and the news of heaven. And fire has been thrown at us.&#8221; They said, &#8220;The thing which has put a barrier between you and the news of heaven must be something which has happened recently. Go eastward and westward and see what has put a barrier between you and the news of heaven.&#8221; Those who went towards Tuhama came across the Prophet at a place called Nakhla and it was on the way to Suq &#8216;Ukaz and the Prophet was offering the Fajr prayer with his companions. When they heard the Qur&#8217;an they listened to it and said, &#8220;By Allah, this is the thing which has put a barrier between us and the news of heaven.&#8221; They went to their people and said, &#8220;O our people; verily we have heard a wonderful recital (Qur&#8217;an) which shows the true path; we believed in it and would not ascribe partners to our Lord.&#8221; Allah revealed the following verses to his Prophet (Sura &#8216;Jinn&#8217;) (72): &#8220;Say: It has been revealed to me.&#8221; And what was revealed to him was the conversation of the Jinns.</p>

I know the identical Suras which the Prophet used to recite in pairs.&#8221; Ibn Mas&#8217;ud then mentioned 20 Mufassal Suras including two Suras from the family of (i.e. those verses which begin with) AL, HA, MIM (which the Prophet used to recite) in each Rak&#8217;a.</p>

He said, &#8220;You will see Allah (your Lord) in the same way. On the Day of Resurrection, people will be gathered and He will order the people to follow what they used to worship. So some of them will follow the sun, some will follow the moon, and some will follow other deities; and only this nation (Muslims) will be left with its hypocrites. Allah will come to them and say, &#8216;I am Your Lord.&#8217; They will say, &#8216;We shall stay in this place till our Lord comes to us and when our Lord will come, we will recognize Him. Then Allah will come to them again and say, &#8216;I am your Lord.&#8217; They will say, &#8216;You are our Lord.&#8217; Allah will call them, and As-Sirat (a bridge) will be laid across Hell and I (Muhammad) shall be the first amongst the Apostles to cross it with my followers. Nobody except the Apostles will then be able to speak and they will be saying then, &#8216;O Allah! Save us. O Allah Save us.&#8217;</p>

Have you seen the thorns of Sa&#8217;dan?&#8221; The people said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;These hooks will be like the thorns of Sa&#8217;dan but nobody except Allah knows their greatness in size and these will entangle the people according to their deeds; some of them will fall and stay in Hell forever; others will receive punishment (torn into small pieces) and will get out of Hell, till when Allah intends mercy on whomever He likes amongst the people of Hell, He will order the angels to take out of Hell those who worshipped none but Him alone. The angels will take them out by recognizing them from the traces of prostrations, for Allah has forbidden the (Hell) fire to eat away those traces. So they will come out of the Fire, it will eat away from the whole of the human body except the marks of the prostrations. At that time they will come out of the Fire as mere skeletons. The Water of Life will be poured on them and as a result they will grow like the seeds growing on the bank of flowing water. Then when Allah had finished from the Judgments amongst his creations, one man will be left between Hell and Paradise and he will be the last man from the people of Hell to enter paradise. He will be facing Hell, and will say, &#8216;O Allah! Turn my face from the fire as its wind has dried me and its steam has burnt me.&#8217; Allah will ask him, &#8220;Will you ask for anything more in case this favor is granted to you?&#8217; He will say, &#8220;No by Your (Honor) Power!&#8221; And he will give to his Lord (Allah) what he will of the pledges and the covenants. Allah will then turn his face from the Fire. When he will face Paradise and will see its charm, he will remain quiet as long as Allah will. He then will say, &#8216;O my Lord! Let me go to the gate of Paradise.&#8217; Allah will ask him, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t you give pledges and make covenants (to the effect) that you would not ask for anything more than what you requested at first?&#8217; He will say, &#8216;O my Lord! Do not make me the most wretched, amongst Your creatures.&#8217; Allah will say, &#8216;If this request is granted, will you then ask for anything else?&#8217; He will say, &#8216;No! By Your Power! I shall not ask for anything else.&#8217; Then he will give to his Lord what He will of the pledges and the covenants. Allah will then let him go to the gate of Paradise. On reaching then and seeing its life, charm, and pleasure, he will remain quiet as long as Allah wills and then will say, &#8216;O my Lord ! Let me enter Paradise.&#8217; Allah will say, May Allah be merciful unto you, O son of Adam! How treacherous you are! Haven&#8217;t you made covenants and given pledges that you will not ask for anything more that what you have been given?&#8217; He will say, &#8216;O my Lord! Do not make me the most wretched amongst Your creatures.&#8217; So Allah will laugh and allow him to enter Paradise and will ask him to request as much as he likes. He will do so till all his desires have been fulfilled . Then Allah will say, &#8216;Request more of such and such things.&#8217; Allah will remind him and when all his desires and wishes; have been fulfilled, Allah will say &#8220;All this is granted to you and a similar amount besides.&#8221; Abu Said Al-Khudri, said to Abu Huraira, &#8216;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah said, &#8216;That is for you and ten times more like it.&#8217; &#8220;Abu Huraira said, &#8220;I do not remember from Allah&#8217;s Apostle except (his saying), &#8216;All this is granted to you and a similar amount besides.&#8221; Abu Sahd said, &#8220;I heard him saying, &#8216;That is for you and ten times more the like of it.&#8221;</p>

I have been shown the Night of &#8220;Qadr&#8221;, but have forgotten its date, but it is in the odd nights of the last ten nights. I saw in my dream that I was prostrating in mud and water.&#8217; In those days the roof of the mosque was made of branches of date-palm trees. At that time the sky was clear and no cloud was visible, but suddenly a cloud came and it rained. The Prophet led us in the prayer and I saw the traces of mud on the forehead and on the nose of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. So it was the confirmation of that dream.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(the clerk of Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba) Once Al-Mughira dictated to me in a letter addressed to Mu&#8217;awiya that the Prophet used to say after every compulsory prayer, &#8220;La ilaha ilallah wahdahu la sharika lahu, lahul-mulku wa-lahul-hamdu, wahuwa ala kulli shai in qadir. Allahumma la mani &#8216;a lima a&#8217;taita, wa la mu&#8217;tiya lima mana&#8217;ta, wa la yanfa&#8217;u dhal-jaddi minka-l-jadd. (None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and He has no partner in Lordship or in worship or in the Names and the Qualities, and for Him is the Kingdom and all the praises are for Him and He is omnipotent. O Allah! Nobody can hold back what you give and nobody can give what You hold back. Hard (efforts by anyone for anything cannot benefit one against Your Will).&#8221; And Al-Hasan said, &#8220;Al-jadd&#8217; means prosperity.&#8221;</p>

When he had finished the prayer with Taslim, he got up hurriedly and went out by crossing the rows of the people to one of the dwellings of his wives. The people got scared at his speed . The Prophet came back and found the people surprised at his haste and said to them, &#8220;I remembered a piece of gold Lying in my house and I did not like it to divert my attention from Allah&#8217;s worship, so I have ordered it to be distributed (in charity).&#8221;</p>

Then he stood up for prayer and I got up too and performed the ablution in the same way and joined him on his left side. He pulled me to the right and prayed as much as Allah will.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While the Prophet was saying something in a gathering, a  Bedouin came and asked him, &#8220;When would the Hour (Doomsday) take place?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle continued his talk, so some people said that Allah&#8217;s Apostle had heard the  question, but did not like what that Bedouin had asked. Some of them said that Alllah&#8217;s  Apostle had not heard it. When the Prophet finished his speech, he said, &#8220;Where is  the questioner, who enquired about the Hour (Doomsday)?&#8221; The Bedouin said, &#8220;I am  here, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; Then the Prophet said, &#8220;When honesty is lost, then  wait for the Hour (Doomsday).&#8221; The Bedouin said, &#8220;How will that be lost?&#8221;  The Prophet said, &#8220;When the power or authority comes in the hands of unfit persons,  then wait for the Hour (Doomsday.)&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the Prophet remained behind us in a journey. He joined  us while we were performing ablution for the prayer which was over-due. We were just  passing wet hands over our feet (and not washing them properly) so the Prophet addressed  us in a loud voice and said twice or thrice: &#8220;Save your heels from the fire.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Amongst the trees, there is a  tree, the leaves of which do not fall and is like a Muslim. Tell me the name of that  tree.&#8221; Everybody started thinking about the trees of the desert areas. And I thought  of the date-palm tree but felt shy to answer the others then asked, &#8220;What is that  tree, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;It is the date-palm tree.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 3, Number 63: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were sitting with the Prophet in the mosque, a man  came riding on a camel. He made his camel kneel down in the mosque, tied its foreleg and  then said: &#8220;Who amongst you is Muhammad?&#8221; At that time the Prophet was sitting  amongst us (his companions) leaning on his arm. We replied, &#8220;This white man reclining  on his arm.&#8221; The an then addressed him, &#8220;O Son of &#8216;Abdul Muttalib.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;I am here to answer your  questions.&#8221; The man said to the Prophet, &#8220;I want to ask you something and will  be hard in questioning. So do not get angry.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Ask whatever  you want.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;I ask you by your Lord, and the Lord of those who were  before you, has Allah sent you as an Apostle to all the mankind?&#8221; The Prophet  replied, &#8220;By Allah, yes.&#8221; The man further said, &#8220;I ask you by Allah. Has  Allah ordered you to offer five prayers in a day and night (24 hours).? He replied,  &#8220;By Allah, Yes.&#8221; The man further said, &#8220;I ask you by Allah! Has Allah  ordered you to observe fasts during this month of the year (i.e. Ramadan)?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;By Allah, Yes.&#8221; The man further said, &#8220;I ask you by Allah. Has  Allah ordered you to take Zakat (obligatory charity) from our rich people and distribute  it amongst our poor people?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;By Allah, yes.&#8221;  Thereupon that man said, &#8220;I have believed in all that with which you have been sent,  and I have been sent by my people as a messenger, and I am Dimam bin Tha&#8217;laba from the  brothers of Bani Sa&#8217;d bin Bakr.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.003.064"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 3, Number 64: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave a letter to a person and ordered  him to go and deliver it to the Governor of Bahrain. (He did so) and the Governor of  Bahrain sent it to Chousroes, who read that letter and then tore it to pieces. (The  sub-narrator (Ibn Shihab) thinks that Ibn Al-Musaiyab said that Allah&#8217;s Apostle invoked  Allah against them (saying), &#8220;May Allah tear them into pieces, and disperse them all  totally.)&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.003.065"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 3, Number 65: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the Prophet wrote a letter or had an idea of writing a  letter. The Prophet was told that they (rulers) would not read letters unless they were  sealed. So the Prophet got a silver ring made with &#8220;Muhammad Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8221;  engraved on it. As if I were just observing its white glitter in the hand of the Prophet </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.003.066"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 3, Number 66: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Waqid Al-Laithi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While Allah&#8217;s Apostle was sitting in the mosque with some  people, three men came. Two of them came in front of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the third one  went away. The two persons kept on standing before Allah&#8217;s Apostle for a while and then  one of them found a place in the circle and sat there while the other sat behind the  gathering, and the third one went away. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle finished his preaching, he  said, &#8220;Shall I tell you about these three persons? One of them be-took himself to  Allah, so Allah took him into His grace and mercy and accommodated him, the second felt  shy from Allah, so Allah sheltered Him in His mercy (and did not punish him), while the  third turned his face from Allah and went away, so Allah turned His face from him  likewise. &#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.003.067"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 3, Number 67: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin Abi Bakra&#8217;s father: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the Prophet was riding his camel and a man was holding  its rein. The Prophet asked, &#8220;What is the day today?&#8221; We kept quiet, thinking  that he might give that day another name. He said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the day of Nahr  (slaughtering of the animals of sacrifice)&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He further  asked, &#8220;Which month is this?&#8221; We again kept quiet, thinking that he might give  it another name. Then he said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the month of Dhul-Hijja?&#8221; We replied,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Verily! Your blood, property and honor are sacred to one  another (i.e. Muslims) like the sanctity of this day of yours, in this month of yours and  in this city of yours. It is incumbent upon those who are present to inform those who are  absent because those who are absent might comprehend (what I have said) better than the  present audience.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 3, Number 68: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Mas&#8217;ud: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet used to take care of us in preaching by  selecting a suitable time, so that we might not get bored. (He abstained from pestering us  with sermons and knowledge all the time). </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.003.069"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 3, Number 69: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Facilitate things to people  (concerning religious matters), and do not make it hard for them and give them good  tidings and do not make them run away (from Islam).&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.003.070"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 3, Number 70: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Wail: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdullah used to give a religious talk to the people on  every Thursday. Once a man said, &#8220;O Aba &#8216;Abdur-Rahman! (By Allah) I wish if you could  preach us daily.&#8221; He replied, &#8220;The only thing which prevents me from doing so,  is that I hate to bore you, and no doubt I take care of you in preaching by selecting a  suitable time just as the Prophet used to do with us, for fear of making us bored.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.003.071"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 3, Number 71: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Muawiya: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;If Allah wants to do  good to a person, He makes him comprehend the religion. I am just a distributor, but the  grant is from Allah. (And remember) that this nation (true Muslims) will keep on following  Allah&#8217;s teachings strictly and they will not be harmed by any one going on a different  path till Allah&#8217;s order (Day of Judgment) is established.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 3, Number 72: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were with the Prophet and a spadix of date-palm tree was  brought to him. On that he said, &#8220;Amongst the trees, there is a tree which resembles  a Muslim.&#8221; I wanted to say that it was the date-palm tree but as I was the youngest  of all (of them) I kept quiet. And then the Prophet said, &#8220;It is the date-palm  tree.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Do not wish to be like anyone  except in two cases. (The first is) A person, whom Allah has given wealth and he spends it  righteously; (the second is) the one whom Allah has given wisdom (the Holy Qur&#8217;an) and he  acts according to it and teaches it to others.&#8221; (Fateh-al-Bari page 177 Vol. 1) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That he differed with Hur bin Qais bin Hisn Al-Fazari  regarding the companion of (the Prophet) Moses. Ibn &#8216;Abbas said that he was Khadir.  Meanwhile, Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b passed by them and Ibn &#8216;Abbas called him, saying &#8220;My friend  (Hur) and I have differed regarding Moses&#8217; companion whom Moses, asked the way to meet.  Have you heard the Prophet mentioning something about him? He said, &#8220;Yes. I heard  Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;While Moses was sitting in the company of some Israelites, a  man came and asked him. &#8220;Do you know anyone who is more learned than you? Moses  replied: &#8220;No.&#8221; So Allah sent the Divine Inspiration to Moses: &#8216;Yes, Our slave  Khadir (is more learned than you.)&#8217; Moses asked (Allah) how to meet him (Khadir). So Allah  made the fish as a sign for him and he was told that when the fish was lost, he should  return (to the place where he had lost it) and there he would meet him (Al-Khadir). So  Moses went on looking for the sign of the fish in the sea. The servant-boy of Moses said  to him: Do you remember when we betook ourselves to the rock, I indeed forgot the fish,  none but Satan made me forget to remember it. On that Moses said: &#8216;That is what we have  been seeking? (18.64) So they went back retracing their foot-steps, and found Khadir.  (And) what happened further to them is narrated in the Holy Qur&#8217;an by Allah. (18.54 up to  18.82) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once I came riding a she-ass and had (just) attained the  age of puberty. Allah&#8217;s Apostle was offering the prayer at Mina. There was no wall in  front of him and I passed in front of some of the row while they were offering their  prayers. There I let the she-ass loose to graze and entered the row, and nobody objected  to it. </font></p>

(and) what happened further  about them is narrated in the Holy Qur&#8217;an by Allah.&#8221; (18.54 up to 18.82) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The example of guidance and  knowledge with which Allah has sent me is like abundant rain falling on the earth, some of  which was fertile soil that absorbed rain water and brought forth vegetation and grass in  abundance. (And) another portion of it was hard and held the rain water and Allah  benefited the people with it and they utilized it for drinking, making their animals drink  from it and for irrigation of the land for cultivation. (And) a portion of it was barren  which could neither hold the water nor bring forth vegetation (then that land gave no  benefits). The first is the example of the person who comprehends Allah&#8217;s religion and  gets benefit (from the knowledge) which Allah has revealed through me (the Prophets and  learns and then teaches others. The last example is that of a person who does not care for  it and does not take Allah&#8217;s guidance revealed through me (He is like that barren  land.)&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;Just now at this place I have seen what I have never  seen before, including Paradise and Hell. No doubt it has been inspired to me that you  will be put to trials in your graves and these trials will be like the trials of  Masiah-ad-Dajjal or nearly like it (the sub narrator is not sure which expression Asma&#8217;  used). You will be asked, &#8216;What do you know about this man (the Prophet Muhammad)?&#8217; Then  the faithful believer (or Asma&#8217; said a similar word) will reply, &#8216;He is Muhammad Allah&#8217;s  Apostle who had come to us with clear evidences and guidance and so we accepted his  teachings and followed him. And he is Muhammad.&#8217; And he will repeat it thrice. Then the  angels will say to him, &#8216;Sleep in peace as we have come to know that you were a faithful  believer.&#8217; On the other hand, a hypocrite or a doubtful person will reply, &#8216;I do not know,  but I heard the people saying something and so I said it.&#8217; (the same). &#8221; </font></p>

(Or) who are the delegates?&#8221; They  replied, &#8220;We are from the tribe of Rabi&#8217;a.&#8221; Then the Prophet said to them,  &#8220;Welcome, O people (or said, &#8220;O delegation (of &#8216;Abdul Qais).&#8221;) Neither will  you have disgrace nor will you regret.&#8221; They said, &#8220;We have come to you from a  distant place and there is the tribe of the infidels of Mudar intervening between you and  us and we cannot come to you except in the sacred month. So please order us to do  something good (religious deeds) and that we may also inform our people whom we have left  behind (at home) and that we may enter Paradise (by acting on them.)&#8221; The Prophet  ordered them to do four things, and forbade them from four things. He ordered them to  believe in Allah Alone, the Honorable the Majestic and said to them, &#8220;Do you know  what is meant by believing in Allah Alone?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle  know better.&#8221; Thereupon the Prophet said, &#8220;(That means to testify that none has  the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is His Apostle, to offer prayers  perfectly, to pay Zakat, to observe fasts during the month of Ramadan, (and) to pay  Al-Khumus (one fifth of the booty to be given in Allah&#8217;s cause).&#8221; Then he forbade  them four things, namely Ad-Dubba.&#8217; Hantam, Muzaffat (and) An-Naqir or Muqaiyar(These were  the names of pots in which alcoholic drinks used to be prepared).

Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8220;How can you keep her as a wife when it has been said (that she is your  foster-sister)?&#8221; Then Uqba divorced her, and she married another man. </font></p>

He used to go one day and  I another day. When I went I used to bring the news of that day regarding the Divine  Inspiration and other things, and when he went, he used to do the same for me. Once my  Ansari friend, in his turn (on returning from the Prophet), knocked violently at my door  and asked if I was there.&#8221; I became horrified and came out to him. He said,  &#8220;Today a great thing has happened.&#8221; I then went to Hafsa and saw her weeping. I  asked her, &#8220;Did Allah&#8217;s Apostle divorce you all?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;I do not  know.&#8221; Then, I entered upon the Prophet and said while standing, &#8220;Have you  divorced your wives?&#8221; The Prophet replied in the negative.

I may not attend the (compulsory congregational) prayer because so and so (the Imam)  prolongs the prayer when he leads us for it. The narrator added: &#8220;I never saw the  Prophet more furious in giving advice than he was on that day. The Prophet said, &#8220;O  people!

On that, the Prophet got angry and his cheeks or his Face became red  and he said, &#8220;You have no concern with it as it has its water container, and its feet  and it will reach water, and eat (the leaves) of trees till its owner finds it.&#8221; The  man then asked about the lost sheep.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Shuraih said, &#8220;When &#8216;Amr bin Said was sending the  troops to Mecca (to fight &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair) I said to him, &#8216;O chief! Allow me to  tell you what the Prophet said on the day following the conquests of Mecca. My ears heard  and my heart comprehended, and I saw him with my own eyes, when he said it. He glorified  and praised Allah and then said, &#8220;Allah and not the people has made Mecca a  sanctuary. So anybody who has belief in Allah and the Last Day (i.e. a Muslim) should  neither shed blood in it nor cut down its trees. If anybody argues that fighting is  allowed in Mecca as Allah&#8217;s Apostle did fight (in Mecca), tell him that Allah gave  permission to His Apostle, but He did not give it to you. The Prophet added: Allah allowed  me only for a few hours on that day (of the conquest) and today (now) its sanctity is the  same (valid) as it was before. So it is incumbent upon those who are present to convey it  (this information) to those who are absent.&#8221; Abu- Shuraih was asked, &#8220;What did  &#8216;Amr reply?&#8221; He said &#8216;Amr said, &#8220;O Abu Shuraih! I know better than you (in this  respect). Mecca does not give protection to one who disobeys (Allah) or runs after  committing murder, or theft (and takes refuge in Mecca). </font></p>

It is incumbent on those who are present to inform those who are absent.&#8221; (Muhammad  the Subnarrator used to say, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle told the truth.&#8221;) The Prophet  repeated twice: &#8220;No doubt!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the year of the Conquest of Mecca, the tribe of Khuza&#8217;a  killed a man from the tribe of Bani Laith in revenge for a killed person, belonging to  them. They informed the Prophet about it. So he rode his Rahila (she-camel for riding) and  addressed the people saying, &#8220;Allah held back the killing from Mecca. (The  sub-narrator is in doubt whether the Prophet said &#8220;elephant or killing,&#8221; as the  Arabic words standing for these words have great similarity in shape), but He (Allah) let  His Apostle and the believers over power the infidels of Mecca. Beware! (Mecca is a  sanctuary) Verily! Fighting in Mecca was not permitted for anyone before me nor will it be  permitted for anyone after me. It (war) in it was made legal for me for few hours or so on  that day. No doubt it is at this moment a sanctuary, it is not allowed to uproot its  thorny shrubs or to uproot its trees or to pick up its Luqatt (fallen things) except by a  person who will look for its owner (announce it publicly). And if somebody is killed, then  his closest relative has the right to choose one of the two&#8211; the blood money (Diyya) or  retaliation having the killer killed. In the meantime a man from Yemen came and said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Get that written for me.&#8221; The Prophet ordered his companions  to write that for him. Then a man from Quraish said, &#8220;Except Al-Iqhkhir (a type of  grass that has good smell) O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, as we use it in our houses and graves.&#8221;  The Prophet said, &#8220;Except Al-Idhkhiri.e. Al-Idhkhir is allowed to be plucked.&#8221; </font></p>

On that the Prophet said to them,  &#8216;Go away (and leave me alone). It is not right that you should quarrel in front of  me.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas came out saying, &#8220;It was most unfortunate (a great disaster)  that Allah&#8217;s Apostle was prevented from writing that statement for them because of their  disagreement and noise. (Note: It is apparent from this Hadith that Ibn &#8216;Abbes had  witnessed the event and came out saying this statement. The truth is not so, for Ibn  &#8216;Abbas used to say this statement on narrating the Hadith and he had not witnessed the  event personally. See Fath Al-Bari Vol. 1, p.220 footnote.)

Later on he got up at night and then asked whether the  boy (or he used a similar word) had slept? Then he got up for the prayer and I stood up by  his left side but he made me stand to his right and offered five Rakat followed by two  more Rakat. Then he slept and I heard him snoring and then (after a while) he left for the  (Fajr) prayer. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Once the Prophet Moses stood up and  addressed Bani Israel. He was asked, &#8220;Who is the most learned man amongst the people.  He said, &#8220;I am the most learned.&#8221; Allah admonished Moses as he did not attribute  absolute knowledge to Him (Allah). So Allah inspired to him &#8220;At the junction of the  two seas there is a slave amongst my slaves who is more learned than you.&#8221; Moses  said, &#8220;O my Lord! How can I meet him?&#8221; Allah said: Take a fish in a large basket  (and proceed) and you will find him at the place where you will lose the fish. So Moses  set out along with his (servant) boy, Yusha&#8217; bin Nuin and carried a fish in a large basket  till they reached a rock, where they laid their heads (i.e. lay down) and slept. The fish  came out of the basket and it took its way into the sea as in a tunnel. So it was an  amazing thing for both Moses and his (servant) boy. They proceeded for the rest of that  night and the following day. When the day broke, Moses said to his (servant) boy:  &#8220;Bring us our early meal. No doubt, we have suffered much fatigue in this  journey.&#8221; Moses did not get tired till he passed the place about which he was told.  There the (servant) boy told Moses, &#8220;Do you remember when we betook ourselves to the  rock, I indeed forgot the fish.&#8221; Moses remarked, &#8220;That is what we have been  seeking. So they went back retracing their foot-steps, till they reached the rock. There  they saw a man covered with a garment (or covering himself with his own garment). Moses  greeted him. Al-Khadir replied saying, &#8220;How do people greet each other in your  land?&#8221; Moses said, &#8220;I am Moses.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;The Moses of Bani  Israel?&#8221; Moses replied in the affirmative and added, &#8220;May I follow you so that  you teach me of that knowledge which you have been taught.&#8221; Al-Khadir replied,  &#8220;Verily! You will not be able to remain patient with me, O Moses! I have some of the  knowledge of Allah which He has taught me and which you do not know, while you have some  knowledge which Allah has taught you which I do not know.&#8221; Moses said, &#8220;Allah  willing, you will find me patient and I will not disobey you in aught. So both of them set  out walking along the sea-shore, as they did not have a boat. In the meantime a boat  passed by them and they requested the crew of the boat to take them on board. The crew  recognized Al-Khadir and took them on board without fare. Then a sparrow came and stood on  the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once or twice in the sea. Al-Khadir said: &#8220;O  Moses! My knowledge and your knowledge have not decreased Allah&#8217;s knowledge except as much  as this sparrow has decreased the water of the sea with its beak.&#8221; Al-Khadir went to  one of the planks of the boat and plucked it out. Moses said, &#8220;These people gave us a  free lift but you have broken their boat and scuttled it so as to drown its people.&#8221;  Al-Khadir replied, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you that you will not be able to remain patient  with me.&#8221; Moses said, &#8220;Call me not to account for what I forgot.&#8221; The first  (excuse) of Moses was that he had forgotten. Then they proceeded further and found a boy  playing with other boys. Al-Khadir took hold of the boy&#8217;s head from the top and plucked it  out with his hands (i.e. killed him). Moses said, &#8220;Have you killed an innocent soul  who has killed none.&#8221; Al-Kha,dir replied, &#8220;Did I not tell you that you cannot  remain patient with me?&#8221; Then they both proceeded till when they came to the people  of a town, they asked them for food, but they refused to entertain them. Then they found  there a wall on the point of collapsing. Al-Khadir repaired it with his own hands. Moses  said, &#8220;If you had wished, surely you could have taken wages for it.&#8221; Al-Khadir  replied, &#8220;This is the parting between you and me.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;May  Allah be Merciful to Moses! Would that he could have been more patient to learn more about  his story with Al-Khadir. &#8221; </font></p>

I got my head shaved before slaughtering the animal.&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Do  the slaughtering (now) and there is no harm.&#8221; So on that day, when the Prophet was  asked about anything as regards the ceremonies of Hajj performed before or after its due  time his reply was, &#8220;Do it (now) and there is no harm.&#8221; </font></p>

Some of them  said to the others: Ask him (the Prophet) about the spirit. Some of them said that they  should not ask him that question as he might give a reply which would displease them. But  some of them insisted on asking, and so one of them stood up and asked, &#8220;O  Aba-l-Qasim ! What is the spirit?&#8221; The Prophet remained quiet. I thought he was being  inspired Divinely. So I stayed till that state of the Prophet (while being inspired) was  over. The Prophet then said, &#8220;And they ask you (O Muhammad) concerning the spirit  &#8211;Say: The spirit &#8212; its knowledge is with my Lord. And of knowledge you (mankind) have  been given only a little).&#8221; (17.85) </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Mu&#8217;adh bin Jabal.&#8221; Mu&#8217;adh replied,  &#8220;Labbaik and Sa&#8217;daik. O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; Again the Prophet said, &#8220;O  Mu&#8217;adh!&#8221; Mu&#8217;adh said thrice, &#8220;Labbaik and Sa&#8217;daik, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;There is none who testifies sincerely that none has the right  to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is his Apostle, except that Allah, will save him  from the Hell-fire.&#8221; Mu&#8217;adh said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle ! Should I not inform the  people about it so that they may have glad tidings?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;When the  people hear about it, they will solely depend on it.&#8221; Then Mu&#8217;adh narrated the  above-mentioned Hadith just before his death, being afraid of committing sin (by not  telling the knowledge). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 3, Number 131: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I was informed that the Prophet had said to Mu&#8217;adh,  &#8220;Whosoever will meet Allah without associating anything in worship with Him will go  to Paradise.&#8221; Mu&#8217;adh asked the Prophet, &#8220;Should I not inform the people of this  good news?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;No, I am afraid, lest they should depend upon  it (absolutely).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 3, Number 132: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Um Salama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Um-Sulaim came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;Verily,  Allah is not shy of (telling you) the truth. Is it necessary for a woman to take a bath  after she has a wet dream (nocturnal sexual discharge?) The Prophet replied, &#8220;Yes, if  she notices a discharge.&#8221; Um Salama, then covered her face and asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! Does a woman get a discharge?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes, let your right hand be  in dust (An Arabic expression you say to a person when you contradict his statement  meaning &#8220;you will not achieve goodness&#8221;), and that is why the son resembles his  mother.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 3, Number 133: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Amongst the trees there is  a tree, the leaves of which do not fall and is like a Muslim, tell me the name of that  tree.&#8221; Everybody started thinking about the trees of the desert areas and I thought  of the date-palm tree but felt shy (to answer). The others asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  inform us of it.&#8221; He replied, &#8220;it is the date-palm tree.&#8221; I told my father  what had come to my mind and on that he said, &#8220;Had you said it I would have preferred  it to such and such a thing that I might possess.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ali: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I used to get the emotional urethral discharge frequently  so I requested Al-Miqdad to ask the Prophet about it. Al-Miqdad asked him and he replied,  &#8220;One has to perform ablution (after it).&#8221; (See Hadith No. 269). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Nafi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar said: &#8220;A man got up in the mosque  and said: O Allah&#8217;s Apostle &#8216;At which place you order us that we should assume the Ihram?&#8217;  Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8216;The residents of Medina should assure the Ihram from  Dhil-Hulaifa, the people of Syria from Al-Ju,hfa and the people of Najd from Qarn.&#8221;  Ibn &#8216;Umar further said, &#8220;The people consider that Allah&#8217;s Apostle had also said, &#8216;The  residents of Yemen should assume Ihram from Yalamlam.&#8217; &#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar used to say,  &#8220;I do not: remember whether Allah&#8217;s Apostle had said the last statement or not?&#8221;  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 3, Number 136: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man asked the Prophet : &#8220;What (kinds of clothes)  should a Muhrim (a Muslim intending to perform &#8216;Umra or Hajj) wear? He replied, &#8220;He  should not wear a shirt, a turban, trousers, a head cloak or garment scented with saffron  or Wars (kinds of perfumes). And if he has n slippers, then he can use Khuffs (leather  socks) but the socks should be cut short so as to make the ankles bare.&#8221; (See Hadith  No. 615, Vol. 2). </font></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 13:</p>
<h3 align="center">Friday Prayer</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.013.001"></a>Volume 2, Book 13, Number 1:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) saying, &#8220;We (Muslims) are the last (to come) but (will be) the foremost on the Day of Resurrection though the former nations were given the Holy Scriptures before us. And this was their day (Friday) the celebration of which was made compulsory for them but they differed about it. So Allah gave us the guidance for it (Friday) and all the other people are behind us in this respect: the Jews&#8217; (holy day is) tomorrow (i.e. Saturday) and the Christians&#8217; (is) the day after tomorrow (i.e. Sunday).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 13, Number 2:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;Anyone of you attending the Friday (prayers) should take a bath.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 13, Number 3:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While Umar bin Al-Khattab was standing and delivering the sermon on a Friday, one of the companions of the Prophet, who was one of the foremost Muhajirs (emigrants) came. &#8216;Umar said to him, &#8220;What is the time now?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I was busy and could not go back to my house till I heard the Adhan. I did not perform more than the ablution.&#8221; Thereupon &#8216;Umar said to him, &#8220;Did you perform only the ablution although you know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) used to order us to take a bath (on Fridays)?&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 13, Number 4:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;The taking of a bath on Friday is compulsory for every male (Muslim) who has attained the age of puberty.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 13, Number 5:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I testify that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The taking of a bath on Friday is compulsory for every male Muslim who has attained the age of puberty and (also) the cleaning of his teeth with Siwak, and the using of perfume if it is available.&#8221; Amr (a sub-narrator) said, &#8220;I confirm that the taking of a bath is compulsory, but as for the Siwak and the using of perfume, Allah knows better whether it is obligatory or not, but according to the Hadith it is as above.&#8221;)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 13, Number 6:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;Any person who takes a bath on Friday like the bath of Janaba and then goes for the prayer (in the first hour i.e. early), it is as if he had sacrificed a camel (in Allah&#8217;s cause); and whoever goes in the second hour it is as if he had sacrificed a cow; and whoever goes in the third hour, then it is as if he had sacrificed a horned ram; and if one goes in the fourth hour, then it is as if he had sacrificed a hen; and whoever goes in the fifth hour then it is as if he had offered an egg. When the Imam comes out (i.e. starts delivering the Khutba), the angels present themselves to listen to the Khutba.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 13, Number 7:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While &#8216;Umar (bin Al-Khattab) was delivering the Khutba on a Friday, a man entered (the mosque). &#8216;Umar asked him, &#8220;What has detained you from the prayer?&#8221; The man said, &#8220;It was only that when I heard the Adhan I performed ablution (for the prayer).&#8221; On that &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Did you not hear the Prophet saying: &#8216;Anyone of you going out for the Jumua prayer should take a bath&#8217;?&#8221;.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 13, Number 8:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salman-Al-Farsi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;Whoever takes a bath on Friday, purifies himself as much as he can, then uses his (hair) oil or perfumes himself with the scent of his house, then proceeds (for the Jumua prayer) and does not separate two persons sitting together (in the mosque), then prays as much as (Allah has) written for him and then remains silent while the Imam is delivering the Khutba, his sins in-between the present and the last Friday would be forgiven.&#8221;</p>
<hr>

But the people disliked it. Ibn Abbas said, &#8220;It was done by one who was much better than I (i.e. the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ). No doubt, the Jumua prayer is compulsory but I dislike to put you to task by bringing you out walking in mud and slush.&#8221;</p>

They asked him about it and he said, &#8220;By Allah, I know of what wood the pulpit was made, and no doubt I saw it on thy very first day when Allah&#8217;s Apostle I took his seat on it. Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent for such and such an Ansari woman (and Sahl mentioned her name) and said to her, &#8216;Order your slave-carpenter to prepare for me some pieces of wood (i.e. pulpit) on which I may sit at the time of addressing the people.&#8217; So she ordered her slave-carpenter and he made it from the tamarisk of the forest and brought it (to the woman). The woman sent that (pulpit) to Allah&#8217;s Apostle who ordered it to be placed here. Then I saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle praying on it and then bowed on it. Then he stepped back, got down and prostrated on the ground near the foot of the pulpit and again ascended the pulpit. After finishing the prayer he faced the people and said, &#8216;I have done this so that you may follow me and learn the way I pray.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

Later he got the news of his being admonished by those whom he had ignored. So he glorified and praised Allah and said, &#8220;Amma ba&#8217;du. By Allah, I may give to a man and ignore another, although the one whom I ignore is more beloved to me than the one whom I give. But I give to some people as I feel that they have no patience and no contentment in their hearts and I leave those who are patient and self-contented with the goodness and wealth which Allah has put into their hearts and &#8216;Amr bin Taghlib is one of them.&#8221; Amr added, By Allah!

The next morning the people spoke about it and so more people gathered and prayed with him (in the second night). They circulated the news in the morning, and so, on the third night the number of people increased greatly. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) came out and they prayed behind him. On the fourth night the mosque was overwhelmed by the people till it could not accommodate them. Allah&#8217;s Apostle came out only for the Fajr prayer and when he finished the prayer, he faced the people and recited &#8220;Tashah-hud&#8221; (I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is His Apostle), and then said, &#8220;Amma ba&#8217;du.

Come to me.&#8221; So the people came and gathered around him and he then said, &#8220;Amma ba&#8217;du.&#8221; &#8220;From now onward the Ansar will decrease and other people will increase. So anybody who becomes a ruler of the followers of Muhammad and has the power to harm or benefit people then he should accept the good from the benevolent amongst them (Ansar) and overlook the faults of their wrong-doers.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">While the Prophet was delivering the Khutba on a Friday, a man stood up and said, &#8220;O, Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The livestock and the sheep are dying, so pray to Allah for rain.&#8221; So he (the Prophet) raised both his hands and invoked Allah (for it).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 13, Number 55:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once in the lifetime of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) the people were afflicted with drought (famine). While the Prophet was delivering the Khutba on a Friday, a Bedouin stood up and said, &#8220;O, Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Our possessions are being destroyed and the children are hungry; Please invoke Allah (for rain)&#8221;. So the Prophet raised his hands. At that time there was not a trace of cloud in the sky. By Him in Whose Hands my soul is as soon as he lowered his hands, clouds gathered like mountains, and before he got down from the pulpit, I saw the rain falling on the beard of the Prophet. It rained that day, the next day, the third day, the fourth day till the next Friday. The same Bedouin or another man stood up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The houses have collapsed, our possessions and livestock have been drowned; Please invoke Allah (to protect us)&#8221;. So the Prophet I raised both his hands and said, &#8220;O Allah! Round about us and not on us&#8221;. So, in whatever direction he pointed with his hands, the clouds dispersed and cleared away, and Medina&#8217;s (sky) became clear as a hole in between the clouds. The valley of Qanat remained flooded, for one month, none came from outside but talked about the abundant rain.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 13, Number 56:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;When the Imam is delivering the Khutba, and you ask your companion to keep quiet and listen, then no doubt you have done an evil act.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 13, Number 57:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) talked about Friday and said, &#8220;There is an hour (opportune time) on Friday and if a Muslim gets it while praying and asks something from Allah, then Allah will definitely meet his demand.&#8221; And he (the Prophet) pointed out the shortness of that time with his hands.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 13, Number 58:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While we were praying (Jumua Khutba &amp; prayer) with the Prophet (p.b.u.h), some camels loaded with food, arrived (from Sham.~ The people diverted their attention towards the camels (and left the mosque), and only twelve persons remained with the Prophet. So this verse was revealed: &#8220;But when they see Some bargain or some amusement, They disperse headlong to it, And leave you standing.&#8221; (62.11)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 13, Number 59:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to pray two Rakat before the Zuhr prayer and two Rakat after it. He also used to pray two Rakat after the Maghrib prayer in his house, and two Rakat after the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer. He never prayed after Jumua prayer till he departed (from the Mosque), and then he would pray two Rakat at home.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 13, Number 60:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sahl bin Sad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a woman amongst us who had a farm and she used to sow Silq (a kind of vegetable) on the edges of streams in her farm. On Fridays she used to pull out the Silq from its roots and put the roots in a utensil. Then she would put a handful of powdered barley over it and cook it. The roots of the Silq were a substitute for meat. After finishing the Jumua prayer we used to greet her and she would give us that food which we would eat with our hands, and because of that meal, we used to look forward to Friday.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet entered the Ka&#8217;ba along with Usama bin Zaid,  &#8216;Uthman bin Talha and Bilal and remained there for a long time. When they came out, I was  the first man to enter the Ka&#8217;ba. I asked Bilal &#8220;Where did the Prophet pray?&#8221;  Bilal replied, &#8220;Between the two front Pillars.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle entered the  Ka&#8217;ba along with Usama bin Zaid, Bilal and &#8216;Uthman bin Talha Al-Hajabi and closed the door  and stayed there for some time. I asked Bilal when he came out, &#8216;What did the Prophet do?&#8217;  He replied, &#8216;He offered prayer with one pillar to his left and one to his right and three  behind.&#8217; In those days the Ka&#8217;ba was supported by six pillars.&#8221; Malik said:  &#8220;There were two pillars on his (the Prophet&#8217;s) right side.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Nafi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;The Prophet used to make his she-camel sit across and  he would pray facing it (as a Sutra).&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What would the Prophet do if  the she-camel was provoked and moved?&#8221; He said, &#8220;He would take its camel-saddle  and put it in front of him and pray facing its back part (as a Sutra). And Ibn &#8216;Umar used  to do the same.&#8221; (This indicates that one should not pray except behind a Sutra). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Do you make us (women) equal to dogs and donkeys? While I  used to lie in my bed, the Prophet would come and pray facing the middle of the bed. I  used to consider it not good to stand in front of him in his prayers. So I used to slip  away slowly and quietly from the foot of the bed till I got out of my guilt. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Salih As-Samman: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I saw Abu Said Al-Khudri praying on a Friday, behind  something which acted as a Sutra. A young man from Bani Abi Mu&#8217;ait, wanted to pass in  front of him, but Abu Said repulsed him with a push on his chest. Finding no alternative  he again tried to pass but Abu Said pushed him with a greater force. The young man abused  Abu Said and went to Marwan and lodged a complaint against Abu Said and Abu Said followed  the young man to Marwan who asked him, &#8220;O Abu Said! What has happened between you and  the son of your brother?&#8221; Abu Sa&#8217;id said to him, &#8220;I heard the Prophet saying,  &#8216;If anybody amongst you is praying behind something as a Sutra and somebody tries to pass  in front of him, then he should repulse him and if he refuses, he should use force against  him for he is a satan.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that Zaid bin Khalid sent him to Abi Juhaim to ask him what  he had heard from Allah&#8217;s Apostle about a person passing in front of another person who  was praying. Abu Juhaim replied, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;If the person who passes in  front of another person in prayer knew the magnitude of his sin he would prefer to wait  for 40 (days, months or years) rather than to pass in front of him.&#8221; Abu An-Nadr  said, &#8220;I do not remember exactly whether he said 40 days, months or years.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud said, &#8220;While Allah&#8217;s Apostle was  praying beside the Ka&#8217;ba, there were some Quraish people sitting in a gathering. One of  them said, &#8216;Don&#8217;t you see this (who does deeds just to show off)? Who amongst you can go  and bring the dung, blood and the abdominal contents (intestines, etc). of the slaughtered  camels of the family of so and so and then wait till he prostrates and put that in between  his shoulders?&#8217; The most unfortunate amongst them (&#8216;Uqba bin Abi Mu&#8217;ait) went (and brought  them) and when Allah&#8217;s Apostle prostrated, he put them between his shoulders. The Prophet  remained in prostration and they laughed so much so that they fell on each other. A  passerby went to Fatima, who was a young girl in those days. She came running and the  Prophet was still in prostration. She removed them and cursed upon the Quraish on their  faces. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle completed his prayer, he said, &#8216;O Allah! Take revenge on  Quraish.&#8217; He said so thrice and added, &#8216;O Allah! take revenge on &#8216;Amr bin Hisham, &#8216;Utba  bin Rabia, Shaiba bin Rabi&#8217;a, Al-Walid bin&#8217;Utba, Umaiya bin Khalaf, &#8216;Uqba bin Abi Mu&#8217;ait  and &#8216;Umar a bin Al-Walid.&#8221; Abdullah added, &#8220;By Allah! I saw all of them dead in  the battle field on the day of Badr and they were dragged and thrown in the Qalib (a well)  at Badr: Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8216;Allah&#8217;s curse has descended upon the people of the  Qalib (well). </font></p>

<h3 align="center">The Two Festivals (Eids)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.015.069"></a>Volume 2, Book 15, Number 69:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar bought a silk cloak from the market, took it to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Take it and adorn yourself with it during the &#8216;Id and when the delegations visit you.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) replied, &#8220;This dress is for those who have no share (in the Hereafter).&#8221; After a long period Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) sent to Umar a cloak of silk brocade. Umar came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) with the cloak and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You said that this dress was for those who had no share (in the Hereafter); yet you have sent me this cloak.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to him, &#8220;Sell it and fulfill your needs by it.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 70:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) came to my house while two girls were singing beside me the songs of Buath (a story about the war between the two tribes of the Ansar, the Khazraj and the Aus, before Islam). The Prophet (p.b.u.h) lay down and turned his face to the other side. Then Abu Bakr came and spoke to me harshly saying, &#8220;Musical instruments of Satan near the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) turned his face towards him and said, &#8220;Leave them.&#8221; When Abu Bakr became inattentive, I signalled to those girls to go out and they left. It was the day of &#8216;Id, and the Black people were playing with shields and spears; so either I requested the Prophet (p.b.u.h) or he asked me whether I would like to see the display. I replied in the affirmative. Then the Prophet (p.b.u.h) made me stand behind him and my cheek was touching his cheek and he was saying, &#8220;Carry on! O Bani Arfida,&#8221; till I got tired. The Prophet (p.b.u.h) asked me, &#8220;Are you satisfied (Is that sufficient for you)?&#8221; I replied in the affirmative and he told me to leave.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 71:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard the Prophet (p.b.u.h) delivering a Khutba saying, &#8220;The first thing to be done on this day (first day of &#8216;Id ul Adha) is to pray; and after returning from the prayer we slaughter our sacrifices (in the name of Allah) and whoever does so, he acted according to our Sunna (traditions).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 72:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr came to my house while two small Ansari girls were singing beside me the stories of the Ansar concerning the Day of Buath. And they were not singers. Abu Bakr said protestingly, &#8220;Musical instruments of Satan in the house of Allah&#8217;s Apostle !&#8221; It happened on the &#8216;Id day and Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! There is an &#8216;Id for every nation and this is our &#8216;Id.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 73:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik,:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle never proceeded (for the prayer) on the Day of &#8216;Id-ul-Fitr unless he had eaten some dates. Anas also narrated: The Prophet used to eat odd number of dates.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 74:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever slaughtered (his sacrifice) before the &#8216;Id prayer, should slaughter again.&#8221; A man stood up and said, &#8220;This is the day on which one has desire for meat,&#8221; and he mentioned something about his neighbors. It seemed that the Prophet I believed him. Then the same man added, &#8220;I have a young she-goat which is dearer to me than the meat of two sheep.&#8221; The Prophet permitted him to slaughter it as a sacrifice. I do not know whether that permission was valid only for him or for others as well.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 75:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet delivered the Khutba after offering the prayer on the Day of Nahr and said, &#8220;Whoever offers the prayer like us and slaughters like us then his Nusuk (sacrifice) will be accepted by Allah. And whoever slaughters his sacrifice before the &#8216;Id prayer then he has not done the sacrifice.&#8221; Abi Burda bin Niyar, the uncle of Al-Bara&#8217; said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have slaughtered my sheep before the &#8216;Id prayer and I thought today as a day of eating and drinking (not alcoholic drinks), and I liked that my sheep should be the first to be slaughtered in my house. So slaughtered my sheep and took my food before coming for the prayer.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;The sheep which you have slaughtered is just mutton (not a Nusuk).&#8221; He (Abu Burda) said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have a young she-goat which is dearer to me than two sheep. Will that be sufficient as a Nusuk on my behalf? &#8220;The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;Yes, it will be sufficient for you but it will not be sufficient (as a Nusuk) for anyone else after you.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 76:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to proceed to the Musalla on the days of Id-ul-Fitr and Id-ul-Adha; the first thing to begin with was the prayer and after that he would stand in front of the people and the people would keep sitting in their rows. Then he would preach to them, advise them and give them orders, (i.e. Khutba). And after that if he wished to send an army for an expedition, he would do so; or if he wanted to give and order, he would do so, and then depart. The people followed this tradition till I went out with Marwan, the Governor of Medina, for the prayer of Id-ul-Adha or Id-ul-Fitr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When we reached the Musalla, there was a pulpit made by Kathir bin As-Salt. Marwan wanted to get up on that pulpit before the prayer. I got hold of his clothes but he pulled them and ascended the pulpit and delivered the Khutba before the prayer. I said to him, &#8220;By Allah, you have changed (the Prophet&#8217;s tradition).&#8221; He replied, &#8220;O Abu Sa&#8217;id! Gone is that which you know.&#8221; I said, &#8220;By Allah! What I know is better than what I do not know.&#8221; Marwan said, &#8220;People do not sit to listen to our Khutba after the prayer, so I delivered the Khutba before the prayer.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 77:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to offer the prayer of &#8216;Id-ul-Adha and &#8216;Id-ul-Fitr and then deliver the Khutba after the prayer.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 78:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Juraij:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ata&#8217; said, &#8220;Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8216;The Prophet went out on the Day of &#8216;Id-ul-Fitr and offered the prayer before delivering the Khutba, Ata told me that during the early days of IbnAz-Zubair, Ibn Abbas had sent a message to him telling him that the Adhan for the &#8216;Id Prayer was never pronounced (in the life time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle) and the Khutba used to be delivered after the prayer. Ata told me that Ibn Abbas and Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah, had said, ú- where was no Adhan for the prayer of &#8216;7d-ul-Fitr and &#8216;Id-ul-Aqha.&#8221; &#8216;At a&#8217; said, &#8220;I heard Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah saying, &#8216;The Prophet stood up and started with the prayer, and after it he delivered the Khutba. When the Prophet of Allah (p.b.u.h) finished (the Khutba), he went to the women and preached to them, while he was leaning on Bilal&#8217;s hand. Bilal was spreading his garment and the ladies were putting alms in it.&#8217; &#8221; I said to Ata, &#8220;Do you think it incumbent upon an Imam to go to the women and preach to them after finishing the prayer and Khutba?&#8221; &#8216;Ata&#8217; said, &#8220;No doubt it is incumbent on Imams to do so, and why should they not do so?&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 79:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I offered the &#8216;Id prayer with Allah&#8217;s Apostle, Abu Bakr, Umar and &#8216;Uthman and all of them offered the prayer before delivering the Khutba.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 80:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle, Abu Bakr and Umar! used to offer the two &#8216;Id prayers before delivering the Khutba.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 81:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet offered a two Rakat prayer on the Day of Id ul Fitr and he did not pray before or after it. Then he went towards women along with Bilal and ordered them to pay alms and so they started giving their earrings and necklaces (in charity).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 82:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;The first thing that we should do on this day of ours is to pray and then return to slaughter the sacrifice. So anyone who does so, he acted according to our Sunna (tradition), and whoever slaughtered the sacrifice before the prayer, it was just meat which he presented to his family and would not be considered as Nusuk.&#8221; A person from the Ansar named Abu Burda bin Niyyar said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I slaughtered the Nusuk (before the prayer) but I have a young she-goat which is better than an older sheep.&#8221; The Prophet I said, &#8220;Sacrifice it in lieu of the first, but it will be not sufficient (as a sacrifice) for anybody else after you.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 83:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin Jubair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was with Ibn Umar when a spear head pierced the sole of his foot and his foot stuck to the paddle of the saddle and I got down and pulled his foot out, and that happened in Mina. Al-Hajjaj got the news and came to enquire about his health and said, &#8220;Alas! If we could only know the man who wounded you!&#8221; Ibn Umar said, &#8220;You are the one who wounded me.&#8221; Al-Hajjaj said, &#8220;How is that?&#8221; Ibn Umar said, &#8220;You have allowed the arms to be carried on a day on which nobody used to carry them and you allowed arms to be carried in the Haram even though it was not allowed before.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 84:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin &#8216;Amr bin Said bin Al-&#8216;Aas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hajjaj went to Ibn Umar while I was present there. Al-Hajjaj asked Ibn Umar, &#8220;How are you?&#8221; Ibn Umar replied, &#8220;I am all right,&#8221; Al-Hajjaj asked, &#8220;Who wounded you?&#8221; Ibn Umar replied, &#8220;The person who allowed arms to be carried on the day on which it was forbidden to carry them (he meant Al-Hajjaj)&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 85:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet delivered the Khutba on the day of Nahr (&#8216;Id-ul-Adha) and said, &#8220;The first thing we should do on this day of ours is to pray and then return and slaughter (our sacrifices). So anyone who does so he acted according to our Sunna; and whoever slaughtered before the prayer then it was just meat that he offered to his family and would not be considered as a sacrifice in any way. My uncle Abu Burda bin Niyyar got up and said, &#8220;O, Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I slaughtered the sacrifice before the prayer but I have a young she-goat which is better than an older sheep.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Slaughter it in lieu of the first and such a goat will not be considered as a sacrifice for anybody else after you.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 86:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;No good deeds done on other days are superior to those done on these (first ten days of Dhul Hijja).&#8221; Then some companions of the Prophet said, &#8220;Not even Jihad?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Not even Jihad, except that of a man who does it by putting himself and his property in danger (for Allah&#8217;s sake) and does not return with any of those things.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">While we were going from Mina to &#8216;Arafat, I asked Anas bin Malik, about Talbiya, &#8220;How did you use to say Talbiya in the company of the Prophet?&#8221; Anas said: &#8220;People used to say Talbiya and their saying was not objected to and they used to say Takbir and that was not objected to either. &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We used to be ordered to come out on the Day of &#8216;Id and even bring out the virgin girls from their houses and menstruating women so that they might stand behind the men and say Takbir along with them and invoke Allah along with them and hope for the blessings of that day and for purification from sins.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I (in my boyhood) went out with the Prophet on the day of &#8216;Id ul Fitr or Id-ul-Adha. The Prophet prayed and then delivered the Khutba and then went towards the women, preached and advised them and ordered them to give alms.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 93:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet went towards Al-Baqi (the grave-yard at Medina) on the day of Id-ul-Adha and offered a two-Rakat prayer (of &#8216;Id-ul-Adha) and then faced us and said, &#8220;On this day of ours, our first act of worship is the offering of prayer and then we will return and slaughter the sacrifice, and whoever does this concords with our Sunna; and whoever slaughtered his sacrifice before that (i.e. before the prayer) then that was a thing which he prepared earlier for his family and it would not be considered as a Nusuk (sacrifice.)&#8221; A man stood up and said, &#8220;O, Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I slaughtered (the animal before the prayer) but I have a young she-goat which is better than an older sheep.&#8221; The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said to him, &#8220;Slaughter it. But a similar sacrifice will not be sufficient for anybody else after you.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 94:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin &#8216;Abis:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abbas was asked whether he had joined the Prophet in the &#8216;Id prayer. He said, &#8220;Yes. And I could not have joined him had I not been young. (The Prophet came out) till he reached the mark which was near the house of Kathir bin As-Salt, offered the prayer, delivered the Khutba and then went towards the women. Bilal was accompanying him. He preached to them and advised them and ordered them to give alms. I saw the women putting their ornaments with their outstretched hands into Bilal&#8217;s garment. Then the Prophet along with Bilal returned home.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 95:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Juraij:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ata&#8217; told me that he had heard Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah saying, &#8220;The Prophet stood up to offer the prayer of the &#8216;Id ul Fitr. He first offered the prayer and then delivered the Khutba. After finishing it he got down (from the pulpit) and went towards the women and advised them while he was leaning on Bilal&#8217;s hand. Bilal was spreading out his garment where the women were putting their alms.&#8221; I asked &#8216;Ata&#8217; whether it was the Zakat of &#8216;Id ul Fitr. He said, &#8220;No, it was just alms given at that time. Some lady put her finger ring and the others would do the same.&#8221; I said, (to &#8216;Ata&#8217;), &#8220;Do you think that it is incumbent upon the Imam to give advice to the women (on &#8216;Id day)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No doubt, it is incumbent upon the Imams to do so and why should they not do so?&#8221; Al-Hasan bin Muslim told me that Ibn Abbas had said, &#8220;I join the Prophet, Abu Bakr, Umar and &#8216;Uthman in the &#8216;Id ul Fitr prayers. They used to offer the prayer before the Khutba and then they used to deliver the Khutba afterwards. Once the Prophet I came out (for the &#8216;Id prayer) as if I were just observing him waving to the people to sit down. He, then accompanied by Bilal, came crossing the rows till he reached the women. He recited the following verse: &#8216;O Prophet! When the believing women come to you to take the oath of fealty to you . . . (to the end of the verse) (60.12).&#8217; After finishing the recitation he said, &#8220;O ladies! Are you fulfilling your covenant?&#8221; None except one woman said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Hasan did not know who was that woman. The Prophet said, &#8220;Then give alms.&#8221; Bilal spread his garment and said, &#8220;Keep on giving alms. Let my father and mother sacrifice their lives for you (ladies).&#8221; So the ladies kept on putting their Fatkhs (big rings) and other kinds of rings in Bilal&#8217;s garment.&#8221; Abdur-Razaq said, &#8221; &#8216;Fatkhs&#8217; is a big ring which used to be worn in the (Pre-lslamic) period of ignorance.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 96:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aiyub:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hafsa bint Sirin said, &#8220;On Id we used to forbid our girls to go out for &#8216;Id prayer. A lady came and stayed at the palace of Bani Khalaf and I went to her. She said, &#8216;The husband of my sister took part in twelve holy battles along with the Prophet and my sister was with her husband in six of them. My sister said that they used to nurse the sick and treat the wounded. Once she asked, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If a woman has no veil, is there any harm if she does not come out (on &#8216;Id day)?&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;Her companion should let her share her veil with her, and the women should participate in the good deeds and in the religious gatherings of the believers.&#8217; &#8221; Hafsa added, &#8220;When Um-&#8216;Atiya came, I went to her and asked her, &#8216;Did you hear anything about so-and-so?&#8217; Um-&#8216;Atlya said, &#8216;Yes, let my father be sacrificed for the Prophet (p.b.u.h). (And whenever she mentioned the name of the Prophet she always used to say, &#8216;Let my father be&#8217; sacrificed for him). He said, &#8216;Virgin mature girls staying often screened (or said, &#8216;Mature girls and virgins staying often screened&#8211;Aiyub is not sure as which was right) and menstruating women should come out (on the &#8216;Id day). But the menstruating women should keep away from the Musalla. And all the women should participate in the good deeds and in the religious gatherings of the believers&#8217;.&#8221; Hafsa said, &#8220;On that I said to Um-&#8216;Atiya, &#8216;Also those who are menstruating?&#8217; &#8221; Um-&#8216;Atiya replied, &#8220;Yes. Do they not present themselves at &#8216;Arafat and elsewhere?&#8221;.</p>
<hr>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Um-&#8216;Atiya:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were ordered to go out (for &#8216;Id) and also to take along with us the menstruating women, mature girls and virgins staying in seclusion. (Ibn &#8216;Aun said, &#8220;Or mature virgins staying in seclusion).&#8221; The menstruating women could present themselves at the religious gathering and invocation of Muslims but should keep away from their Musalla.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">On the day of Nahr Allah&#8217;s Apostle delivered the Khutba after the &#8216;Id prayer and said, &#8220;Anyone who prayed like us and slaughtered the sacrifice like we did then he acted according to our (Nusuk) tradition of sacrificing, and whoever slaughtered the sacrifice before the prayer, then that was just mutton (i.e. not sacrifice).&#8221; Abu Burda bin Naiyar stood up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! By Allah, I slaughtered my sacrifice before I offered the (Id) prayer and thought that today was the day of eating and drinking (non-alcoholic drinks) and so I made haste (in slaughtering) and ate and also fed my family and neighbors.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;That was just mutton (not a sacrifice).&#8221; Then Abu Burda said, &#8220;I have a young she-goat and no doubt, it is better than two sheep. Will that be sufficient as a sacrifice for me?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Yes. But it will not be sufficient for anyone else (as a sacrifice), after you.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle .~ offered the prayer on the day of Nahr and then delivered the Khutba and ordered that whoever had slaughtered his sacrifice before the prayer should repeat it, that is, should slaughter another sacrifice. Then a person from the Ansar stood up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! because of my neighbors (he described them as being very needy or poor) I slaughtered before the prayer. I have a young she-goat which, in my opinion, is better than two sheep.&#8221; The Prophet gave him the permission for slaughtering it as a sacrifice.</p>

Abu Bakr scolded them and the Prophet uncovered his face and said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;Leave them, for these days are the days of &#8216;Id and the days of Mina.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha further said, &#8220;Once the Prophet was screening me and I was watching the display of black slaves in the Mosque and (&#8216;Umar) scolded them.

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 14:</p>
<h3 align="center">Fear Prayer</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.014.064"></a>Volume 2, Book 14, Number 64:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Shu&#8217;aib:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Az-Zuhri, &#8220;Did the Prophet ever offer the Fear Prayer?&#8221; Az-Zuhri said, &#8220;I was told by Salim that &#8216;Abdullah bin Umar I had said, &#8216;I took part in a holy battle with Allah&#8217;s Apostle I in Najd. We faced the enemy and arranged ourselves in rows. Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) stood up to lead the prayer and one party stood to pray with him while the other faced the enemy. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) and the former party bowed and performed two prostrations. Then that party left and took the place of those who had not prayed. Allah&#8217;s Apostle prayed one Raka (with the latter) and performed two prostrations and finished his prayer with Taslim. Then everyone of them bowed once and performed two prostrations individually.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 14, Number 65:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Umar said something similar to Mujahid&#8217;s saying: Whenever (Muslims and non-Muslims) stand face to face in battle, the Muslims can pray while standing. Ibn Umar added, &#8220;The Prophet said, &#8216;If the number of the enemy is greater than the Muslims, they can pray while standing or riding (individually).&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 14, Number 66:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once the Prophet (p.b.u.h) led the fear prayer and the people stood behind him. He said Takbir (Allahu-Akbar) and the people said the same. He bowed and some of them bowed. Then he prostrated and they also prostrated. Then he stood for the second Raka and those who had prayed the first Raka left and guarded their brothers. The second party joined him and performed bowing and prostration with him. All the people were in prayer but they were guarding one another during the prayer.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 14, Number 67:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the day of the Khandaq Umar came, cursing the disbelievers of Quraish and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have not offered the &#8216;Asr prayer and the sun has set.&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;By Allah! I too, have not offered the prayer yet. &#8220;The Prophet then went to Buthan, performed ablution and performed the &#8216;Asr prayer after the sun had set and then offered the Maghrib prayer after it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 14, Number 68:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) offered the Fajr prayer when it was still dark, then he rode and said, &#8216;Allah Akbar! Khaibar is ruined. When we approach near to a nation, the most unfortunate is the morning of those who have been warned.&#8221; The people came out into the streets saying, &#8220;Muhammad and his army.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle vanquished them by force and their warriors were killed; the children and women were taken as captives. Safiya was taken by Dihya Al-Kalbi and later she belonged to Allah&#8217;s Apostle go who married her and her Mahr was her manumission.</p>

		<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Why Allah sent Prophets and Messengers ?</strong></span><br>
Source:  Appendix II from  &#8216;Interpretations and Meanings of the Noble Qu&#8217;ran&#8217;<br>
By Dr. Muhammad Taqiuddeen al-Hilaalee, Ph.D. and Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ever since people innovated the dogma of joining others in worship along with Allah, Allah had been sending Prophets and Messengers to His devotees in order to invite them to the worship of Allah and Allah Alone, to order them not to ascribe partners unto Him and bring them out of the darkness of polytheism and into the light of Monotheism. All the Prophets preached the belief in the Oneness of Allah. The following verses from the Noble Qur&#8217;an illustrate this fact:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed, We sent Nooh (Noah) to his people and he said: &#8216;O my people! Worship Allah! You have no other Ilaah (God) but him. (Laa ilaaha ill Allaah, none has the right to be worshipped but Allah). Certainly, I fear for you the torment of a great Day!'&#8221; (Al-A&#8217;araaf, The Heights 7:59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And to &#8216;Aad (people, We sent) their brother Hood. He said: &#8216;O my people! Worship Allah! You have no other Ilaah (God) but Him. (Laa ilaaha ill Allaah, none has the right to be worshipped but Allah). Will you not fear (Allah)?'&#8221; (Al-A&#8217;araaf, The Heights 7:65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And to (the people of) Madyaan (Midian), (We sent) their brother Shu&#8217;ayb. He said: &#8216;O my People! Worship Allah! You have no other Ilaah (God) but Him. (Laa ilaaha ill Allaah, none has the right to be worshipped but Allah). Verily, a clear proof (sign) from your Lord has come unto you, so give full measure and full weight and wrong not men in their things, and do not make mischief on the earth after it has been set in order, that will be better for you, if you are believers.'&#8221; (Al-A&#8217;araaf, The Heights 7:85)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And to Thamood (people, We sent) their brother Saalih. He said: &#8216;O my people! Worship Allah! You have no other Ilaah (God) but Him. (Laa ilaaha ill Allaah, none has the right to be worshipped but Allah).'&#8221; (Al-A&#8217;araaf, The Heights 7:73)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): Worship Allah (Alone) and avoid (or keep away from) Taaghoot (all false deities etc. do not worship Taaghoots besides Allah).&#8221; (An-Nahl, The Bee 16:36)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every Prophet was sent unto his own nation for their guidance, but the Message of Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam &#8211; peace be upon him) was general for all mankind and jinn (a being created from smokeless flames).</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Say [O Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam)]: &#8216;O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allah.'&#8221; (Al-A&#8217;araaf, The Heights 7:158)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the aim of sending these Prophets and Messengers to mankind and jinn was only that they should worship Allah Alone, as Allah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And I (Allah) created not the jinn and men except they should worship Me (Alone)&#8221; (Adh-Dhaariyaat, The Winds that Scatter 51:56)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And to worship Allah means to obey Him and to do all that He has ordained, &#8211; and to fear Him by abstaining from all that He has forbidden. Then those who will obey Allaah will be rewarded in Paradise, and those who will disobey Him will be punished in the Hell-fire.</p>
