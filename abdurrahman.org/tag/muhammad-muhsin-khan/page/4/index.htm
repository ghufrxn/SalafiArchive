<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Urwa bin Al-Musayyab, Alqama bin Waqqas and  Ubaidullah bin Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>About the story of &#8216;Aisha and their narrations were similar  attesting each other, when the liars said what they invented about &#8216;Aisha, and the Divine  Inspiration was delayed, Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent for &#8216;Ali and Usama to consult them in  divorcing his wife (i.e. &#8216;Aisha). Usama said, &#8220;Keep your wife, as we know nothing  about her except good.&#8221; Buraira said, &#8220;I cannot accuse her of any defect except  that she is still a young girl who sleeps, neglecting her family&#8217;s dough which the  domestic goats come to eat (i.e. she was too simpleminded to deceive her husband).&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Who can help me to take revenge over the man who has harmed me  by defaming the reputation of my family? By Allah, I have not known about my  family-anything except good, and they mentioned (i.e. accused) a man about whom I did not  know anything except good.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 48, Number 806: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdullah bin Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Ubai bin Kab Al-Ansari went to the  garden where Ibn Saiyad used to live. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle entered (the garden), he (i.e.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle ) started hiding himself behind the datepalms as he wanted to hear  secretly the talk of Ibn Saiyad before the latter saw him. Ibn Saiyad wrapped with a soft  decorated sheet was lying on his bed murmuring. Ibn Saiyad&#8217;s mother saw the Prophet hiding  behind the stems of the date-palms. She addressed Ibn Saiyad saying, &#8220;O Saf, this is  Muhammad.&#8221; Hearing that Ibn Saiyad stopped murmuring (or got cautious), the Prophet  said, &#8220;If she had left him undisturbed, he would have revealed his reality.&#8221;  (See Hadith No. 290, Vol 4 for details) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 48, Number 807: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The wife of Rifa&#8217;a Al-Qurazi came to the Prophet and said,  &#8220;I was Rifa&#8217;a&#8217;s wife, but he divorced me and it was a final irrevocable divorce. Then  I married AbdurRahman bin Az-Zubair but he is impotent.&#8221; The Prophet asked her &#8216;Do  you want to remarry Rifa&#8217;a? You cannot unless you had a complete sexual relation with your  present husband.&#8221; Abu Bakr was sitting with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Khalid bin Said bin  Al-&#8216;As was at the door waiting to be admitted. He said, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! Do you hear what  this (woman) is revealing frankly before the Prophet ?&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.048.808"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 48, Number 808: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdullah bin Abu Mulaika from &#8216;Uqba bin Al-Harith:  </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Uqba married the daughter of Abu Ihab bin Aziz, and then a  woman came and said, &#8220;I suckled &#8216;Uqba and his wife.&#8221; &#8216;Uqba said to her, &#8220;I  do not know that you have suckled me, and you did not inform me.&#8221; He then sent  someone to the house of Abu Ihab to enquire about that but they did not know that she had  suckled their daughter. Then &#8216;Uqba went to the Prophet in Medina and asked him about it.  The Prophet said to him, &#8220;How (can you keep your wife) after it has been said (that  both of you were suckled by the same woman)?&#8221; So, he divorced her and she was married  to another (husband). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 48, Number 809: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>People were (sometimes) judged by the revealing of a Divine  Inspiration during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle but now there is no longer any more  (new revelation). Now we judge you by the deeds you practice publicly, so we will trust  and favor the one who does good deeds in front of us, and we will not call him to account  about what he is really doing in secret, for Allah will judge him for that; but we will  not trust or believe the one who presents to us with an evil deed even if he claims that  his intentions were good. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 48, Number 810: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A funeral procession passed in front of the Prophet and the  people praised the deceased. The Prophet said, &#8220;It has been affirmed  (Paradise).&#8221; Then another funeral procession passed by and the people talked badly of  the deceased. The Prophet said, &#8220;It has been affirmed (Hell).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle  was asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You said it has been affirmed for both?&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;The testimony of the people (is accepted), (for) the believer are  Allah&#8217;s witnesses on the earth.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 48, Number 811: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Al-Aswad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once I went to Medina where there was an outbreak of  disease and the people were dying rapidly. I was sitting with &#8216;Umar and a funeral  procession passed by. The people praised the deceased. &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;It has been  affirmed&#8221; (Paradise). Then another funeral procession passed by. The people praised  the deceased. &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;It has been affirmed.&#8221; (Paradise). Then another  funeral procession passed by. The people praised the deceased. &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;It has  been affirmed (Paradise).&#8221; Then a third funeral procession passed by and the people  talked badly of the deceased. &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;It has been affirmed (Hell).&#8221; I asked  Umar, &#8220;O chief of the believers! What has been affirmed?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have  said what the Prophet said. He said, &#8216;Allah will admit into paradise any Muslim whose good  character is attested by four persons.&#8217; We asked the Prophet, &#8216;If there were three  witnesses only?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Even three.&#8217; We asked, &#8216;If there were two only?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Even  two.&#8217; But we did not ask him about one witness.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Aflah asked the permission to visit me but I did not allow  him. He said, &#8220;Do you veil yourself before me although I am your uncle?&#8221; &#8216;Aisha  said, &#8220;How is that?&#8221; Aflah replied, &#8220;You were suckled by my brother&#8217;s wife  with my brother&#8217;s milk.&#8221; I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it, and he said, &#8220;Allah  is right, so permit him to visit you.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said about Hamza&#8217;s daughter, &#8220;I am not  legally permitted to marry her, as foster relations are treated like blood relations (in  marital affairs). She is the daughter of my foster brother.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Amra bint &#8216;Abdur-Rahman: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That &#8216;Aisha the wife of the Prophet told her uncle that  once, while the Prophet was in her house, she heard a man asking Hafsa&#8217;s permission to  enter her house. &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I think the man is Hafsa&#8217;s  foster uncle.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! There is a man asking the  permission to enter your house.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;I think the man is  Hafsa&#8217;s foster uncle.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;If so-and-so were living (i.e. her foster  uncle) would he be allowed to visit me?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Yes, he would,  as the foster relations are treated like blood relations (in marital affairs).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the Prophet came to me while a man was in my house. He  said, &#8220;O &#8216;Aisha! Who is this (man)?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;My foster brothers&#8221;  He said, &#8220;O &#8216;Aisha! Be sure about your foster brothers, as fostership is only valid  if it takes place in the suckling period (before two years of age).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the wife of the Prophet) &#8220;Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle  intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him  the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the  lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by  women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When  Allah&#8217;s Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city  of Medina, Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off  was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing  I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my  necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because  of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the  back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in  weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the  difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the  camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I  found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I  went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and  come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Safwan bin Mu&#8217;attal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the  army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me,  and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, &#8220;Inna  lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).&#8221; He  made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs  of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by  the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was  meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the  leader of the false accusers was &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to  Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged  statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not  receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got  sick. But he would come, greet and say, &#8216;How is that (girl)?&#8217; I did not know anything of  what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the  Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the  call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to  our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old &#8216;Arabs in the open  country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah  stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, &#8216;Let Mistah be ruined.&#8217; I said,  &#8216;You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of)  Badr?&#8217; She said, &#8216;O Hanata (you there) didn&#8217;t you hear what they said?&#8217; Then she told me  the rumors of the false accusers. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, &#8216;How is that (girl)?&#8217; I requested  him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I  Allah&#8217;s Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, &#8216;What are the  people talking about?&#8217; She said, &#8216;O my daughter! Don&#8217;t worry much about this matter. By  Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the  women would forge false news about her.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Glorified be Allah! Are the people  really taking of this matter?&#8217; That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till  morning. In the morning Allah&#8217;s Apostle called Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when  he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e.  &#8216;Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added,  &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good.&#8217;  &#8216;Ali bin Abu Talib said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and  there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you  the truth.&#8217; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle called Buraira and said, &#8216;O Burair. Did you ever see  anything which roused your suspicions about her?&#8217; Buraira said, &#8216;No, by Allah Who has sent  you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of  immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat.&#8217; On that day  Allah&#8217;s Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing  &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Who will support me to punish that  person (&#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my  family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person  about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my  company.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Sad bin Mu&#8217;adh got up and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! by  Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will  chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will  fulfill your order.&#8217; On that Sad bin &#8216;Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this  incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said,  &#8216;By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill  him.&#8217; On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sad bin &#8216;Ubada), &#8216;By Allah! you are a  liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites.&#8217; On  this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other,  while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quietened them till they  became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did  my tears stop, nor could I sleep. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for  two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were  sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I  allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this  state, Allah&#8217;s Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they  forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited  Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His  Apostle) and then said, &#8216;O &#8216;Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you  are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin,  then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and  asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance.&#8217; When Allah&#8217;s Apostle finished  his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I  requested my father to reply to Allah&#8217;s Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I  do not know what to say to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8217; I said to my mother, &#8216;Talk to Allah&#8217;s Apostle  on my behalf.&#8217; She said, &#8216;By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the  Quran. I said. &#8216;I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and  that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you  that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I  confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would  believe me. By Allah, I don&#8217;t compare my situation with you except to the situation of  Joseph&#8217;s father (i.e. Jacob) who said, &#8216;So (for me) patience is most fitting against that  which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought.&#8217; Then I turned to the  other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought  that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior  to be talked of in the Holy Qur&#8217;an. I had hoped that Allah&#8217;s Apostle might have a dream in  which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allah&#8217;s Apostle had not got up and nobody  had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. So, there  overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being  inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping  like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allah&#8217;s Apostle was  over, he was smiling and the first word he said, &#8216;Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has  declared your innocence.&#8217; My mother told me to go to Allah&#8217;s Apostle . I replied, &#8216;By  Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah.&#8217; So Allah revealed: &#8220;Verily!  They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .&#8221; (24.11) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr,  who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, &#8216;By Allah, I  will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha.&#8217; But Allah  later revealed: &#8212; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;And let not those who are good and wealthy among you  swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allah&#8217;s  Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you?  Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221; (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said,  &#8216;Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me,&#8217; and resumed helping Mistah whom he  used to help before. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the  Prophet&#8217;s wife about me saying, &#8216;What do you know and what did you see?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By  Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.&#8221; Aisha further added &#8220;Zainab  was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophet&#8217;s love), yet Allah protected her  (from being malicious), for she had piety.&#8221; </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked me, &#8216;Do you  have an evidence?&#8217; I replied in the negative. He said to the Jew, &#8216;Take an oath.&#8217; I said,  &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He will surely take an oath and take my property unjustly.&#8221; So,  Allah revealed: &#8220;Verily! Those who purchase a little gain at the cost of Allah&#8217;s  covenant and their oaths . . . &#8221; (3.77) </font></p>

He  said, &#8216;He was telling the truth; this Divine Verse was revealed in connection with me.  There was a dispute between me and another man about something and the case was filed  before Allah&#8217;s Apostle who said, &#8216;Produce your two witnesses or else the defendant is to  take an oath.&#8217; I said, The defendant will surely take a (false) oath caring for nothing.&#8217;  The Prophet said, &#8216;Whoever takes a false oath in order to grab (other&#8217;s) property, then  Allah will be angry with him when he will meet Him.&#8217; Then Allah revealed its confirmation.  Al-Ashath then recited the above Divine Verse.&#8221; (3.77) </font></p>

If anyone of us saw another man over  his wife, would he go to search for a proof.&#8221; The Prophet went on saying,  &#8220;Produce a proof or else you would get the legal punishment (by being lashed) on your  back.&#8221; The Prophet then mentioned the narration of Lian (as in the Holy Book).

How do you ask the people  of the Scriptures, though your Book (i.e. the Quran) which was revealed to His Prophet is  the most recent information from Allah and you recite it, the Book that has not been  distorted? Allah has revealed to you that the people of the scriptures have changed with  their own hands what was revealed to them and they have said (as regards their changed  Scriptures): This is from Allah, in order to get some worldly benefit thereby.&#8221; Ibn  Abbas added: &#8220;Isn&#8217;t the knowledge revealed to you sufficient to prevent you from  asking them? By Allah I have never seen any one of them asking (Muslims) about what has  been revealed to you.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The example of the person abiding  by Allah&#8217;s orders and limits (or the one who abides by the limits and regulations  prescribed by Allah) in comparison to the one who do wrong and violate Allah&#8217;s limits and  orders is like the example of people drawing lots for seats in a boat. Some of them got  seats in the upper part while the others in the lower part ; those in the, lower part have  to pass by those in the upper one to get water, and that troubled the latter. One of them  (i.e. the people in the lower part) took an axe and started making a hole in the bottom of  the boat. The people of the upper part came and asked him, (saying), &#8216;What is wrong with  you?&#8217; He replied, &#8220;You have been troubled much by my (coming up to you), and I have  to get water.&#8217; Now if they prevent him from doing that they will save him and themselves,  but if they leave him (to do what he wants), they will destroy him and themselves.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That when the Ansar drew lots as to which of the emigrants  should dwell with which of the Ansar, the name of Uthman bin Mazun came out (to be in  their lot). Um Al-Ala further said, &#8220;Uthman stayed with us, and we nursed him when he  got sick, but he died. We shrouded him in his clothes, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to our  house and I said, (addressing the dead &#8216;Uthman), &#8216;O Abu As-Sa&#8217;ib! May Allah be merciful to  you. I testify that Allah has blessed you.&#8217; The Prophet said to me, &#8220;How do you know  that Allah has blessed him?&#8221; I replied, &#8216;I do not know O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! May my  parents be sacrificed for you.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;As regards Uthman, by Allah he has  died and I really wish him every good, yet, by Allah, although I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I do  not know what will be done to him.&#8217; Um Al-Ala added, &#8216;By Allah I shall never attest the  piety of anybody after him. And what Allah&#8217;s Apostles said made me sad.&#8221; Um Al-Ala  further said, &#8220;Once I slept and saw in a dream, a flowing stream for Uthman. So I  went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and told him about it, he said, &#8216;That is (the symbol of) his  deeds.&#8221; </font></p>

He  also used to fix for everyone of his wives a day and a night, but Sauda bint Zam&#8217;a gave  her day and night to &#8216;Aisha, the wife of the Prophet intending thereby to please Allah&#8217;s  Apostle. </font></p>

If they knew the reward of the noon prayer, they would  race for it, and if they knew the reward of the morning (i.e. Fajr) and Isha prayers, they  would present themselves for the prayer even if they had to crawl to reach there. </font></p>

<h3 align="center"><font>Peacemaking </font></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.049.855">Volume 3, Book 49, Number 855: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>There was a dispute amongst the people of the tribe of Bani  &#8216;Amr bin &#8216;Auf. The Prophet went to them along with some of his companions in order to make  peace between them. The time for the prayer became due but the Prophet did not turn up;  Bilal pronounced the Adhan (i.e. call) for the prayer but the Prophet did not turn up, so  Bilal went to Abu Bakr and said, &#8220;The time for the prayer is due and the Prophet i  detained, would you lead the people in the prayer?&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;Yes, you  wish.&#8221; So, Bilal pronounced the Iqama of the prayer and Abu Bakr went ahead (to lead  the prayer), but the Prophet came walking among the rows till he joined the first row. The  people started clapping and they clapped too much, and Abu Bakr used not to look hither  and thither in the prayer, but he turned round and saw the Prophet standing behind him.  The Prophet beckoned him with his hand to keep on praying where he was. Abu Bakr raised  his hand and praised Allah and then retreated till he came in the (first) row, and the  Prophet went ahead and lead the people in the prayer. When the Prophet finished the  prayer, he turned towards the people and said, &#8220;O people! When something happens to  you during the prayer, you start clapping. Really clapping is (permissible) for women  only. If something happens to one of you in his prayer, he should say: &#8216;Subhan Allah&#8217;,  (Glorified be Allah), for whoever hears him (saying so) will direct his attention towards  him. O Abu Bakr! What prevented you from leading the people in the prayer when I beckoned  to you (to continue)?&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;It did not befit the son of Abu Quhafa  to lead the prayer in front of the Prophet. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It was said to the Prophet &#8220;Would that you see  Abdullah bin Ubai.&#8221; So, the Prophet went to him, riding a donkey, and the Muslims  accompanied him, walking on salty barren land. When the Prophet reached &#8216;Abdullah bin  Ubai, the latter said, &#8220;Keep away from me! By Allah, the bad smell of your donkey has  harmed me.&#8221; On that an Ansari man said (to &#8216;Abdullah), &#8220;By Allah! The smell of  the donkey of Allah&#8217;s Apostle is better than your smell.&#8221; On that a man from  &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s tribe got angry for &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s sake, and the two men abused each other which  caused the friends of the two men to get angry, and the two groups started fighting with  sticks, shoes and hands. We were informed that the following Divine Verse was revealed (in  this concern):&#8211; &#8220;And if two groups of Believers fall to fighting then, make peace  between them.&#8221; (49.9) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That she heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;He who makes  peace between the people by inventing good information or saying good things, is not a  liar.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the people of Quba fought with each other till they  threw stones on each other. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle was informed about it, he said, &#8220;Let  us go to bring about a reconciliation between them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The following Verse: If a woman fears cruelty or desertion  on her husband&#8217;s part (i.e. the husband notices something unpleasant about his wife, such  as old age or the like, and wants to divorce her, but she asks him to keep her and provide  for her as he wishes). (4.128) &#8220;There is no blame on them if they reconcile on such  basis.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A bedouin came and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Judge  between us according to Allah&#8217;s Laws.&#8221; His opponent got up and said, &#8220;He is  right. Judge between us according to Allah&#8217;s Laws.&#8221; The bedouin said, &#8220;My son  was a laborer working for this man, and he committed illegal sexual intercourse with his  wife. The people told me that my son should be stoned to death; so, in lieu of that, I  paid a ransom of one hundred sheep and a slave girl to save my son. Then I asked the  learned scholars who said, &#8220;Your son has to be lashed one-hundred lashes and has to  be exiled for one year.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;No doubt I will judge between you  according to Allah&#8217;s Laws. The slave-girl and the sheep are to go back to you, and your  son will get a hundred lashes and one year exile.&#8221; He then addressed somebody,  &#8220;O Unais! go to the wife of this (man) and stone her to death&#8221; So, Unais went  and stoned her to death. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If somebody innovates something  which is not in harmony with the principles of our religion, that thing is rejected.&#8221;  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara bin &#8216;Azib: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah&#8217;s Apostle concluded a peace treaty with the  people of Hudaibiya, Ali bin Abu Talib wrote the document and he mentioned in it,  &#8220;Muhammad, Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; The pagans said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t write: &#8216;Muhammad,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8217;, for if you were an apostle we would not fight with you.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle asked Ali to rub it out, but Ali said, &#8220;I will not be the person to rub it  out.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle rubbed it out and made peace with them on the condition that  the Prophet and his companions would enter Mecca and stay there for three days, and that  they would enter with their weapons in cases. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 49, Number 863: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet intended to perform &#8216;Umra in the month of  Dhul-Qada, the people of Mecca did not let him enter Mecca till he settled the matter with  them by promising to stay in it for three days only. When the document of treaty was  written, the following was mentioned: &#8216;These are the terms on which Muhammad, Allah&#8217;s  Apostle agreed (to make peace).&#8217; They said, &#8220;We will not agree to this, for if we  believed that you are Allah&#8217;s Apostle we would not prevent you, but you are Muhammad bin  &#8216;Abdullah.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle and also Muhammad bin  &#8216;Abdullah.&#8221; Then he said to &#8216;Ali, &#8220;Rub off (the words) &#8216;Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8217; &#8220;,  but &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;No, by Allah, I will never rub off your name.&#8221; So, Allah&#8217;s  Apostle took the document and wrote, &#8216;This is what Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdullah has agreed upon:  No arms will be brought into Mecca except in their cases, and nobody from the people of  Mecca will be allowed to go with him (i.e. the Prophet ) even if he wished to follow him  and he (the Prophet ) will not prevent any of his companions from staying in Mecca if the  latter wants to stay.&#8217; When the Prophet entered Mecca and the time limit passed, the  Meccans went to &#8216;Ali and said, &#8220;Tell your Friend (i.e. the Prophet ) to go out, as  the period (agreed to) has passed.&#8221; So, the Prophet went out of Mecca. The daughter  of Hamza ran after them (i.e. the Prophet and his companions), calling, &#8220;O Uncle! O  Uncle!&#8221; &#8216;Ali received her and led her by the hand and said to Fatima, &#8220;Take your  uncle&#8217;s daughter.&#8221; Zaid and Ja&#8217;far quarrel ed about her. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;I have more  right to her as she is my uncle&#8217;s daughter.&#8221; Ja&#8217;far said, &#8220;She is my uncle&#8217;s  daughter, and her aunt is my wife.&#8221; Zaid said, &#8220;She is my brother&#8217;s  daughter.&#8221; The Prophet judged that she should be given to her aunt, and said that the  aunt was like the mother. He then said to &#8216;All, &#8220;You are from me and I am from  you&#8221;, and said to Ja&#8217;far, &#8220;You resemble me both in character and  appearance&#8221;, and said to Zaid, &#8220;You are our brother (in faith) and our freed  slave.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle set out for the &#8216;Umra but the pagans of  Quraish prevented him from reaching the Ka&#8217;ba. So, he slaughtered his sacrifice and got  his head shaved at Al-Hudaibiya, and agreed with them that he would perform &#8216;Umra the  following year and would not carry weapons except swords and would not stay in Mecca  except for the period they al lowed. So, the Prophet performed the &#8216;Umra in the following  year and entered Mecca according to the treaty, and when he stayed for three days, the  pagans ordered him to depart, and he departed. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ar-Rabi, the daughter of An-Nadr broke the tooth of a girl,  and the relatives of Ar-Rabi&#8217; requested the girl&#8217;s relatives to accept the Irsh  (compensation for wounds etc.) and forgive (the offender), but they refused. So, they went  to the Prophet who ordered them to bring about retaliation. Anas bin An-Nadr asked,  &#8220;O Allah&#8221;; Apostle! Will the tooth of Ar-Rabi&#8217; be broken? No, by Him Who has  sent you with the Truth, her tooth will not be broken.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;O  Anas! Allah&#8221;; law ordains retaliation.&#8221; Later the relatives of the girl agreed  and forgave her. The Prophet said, &#8220;There are some of Allah&#8217;s slaves who, if they  take an oath by Allah, are responded to by Allah i.e. their oath is fulfilled). Anas  added, &#8220;The people agreed and accepted the Irsh.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 49, Number 867: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Hasan Al-Basri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>By Allah, Al-Hasan bin Ali led large battalions like  mountains against Muawiya. Amr bin Al-As said (to Muawiya), &#8220;I surely see battalions  which will not turn back before killing their opponents.&#8221; Muawiya who was really the  best of the two men said to him, &#8220;O &#8216;Amr! If these killed those and those killed  these, who would be left with me for the jobs of the public, who would be left with me for  their women, who would be left with me for their children?&#8221; Then Muawiya sent two  Quraishi men from the tribe of &#8216;Abd-i-Shams called &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin Sumura and Abdullah  bin &#8216;Amir bin Kuraiz to Al-Hasan saying to them, &#8220;Go to this man (i.e. Al-Hasan) and  negotiate peace with him and talk and appeal to him.&#8221; So, they went to Al-Hasan and  talked and appealed to him to accept peace. Al-Hasan said, &#8220;We, the offspring of  &#8216;Abdul Muttalib, have got wealth and people have indulged in killing and corruption (and  money only will appease them).&#8221; They said to Al-Hasan, &#8220;Muawiya offers you so  and so, and appeals to you and entreats you to accept peace.&#8221; Al-Hasan said to them,  &#8220;But who will be responsible for what you have said?&#8221; They said, &#8220;We will  be responsible for it.&#8221; So, what-ever Al-Hasan asked they said, &#8220;We will be  responsible for it for you.&#8221; So, Al-Hasan concluded a peace treaty with Muawiya.  Al-Hasan (Al-Basri) said: I heard Abu Bakr saying, &#8220;I saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the  pulpit and Al-Hasan bin &#8216;Ali was by his side. The Prophet was looking once at the people  and once at Al-Hasan bin &#8216;Ali saying, &#8216;This son of mine is a Saiyid (i.e. a noble) and may  Allah make peace between two big groups of Muslims through him.&#8221; </font></p>

One of them was appealing to the other to deduct his  debt and asking him to be lenient but the other was saying, &#8220;By Allah I will not do  so.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle went out to them and said, &#8220;Who is the one who was swearing  by Allah that he would not do a favor?&#8221; That man said, &#8220;I am that person, O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

The Prophet passed by them and said, &#8220;O Ka&#8217;b,&#8221; beckoning with his  hand as if intending to say, &#8220;Deduct half the debts.&#8221; So, Kab took half what the  other owed him and remitted the other half. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;There is a Sadaqa to be given  for every joint of the human body; and for every day on which the sun rises there is a  reward of a Sadaqa (i.e. charitable gift) for the one who establishes justice among  people.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 49, Number 871: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Urwa bin Az-Zubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Az-Zubair told me that he quarrelled with an Ansari man who  had participated in (the battle of) Badr in front of Allah&#8217;s Apostle about a water stream  which both of them used for irrigation. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to Az-Zubair, &#8220;O Zubair!  Irrigate (your garden) first, and then let the water flow to your neighbor.&#8221; The  Ansari became angry and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Is it because he is your  cousin?&#8221; On that the complexion of Allah&#8217;s Apostle changed (because of anger) and  said (to Az-Zubair), &#8220;I irrigate (your garden) and then with-hold the water till it  reaches the walls (surrounding the palms).&#8221; So, Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave Az-Zubair his  full right. Before that Allah&#8217;s Apostle had given a generous judgment beneficial for  Az-Zubair and the Ansari, but when the Ansan irritated Allah&#8217;s Apostle he gave Az-Zubair  his full right according to the evident law. Az-Zubair said, &#8220;By Allah ! I think the  following Verse was revealed concerning that case: &#8220;But no by your Lord They can have  No faith Until they make you judge In all disputes between them.&#8221; (4.65) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 49, Number 872: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My father died and was in debt. I suggested that his  creditors take the fruits (i.e. dates) of my garden in lieu of the debt of my father, but  they refused the offer, as they thought that it would not cover the full debt. So, I went  to the Prophet and told him about it. He said (to me), &#8220;When you pluck the dates and  collect them in the Mirbad (i.e. a place where dates are dried), call me (Allah&#8217;s  Apostle).&#8221; Finally he came accompanied by Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar and sat on the dates and  invoked Allah to bless them. Then he said, &#8220;Call your creditors and give them their  full rights.&#8221; So, I paid all my father&#8217;s creditors in full and yet thirteen extra  Wasqs of dates remained, seven of which were &#8216;Ajwa and six were Laun or six of which were  Ajwa and seven were Laun. I met Allah&#8217;s Apostle at sunset and informed him about it. On  that he smiled and said, &#8220;Go to Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar and tell them about it.&#8221; They  said, &#8220;We perceived that was going to happen, as Allah&#8217;s Apostle did what he  did.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdullah bin Kab: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That Ka&#8217;b bin Malik told him that in the lifetime of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle he demanded his debt from Ibn Abu Hadrad in the Mosque. Their voices grew  louder till Allah&#8217;s Apostle heard them while he was in his house. So he lifted the curtain  of his room and called Ka&#8217;b bin Malik saying, &#8220;O Ka&#8217;b!&#8221; He replied,  &#8220;Labbaik! O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He beckoned to him with his hand suggesting that  he deduct half the debt. Ka&#8217;b said, &#8220;I agree, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle then said (to Ibn Abu Hadrad), &#8220;Get up and pay him the rest.&#8221; </font></p>

Another dead man was brought and the people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Lead  his funeral prayer.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Is he in debt?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Has he left any wealth?&#8221; They said, &#8221;Three  Dinars.&#8221; So, he led the prayer. Then a third dead man was brought and the people said  (to the Prophet ), Please lead his funeral prayer.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Has he left any  wealth?&#8221; They said, &#8220;No.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;Is he in debt?&#8221; They said,  (&#8220;Yes! He has to pay) three Diners.&#8217;, He (refused to pray and) said, &#8220;Then pray  for your (dead) companion.&#8221; Abu Qatada said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Lead his  funeral prayer, and I will pay his debt.&#8221; So, he led the prayer. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 488h: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;An Israeli man asked another  Israeli to lend him one thousand Dinars. The second man required witnesses. The former  replied, &#8216;Allah is sufficient as a witness.&#8217; The second said, &#8216;I want a surety.&#8217; The  former replied, &#8216;Allah is sufficient as a surety.&#8217; The second said, &#8216;You are right,&#8217; and  lent him the money for a certain period. The debtor went across the sea. When he finished  his job, he searched for a conveyance so that he might reach in time for the repayment of  the debt, but he could not find any. So, he took a piece of wood and made a hole in it,  inserted in it one thousand Dinars and a letter to the lender and then closed (i.e.  sealed) the hole tightly. He took the piece of wood to the sea and said. &#8216;O Allah! You  know well that I took a loan of one thousand Dinars from so-and-so. He demanded a surety  from me but I told him that Allah&#8217;s Guarantee was sufficient and he accepted Your  guarantee. He then asked for a witness and I told him that Allah was sufficient as a  Witness, and he accepted You as a Witness. No doubt, I tried hard to find a conveyance so  that I could pay his money but could not find, so I hand over this money to You.&#8217; Saying  that, he threw the piece of wood into the sea till it went out far into it, and then he  went away. Meanwhile he started searching for a conveyance in order to reach the  creditor&#8217;s country. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>One day the lender came out of his house to see whether a  ship had arrived bringing his money, and all of a sudden he saw the piece of wood in which  his money had been deposited. He took it home to use for fire. When he sawed it, he found  his money and the letter inside it. Shortly after that, the debtor came bringing one  thousand Dinars to him and said, &#8216;By Allah, I had been trying hard to get a boat so that I  could bring you your money, but failed to get one before the one I have come by.&#8217; The  lender asked, &#8216;Have you sent something to me?&#8217; The debtor replied, &#8216;I have told you I  could not get a boat other than the one I have come by.&#8217; The lender said, &#8216;Allah has  delivered on your behalf the money you sent in the piece of wood. So, you may keep your  one thousand Dinars and depart guided on the right path.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 489: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Said bin Jubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn Abbas said, &#8220;In the verse: To every one We have  appointed &#8216; (Muwaliya Mawaliya means one&#8217;s) heirs (4.33).&#8217; (And regarding the verse) &#8216;And  those with whom your right hands have made a pledge.&#8217; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;When the  emigrants came to the Prophet in Medina, the emigrant would inherit the Ansari while the  latter&#8217;s relatives would not inherit him because of the bond of brotherhood which the  Prophet established between them (i.e. the emigrants and the Ansar). When the verse: &#8216;And  to everyone We have appointed heirs&#8217; (4.33) was revealed, it cancelled (the bond (the  pledge) of brotherhood regarding inheritance).&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;The verse: To  those also to whom your right hands have pledged, remained valid regarding co-operation  and mutual advice, while the matter of inheritance was excluded and it became permissible  to assign something in one&#8217;s testament to the person who had the right of inheriting  before. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Salama bin Al-Akwa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A dead person was brought to the Prophet so that he might  lead the funeral prayer for him. He asked, &#8220;Is he in debt?&#8221; When the people  replied in the negative, he led the funeral prayer. Another dead person was brought and he  asked, &#8220;Is he in debt?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He (refused to lead the  prayer and) said, &#8220;Lead the prayer of your friend.&#8221; Abu Qatada said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I undertake to pay his debt.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then led his funeral  prayer. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the Prophet said (to me), &#8220;If the money of  Bahrain comes, I will give you a certain amount of it.&#8221; The Prophet had breathed his  last before the money of Bahrain arrived. When the money of Bahrain reached, Abu Bakr  announced, &#8220;Whoever was promised by the Prophet should come to us.&#8221; I went to  Abu Bakr and said, &#8220;The Prophet promised me so and so.&#8221; Abu Bakr gave me a  handful of coins and when I counted them, they were five-hundred in number. Abu Bakr then  said, &#8220;Take twice the amount you have taken (besides).&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.037.494"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 494: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(wife of the Prophet) Since I reached the age when I could  remember things, I have seen my parents worshipping according to the right faith of Islam.  Not a single day passed but Allah&#8217;s Apostle visited us both in the morning and in the  evening. When the Muslims were persecuted, Abu Bakr set out for Ethiopia as an emigrant.  When he reached a place called Bark-al-Ghimad, he met Ibn Ad-Daghna, the chief of the Qara  tribe, who asked Abu Bakr, &#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;My people  have turned me out of the country and I would like to tour the world and worship my  Lord.&#8221; Ibn Ad-Daghna said, &#8220;A man like you will not go out, nor will he be  turned out as you help the poor earn their living, keep good relation with your Kith and  kin, help the disabled (or the dependents), provide guests with food and shelter, and help  people during their troubles. I am your protector. So, go back and worship your Lord at  your home.&#8221; Ibn Ad-Daghna went along with Abu Bakr and took him to the chiefs of  Quraish saying to them, &#8220;A man like Abu Bakr will not go out, nor will he be turned  out. Do you turn out a man who helps the poor earn their living, keeps good relations with  Kith and kin, helps the disabled, provides guests with food and shelter, and helps the  people during their troubles?&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So, Quraish allowed Ibn Ad-Daghna&#8217;s guarantee of protection  and told Abu- Bakr that he was secure, and said to Ibn Ad-Daghna, &#8220;Advise Abu Bakr to  worship his Lord in his house and to pray and read what he liked and not to hurt us and  not to do these things publicly, for we fear that our sons and women may follow him.&#8221;  Ibn Ad-Daghna told Abu Bakr of all that, so Abu- Bakr continued worshipping his Lord in  his house and did not pray or recite Qur&#8217;an aloud except in his house. Later on Abu Bakr  had an idea of building a mosque in the court yard of his house. He fulfilled that idea  and started praying and reciting Qur&#8217;an there publicly. The women and the offspring of the  pagans started gathering around him and looking at him astonishingly. Abu Bakr was a  softhearted person and could not help weeping while reciting Qur&#8217;an. This horrified the  pagan chiefs of Quraish. They sent for Ibn Ad-Daghna and when he came, they said, &#8220;We  have given Abu Bakr protection on condition that he will worship his Lord in his house,  but he has transgressed that condition and has built a mosque in the court yard of his  house and offered his prayer and recited Qur&#8217;an in public. We are afraid lest he mislead  our women and offspring. So, go to him and tell him that if he wishes he can worship his  Lord in his house only, and if not, then tell him to return your pledge of protection as  we do not like to betray you by revoking your pledge, nor can we tolerate Abu Bakr&#8217;s  public declaration of Islam (his worshipping).&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Aisha added: Ibn Ad-Daghna came to Abu Bakr and said,  &#8220;You know the conditions on which I gave you protection, so you should either abide  by those conditions or revoke my protection, as I do not like to hear the &#8216;Arabs saying  that Ibn Ad-Daghna gave the pledge of protection to a person and his people did not  respect it.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;I revoke your pledge of protection and am satisfied  with Allah&#8217;s protection.&#8221; At that time Allah&#8217;s Apostle was still in Mecca and he said  to his companions, &#8220;Your place of emigration has been shown to me. I have seen salty  land, planted with date-palms and situated between two mountains which are the two  ,Harras.&#8221; So, when the Prophet told it, some of the companions migrated to Medina,  and some of those who had migrated to Ethiopia returned to Medina. When Abu Bakr prepared  for emigration, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to him, &#8220;Wait, for I expect to be permitted to  emigrate.&#8221; Abu Bakr asked, &#8220;May my father be sacrificed for your sake, do you  really expect that?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied in the affirmative. So, Abu Bakr  postponed his departure in order to accompany Allah&#8217;s Apostle and fed two camels which he  had, with the leaves of Samor trees for four months. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 495: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever a dead man in debt was brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle  he would ask, &#8220;Has he left anything to repay his debt?&#8221; If he was informed that  he had left something to repay his debts, he would offer his funeral prayer, otherwise he  would tell the Muslims to offer their friend&#8217;s funeral prayer. When Allah made the Prophet  wealthy through conquests, he said, &#8220;I am more rightful than other believers to be  the guardian of the believers, so if a Muslim dies while in debt, I am responsible for the  repayment of his debt, and whoever leaves wealth (after his death) it will belong to his  heirs. &#8221; </font></p>

The Prophet said to her &#8220;Order your slave to prepare the  wood (pieces) for the pulpit.&#8221; So, she ordered her slave who went and cut the wood  from the tamarisk and prepared the pulpit, for the Prophet. When he finished the pulpit,  the woman informed the Prophet that it had been finished. The Prophet asked her to send  that pulpit to him, so they brought it. The Prophet lifted it and placed it at the place  in which you see now.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Qatada Al-Aslami: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That his father said, &#8220;One day I was sitting with some  of the Prophet&#8217;s companions on the way to Mecca. Allah&#8217;s Apostle was ahead of us. All of  my companions were in the state of Ihram while I was a non-Muhrim. They saw an onager  while I was busy repairing my shoes, so they did not tell me about it but they wished I  had seen it. By chance I looked up and saw it. So, I turned to the horse, saddled it and  rode on it, forgetting to take the spear and the whip. I asked them if they could hand  over to me the whip and the spear but they said, &#8216;No, by Allah, we shall not help you in  that in any way.&#8217; I became angry and got down from the horse, picked up both the things  and rode the horse again. I attacked the onager and slaughtered it, and brought it (after  it had been dead). They took it (cooked some of it) and started eating it, but they  doubted whether it was allowed for them to eat it or not, as they were in the state of  Ihram. So, we proceeded and I hid with me one of its fore-legs. When we met Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and asked him about the case, he asked, &#8216;Do you have a portion of it with you?&#8217; I  replied in the affirmative and gave him that fleshy fore-leg which he ate completely while  he was in the state of Ihram . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once Allah&#8217;s Apostle visited us in this house of ours and  asked for something to drink. We milked one of our sheep and mixed it with water from this  well of ours and gave it to him. Abu Bakr was sitting on his left side and &#8216;Umar in front  of him and a bedouin on his right side. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle finished, &#8216;Umar said to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle &#8220;Here is Abu Bakr.&#8221; But Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave the remaining milk  to the bedouin and said twice, &#8220;The (persons on the) right side! So, start from the  right side.&#8221; Anas added, &#8220;It is a Sunna (the Prophet&#8217;s traditions)&#8221; and  repeated it thrice. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Urwa from &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle were in two groups. One group  consisted of &#8216;Aisha, Hafsa, Safiyya and Sauda; and the other group consisted of Um Salama  and the other wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. The Muslims knew that Allah&#8217;s Apostle loved  &#8216;Aisha, so if any of them had a gift and wished to give to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, he would delay  it, till Allah&#8217;s Apostle had come to &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s home and then he would send his gift to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle in her home. The group of Um Salama discussed the matter together and  decided that Um Salama should request Allah&#8217;s Apostle to tell the people to send their  gifts to him in whatever wife&#8217;s house he was. Um Salama told Allah&#8217;s Apostle of what they  had said, but he did not reply. Then they (those wives) asked Um Salama about it. She  said, &#8220;He did not say anything to me.&#8221; They asked her to talk to him again. She  talked to him again when she met him on her day, but he gave no reply. When they asked  her, she replied that he had given no reply. They said to her, &#8220;Talk to him till he  gives you a reply.&#8221; When it was her turn, she talked to him again. He then said to  her, &#8220;Do not hurt me regarding Aisha, as the Divine Inspirations do not come to me on  any of the beds except that of Aisha.&#8221; On that Um Salama said, &#8220;I repent to  Allah for hurting you.&#8221; Then the group of Um Salama called Fatima, the daughter of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and sent her to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to say to him, &#8220;Your wives request to  treat them and the daughter of Abu Bakr on equal terms.&#8221; Then Fatima conveyed the  message to him. The Prophet said, &#8220;O my daughter! Don&#8217;t you love whom I love?&#8221;  She replied in the affirmative and returned and told them of the situation. They requested  her to go to him again but she refused. They then sent Zainab bint Jahsh who went to him  and used harsh words saying, &#8220;Your wives request you to treat them and the daughter  of Ibn Abu Quhafa on equal terms.&#8221; On that she raised her voice and abused &#8216;Aisha to  her face so much so that Allah&#8217;s Apostle looked at &#8216;Aisha to see whether she would retort.  &#8216;Aisha started replying to Zainab till she silenced her. The Prophet then looked at &#8216;Aisha  and said, &#8220;She is really the daughter of Abu Bakr.&#8221; </font></p>

By Him in Whose Hands my life is, whoever takes something from the  resources of the Zakat (unlawfully) will be carrying it on his neck on the Day of  Resurrection; if it be a camel, it will be grunting; if a cow, it will be mooing; and if a  sheep, it will be bleating.&#8221; The Prophet then raised his hands till we saw the  whiteness of his armpits, and he said thrice, &#8220;O Allah!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;I am  ruined.&#8221; The Prophet asked, &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I had a  sexual intercourse with my wife during Ramadan (while fasting).&#8221; The Prophet asked  him, &#8220;Can you manumit a slave?&#8221; He replied in the negative. He then asked him,  &#8220;Can you fast for two successive months continuously&#8221; He replied in the  negative. The Prophet then asked him, &#8220;Can you feed sixty poor persons?&#8221; He  replied in the negative. In the meantime an Ansari came with a basket full of dates. The  Prophet said to the man, &#8220;Take it and give it in charity (as an expiation of your  sin).&#8221; The man said &#8220;Should I give it to some people who are poorer than we O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle? By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, there is no family between  Medina&#8217;s two mountains poorer than we.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle told him to take it and  provide his family with it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My father was martyred on the day (of the battle) of Uhud  and his creditors demanded the debt back in a harsh manner. So I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle  and informed him of that, he asked them to accept the fruits of my garden and excuse my  father, but they refused. So, Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not give them the fruits, nor did he cut  them and distribute them among them, but said, &#8220;I will come to you tomorrow  morning.&#8221; So, he came to us the next morning and walked about in between the  date-palms and invoked Allah to bless their fruits. I plucked the fruits and gave back all  the rights of the creditors in full, and a lot of fruits were left for us. Then I went to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle, who was sitting, and informed him about what happened. Allah&#8217;s Apostle  told &#8216;Umar, who was sitting there, to listen to the story. &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t we know  that you are Allah&#8217;s Apostle?

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the delegates of the tribe of Hawazin came to the  Prophet they requested him to return their property and their captives. He said to them,  &#8220;This concerns also other people along with me as you see, and the best statement to  me is the true one, so you may choose one of two alternatives; either the captives or the  property and (I have not distributed the booty for) I have been waiting for you.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet had returned from Ta&#8217;if, he waited for  them for more than ten nights. When they came to know that the Prophet would not return  except one of the two, they chose their captives. The Prophet then stood up amongst the  Muslims, Glorified and Praised Allah as He deserved, and then said, &#8220;Then after:  These brothers of yours have come to you with repentance and I see it proper to return  their captives, so whoever amongst you likes to do that as a favor, then he can do it, and  whoever of you wants to stick to his share till we pay him from the very first Fai (i.e.  war booty) which Allah will give us, then he can do so.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;We  return (the captives) to them willingly as a favor, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;I do not know who of you has given his consent and who has not; so go back and  your leaders may present your decision to me.&#8221; The people went away, and their  leaders discussed the matter with them, and then came to the Prophet to tell him that all  of them had given their consent (to return the captives) willingly. (Az-Zuhn, the  sub-narrator said, &#8220;This is what we know about the captives, of Hawazin.&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 332:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;The rights of a Muslim on the Muslims are to follow the funeral processions, to accept invitation and to reply the sneezer. (see Hadith No 331)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 333:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr came riding his horse from his dwelling place in As-Sunh. He got down from it, entered the Mosque and did not speak with anybody till he came to me and went direct to the Prophet, who was covered with a marked blanket. Abu Bakr uncovered his face. He knelt down and kissed him and then started weeping and said, &#8220;My father and my mother be sacrificed for you, O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! Allah will not combine two deaths on you. You have died the death which was written for you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Salama from Ibn Abbas : Abu Bakr came out and &#8216;Umar , was addressing the people, and Abu Bakr told him to sit down but &#8216;Umar refused. Abu Bakr again told him to sit down but &#8216;Umar again refused. Then Abu Bakr recited the Tashah-hud (i.e. none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is Allah&#8217;s Apostle) and the people attended to Abu Bakr and left &#8216;Umar. Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Amma ba&#8217;du, whoever amongst you worshipped Muhammad, then Muhammad is dead, but whoever worshipped Allah, Allah is alive and will never die. Allah said: &#8216;Muhammad is no more than an Apostle and indeed (many) Apostles have passed away before him ..(up to the) grateful.&#8217; &#8221; (3.144) (The narrator added, &#8220;By Allah, it was as if the people never knew that Allah had revealed this verse before till Abu Bakr recited it and then whoever heard it, started reciting it &#8220;)</p>

We made him stay with us in our house. Then he suffered from a disease which proved fatal when he died and was given a bath and was shrouded in his clothes, Allah&#8217;s Apostle came I said, &#8216;May Allah be merciful to you, O Abu As-Sa&#8217;ib! I testify that Allah has honored you&#8217;. The Prophet said, &#8216;How do you know that Allah has honored him?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Let my father be sacrificed for you! On whom else shall Allah bestow His honor?&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;No doubt, death came to him. By Allah, I too wish him good, but by Allah, I do not know what Allah will do with me though I am Al lah&#8217;s Apostle. &#8216; By Allah, I never attested the piety of anyone after that.&#8221;</p>

On that the eyes of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) started shedding tears. Sad said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

I sat in between them (or said, I sat beside one of them.

There he saw some travelers in the shade of a Samura (A kind of forest tree). He said (to me), &#8220;Go and see who those travelers are.&#8221; So I went and saw that one of them was Suhaib. I told this to &#8216;Umar who then asked me to call him. So I went back to Suhaib and said to him, &#8220;Depart and follow the chief of the faithful believers.&#8221; Later, when &#8216;Umar was stabbed, Suhaib came in weeping and saying, &#8220;O my brother, O my friend!&#8221; (on this &#8216;Umar said to him, &#8220;O Suhaib! Are you weeping for me while the Prophet said, &#8220;The dead person is punished by some of the weeping of his relatives?&#8221; Ibn Abbas added, &#8220;When &#8216;Umar died I told all this to Aisha and she said, &#8216;May Allah be merciful to Umar. By Allah, Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not say that a believer is punished by the weeping of his relatives. But he said, Allah increases the punishment of a non-believer because of the weeping of his relatives.&#8221; Aisha further added, &#8220;The Quran is sufficient for you (to clear up this point) as Allah has stated: &#8216;No burdened soul will bear another&#8217;s burden.&#8217; &#8221; (35.18).

Should I give two-thirds of my property in charity?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No.&#8217; I asked, &#8216;Half?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No.&#8217; then he added, &#8216;One-third, and even one-third is much. You&#8217;d better leave your inheritors wealthy rather than leaving them poor, begging others. You will get a reward for whatever you spend for Allah&#8217;s sake, even for what you put in your wife&#8217;s mouth.&#8217; I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Will I be left alone after my companions have gone?&#8217; He said, &#8216;If you are left behind, whatever good deeds you will do will up-grade you and raise you high. And perhaps you will have a long life so that some people will be benefited by you while others will be harmed by you. O Allah! Complete the emigration of my companions and do not turn them renegades.&#8217; But Allah&#8217;s Apostle felt sorry for poor Sad bin Khaula as he died in Mecca.&#8221; (but Sad bin Abi Waqqas lived long after the Prophet (p.b.u.h).)</p>

The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;Forbid them.&#8221; So again he went and came back for the third time and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! By Allah, they did not listen to us at all.&#8221; (&#8216;Aisha added): Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered him to go and put dust in their mouths. I said, (to that man) &#8220;May Allah stick your nose in the dust (i.e. humiliate you)! You could neither (persuade the women to) fulfill the order of Allah&#8217;s Apostle nor did you relieve Allah&#8217;s Apostle from fatigue. &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">One day the Prophet went out and offered the funeral prayers of the martyrs of Uhud and then went up the pulpit and said, &#8220;I will pave the way for you as your predecessor and will be a witness on you. By Allah! I see my Fount (Kauthar) just now and I have been given the keys of all the treasures of the earth (or the keys of the earth). By Allah! I am not afraid that you will worship others along with Allah after my death, but I am afraid that you will fight with one another for the worldly things.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle shrouded every two martyrs of Uhud in one piece of cloth and then he would ask, &#8220;Which of them knew more Quran?&#8221; When one of them was pointed out he would put him first in the grave. He said, &#8220;I am a witness on these.&#8221; Then he ordered them to be buried with blood on their bodies. Neither did he offer their funeral prayer nor did he get them washed. (Jabir bin Abdullah added): Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to ask about the martyrs of Uhud as to which of them knew more of the Quran.&#8221; And when one of them was pointed out as having more of it he would put him first in the grave and then his companions.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah has made Mecca a sanctuary (sacred place) and it was a sanctuary before me and will be so after me. It was made legal for me (to fight in it) for a few hours of the day. None is allowed to uproot its thorny shrubs or to cut its trees or to chase its game or to pick up its fallen things except by a person who announces it publicly.&#8221; On that Al-Abbas said (to the Prophet), &#8220;Except Al-Idhkhir for our goldsmiths and for our graves.&#8221; And so the Prophet added, &#8220;Except Al-Idhkhir. &#8221; And Abu Huraira narrated that the Prophet said, &#8220;Except Al-Idhkhir for our graves and houses.&#8221; And Ibn Abbas said, &#8220;For their goldsmiths and houses.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to Abdullah bin Ubai (a hypocrite) after his death and he has been laid in his pit (grave). He ordered (that he be taken out of the grave) and he was taken out. Then he placed him on his knees and threw some of his saliva on him and clothed him in his (the Prophet&#8217;s) own shirt. Allah knows better (why he did so). &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai had given his shirt to Al-Abbas to wear. Abu Harun said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle at that time had two shirts and the son of &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai said to him, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Clothe my father in your shirt which has been in contact with your skin.&#8217; &#8216; Sufyan added, &#8220;Thus people think that the Prophet clothed &#8216;Abdullah bin Tubal in his shirt in lieu of what he (Abdullah) had done (for Al Abbas, the Prophet&#8217;s uncle.)&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">When the time of the Battle of Uhud approached, my father called me at night and said, &#8220;I think that I will be the first amongst the companions of the Prophet to be martyred. I do not leave anyone after me dearer to me than you, except Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8217;s soul and I owe some debt and you should repay it and treat your sisters favorably (nicely and politely).&#8221; So in the morning he was the first to be martyred and was buried along with another (martyr). I did not like to leave him with the other (martyr) so I took him out of the grave after six months of his burial and he was in the same condition as he was on the day of burial, except a slight change near his ear.</p>

The Prophet said, &#8220;I will be a witness on these on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; Then he ordered them to be buried with their blood on their bodies and he did not have them washed.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar set out along with the Prophet (p.b.u.h) with a group of people to Ibn Saiyad till they saw him playing with the boys near the hillocks of Bani Mughala. Ibn Saiyad at that time was nearing his puberty and did not notice (us) until the Prophet stroked him with his hand and said to him, &#8220;Do you testify that I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; Ibn Saiyad looked at him and said, &#8220;I testify that you are the Messenger of illiterates.&#8221; Then Ibn Saiyad asked the Prophet (p.b.u.h), &#8220;Do you testify that I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; The Prophet (p.b.u.h) refuted it and said, &#8220;I believe in Allah and His Apostles.&#8221; Then he said (to Ibn Saiyad), &#8220;What do you think?&#8221; Ibn Saiyad answered, &#8220;True people and liars visit me.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;You have been confused as to this matter.&#8221; Then the Prophet said to him, &#8220;I have kept something (in my mind) for you, (can you tell me that?)&#8221; Ibn Saiyad said, &#8220;It is Al-Dukh (the smoke).&#8221; (2) The Prophet said, &#8220;Let you be in ignominy. You cannot cross your limits.&#8221; On that &#8216;Umar, said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allow me to chop his head off.&#8221; The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;If he is he (i.e. Dajjal), then you cannot over-power him, and if he is not, then there is no use of murdering him.&#8221; (Ibn &#8216;Umar added): Later on Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) once again went along with Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b to the date-palm trees (garden) where Ibn Saiyad was staying. The Prophet (p.b.u.h) wanted to hear something from Ibn Saiyad before Ibn Saiyad could see him, and the Prophet (p.b.u.h) saw him lying covered with a sheet and from where his murmurs were heard. Ibn Saiyad&#8217;s mother saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle while he was hiding himself behind the trunks of the date-palm trees. She addressed Ibn Saiyad, &#8220;O Saf ! (and this was the name of Ibn Saiyad) Here is Muhammad.&#8221; And with that Ibn Saiyad got up. The Prophet said, &#8220;Had this woman left him (Had she not disturbed him), then Ibn Saiyad would have revealed the reality of his case.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Shihab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The funeral prayer should be offered for every child even if he were the son of a prostitute as he was born with a true faith of Islam (i.e. to worship none but Allah Alone). If his parents are Muslims, particularly the father, even if his mother were a non-Muslim, and if he after the delivery cries (even once) before his death (i.e. born alive) then the funeral prayer must be offered. And if the child does not cry after his delivery (i.e. born dead) then his funeral prayer should not be offered, and he will be considered as a miscarriage. Abu Huraira, narrated that the Prophet said, &#8220;Every child is born with a true faith (i.e. to worship none but Allah Alone) but his parents convert him to Judaism or to Christianity or to Magainism, as an animal delivers a perfect baby animal. Do you find it mutilated?&#8221; Then Abu Huraira recited the holy verses: &#8216;The pure Allah&#8217;s Islamic nature (true faith i.e. to worship none but Allah Alone), with which He has created human beings.&#8217; &#8221; (30.30).</p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to Abu Talib, &#8220;O uncle! Say: None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, a sentence with which I shall be a witness (i.e. argue) for you before Allah. Abu Jahl and &#8216;Abdullah bin Abi Umaiya said, &#8220;O Abu Talib! Are you going to denounce the religion of Abdul Muttalib?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on inviting Abu Talib to say it (i.e. &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah&#8217;) while they (Abu Jahl and Abdullah) kept on repeating their statement till Abu Talib said as his last statement that he was on the religion of Abdul Muttalib and refused to say, &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah.&#8217; (Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I will keep on asking Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for you unless I am forbidden (by Allah) to do so.&#8221; So Allah revealed (the verse) concerning him (i.e. It is not fitting for the Prophet and those who believe that they should invoke (Allah) for forgiveness for pagans even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to them that they are companions of the fire (9.113).</p>

He then took a green leaf of a date-palm tree split it into two pieces and fixed one on each grave. The people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

Should we not depend on what has been written for us and leave the deeds as whoever amongst us is blessed will do the deeds of a blessed person and whoever amongst us will be wretched, will do the deeds of a wretched person?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;The good deeds are made easy for the blessed, and bad deeds are made easy for the wretched.&#8221; Then he recited the Verses:&#8211; &#8220;As for him who gives (in charity) and is Allah-fearing And believes in the Best reward from Allah. &#8221; (92.5-6)</p>

Go away from me.&#8221; When I talked too much he said, &#8220;I have been given the choice and so I have chosen (to offer the prayer).

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;When anyone of you dies, he is shown his place both in the morning and in the evening. If he is one of the people of Paradise; he is shown his place in it, and if he is from the people of the Hell-Fire; he is shown his place there-in. Then it is said to him, &#8216;This is your place till Allah resurrect you on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;When the funeral is ready (for its burial) and the people lift it on their shoulders, then if the deceased is a righteous person he says, &#8216;Take me ahead,&#8217; and if he is not a righteous one then he says, &#8216;Woe to it (me)! Where are you taking it (me)?&#8217; And his voice is audible to everything except human beings; and if they heard it they would fall down unconscious . &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) was asked about the children of (Mushrikeen) pagans. The Prophet replied, &#8220;Since Allah created them, He knows what sort of deeds they would have done.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Every child is born with a true faith of Islam (i.e. to worship none but Allah Alone) and his parents convert him to Judaism or Christianity or Magianism, as an animal delivers a perfect baby animal. Do you find it mutilated?&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 468:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Samura bin Jundab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever the Prophet finished the (morning) prayer, he would face us and ask, &#8220;Who amongst you had a dream last night?&#8221; So if anyone had seen a dream he would narrate it. The Prophet would say: &#8220;Ma sha&#8217;a-llah&#8221; (An Arabic maxim meaning literally, &#8216;What Allah wished,&#8217; and it indicates a good omen.) One day, he asked us whether anyone of us had seen a dream. We replied in the negative. The Prophet said, &#8220;But I had seen (a dream) last night that two men came to me, caught hold of my hands, and took me to the Sacred Land (Jerusalem). There, I saw a person sitting and another standing with an iron hook in his hand pushing it inside the mouth of the former till it reached the jaw-bone, and then tore off one side of his cheek, and then did the same with the other side; in the mean-time the first side of his cheek became normal again and then he repeated the same operation again. I said, &#8216;What is this?&#8217; They told me to proceed on and we went on till we came to a man Lying flat on his back, and another man standing at his head carrying a stone or a piece of rock, and crushing the head of the Lying man, with that stone. Whenever he struck him, the stone rolled away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man went to pick it up and by the time he returned to him, the crushed head had returned to its normal state and the man came back and struck him again (and so on). I said, &#8216;Who is this?&#8217; They told me to proceed on; so we proceeded on and passed by a hole like an oven; with a narrow top and wide bottom, and the fire was kindling underneath that hole. Whenever the fire-flame went up, the people were lifted up to such an extent that they about to get out of it, and whenever the fire got quieter, the people went down into it, and there were naked men and women in it. I said, &#8216;Who is this?&#8217; They told me to proceed on. So we proceeded on till we reached a river of blood and a man was in it, and another man was standing at its bank with stones in front of him, facing the man standing in the river. Whenever the man in the river wanted to come out, the other one threw a stone in his mouth and caused him to retreat to his original position; and so whenever he wanted to come out the other would throw a stone in his mouth, and he would retreat to his original position. I asked, &#8216;What is this?&#8217; They told me to proceed on and we did so till we reached a well-flourished green garden having a huge tree and near its root was sitting an old man with some children. (I saw) Another man near the tree with fire in front of him and he was kindling it up. Then they (i.e. my two companions) made me climb up the tree and made me enter a house, better than which I have ever seen. In it were some old men and young men, women and children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they took me out of this house and made me climb up the tree and made me enter another house that was better and superior (to the first) containing old and young people. I said to them (i.e. my two companions), &#8216;You have made me ramble all the night. Tell me all about that I have seen.&#8217; They said, &#8216;Yes. As for the one whose cheek you saw being torn away, he was a liar and he used to tell lies, and the people would report those lies on his authority till they spread all over the world. So, he will be punished like that till the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one whose head you saw being crushed is the one whom Allah had given the knowledge of Quran (i.e. knowing it by heart) but he used to sleep at night (i.e. he did not recite it then) and did not use to act upon it (i.e. upon its orders etc.) by day; and so this punishment will go on till the Day of Resurrection. And those you saw in the hole (like oven) were adulterers (those men and women who commit illegal sexual intercourse). And those you saw in the river of blood were those dealing in Riba (usury). And the old man who was sitting at the base of the tree was Abraham and the little children around him were the offspring of the people. And the one who was kindling the fire was Malik, the gate-keeper of the Hell-fire. And the first house in which you have gone was the house of the common believers, and the second house was of the martyrs. I am Gabriel and this is Michael. Raise your head.&#8217; I raised my head and saw a thing like a cloud over me. They said, &#8216;That is your place.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Let me enter my place.&#8217; They said, &#8216;You still have some life which you have not yet completed, and when you complete (that remaining portion of your life) you will then enter your place.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 469:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hisham&#8217;s father:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aisha said, &#8220;I went to Abu Bakr (during his fatal illness) and he asked me, &#8216;In how many garments was the Prophet shrouded?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;In three Sahuliya pieces of white cloth of cotton, and there was neither a shirt nor a turban among them.&#8217; Abu Bakr further asked her, &#8216;On which day did the Prophet die?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;He died on Monday.&#8217; He asked, &#8216;What is today?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;Today is Monday.&#8217; He added, &#8216;I hope I shall die sometime between this morning and tonight.&#8217; Then he looked at a garment that he was wearing during his illness and it had some stains of saffron. Then he said, &#8216;Wash this garment of mine and add two more garments and shroud me in them.&#8217; I said, &#8216;This is worn out.&#8217; He said, &#8216;A living person has more right to wear new clothes than a dead one; the shroud is only for the body&#8217;s pus.&#8217; He did not die till it was the night of Tuesday and was buried before the morning.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 470:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man said to the Prophet (p.b.u.h), &#8220;My mother died suddenly and I thought that if she had lived she would have given alms. So, if I give alms now on her behalf, will she get the reward?&#8221; The Prophet replied in the affirmative.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 471:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During his sickness, Allah&#8217;s Apostle was asking repeatedly, &#8220;Where am I today? Where will I be tomorrow?&#8221; And I was waiting for the day of my turn (impatiently). Then, when my turn came, Allah took his soul away (in my lap) between my chest and arms and he was buried in my house.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 472:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle in his fatal illness said, &#8220;Allah cursed the Jews and the Christians, for they built the places of worship at the graves of their prophets.&#8221; And if that had not been the case, then the Prophet&#8217;s grave would have been made prominent before the people. So (the Prophet ) was afraid, or the people were afraid that his grave might be taken as a place for worship.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 473:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakr bin &#8216;Aiyash :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyan At-Tammar told me that he had seen the grave of the Prophet elevated and convex.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 474:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Urwa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the wall fell on them (i.e. graves) during the caliphate of Al-Walid bin &#8216;Abdul Malik, the people started repairing it, and a foot appeared to them. The people got scared and thought that it was the foot of the Prophet. No-one could be found who could tell them about it till I (&#8216;Urwa) said to them, &#8220;By Allah, this is not the foot of the Prophet but it is the foot of Umar.&#8221; Aisha narrated that she made a will to &#8216;Abdullah bin Zubair, &#8220;Do not bury me with them (the Prophet and his two companions) but bury me with my companions (wives of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ) in Al-Baqi as I would not like to be looked upon as better than I really am (by being buried near the Prophet).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 475:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amr bin Maimun Al-Audi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I saw &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab (when he was stabbed) saying, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar! Go to the mother of the believers Aisha and say, &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab sends his greetings to you,&#8217; and request her to allow me to be buried with my companions.&#8221; (So, Ibn &#8216;Umar conveyed the message to &#8216;Aisha.) She said, &#8220;I had the idea of having this place for myself but today I prefer him (&#8216;Umar) to myself (and allow him to be buried there).&#8221; When &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar returned, &#8216;Umar asked him, &#8220;What (news) do you have?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;O chief of the believers! She has allowed you (to be buried there).&#8221; On that &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Nothing was more important to me than to be buried in that (sacred) place. So, when I expire, carry me there and pay my greetings to her (&#8216;Aisha ) and say, &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks permission; and if she gives permission, then bury me (there) and if she does not, then take me to the grave-yard of the Muslims. I do not think any person has more right for the caliphate than those with whom Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) was always pleased till his death. And whoever is chosen by the people after me will be the caliph, and you people must listen to him and obey him,&#8221; and then he mentioned the name of &#8216;Uthman, &#8216;Ali, Talha, Az-Zubair, &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf and Sad bin Abi Waqqas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By this time a young man from Ansar came and said, &#8220;O chief of the believers! Be happy with Allah&#8217;s glad tidings. The grade which you have in Islam is known to you, then you became the caliph and you ruled with justice and then you have been awarded martyrdom after all this.&#8221; &#8216;Umar replied, &#8220;O son of my brother! Would that all that privileges will counterbalance (my short comings), so that I neither lose nor gain anything. I recommend my successor to be good to the early emigrants and realize their rights and to protect their honor and sacred things. And I also recommend him to be good to the Ansar who before them, had homes (in Medina) and had adopted the Faith. He should accept the good of the righteous among them and should excuse their wrongdoers. I recommend him to abide by the rules and regulations concerning the Dhimmis (protectees) of Allah and His Apostle, to fulfill their contracts completely and fight for them and not to tax (overburden) them beyond their capabilities.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Lahab, may Allah curse him, once said to the Prophet (p.b.u.h), &#8220;Perish you all the day.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Thy Prophet sent Muadh to Yemen and said, &#8220;Invite the people to testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and if they obey you to do so, then teach them that Allah has enjoined on them five prayers in every day and night (in twenty-four hours), and if they obey you to do so, then teach them that Allah has made it obligatory for them to pay the Zakat from their property and it is to be taken from the wealthy among them and given to the poor.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A man said to the Prophet &#8220;Tell me of such a deed as will make me enter Paradise.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;What is the matter with him? What is the matter with him?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;He has something to ask. (What he needs greatly) The Prophet said: (In order to enter Paradise) you should worship Allah and do not ascribe any partners to Him, offer prayer perfectly, pay the Zakat and keep good relations with your Kith and kin.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 12, Vol 8).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A delegation of the tribe of &#8216;Abdul Qais came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We are from the tribe of Rabi&#8217;a, and the infidels of the tribe of Mudar stands between us and you; so we cannot come to you except during the Sacred Months. Please order us to do something (religious deeds) which we may carry out and also invite to it our people whom we have left behind.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I order you to do four things and forbid you four others: (I order you) to have faith in Allah, and confess that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, (and the Prophet gestured with his hand like this (i.e. one knot) and to offer prayers perfectly and to pay the Zakat, and to pay one-fifth of the booty in Allah&#8217;s Cause. And I forbid you to use Dubba&#8217;, Hantam, Naqir and Muzaffat (all these are the names of utensils used for preparing alcoholic drinks).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Apostle died and Abu Bakr became the caliph some Arabs renegade (reverted to disbelief) (Abu Bakr decided to declare war against them), &#8216;Umar, said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;How can you fight with these people although Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;I have been ordered (by Allah) to fight the people till they say: &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and whoever said it then he will save his life and property from me except on trespassing the law (rights and conditions for which he will be punished justly), and his accounts will be with Allah.&#8217; &#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;By Allah! I will fight those who differentiate between the prayer and the Zakat as Zakat is the compulsory right to be taken from the property (according to Allah&#8217;s orders) By Allah! If they refuse to pay me even a she-kid which they used to pay at the time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle . I would fight with them for withholding it&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;By Allah, it was nothing, but Allah opened Abu Bakr&#8217;s chest towards the decision (to fight) and I came to know that his decision was right.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.044.663">Volume 3, Book 44, Number 663: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent an army towards the east coast  and appointed Abu &#8216;Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah as their chief, and the army consisted of  three-hundred men including myself. We marched on till we reached a place where our food  was about to finish. Abu- &#8216;Ubaida ordered us to collect all the journey food and it was  collected. My (our) journey food was dates. Abu &#8216;Ubaida kept on giving us our daily ration  in small amounts from it, till it was exhausted. The share of everyone of us used to be  one date only.&#8221; I said, &#8220;How could one date benefit you?&#8221; Jabir replied,  &#8220;We came to know its value when even that too finished.&#8221; Jabir added, &#8220;When  we reached the sea-shore, we saw a huge fish which was like a small mountain. The army ate  from it for eighteen days. Then Abu &#8216;Ubaida ordered that two of its ribs be fixed and they  were fixed in the ground. Then he ordered that a she-camel be ridden and it passed under  the two ribs (forming an arch) without touching them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 664: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Salama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the journey food diminished and the people were  reduced to poverty. They went to the Prophet and asked his permission to slaughter their  camels, and he agreed. &#8216;Umar met them and they told him about it, and he said, &#8220;How  would you survive after slaughtering your camels?&#8221; Then he went to the Prophet and  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! How would they survive after slaughtering their  camels?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered &#8216;Umar, &#8220;Call upon the people to bring what has  remained of their food.&#8221; A leather sheet was spread and al I the journey food was  collected and heaped over it. Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up and invoked Allah to bless it, and  then directed all the people to come with their utensils, and they started taking from it  till all of them got what was sufficient for them. Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8220;I  testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and I am His Apostle. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Rafi bin Khadij: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We used to offer the &#8216;Asr prayer with the Prophet and  slaughter a camel, the meat of which would be divided in ten parts. We would eat the  cooked meat before sunset. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 666: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;When the people of Ash&#8217;ari tribe  ran short of food during the holy battles, or the food of their families in Medina ran  short, they would collect all their remaining food in one sheet and then distribute it  among themselves equally by measuring it with a bowl. So, these people are from me, and I  am from them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 667: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that Abu Bakr As-Siddiq wrote to him the law of Zakat which  was made obligatory by Allah&#8217;s Apostle. He wrote: &#8216;Partners possessing joint property  (sheep) have to pay its Zakat equally. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.044.668"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 668: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abaya bin Rafa&#8217;a bin Raft&#8217; bin Khadij: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My grandfather said, &#8220;We were in the company of the  Prophet at Dhul-Hulaifa. The people felt hungry and captured some camels and sheep (as  booty). The Prophet was behind the people. They hurried and slaughtered the animals and  put their meat in pots and started cooking it. (When the Prophet came) he ordered the pots  to be upset and then he distributed the animals (of the booty), regarding ten sheep as  equal to one camel. One of the camels fled and the people ran after it till they were  exhausted. At that time there were few horses. A man threw an arrow at the camel, and  Allah stopped the camel with it. The Prophet said, &#8220;Some of these animals are like  wild animals, so if you lose control over one of these animals, treat it in this way (i.e.  shoot it with an arrow).&#8221; Before distributing them among the soldiers my grandfather  said, &#8220;We may meet the enemies in the future and have no knives; can we slaughter the  animals with reeds?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Use whatever causes blood to flow, and  eat the animals if the name of Allah has been mentioned on slaughtering them. Do not  slaughter with teeth or fingernails and I will tell you why: It is because teeth are bones  (i.e. cannot cut properly) and fingernails are the tools used by the Ethiopians (whom we  should not imitate for they are infidels).&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.044.669"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 669: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet decreed that one should not eat two dates  together at a time unless he gets the permission from his companions (sharing the meal  with him). </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.044.670"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 670: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabala: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;While at Medina we were struck with famine. Ibn  Az-Zubair used to provide us with dates as our food. Ibn &#8216;Umar used to pass by us and say,  &#8220;Don&#8217;t eat two dates together at a time as the Prophet has forbidden eating two dates  together at a time (in a gathering) unless one takes the permission of one&#8217;s companion  brother.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.044.671"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 671: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Nafi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;If one  manumits his share of a jointly possessed slave, and can afford the price of the other  shares according to the adequate price of the slave, the slave will be completely  manumitted; otherwise he will be partially manumitted.&#8217; &#8221; (Aiyub, a sub-narrator is  not sure whether the saying &#8221; &#8230; otherwise he will be partially manumitted&#8221; was  said by Nafi&#8217; or the Prophet.) </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.044.672"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 672: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever manumits his share of a  jointly possessed slave, it is imperative for him to get that slave manumitted completely  by paying the remaining price, and if he does not have sufficient money to manumit him,  then the price of the slave should be estimated justly, and he is to be allowed to work  and earn the amount that will manumit him (without overburdening him)&#8221;. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.044.673"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 673: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated An-Nu&#8217;man bin Bashir: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The example of the person abiding  by Allah&#8217;s order and restrictions in comparison to those who violate them is like the  example of those persons who drew lots for their seats in a boat. Some of them got seats  in the upper part, and the others in the lower. When the latter needed water, they had to  go up to bring water (and that troubled the others), so they said, &#8216;Let us make a hole in  our share of the ship (and get water) saving those who are above us from troubling them.  So, if the people in the upper part left the others do what they had suggested, all the  people of the ship would be destroyed, but if they prevented them, both parties would be  safe.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.044.674"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 674: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Urwa bin Az-Zubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That he had asked &#8216;Aisha about the meaning of the Statement  of Allah: &#8220;If you fear that you shall not Be able to deal justly With the orphan  girls, then Marry (Other) women of your choice Two or three or four.&#8221; (4.3) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>She said, &#8220;O my nephew! This is about the orphan girl  who lives with her guardian and shares his property. Her wealth and beauty may tempt him  to marry her without giving her an adequate Mahr (bridal-money) which might have been  given by another suitor. So, such guardians were forbidden to marry such orphan girls  unless they treated them justly and gave them the most suitable Mahr; otherwise they were  ordered to marry any other woman.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha further said, &#8220;After that verse the  people again asked the Prophet (about the marriage with orphan &#8216;girls), so Allah revealed  the following verses:&#8211; &#8216;They ask your instruction Concerning the women. Say: Allah  Instructs you about them And about what is Recited unto you In the Book, concerning The  orphan girls to whom You give not the prescribed portions and yet whom you Desire to  marry&#8230;&#8221; (4.127) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>What is meant by Allah&#8217;s Saying:&#8211; &#8216;And about what is  Recited unto you is the former verse which goes:&#8211; &#8216;If you fear that you shall not Be able  to deal justly With the orphan girls, then Marry (other) women of your choice.&#8217; (4.3)  &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s saying in the other verse:&#8211;&#8216;Yet whom you desire to marry&#8217;  (4.127) means the desire of the guardian to marry an orphan girl under his supervision  when she has not much property or beauty (in which case he should treat her justly). The  guardians were forbidden to marry their orphan girls possessing property and beauty  without being just to them, as they generally refrain from marrying them (when they are  neither beautiful nor wealthy).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet established the right of Shu&#8217;fa (i.e.  Pre-emption) in joint properties; but when the land is divided and the ways are  demarcated, then there is no pre-emption. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The right of pre-emption is valid  in every joint property, but when the land is divided and the way is demarcated, then  there is no right of pre-emption.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sulaiman bin Abu Muslim: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked Abu Minhal about money exchange from hand to hand.  He said, &#8220;I and a partner of mine bought something partly in cash and partly on  credit.&#8221; Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib passed by us and we asked about it. He replied, &#8220;I  and my partner Zaid bin Al-Arqam did the same and then went to the Prophet and asked him  about it. He said, &#8216;Take what was from hand to hand and leave what was on credit.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Hisham: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that his mother Zainab bint Humaid took him to the Prophet  and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Take the pledge of allegiance from him.&#8221; But he  said, &#8220;He is still too young for the pledge,&#8221; and passed his hand on his (i.e.  &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s) head and invoked for Allah&#8217;s blessing for him. Zuhra bin Ma&#8217;bad stated that  he used to go with his grandfather, &#8216;Abdullah bin Hisham, to the market to buy foodstuff.  Ibn &#8216;Umar and Ibn Az-Zubair would meet him and say to him, &#8220;Be our partner, as the  Prophet invoked Allah to bless you.&#8221; So, he would be their partner, and very often he  would win a camel&#8217;s load and send it home. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever manumits his share of a  jointly possessed slave, it is essential for him to manumit the slave completely if he has  sufficient money. Otherwise he should look for some work for the slave (to earn what would  enable him to emancipate himself), without overburdening him with work.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 683: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet (along with his companions) reached Mecca in  the morning of the fourth of Dhul-Hijja assuming Ihram for Hajj only. So when we arrived  at Mecca, the Prophet ordered us to change our intentions of the Ihram for&#8217;Umra and that  we could finish our Ihram after performing the &#8216;Umra and could go to our wives (for sexual  intercourse). The people began talking about that. Jabir said surprisingly, &#8220;Shall we  go to Mina while semen is dribbling from our male organs?&#8221; Jabir moved his hand while  saying so. When this news reached the Prophet he delivered a sermon and said, &#8220;I have  been informed that some peoples were saying so and so; By Allah I fear Allah more than you  do, and am more obedient to Him than you. If I had known what I know now, I would not have  brought the Hadi (sacrifice) with me and had the Hadi not been with me, I would have  finished the Ihram.&#8221; At that Suraqa bin Malik stood up and asked &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! Is this permission for us only or is it forever?&#8221; The Prophet replied,  &#8220;It is forever.&#8221; In the meantime &#8216;Ali bin Abu Talib came from Yemen and was  saying Labbaik for what the Prophet has intended. (According to another man, &#8216;Ali was  saying Labbaik for Hajj similar to Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8217;s). The Prophet told him to keep on the  Ihram and let him share the Hadi with him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 684: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abaya bin Rifaa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My grandfather, Rafi bin Khadij said, &#8220;We were in the  valley of Dhul-Hulaifa of Tuhama in the company of the Prophet and had some camels and  sheep (of the booty). The people hurried (in slaughtering the animals) and put their meat  in the pots and started cooking. Allah&#8217;s Apostle came and ordered them to upset the pots,  and distributed the booty considering one camel as equal to ten sheep. One of the camels  fled and the people had only a few horses, so they got worried. (The camel was chased and)  a man slopped the camel by throwing an arrow at it. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Some of these  animals are untamed like wild animals, so if anyone of them went out of your control, then  you should treat it as you have done now.&#8217; &#8221; My grandfather said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! We fear that we may meet our enemy tomorrow and we have no knives, could we  slaughter the animals with reeds?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, or you can use what  would make blood flow (slaughter) and you can eat what is slaughtered and the Name of  Allah is mentioned at the time of slaughtering. But don&#8217;t use teeth or fingernails (in  slaughtering). I will tell you why, as for teeth, they are bones, and fingernails are used  by Ethiopians for slaughtering. (See Hadith 668) </font></p>

It is shameful for us. But we  will mortgage our arms to you.&#8221; So, Muhammad bin Maslama promised him that he would  come to him next time. They (Muhammad bin Maslama and his companions came to him as  promised and murdered him. Then they went to the Prophet and told him about it. </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said (to me), &#8220;Produce two witnesses (to support your claim); otherwise the  defendant has the right to take an oath (to refute your claim).&#8217; I said, &#8216;The defendant  would not mind to take a false oath.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8216;Whoever took a  false oath in order to grab someone else&#8217;s property will meet Allah, Allah will be angry  with him.&#8217; Allah then revealed what Confirmed it.&#8221; Al-Ash&#8217;ath then recited the  following Verse:&#8211;&#8220;Verily! Those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah&#8217;s  covenant, And their oaths . . . (to) . . . they shall have a painful torment!&#8217; (3.77) (See  Hadith No. 546) </font></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 43:</p>
<h3 align="center">Oppressions</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.043.620"></a>Volume 3, Book 43, Number 620:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;When the believers pass safely over (the bridge across) Hell, they will be stopped at a bridge in between Hell and Paradise where they will retaliate upon each other for the injustices done among them in the world, and when they get purified of all their sins, they will be admitted into Paradise. By Him in Whose Hands the life of Muhammad is everybody will recognize his dwelling in Paradise better than he recognizes his dwelling in this world.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 621:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Safwan bin Muhriz Almazini:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was walking with Ibn &#8216;Umar holding his hand, a man came in front of us and asked, &#8220;What have you heard from Allah&#8217;s Apostle about An-Najwa?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;Allah will bring a believer near Him and shelter him with His Screen and ask him: Did you commit such-and-such sins? He will say: Yes, my Lord. Allah will keep on asking him till he will confess all his sins and will think that he is ruined. Allah will say: &#8216;I did screen your sins in the world and I forgive them for you today&#8217;, and then he will be given the book of his good deeds. Regarding infidels and hypocrites (their evil acts will be exposed publicly) and the witnesses will say: These are the people who lied against their Lord. Behold! The Curse of Allah is upon the wrongdoers.&#8221; (11.18)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 622:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;A Muslim is a brother of another Muslim, so he should not oppress him, nor should he hand him over to an oppressor. Whoever fulfilled the needs of his brother, Allah will fulfill his needs; whoever brought his (Muslim) brother out of a discomfort, Allah will bring him out of the discomforts of the Day of Resurrection, and whoever screened a Muslim, Allah will screen him on the Day of Resurrection . &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 623:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Help your brother, whether he is an oppressor or he is an oppressed one.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 624:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Help your brother, whether he is an oppressor or he is an oppressed one. People asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! It is all right to help him if he is oppressed, but how should we help him if he is an oppressor?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;By preventing him from oppressing others.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 625:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Muawiya bin Suwald:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib saying, &#8220;The Prophet orders us to do seven things and prohibited us from doing seven other things.&#8221; Then Al-Bara&#8217; mentioned the following:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) To pay a visit to the sick (inquiring about his health),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) to follow funeral processions,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) to say to a sneezer, &#8220;May Allah be merciful to you&#8221; (if he says, &#8220;Praise be to Allah!&#8221;),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4) to return greetings,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5) to help the oppressed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(6) to accept invitations,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(7) to help others to fulfill their oaths. (See Hadith No. 753, Vol. 7)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 626:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;A believer to another believer is like a building whose different parts enforce each other.&#8221; The Prophet then clasped his hands with the fingers interlaced (while saying that).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever has oppressed another person concerning his reputation or anything else, he should beg him to forgive him before the Day of Resurrection when there will be no money (to compensate for wrong deeds), but if he has good deeds, those good deeds will be taken from him according to his oppression which he has done, and if he has no good deeds, the sins of the oppressed person will be loaded on him.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 630:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the explanation of the following verse:&#8211; &#8220;If a wife fears Cruelty or desertion On her husband&#8217;s part.&#8221; (4.128) A man may dislike his wife and intend to divorce her, so she says to him, &#8220;I give up my rights, so do not divorce me.&#8221; The above verse was revealed concerning such a case.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 631:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sahl bin Sad As-Sa&#8217;idi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A drink (milk mixed with water) was brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle who drank some of it. A boy was sitting to his right, and some old men to his left. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to the boy, &#8220;Do you allow me to give the rest of the drink to these people?&#8221; The boy said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I will not give preference to anyone over me to drink the rest of it from which you have drunk.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then handed the bowl (of drink) to the boy. (See Hadith No. 541).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 632:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin Zaid:</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 633:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Salama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That there was a dispute between him and some people (about a piece of land). When he told &#8216;Aisha about it, she said, &#8220;O Abu Salama! Avoid taking the land unjustly, for the Prophet said, &#8216;Whoever usurps even one span of the land of somebody, his neck will be encircled with it down the seven earths.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 634:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salim&#8217;s father (i.e. &#8216;Abdullah):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever takes a piece of the land of others unjustly, he will sink down the seven earths on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 635:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;We were in Medina with some of the Iraqi people, and we were struck with famine and Ibn Az-Zubair used to give us dates. Ibn &#8216;Umar used to pass by and say, &#8220;The Prophet forbade us to eat two dates at a time, unless one takes the permission of one&#8217;s companions.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 636:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Mas&#8217;ud:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was an Ansari man called Abu Shu&#8217;aib who had a slave butcher. Abu Shu&#8217;aib said to him, &#8220;Prepare a meal sufficient for five persons so that I might invite the Prophet besides other four persons.&#8221; Abu Shu&#8217;aib had seen the signs of hunger on the face of the Prophet and so he invited him. Another man who was not invited, followed the Prophet. The Prophet said to Abu Shu&#8217;aib, &#8220;This man has followed us. Do you allow him to share the meal?&#8221; Abu Shu&#8217;aib said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 637:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The most hated person in the sight of Allah is the most quarrelsome person.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 638:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Um Salama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) Allah&#8217;s Apostle heard some people quarreling at the door of his dwelling. He came out and said, &#8220;I am only a human being, and opponents come to me (to settle their problems); maybe someone amongst you can present his case more eloquently than the other, whereby I may consider him true and give a verdict in his favor. So, If I give the right of a Muslim to another by mistake, then it is really a portion of (Hell) Fire, he has the option to take or give up (before the Day of Resurrection).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 639:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever has (the following) four characters will be a hypocrite, and whoever has one of the following four characteristics will have one characteristic of hypocrisy until he gives it up. These are: (1 ) Whenever he talks, he tells a lie; (2) whenever he makes a promise, he breaks it; (3) whenever he makes a covenant he proves treacherous; (4) and whenever he quarrels, he behaves impudently in an evil insulting manner.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 33 Vol. 1)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 640:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hind bint &#8216;Utba (Abu Sufyan&#8217;s wife) came and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Abu Sufyan is a miser. Is there any harm if I spend something from his property for our children?&#8221; He said, there is no harm for you if you feed them from it justly and reasonably (with no extravagance).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 641:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Uqba bin &#8216;Amir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We staid to the Prophet, &#8220;You send us out and it happens that we have to stay with such people as do not entertain us. What do you think about it? He said to us, &#8220;If you stay with some people and they entertain you as they should for a guest, accept their hospitality, but If they don&#8217;t do, take the right of the guest from them.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 642:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah took away the soul of His Prophet at his death, the Ansar assembled In the shed of Bani Sa&#8217;ida.

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 643:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Araj:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Huraira said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;No-one should prevent his neighbor from fixing a wooden peg in his wall.&#8221; Abu Huraira said (to his companions), &#8220;Why do I find you averse to it? By Allah, I certainly will narrate it to you.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was the butler of the people in the house of Abu Talha, and in those days drinks were prepared from dates. Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered somebody to announce that alcoholic drinks had been prohibited. Abu Talha ordered me to go out and spill the wine. I went out and spilled it, and it flowed in the streets of Medina. Some people said, &#8220;Some people were killed and wine was still in their stomachs.&#8221; On that the Divine revelation came:&#8211; &#8220;On those who believe And do good deeds There is no blame For what they ate (in the past).&#8221; (5.93)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Beware! Avoid sitting on he roads (ways).&#8221; The people said, &#8220;There is no way out of it as these are our sitting places where we have talks.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;If you must sit there, then observe the rights of the way.&#8221; They asked, &#8220;What are the rights of the way?&#8221; He said, &#8220;They are the lowering of your gazes (on seeing what is illegal to look at), refraining from harming people, returning greetings, advocating good and forbidding evil.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 646:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;A man felt very thirsty while he was on the way, there he came across a well. He went down the well, quenched his thirst and came out. Meanwhile he saw a dog panting and licking mud because of excessive thirst. He said to himself, &#8220;This dog is suffering from thirst as I did.&#8221; So, he went down the well again and filled his shoe with water and watered it. Allah thanked him for that deed and forgave him. The people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Is there a reward for us in serving the animals?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;Yes, there is a reward for serving any animate (living being).&#8221; (See Hadith No. 551)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 647:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Usama bin Zaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once the Prophet stood at the top of one of the castles (or higher buildings) of Medina and said, &#8220;Do you see what I see? No doubt I am seeing the spots of afflictions amongst your houses as numerous as the spots where rain-drops fall (during a heavy rain). (See Hadith No. 102)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 648:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I had been eager to ask &#8216;Umar about the two ladies from among the wives of the Prophet regarding whom Allah said (in the Qur&#8217;an saying): If you two (wives of the Prophet namely Aisha and Hafsa) turn in repentance to Allah your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet likes) (66.4), till performed the Hajj along with &#8216;Umar (and on our way back from Hajj) he went aside (to answer the call of nature) and I also went aside along with him carrying a tumbler of water. When he had answered the call of nature and returned. I poured water on his hands from the tumbler and he performed ablution. I said, &#8220;O Chief of the believers! &#8216; Who were the two ladies from among the wives of the Prophet to whom Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;If you two return in repentance (66.4)? He said, &#8220;I am astonished at your question, O Ibn &#8216;Abbas. They were Aisha and Hafsa.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then &#8216;Umar went on relating the narration and said. &#8220;I and an Ansari neighbor of mine from Bani Umaiya bin Zaid who used to live in &#8216;Awali Al-Medina, used to visit the Prophet in turns. He used to go one day, and I another day. When I went I would bring him the news of what had happened that day regarding the instructions and orders and when he went, he used to do the same for me. We, the people of Quraish, used to have authority over women, but when we came to live with the Ansar, we noticed that the Ansari women had the upper hand over their men, so our women started acquiring the habits of the Ansari women. Once I shouted at my wife and she paid me back in my coin and I disliked that she should answer me back. She said, &#8216;Why do you take it ill that I retort upon you? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet retort upon him, and some of them may not speak with him for the whole day till night.&#8217; What she said scared me and I said to her, &#8216;Whoever amongst them does so, will be a great loser.&#8217; Then I dressed myself and went to Hafsa and asked her, &#8216;Does any of you keep Allah&#8217;s Apostle angry all the day long till night?&#8217; She replied in the affirmative. I said, &#8216;She is a ruined losing person (and will never have success)! Doesn&#8217;t she fear that Allah may get angry for the anger of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and thus she will be ruined? Don&#8217;t ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle too many things, and don&#8217;t retort upon him in any case, and don&#8217;t desert him. Demand from me whatever you like, and don&#8217;t be tempted to imitate your neighbor (i.e. &#8216;Aisha) in her behavior towards the Prophet), for she (i.e. Aisha) is more beautiful than you, and more beloved to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In those days it was rumored that Ghassan, (a tribe living in Sham) was getting prepared their horses to invade us. My companion went (to the Prophet on the day of his turn, went and returned to us at night and knocked at my door violently, asking whether I was sleeping. I was scared (by the hard knocking) and came out to him. He said that a great thing had happened. I asked him: What is it? Have Ghassan come? He replied that it was worse and more serious than that, and added that Allah&#8217;s Apostle had divorced all his wives. I said, Hafsa is a ruined loser! I expected that would happen some day.&#8217; So I dressed myself and offered the Fajr prayer with the Prophet. Then the Prophet entered an upper room and stayed there alone. I went to Hafsa and found her weeping. I asked her, &#8216;Why are you weeping? Didn&#8217;t I warn you? Have Allah&#8217;s Apostle divorced you all?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;I don&#8217;t know. He is there in the upper room.&#8217; I then went out and came to the pulpit and found a group of people around it and some of them were weeping. Then I sat with them for some time, but could not endure the situation. So I went to the upper room where the Prophet was and requested to a black slave of his: &#8220;Will you get the permission of (Allah&#8217;s Apostle) for Umar (to enter)? The slave went in, talked to the Prophet about it and came out saying, &#8216;I mentioned you to him but he did not reply.&#8217; So, I went and sat with the people who were sitting by the pulpit, but I could not bear the situation, so I went to the slave again and said: &#8220;Will you get he permission for Umar? He went in and brought the same reply as before. When I was leaving, behold, the slave called me saying, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle has granted you permission.&#8221; So, I entered upon the Prophet and saw him lying on a mat without wedding on it, and the mat had left its mark on the body of the Prophet, and he was leaning on a leather pillow stuffed with palm fires. I greeted him and while still standing, I said: &#8220;Have you divorced your wives?&#8217; He raised his eyes to me and replied in the negative. And then while still standing, I said chatting: &#8220;Will you heed what I say, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We, the people of Quraish used to have the upper hand over our women (wives), and when we came to the people whose women had the upper hand over them&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar told the whole story (about his wife). &#8220;On that the Prophet smiled.&#8221; &#8216;Umar further said, &#8220;I then said, &#8216;I went to Hafsa and said to her: Do not be tempted to imitate your companion (&#8216;Aisha) for she is more beautiful than you and more beloved to the Prophet.&#8217; The Prophet smiled again. When I saw him smiling, I sat down and cast a glance at the room, and by Allah, I couldn&#8217;t see anything of importance but three hides. I said (to Allah&#8217;s Apostle) &#8220;Invoke Allah to make your followers prosperous for the Persians and the Byzantines have been made prosperous and given worldly luxuries, though they do not worship Allah?&#8217; The Prophet was leaning then (and on hearing my speech he sat straight) and said, &#8216;O Ibn Al-Khatttab! Do you have any doubt (that the Hereafter is better than this world)? These people have been given rewards of their good deeds in this world only.&#8217; I asked the Prophet . &#8216;Please ask Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for me. The Prophet did not go to his wives because of the secret which Hafsa had disclosed to &#8216;Aisha, and he said that he would not go to his wives for one month as he was angry with them when Allah admonished him (for his oath that he would not approach Maria). When twenty-nine days had passed, the Prophet went to Aisha first of all. She said to him, &#8216;You took an oath that you would not come to us for one month, and today only twenty-nine days have passed, as I have been counting them day by day.&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;The month is also of twenty-nine days.&#8217; That month consisted of twenty-nine days. &#8216;Aisha said, &#8216;When the Divine revelation of Choice was revealed, the Prophet started with me, saying to me, &#8216;I am telling you something, but you needn&#8217;t hurry to give the reply till you can consult your parents.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha knew that her parents would not advise her to part with the Prophet . The Prophet said that Allah had said:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O Prophet! Say To your wives; If you desire The life of this world And its glitter, &#8230; then come! I will make a provision for you and set you free In a handsome manner. But if you seek Allah And His Apostle, and The Home of the Hereafter, then Verily, Allah has prepared For the good-doers amongst you A great reward.&#8217; (33.28) &#8216;Aisha said, &#8216;Am I to consult my parents about this? I indeed prefer Allah, His Apostle, and the Home of the Hereafter.&#8217; After that the Prophet gave the choice to his other wives and they also gave the same reply as &#8216;Aisha did.&#8221;</p>

<h3 align="center">Praying at Night in Ramadaan (Taraweeh)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.032.226"></a>Volume 3, Book 32, Number 226:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying regarding Ramadan, &#8220;Whoever prayed at night in it (the month of Ramadan) out of sincere Faith and hoping for a reward from Allah, then all his previous sins will be forgiven.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 227:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever prayed at night the whole month of Ramadan out of sincere Faith and hoping for a reward from Allah, then all his previous sins will be forgiven.&#8221; Ibn Shihab (a sub-narrator) said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle died and the people continued observing that (i.e. Nawafil offered individually, not in congregation), and it remained as it was during the Caliphate of Abu Bakr and in the early days of &#8216;Umar&#8217;s Caliphate.&#8221; &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin &#8216;Abdul Qari said, &#8220;I went out in the company of &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab one night in Ramadan to the mosque and found the people praying in different groups. A man praying alone or a man praying with a little group behind him. So, &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;In my opinion I would better collect these (people) under the leadership of one Qari (Reciter) (i.e. let them pray in congregation!)&#8217;. So, he made up his mind to congregate them behind Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b. Then on another night I went again in his company and the people were praying behind their reciter. On that, &#8216;Umar remarked, &#8216;What an excellent Bid&#8217;a (i.e. innovation in religion) this is; but the prayer which they do not perform, but sleep at its time is better than the one they are offering.&#8217; He meant the prayer in the last part of the night. (In those days) people used to pray in the early part of the night.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 228:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to pray (at night) in Ramadan.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 229:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Urwa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That he was informed by &#8216;Aisha, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle went out in the middle of the night and prayed in the mosque and some men prayed behind him. In the morning, the people spoke about it and then a large number of them gathered and prayed behind him (on the second night). In the next morning the people again talked about it and on the third night the mosque was full with a large number of people. Allah&#8217;s Apostle came out and the people prayed behind him. On the fourth night the Mosque was overwhelmed with people and could not accommodate them, but the Prophet came out (only) for the morning prayer. When the morning prayer was finished he recited Tashah-hud and (addressing the people) said, &#8220;Amma ba&#8217;du, your presence was not hidden from me but I was afraid lest the night prayer (Qiyam) should be enjoined on you and you might not be able to carry it on.&#8221; So, Allah&#8217;s Apostle died and the situation remained like that (i.e. people prayed individually). &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 230:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Salama bin &#8216;Abdur Rahman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that he asked &#8216;Aisha &#8220;How was the prayer of Allah&#8217;s Apostle in Ramadan?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;He did not pray more than eleven Rakat in Ramadan or in any other month. He used to pray four Rakat &#8212;- let alone their beauty and length&#8212;-and then he would pray four &#8212;-let alone their beauty and length &#8212;-and then he would pray three Rakat (Witr).&#8221; She added, &#8220;I asked, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do you sleep before praying the Witr?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;O &#8216;Aisha! My eyes sleep but my heart does not sleep.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 231:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever fasted the month of Ramadan out of sincere Faith (i.e. belief) and hoping for a reward from Allah, then all his past sins will be forgiven, and whoever stood for the prayers in the night of Qadr out of sincere Faith and hoping for a reward from Allah, then all his previous sins will be forgiven .&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 232:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some men amongst the companions of the Prophet were shown in their dreams that the night of Qadr was in the last seven nights of Ramadan. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;It seems that all your dreams agree that (the Night of Qadr) is in the last seven nights, and whoever wants to search for it (i.e. the Night of Qadr) should search in the last seven (nights of Ramadan).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 233:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Salama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Abu Sa&#8217;id, and he was a friend of mine, (about the Night of Qadr) and he said, &#8220;We practiced Itikaf (seclusion in the mosque) in the middle third of the month of Ramadan with the Prophet . In the morning of the 20th of Ramadan, the Prophet came and addressed us and said, &#8216;I was informed of (the date of the Night of Qadr) but I was caused to forget it; so search for it in the odd nights of the last ten nights of the month of Ramadan. (In the dream) I saw myself prostrating in mud and water (as a sign). So, whoever was in l&#8217;tikaf with me should return to it with me (for another 10-day&#8217;s period)&#8217;, and we returned. At that time there was no sign of clouds in the sky but suddenly a cloud came and it rained till rain-water started leaking through the roof of the mosque which was made of date-palm leaf stalks. Then the prayer was established and I saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle prostrating in mud and water and I saw the traces of mud on his forehead.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 234:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Search for the Night of Qadr in the odd nights of the last ten days of Ramadan.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 235:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to practice Itikaf (in the mosque) in the middle third of Ramadan and after passing the twenty nights he used to go back to his house on the 21st, and the people who were in Itikaf with him also used to go back to their houses. Once in Ramadan, in which he practiced Itikaf, he established the night prayers at the night in which he used to return home, and then he addressed the people and ordered them whatever Allah wished him to order and said, &#8220;I used to practice Itikaf for these ten days (i.e. the middle 113rd but now I intend to stay in Itikaf for the last ten days (of the month); so whoever was in Itikaf with me should stay at his place of seclusion. I have verily been shown (the date of) this Night (of Qadr) but I have forgotten it. So search for it in the odd nights of the last ten days (of this month). I also saw myself (in the dream) prostrating in mud and water.&#8221; On the night of the 21st, the sky was covered with clouds and it rained, and the rain-water started leaking through the roof of the mosque at the praying place of the Prophet . I saw with my own eyes the Prophet at the completion of the morning prayer leaving with his face covered with mud and water.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 236:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Look for (the Night of Qadr).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 237:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to practice Itikaf in the last ten nights of Ramadan and used to say, &#8220;Look for the Night of Qadr in the last ten nights of the month of Ramadan ,&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 238:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Look for the Night of Qadr in the last ten nights of Ramadan ,&#8217; on the night when nine or seven or five nights remain out of the last ten nights of Ramadan (i.e. 21, 23, 25, respectively).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 239:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The Night of Qadr is in the last ten nights of the month (Ramadan), either on the first nine or in the last (remaining) seven nights (of Ramadan).&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas added, &#8220;Search for it on the twenty-fourth (of Ramadan).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 240:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ubada bin As-Samit:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet came out to inform us about the Night of Qadr but two Muslims were quarreling with each other. So, the Prophet said, &#8220;I came out to inform you about the Night of Qadr but such-and-such persons were quarreling, so the news about it had been taken away; yet that might be for your own good, so search for it on the 29th, 27th and 25th (of Ramadan).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 241:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With the start of the last ten days of Ramadan, the Prophet used to tighten his waist belt (i.e. work hard) and used to pray all the night, and used to keep his family awake for the prayers.</p>

<h3 align="center">Retiring to a Mosque for Remembrance ofAllah (I&#8217;tikaf)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.033.242"></a>Volume 3, Book 33, Number 242:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to practise Itikaf in the last ten days of the month of Ramadan.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 243:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) The Prophet used to practice Itikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan till he died and then his wives used to practice Itikaf after him.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 244:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to practice Itikaf in the middle ten days of Ramadan and once he stayed in Itikaf till the night of the twenty-first and it was the night in the morning of which he used to come out of his Itikaf. The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever was in Itikaf with me should stay in Itikaf for the last ten days, for I was informed (of the date) of the Night (of Qadr) but I have been caused to forget it. (In the dream) I saw myself prostrating in mud and water in the morning of that night. So, look for it in the last ten nights and in the odd ones of them.&#8221; It rained that night and the roof of the mosque dribbled as it was made of leaf stalks of date-palms. I saw with my own eyes the mark of mud and water on the forehead of the Prophet (i.e. in the morning of the twenty-first).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 245:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to (put) bend his head (out) to me while he was in Itikaf in the mosque during my monthly periods and I would comb and oil his hair.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 246:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to let his head in (the house) while he was in the mosque and I would comb and oil his hair. When in Itikaf he used not to enter the house except for a need.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 247:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to embrace me during my menses. He also used to put his head out of the mosque while he was in Itikaf, and I would wash it during my menses.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 248:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar asked the Prophet &#8220;I vowed in the Pre-lslamic period of ignorance to stay in Itikaf for one night in Al-Masjid al-Haram.&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Fulfill your vow.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 249:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aisha said, &#8220;the Prophet used to practice Itikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan and I used to pitch a tent for him, and after offering the morning prayer, he used to enter the tent.&#8221; Hafsa asked the permission of &#8216;Aisha to pitch a tent for her and she allowed her and she pitched her tent. When Zainab bint Jahsh saw it, she pitched another tent. In the morning the Prophet noticed the tents. He said, &#8216;What is this?&#8221; He was told of the whole situation. Then the Prophet said, &#8220;Do you think that they intended to do righteousness by doing this?&#8221; He therefore abandoned the Itikaf in that month and practiced Itikaf for ten days in the month of Shawwal.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 250:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet intended to practice Itikaf and when he reached the place where he intended to perform Itikaf, he saw some tents, the tents of &#8216;Aisha, Hafsa and Zainab. So, he said, &#8220;Do you consider that they intended to do righteousness by doing this?&#8221; And then he went away and did not perform Itikaf (in Ramadan) but performed it in the month of Shawwal for ten days.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 251:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ali bin Al-Husain:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Safiya, the wife of the Prophet told me that she went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to visit him in the mosque while he was in Itikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan. She had a talk with him for a while, then she got up in order to return home. The Prophet accompanied her. When they reached the gate of the mosque, opposite the door of Um-Salama, two Ansari men were passing by and they greeted Allah&#8217;s Apostle . He told them: Do not run away! And said, &#8220;She is (my wife) Safiya bint Huyai.&#8221; Both of them said, &#8220;Subhan Allah, (How dare we think of any evil) O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; And they felt it. The Prophet said (to them), &#8220;Satan reaches everywhere in the human body as blood reaches in it, (everywhere in one&#8217;s body). I was afraid lest Satan might insert an evil thought in your minds.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 252:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Salama bin &#8216;Abdur-Rahman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Abu Said Al-Khudri, &#8220;Did you hear Allah&#8217;s Apostle talking about the Night of Qadr?&#8221; He replied in the affirmative and said, &#8220;Once we were in Itikaf with Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the middle ten days of (Ramadan) and we came out of it in the morning of the twentieth, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle- delivered a sermon on the 20th (of Ramadan) and said, &#8216;I was informed (of the date) of the Night of Qadr (in my dream) but had forgotten it. So, look for it in the odd nights of the last ten nights of the month of Ramadan. I saw myself prostrating in mud and water on that night (as a sign of the Night of Qadr). So, whoever had been in Itikaf with Allah&#8217;s Apostle should return for it.&#8217; The people returned to the mosque (for Itikaf). There was no trace of clouds in the sky. But all of a sudden a cloud came and it rained. Then the prayer was established (they stood for the prayer) and Allah&#8217;s Apostle prostrated in mud and water and I saw mud over the forehead and the nose of the Prophet.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 253:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle practiced Itikaf with him while she ad bleeding in between her periods and she would see red (blood) or yellowish traces, and sometimes we put a tray beneath her when she offered the prayer.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 254:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali bin Al-Husain (from Safiya, the Prophet&#8217;s wife):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wives of the Prophet were with him in the mosque (while he was in Itikaf) and then they departed and the Prophet said to Safiya bint Huyai, &#8220;Don&#8217;t hurry up, for I shall accompany you,&#8221; (and her dwelling was in the house of Usama). The Prophet went out and in the meantime two Ansari men met him and they looked at the Prophet and passed by. The Prophet said to them, &#8220;Come here. She is (my wife) Safiya bint Huyai.&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Subhan Allah, (How dare we think of evil) O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! (we never expect anything bad from you).&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Satan circulates in the human being as blood circulates in the body, and I was afraid lest Satan might insert an evil thought in your minds.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 255:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali bin Al-Husain from Safiya:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Safiya went to the Prophet while he was in Itikaf. When she returned, the Prophet accompanied her walking. An Ansari man saw him. When the Prophet noticed him, he called him and said, &#8220;Come here. She is Safiya. (Sufyan a sub-narrator perhaps said that the Prophet had said, &#8220;This is Safiya&#8221;). And Satan circulates in the body of Adam&#8217;s offspring as his blood circulates in it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(A sub-narrator asked Sufyan, &#8220;Did Safiya visit him at night?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Of course, at night.&#8221;)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 256:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We practiced Itikaf with Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the middle ten days (of Ramadan). In the morning of the twentieth (of Ramadan) we shifted our baggage, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to us and said, &#8220;Whoever was m Itikaf should return to his place of Itikaf, for I saw (i.e. was informed about the date of) this Night (of Qadr) and saw myself prostrating in mud and water.&#8221; When I returned to my place the sky was overcast with clouds and it rained. By Him Who sent Muhammad with the Truth, the sky was covered with clouds from the end of that day, and the mosque which was roofed with leaf-stalks of date palm trees (leaked with rain) and I saw the trace of mud and water over the nose of the Prophet and its tip.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 257:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amra bint &#8216;Abdur-Rahman from &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to practice Itikaf every year in the month of Ramadan. And after offering the morning prayer, he used to enter the place of his Itikaf. &#8216;Aisha asked his permission to let her practice Itikaf and he allowed her, and so she pitched a tent in the mosque. When Hafsa heard of that, she also pitched a tent (for herself), and when Zainab heard of that, she too pitched another tent. When, in the morning, Allah&#8217;s Apostle had finished the morning prayer, he saw four tents and asked, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; He was informed about it. He then said, &#8220;What made them do this? Is it righteousness? Remove the tents, for I do not want to see them.&#8221; So, the tents were removed. The Prophet did not perform Itikaf that year in the month of Ramadan, but did it in the last ten days of Shawwal.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 258:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I vowed in the Pre-lslamic period to perform Itikaf in Al-Masjid-al-Haram for one night.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Fulfill your vow.&#8221; So, he performed Itikaf for one night.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 259:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that &#8216;Umar had vowed in the Pre-lslamic period to perform Itikaf in Al-Masjid-al-Haram. (A sub-narrator thinks that &#8216;Umar vowed to perform Itikaf for one night.) Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to &#8216;Umar, &#8220;Fulfill your vow.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 260:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to perform Itikaf every year in the month of Ramadan for ten days, and when it was the year of his death, he stayed in Itikaf for twenty days.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 261:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amra bint &#8216;AbdurRahman from &#8216;Aisha: Allah&#8217;s Apostle mentioned that he would practice Itikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan. &#8216;Aisha asked his permission to perform Itikaf and he permitted her. Hafsa asked &#8216;Aisha to take his permission for</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 262:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Urwa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aisha during her menses used to comb and oil the hair of the Prophet while he used to be in Itikaf in the mosque. He would stretch out his head towards her while she was in her chamber.</p>

<h3 align="center">Prayer at Night (Tahajjud)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.021.221"></a>Volume 2, Book 21, Number 221:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet got up at night to offer the Tahajjud prayer, he used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allahumma lakal-hamd. Anta qaiyimus-samawati wal-ard wa man fihinna. Walakal-hamd, Laka mulkus-samawati wal-ard wa man fihinna. Walakal-hamd, anta nurus-samawati wal-ard. Walakalhamd, anta-l-haq wa wa&#8217;duka-l-haq, wa liqa&#8217;uka Haq, wa qualuka Haq, wal-jannatu Haq wan-naru Haq wannabiyuna Haq. Wa Muhammadun, sallal-lahu&#8217;alaihi wasallam, Haq, was-sa&#8217;atu Haq. Allahumma aslamtu Laka wabika amantu, wa &#8216;Alaika tawakkaltu, wa ilaika anabtu wa bika khasamtu, wa ilaika hakamtu faghfir li ma qaddamtu wama akh-khartu wama as-rartu wama&#8217;a lantu, anta-l-muqaddim wa anta-l-mu akh-khir, la ilaha illa anta (or la ilaha ghairuka).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Allah! All the praises are for you, You are the Holder of the Heavens and the Earth, And whatever is in them. All the praises are for You; You have the possession of the Heavens and the Earth And whatever is in them. All the praises are for You; You are the Light of the Heavens and the Earth And all the praises are for You; You are the King of the Heavens and the Earth; And all the praises are for You; You are the Truth and Your Promise is the truth, And to meet You is true, Your Word is the truth And Paradise is true And Hell is true And all the Prophets (Peace be upon them) are true; And Muhammad is true, And the Day of Resurrection is true. O Allah ! I surrender (my will) to You; I believe in You and depend on You. And repent to You, And with Your help I argue (with my opponents, the non-believers) And I take You as a judge (to judge between us). Please forgive me my previous And future sins; And whatever I concealed or revealed And You are the One who make (some people) forward And (some) backward. There is none to be worshipped but you . Sufyan said that &#8216;Abdul Karim Abu Umaiya added to the above, &#8216;Wala haula Wala quwata illa billah&#8217; (There is neither might nor power except with Allah).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 222:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salim&#8217;s father:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the life-time of the Prophet whosoever saw a dream would narrate it to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. I had a wish of seeing a dream to narrate it to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) I was a grown up boy and used to sleep in the Mosque in the life-time of the Prophet. I saw in the dream that two angels caught hold of me and took me to the Fire which was built all round like a built well and had two poles in it and the people in it were known to me. I started saying, &#8220;I seek refuge with Allah from the Fire.&#8221; Then I met another angel who told me not to be afraid. I narrated the dream to Hafsa who told it to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. The Prophet said, &#8220;Abdullah is a good man. I wish he prayed Tahajjud.&#8221; After that &#8216;Abdullah (i.e. Salim&#8217;s father) used to sleep but a little at night.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 223:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to offer eleven Rakat and that was his prayer. He used to prolong the prostration to such an extent that one could recite fifty verses (of the Quran) before he would lift his head. He used to pray two Rakat (Sunna) before the Fajr prayer and then used to lie down on his right side till the call-maker came and informed him about the prayer.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 224:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jundab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet became sick and did not get up (for Tahajjud prayer) for a night or two.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 225:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jundab bin &#8216;Abdullah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Gabriel did not come to the Prophet (for some time) and so one of the Quraish women said, &#8220;His Satan has deserted him.&#8221; So came the Divine Revelation: &#8220;By the forenoon And by the night When it is still! Your Lord (O Muhammad) has neither Forsaken you Nor hated you.&#8221; (93.1-3)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 226:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Um Salama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One night the Prophet got up and said, &#8220;Subhan Allah! How many afflictions Allah has revealed tonight and how many treasures have been sent down (disclosed). Go and wake the sleeping lady occupants of these dwellings up (for prayers), perhaps a well-dressed in this world may be naked in the Hereafter.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 227:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One night Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me and Fatima, the daughter of the Prophet and asked, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you pray (at night)?&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Our souls are in the hands of Allah and if He wants us to get up He will make us get up.&#8221; When I said that, he left us without saying anything and I heard that he was hitting his thigh and saying, &#8220;But man is more quarrelsome than anything.&#8221; (18.54)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 228:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to give up a good deed, although he loved to do it, for fear that people might act on it and it might be made compulsory for them. The Prophet never prayed the Duha prayer, but I offer it.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 229:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha, the mother of the faithful believers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One night Allah&#8217;s Apostle offered the prayer in the Mosque and the people followed him. The next night he also offered the prayer and too many people gathered. On the third and the fourth nights more people gathered, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not come out to them. In the morning he said, &#8220;I saw what you were doing and nothing but the fear that it (i.e. the prayer) might be enjoined on you, stopped me from coming to you.&#8221; And that happened in the month of Ramadan.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 230:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Mughira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to stand (in the prayer) or pray till both his feet or legs swelled. He was asked why (he offered such an unbearable prayer) and he said, &#8220;should I not be a thankful slave.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 231:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr bin Al-&#8216;As:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle told me, &#8220;The most beloved prayer to Allah is that of David and the most beloved fasts to Allah are those of David. He used to sleep for half of the night and then pray for one third of the night and again sleep for its sixth part and used to fast on alternate days.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 232:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Masruq:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked &#8216;Aisha which deed was most loved by the Prophet. She said, &#8220;A deed done continuously.&#8221; I further asked, &#8220;When did he used to get up (in the night for the prayer).&#8221; She said, &#8220;He used to get up on hearing the crowing of a cock.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 233:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Ashath:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In my house he (Prophet (p.b.u.h) ) never passed the last hours of the night but sleeping.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 235:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas bin Malik said, &#8220;The Prophet (p.b.u.h) and Zaid bin Thabit took their Suhur together. When they finished it, the Prophet stood for the (Fajr) prayer and offered it.&#8221; We asked Anas, &#8220;What was the interval between their finishing the Suhur and the starting of the morning prayer?&#8221; Anas replied, &#8220;It was equal to the time taken by a person in reciting fifty verses of the Quran.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 236:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu-Wa il:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;One night I offered the Tahajjud prayer with the Prophet and he kept on standing till an ill-thought came to me.&#8221; We said, &#8220;What was the ill-thought?&#8221; He said, &#8220;It was to sit down and leave the Prophet (standing).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 237:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hudhaifa :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever the Prophet got up for Tahajjud prayer he used to clean his mouth (and teeth) with Siwak.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 238:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! How is the prayer of the night?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Two Rakat followed by two Rakat and so on, and when you apprehend the approaching dawn, offer one Raka as Witr.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 239:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prayer of the Prophet used to be of thirteen Rakat, i.e. of the night prayer.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 240:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Masruq:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Aisha about the night prayer of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and she said, &#8220;It was seven, nine or eleven Rakat besides the two Rakat of the Fajr prayer (i.e. Sunna). &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 241:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha,</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 242:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sometimes Allah&#8217;s Apostle would not fast (for so many days) that we thought that he would not fast that month and he sometimes used to fast (for so many days) that we thought he would not leave fasting through-out that month and (as regards his prayer and sleep at night), if you wanted to see him praying at night, you could see him praying and if you wanted to see him sleeping, you could see him sleeping.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 243:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Satan puts three knots at the back of the head of any of you if he is asleep. On every knot he reads and exhales the following words, &#8216;The night is long, so stay asleep.&#8217; When one wakes up and remembers Allah, one knot is undone; and when one performs ablution, the second knot is undone, and when one prays the third knot is undone and one gets up energetic with a good heart in the morning; otherwise one gets up lazy and with a mischievous heart.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 244:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Samura bin Jundab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said in his narration of a dream that he saw, &#8220;He whose head was being crushed with a stone was one who learnt the Quran but never acted on it, and slept ignoring the compulsory prayers.&#8221;</p>
<hr>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A person was mentioned before the Prophet (p.b.u.h) and he was told that he had kept on sleeping till morning and had not got up for the prayer. The Prophet said, &#8220;Satan urinated in his ears.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 246:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;Our Lord, the Blessed, the Superior, comes every night down on the nearest Heaven to us when the last third of the night remains, saying: &#8220;Is there anyone to invoke Me, so that I may respond to invocation? Is there anyone to ask Me, so that I may grant him his request? Is there anyone seeking My forgiveness, so that I may forgive him?&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 247:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Aswad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked &#8216;Aisha &#8220;How is the night prayer of the Prophet?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;He used to sleep early at night, and get up in its last part to pray, and then return to his bed. When the Muadh-dhin pronounced the Adhan, he would get up. If he was in need of a bath he would take it; otherwise he would perform ablution and then go out (for the prayer).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 248:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Salma bin &#8216;Abdur Rahman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked &#8216;Aisha, &#8220;How is the prayer of Allah&#8217;s Apostle during the month of Ramadan.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle never exceeded eleven Rakat in Ramadan or in other months; he used to offer four Rakat&#8211; do not ask me about their beauty and length, then four Rakat, do not ask me about their beauty and length, and then three Rakat.&#8221; Aisha further said, &#8220;I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do you sleep before offering the Witr prayer?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;O &#8216;Aisha! My eyes sleep but my heart remains awake&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 249:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I did not see the Prophet reciting (the Quran) in the night prayer while sitting except when he became old; when he used to recite while sitting, and when thirty or forty verses remained from the Sura, he would get up and recite them and then bow.</p>
<hr>

<p style="text-align:justify;">that he remembered Allah&#8217;s Apostle and he also remembered a mouthful of water which he had thrown on his face, after taking it from a well that was in their house. Mahmud said that he had heard Itban bin Malik, who was present with Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the battle of Badr saying, &#8220;I used to lead my people at Bani Salim in the prayer and there was a valley between me and those people. Whenever it rained it used to be difficult for me to cross it to go to their mosque. So I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8216;I have weak eye-sight and the valley between me and my people flows during the rainy season and it becomes difficult for me to cross it; I wish you would come to my house and pray at a place so that I could take that place as a praying place.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;I will do so.&#8217; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr came to my house in the (next) morning after the sun had risen high. Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked my permission to let him in and I admitted him. He did not sit before saying, &#8216;Where do you want us to offer the prayer in your house?&#8217; I pointed to the place where I wanted him to pray. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up for the prayer and started the prayer with Takbir and we aligned in rows behind him; and he offered two Rakat, and finished them with Taslim, and we also performed Taslim with him. I detained him for a meal called &#8220;Khazir&#8221; which I had prepared for him.&#8211;(&#8220;Khazir&#8221; is a special type of dish prepared from barley flour and meat soup)&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the neighbors got the news that Allah&#8217;s Apostle was in my house, they poured it till there were a great number of men in the house. One of them said, &#8216;What is wrong with Malik, for I do not see him?&#8217; One of them replied, &#8216;He is a hypocrite and does not love Allah and His Apostle.&#8217; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Don&#8217;t say this. Haven&#8217;t you seen that he said, &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah for Allah&#8217;s sake only.&#8217; The man replied, &#8216;Allah and His Apostle know better; but by Allah, we never saw him but helping and talking with the hypocrites.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8216;No doubt, whoever says. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and by that he wants the pleasures of Allah, then Allah will save him from Hell.&#8221; Mahmud added, &#8220;I told the above narration to some people, one of whom was Ab-u Aiyub, the companion of Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the battle in which he (Ab-u Aiyub) died and Yazid bin Mu&#8217;aw7ya was their leader in Roman Territory. Abu Aiyub denounced the narration and said, &#8216;I doubt that Allah&#8217;s Apostle ever said what you have said.&#8217; I felt that too much, and I vowed to Allah that if I remained alive in that holy battle, I would (go to Medina and) ask Itban bin Malik if he was still living in the mosque of his people. So when he returned, I assumed Ihram for Hajj or &#8216;Umra and then I proceeded on till I reached Medina. I went to Bani Salim and Itban bin Malik, who was by then an old blind man, was leading his people in the prayer. When he finished the prayer, I greeted him and introduced myself to him and then asked him about that narration. He told that narration again in the same manner as he had narrated it the first time.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to go to the Mosque of Quba (sometimes) walking and sometimes riding. Added Nafi (in another narration), &#8220;He then would offer two Rakat (in the Mosque of Quba).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I found a purse containing one hundred Diners. So I went to  the Prophet (and informed him about it), he said, &#8220;Make public announcement about it  for one year&#8221; I did so, but nobody turned up to claim it, so I again went to the  Prophet who said, &#8220;Make public announcement for another year.&#8221; I did, but none  turned up to claim it. I went to him for the third time and he said, &#8220;Keep the  container and the string which is used for its tying and count the money it contains and  if its owner comes, give it to him; otherwise, utilize it.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The sub-narrator Salama said, &#8220;I met him (Suwaid,  another sub-narrator) in Mecca and he said, &#8216;I don&#8217;t know whether Ubai made the  announcement for three years or just one year.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 42, Number 609: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A bedouin went to the Prophet and asked him about picking  up a lost thing. The Prophet said, &#8220;Make public announcement about it for one year.  Remember the description of its container and the string with which it is tied; and if  somebody comes and claims it and describes it correctly, (give it to him); otherwise,  utilize it.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What about a lost sheep?&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;It is for you, for your brother (i.e. its owner), or for the  wolf.&#8221; He further asked, &#8220;What about a lost camel?&#8221; On that the face of the  Prophet became red (with anger) and said, &#8220;You have nothing to do with it, as it has  its feet, its water reserve and can reach places of water and drink, and eat trees.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 42, Number 610: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sulaiman bin Bilal from Yahya: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Yazid Maula Al-Munba&#8217;ith heard Zaid bin Khalid al-Juham  saying, &#8220;The Prophet was asked about Luqata. He said, &#8216;Remember the description of  its container and the string it is tied with, and announce it publicly for one year.&#8217;  &#8221; Yazid added, &#8220;If nobody claims then the person who has found it can spend it,  and it is regarded as a trust entrusted to him.&#8221; Yahya said, &#8220;I do not know  whether the last sentences were said by the Prophet or by Yazid.&#8221; Zaid further said,  &#8220;The Prophet was asked, &#8216;What about a lost sheep?&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;Take it, for it  is for you or for your brother (i.e. its owner) or for the wolf.&#8221; Yazid added that it  should also be announced publicly. The man then asked the Prophet about a lost camel. The  Prophet said, &#8220;Leave it, as it has its feet, water container (reservoir), and it will  reach a place of water and eat trees till its owner finds it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 42, Number 611: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Zaid bin Khalid: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came and asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about picking a lost  thing. The Prophet said, &#8220;Remember the description of its container and the string it  is tied with, and make public announcement about it for one year. If the owner shows up,  give it to him; otherwise, do whatever you like with it.&#8221; He then asked, &#8220;What  about a lost sheep?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;It is for you, for your brother (i.e.  its owner), or for the wolf.&#8221; He further asked, &#8220;What about a lost camel?&#8221;  The Prophet said, &#8220;It is none of your concern. It has its water-container (reservoir)  and its feet, and it will reach water and drink it and eat the trees till its owner finds  it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 42, Number 612: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet passed a date fallen on the way and said,  &#8220;Were I not afraid that it may be from a Sadaqa (charitable gifts), I would have  eaten it.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, &#8220;Sometimes  when I return home and find a date fallen on my bed, I pick it up in order to eat it, but  I fear that it might be from a Sadaqa, so I throw it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 42, Number 613: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah gave victory to His Apostle over the people of  Mecca, Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up among the people and after glorifying Allah, said,  &#8220;Allah has prohibited fighting in Mecca and has given authority to His Apostle and  the believers over it, so fighting was illegal for anyone before me, and was made legal  for me for a part of a day, and it will not be legal for anyone after me. Its game should  not be chased, its thorny bushes should not be uprooted, and picking up its fallen things  is not allowed except for one who makes public announcement for it, and he whose relative  is murdered has the option either to accept a compensation for it or to retaliate.&#8221;  Al-&#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Except Al-ldhkhir, for we use it in our graves and houses.&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Except Al-ldhkhir.&#8221; Abu Shah, a Yemenite, stood up and  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Get it written for me.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;Write it for Abu Shah.&#8221; (The sub-narrator asked Al-Auza&#8217;i): What did he mean by  saying, &#8220;Get it written, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;The speech which  he had heard from Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 42, Number 614: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;An animal should not be milked  without the permission of its owner. Does any of you like that somebody comes to his store  and breaks his container and takes away his food? The udders of the animals are the stores  of their owners where their provision is kept, so nobody should milk the animals of  somebody else, without the permission of its owner.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about the Luqata. He said,  &#8220;Make public announcement of it for one year, then remember the description of its  container and the string it is tied with, utilize the money, and if its owner comes back  after that, give it to him.&#8221; The people asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What about a  lost sheep?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Take it, for it is for you, for your  brother, or for the wolf.&#8221; The man asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What about a lost  camel?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle got angry and his cheeks or face became red, and said,  &#8220;You have no concern with it as it has its feet, and its water-container, till its  owner finds it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I as in the company of Salman bin Rabi&#8217;a and Suhan,  in one of the holy battles, I found a whip. One of them told me to drop it but I refused  to do so and said that I would give it to its owner if I found him, otherwise I would  utilize it. On our return we performed Hajj and on passing by Medina, I asked Ubai bin  Ka&#8217;b about it. He said, &#8220;I found a bag containing a hundred Dinars in the lifetime of  the Prophet and took it to the Prophet who said to me, &#8216;Make public announcement about it  for one year.&#8217; So, I announced it for one year and went to the Prophet who said, &#8216;Announce  it publicly for another year.&#8217; So, I announced it for another year. I went to him again  and he said, &#8220;Announce for an other year.&#8221; So I announced for still another  year. I went to the Prophet for the fourth time, and he said, &#8216;Remember the amount of  money, the description of its container and the string it is tied with, and if the owner  comes, give it to him; otherwise, utilize it.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A bedouin asked the Prophet about the Luqata.

The face of the  Prophet become red and he said, &#8220;You have o concern with it as it has its water  reservoir and feet and it will reach water and drink and eat trees. Leave it till its  owner finds it.&#8221; He then asked the Prophet about a lost sheep. The Prophet said,  &#8220;It is for you, for your brother, or for the wolf.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was on my way, all of a sudden I saw a shepherd  driving his sheep, I asked him whose servant he was. He replied that he was the servant of  a man from Quraish, and then he mentioned his name and I recognized him. I asked, &#8220;Do  your sheep have some milk?&#8221; He replied in the affirmative. I said, &#8220;Are you  going to milk for me?&#8221; He replied in the affirmative. I ordered him and he tied the  legs of one of the sheep. Then I told him to clean the udder (teats) of dust and to remove  dust off his hands. He removed the dust off his hands by clapping his hands. He then  milked a little milk. I put the milk for Allah&#8217;s Apostle in a pot and closed its mouth  with a piece of cloth and poured water over it till it became cold. I took it to the  Prophet and said, &#8220;Drink, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He drank it till I was pleased. </font></p>

<h3 align="center">Virtues of Madinah</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.030.091"></a>Volume 3, Book 30, Number 91:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Medina is a sanctuary from that place to that. Its trees should not be cut and no heresy should be innovated nor any sin should be committed in it, and whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits sins (bad deeds), then he will incur the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 409, Vol 9).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 92:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet came to Medina and ordered a mosque to be built and said, &#8220;O Bani Najjar! Suggest to me the price (of your land).&#8221; They said, &#8220;We do not want its price except from Allah&#8221; (i.e. they wished for a reward from Allah for giving up their land freely). So, the Prophet ordered the graves of the pagans to be dug out and the land to be levelled, and the date-palm trees to be cut down. The cut date-palms were fixed in the direction of the Qibla of the mosque.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 93:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;I have made Medina a sanctuary between its two (Harrat) mountains.&#8221; The Prophet went to the tribe of Bani Haritha and said (to them), &#8220;I see that you have gone out of the sanctuary,&#8221; but looking around, he added, &#8220;No, you are inside the sanctuary.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 94:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have nothing except the Book of Allah and this written paper from the Prophet (where-in is written:) Medina is a sanctuary from the &#8216;Air Mountain to such and such a place, and whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits a sin, or gives shelter to such an innovator in it will incur the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted. And the asylum (of protection) granted by any Muslim is to be secured (respected) by all the other Muslims; and whoever betrays a Muslim in this respect incurs the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, and none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted, and whoever (freed slave) befriends (take as masters) other than his manumitters without their permission incurs the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, and none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 95:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I was ordered to migrate to a town which will swallow (conquer) other towns and is called Yathrib and that is Medina, and it turns out (bad) persons as a furnace removes the impurities of iron.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 96:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Humaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We came with the Prophet from Tabuk, and when we reached near Medina, the Prophet said, &#8220;This is Tabah.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 97:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If I saw deers grazing in Medina, I would not chase them, for Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;(Medina) is a sanctuary between its two mountains.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 98:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;The people will leave Medina in spite of the best state it will have, and none except the wild birds and the beasts of prey will live in it, and the last persons who will die will be two shepherds from the tribe of Muzaina, who will be driving their sheep towards Medina, but will find nobody in it, and when they reach the valley of Thaniyat-al-Wada&#8217;, they will fall down on their faces dead.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 99:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Zuhair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Yemen will be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families, and those who will obey them to migrate (to Yemen) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew. Sham will also be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families and those who will obey them, to migrate (to Sham) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew. &#8216;Iraq will be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families and those who will obey them to migrate (to &#8216;Iraq) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 100:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Verily, Belief returns and goes back to Medina as a snake returns and goes back to its hole (when in danger).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 101:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;None plots against the people of Medina but that he will be dissolved (destroyed) like the salt is dissolved in water.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 102:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Usama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once the Prophet stood at the top of a (looked out from upon one) castle amongst the castles (or the high buildings) of Medina and said, &#8220;Do you see what I see? (No doubt) I see the spots where afflictions will take place among your houses (and these afflictions will be) as numerous as the spots where rain-drops fall.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 103:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The terror caused by Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal will not enter Medina and at that time Medina will have seven gates and there will be two angels at each gate guarding them.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 104:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;There are angels guarding the entrances (or roads) of Medina, neither plague nor Ad-Dajjal will be able to enter it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 105:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;There will be no town which Ad-Dajjal will not enter except Mecca and Medina, and there will be no entrance (road) (of both Mecca and Medina) but the angels will be standing in rows guarding it against him, and then Medina will shake with its inhabitants thrice (i.e. three earth-quakes will take place) and Allah will expel all the nonbelievers and the hypocrites from it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 106:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle told us a long narrative about Ad-Dajjal, and among the many things he mentioned, was his saying, &#8220;Ad-Dajjal will come and it will be forbidden for him to pass through the entrances of Medina. He will land in some of the salty barren areas (outside) Medina; on that day the best man or one of the best men will come up to him and say, &#8216;I testify that you are the same Dajjal whose description was given to us by Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8217; Ad-Dajjal will say to the people, &#8216;If I kill this man and bring him back to life again, will you doubt my claim?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;No.&#8217; Then Ad-Dajjal will kill that man and bring him back to life. That man will say, &#8216;Now I know your reality better than before.&#8217; Ad-Dajjal will say, &#8216;I want to kill him but I cannot.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 107:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A bedouin came to the Prophet and gave a pledge of allegiance for embracing Islam. The next day he came with fever and said (to the Prophet ), &#8220;Please cancel my pledge (of embracing Islam and of emigrating to Medina).&#8221; The Prophet refused (that request) three times and said, &#8220;Medina is like a furnace, it expels out the impurities (bad persons) and selects the good ones and makes them perfect.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 108:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Thabit:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet went out for (the battle of) Uhud, some of his companions (hypocrites) returned (home). A party of the believers remarked that they would kill those (hypocrites) who had returned, but another party said that they would not kill them. So, this Divine Inspiration was revealed: &#8220;Then what is the matter with you that you are divided into two parties concerning the hypocrites.&#8221; (4.88) The Prophet said, &#8220;Medina expels the bad persons from it, as fire expels the impurities of iron.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 109:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah! Bestow on Medina twice the blessings You bestowed on Mecca.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 110:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever the Prophet returned from a journey and observed the walls of Medina, he would make his Mount go fast, and if he was on an animal (i.e. a horse), he would make it gallop because of his love for Medina.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 111:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The people of) Bani Salama intended to shift near the mosque (of the Prophet) but Allah&#8217;s Apostle disliked to see Medina vacated and said, &#8220;O the people of Bani Salama! Don&#8217;t you think that you will be rewarded for your footsteps which you take towards the mosque?&#8221; So, they stayed at their old places.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 112:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, &#8220;There is a garden from the gardens of Paradise between my house and my pulpit, and my pulpit is on my Lake Fount (Al-Kauthar).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 113:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Apostle reached Medina, Abu Bakr and Bilal became ill. When Abu Bakr&#8217;s fever got worse, he would recite (this poetic verse): &#8220;Everybody is staying alive with his People, yet Death is nearer to him than His shoe laces.&#8221; And Bilal, when his fever deserted him, would recite: &#8220;Would that I could stay overnight in A valley wherein I would be Surrounded by Idhkhir and Jalil (kinds of good-smelling grass). Would that one day I could Drink the water of the Majanna, and Would that (The two mountains) Shama and Tafil would appear to me!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah! Curse Shaiba bin Rabi&#8217;a and &#8216;Utba bin Rabi&#8217;a and Umaiya bin Khalaf as they turned us out of our land to the land of epidemics.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8220;O Allah! Make us love Medina as we love Mecca or even more than that. O Allah! Give blessings in our Sa and our Mudd (measures symbolizing food) and make the climate of Medina suitable for us, and divert its fever towards Aljuhfa.&#8221; Aisha added: When we reached Medina, it was the most unhealthy of Allah&#8217;s lands, and the valley of Bathan (the valley of Medina) used to flow with impure colored water.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 114:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Aslam from his father:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar said, O Allah! Grant me martyrdom in Your cause, and let my death be in the city of Your Apostle.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;(On the Day of Resurrection) camels  will come to their owner in the best state of health they have ever had (in the world),  and if he had not paid their Zakat (in the world) then they would tread him with their  feet; and similarly, sheep will come to their owner in the best state of health they have  ever had in the world, and if he had not paid their Zakat, then they would tread him with  their hooves and would butt him with their horns.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;One of  their rights is that they should be milked while water is kept in front of them.&#8221; The  Prophet added, &#8220;I do not want anyone of you to come to me on the Day of Resurrection,  carrying over his neck a sheep that will be bleating. Such a person will (then) say, &#8216;O  Muhammad! (please intercede for me,) I will say to him. &#8216;I can&#8217;t help you, for I conveyed  Allah&#8217;s Message to you.&#8217; Similarly, I do not want anyone of you to come to me carrying  over his neck a camel that will be grunting. Such a person (then) will say &#8220;O  Muhammad! (please intercede for me).&#8221; I will say to him, &#8220;I can&#8217;t help you for I  conveyed Allah&#8217;s message to you.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever is made wealthy by  Allah and does not pay the Zakat of his wealth, then on the Day of Resurrection his wealth  will be made like a bald-headed poisonous male snake with two black spots over the eyes.  The snake will encircle his neck and bite his cheeks and say, &#8216;I am your wealth, I am your  treasure.&#8217; &#8221; Then the Prophet recited the holy verses:&#8211; &#8216;Let not those who withhold  . . .&#8217; (to the end of the verse).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;No Zakat is due on  property mounting to less than five Uqiyas (of silver), and no Zakat is due on less than  five camels, and there is no Zakat on less than five Wasqs.&#8221; (A Wasqs equals 60 Sa&#8217;s)  &amp; (1 Sa=3 K gms App.) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 488: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Zaid bin Wahab: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I passed by a place called Ar-Rabadha and by chance I met  Abu Dhar and asked him, &#8220;What has brought you to this place?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I  was in Sham and differed with Muawiya on the meaning of (the following verses of the  Quran): &#8216;They who hoard up gold and silver and spend them not in the way of Allah.&#8217;  (9.34). Muawiya said, &#8216;This verse is revealed regarding the people of the  scriptures.&#8221; I said, It was revealed regarding us and also the people of the  scriptures.&#8221; So we had a quarrel and Mu&#8217;awiya sent a complaint against me to &#8216;Uthman.  &#8216;Uthman wrote to me to come to Medina, and I came to Medina. Many people came to me as if  they had not seen me before. So I told this to &#8216;Uthman who said to me, &#8220;You may  depart and live nearby if you wish.&#8221; That was the reason for my being here for even  if an Ethiopian had been nominated as my ruler, I would have obeyed him . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 489: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Ahnaf bin Qais: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was sitting with some people from Quraish, a man  with very rough hair, clothes, and appearance came and stood in front of us, greeted us  and said, &#8220;Inform those who hoard wealth, that a stone will be heated in the  Hell-fire and will be put on the nipples of their breasts till it comes out from the bones  of their shoulders and then put on the bones of their shoulders till it comes through the  nipples of their breasts the stone will be moving and hitting.&#8221; After saying that,  the person retreated and sat by the side of the pillar, I followed him and sat beside him,  and I did not know who he was. I said to him, &#8220;I think the people disliked what you  had said.&#8221; He said, &#8220;These people do not understand anything, although my friend  told me.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;Who is your friend?&#8221; He said, &#8220;The Prophet said  (to me), &#8216;O Abu Dhar! Do you see the mountain of Uhud?&#8217; And on that I (Abu Dhar) started  looking towards the sun to judge how much remained of the day as I thought that Allah&#8217;s  Apostle wanted to send me to do something for him and I said, &#8216;Yes!&#8217; He said, &#8216;I do not  love to have gold equal to the mountain of Uhud unless I spend it all (in Allah&#8217;s cause)  except three Dinars (pounds). These people do not understand and collect worldly wealth.  No, by Allah, Neither I ask them for worldly benefits nor am I in need of their religious  advice till I meet Allah, The Honorable, The Majestic.&#8221; &#8216; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was sitting with Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) two  person came to him; one of them complained about his poverty and the other complained  about the prevalence of robberies. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;As regards stealing and  robberies, there will shortly come a time when a caravan will go to Mecca (from Medina)  without any guard. And regarding poverty, The Hour (Day of Judgment) will not be  established till one of you wanders about with his object of charity and will not find  anybody to accept it And (no doubt) each one of you will stand in front of Allah and there  will be neither a curtain nor an interpreter between him and Allah, and Allah will ask  him, &#8216;Did not I give you wealth?&#8217; He will reply in the affirmative. Allah will further  ask, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t I send a messenger to you?&#8217; And again that person will reply in the  affirmative Then he will look to his right and he will see nothing but Hell-fire, and then  he will look to his left and will see nothing but Hell-fire. And so, any (each one) of you  should save himself from the fire even by giving half of a date-fruit (in charity). And if  you do not find a half date-fruit, then (you can do it through saying) a good pleasant  word (to your brethren). (See Hadith No. 793 Vol. 4). </font></p>

Do not delay it to the time of approaching death and then say, &#8216;Give so  much to such and such, and so much to such and such.&#8217; And it has already belonged to such  and such (as it is too late).&#8221; </font></p>

(When Zainab bint Jahsh died first of  all in the caliphate of &#8216;Umar), we came to know that the long hand was a symbol of  practicing charity, so she was the first to follow the Prophet and she used to love to  practice charity.

(1) And when the miser wants to spend, it (the iron cloak)  sticks and every ring gets stuck to its place and he tries to widen it, but it did not  become wide. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Abu Bakr; sent me to (collect the Zakat from) Bahrein,  he wrote to me the following:&#8211; (In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful).  These are the orders for compulsory charity (Zakat) which Allah&#8217;s Apostle had made  obligatory for every Muslim, and which Allah had ordered His Apostle to observe: Whoever  amongst the Muslims is asked to pay Zakat accordingly, he should pay it (to the Zakat  collector) and whoever is asked more than that (what is specified in this script) he  should not pay it; for twenty-four camels or less, sheep are to be paid as Zakat; for  every five camels one sheep is to be paid, and if there are between twenty-five to  thirty-five camels, one Bint Makhad is to be paid; and if they are between thirty-six to  forty-five (camels), one Bint Labun is to be paid; and if they are between forty-six to  sixty (camels), one Hiqqa is to be paid; and if the number is between sixty-one to  seventy-five (camels), one Jadh&#8217;a is to be paid; and if the number is between seventy-six  to ninety (camels), two Bint Labuns are to be paid; and if they are from ninety-one to  one-hundred-and twenty (camels), two Hiqqas are to be paid; and if they are over  one-hundred and-twenty (camels), for every forty (over one-hundred-and-twenty) one Bint  Labun is to be paid, and for every fifty camels (over one-hundred-and-twenty) one Hiqqa is  to be paid; and who ever has got only four camels, has to pay nothing as Zakat, but if the  owner of these four camels wants to give something, he can. If the number of camels  increases to five, the owner has to pay one sheep as Zakat. As regards the Zakat for the  (flock) of sheep; if they are between forty and one-hundred-and-twenty sheep, one sheep is  to be paid; and if they are between one-hundred-and-twenty to two hundred (sheep), two  sheep are to be paid; and if they are between two-hundred to three-hundred (sheep), three  sheep are to be paid; and for over three-hundred sheep, for every extra hundred sheep, one  sheep is to be paid as Zakat. And if somebody has got less than forty sheep, no Zakat is  required, but if he wants to give, he can. For silver the Zakat is one-fortieth of the lot  (i.e. 2.5%), and if its value is less than two-hundred Dirhams, Zakat is not required, but  if the owner wants to pay he can.&#8217; </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to go there and used to drink its nice water.&#8221; Anas  added, &#8220;When these verses were revealed:&#8211;&#8216;By no means shall you Attain righteousness  unless You spend (in charity) of that Which you love. &#8216; (3.92) Abu Talha said to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah, the Blessed, the Superior says: By no means shall you  attain righteousness, unless you spend (in charity) of that which you love. And no doubt,  Bairuha&#8217; garden is the most beloved of all my property to me. So I want to give it in  charity in Allah&#8217;s Cause. I expect its reward from Allah. O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Spend it  where Allah makes you think it feasible.&#8217; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Bravo! It is  useful property. I have heard what you have said (O Abu Talha), and I think it would be  proper if you gave it to your Kith and kin.&#8217; Abu Talha said, I will do so, O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle.&#8217; Then Abu Talha distributed that garden amongst his relatives and his  cousins.&#8221; </font></p>

Give alms, for I have seen that the majority of the  dwellers of Hell-Fire were you (women).&#8221; The women asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  What is the reason for it?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;O women! You curse frequently, and are  ungrateful to your husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and  religion than you. O women, some of you can lead a cautious wise man astray.&#8221; Then he  left. And when he reached his house, Zainab, the wife of Ibn Masud, came and asked  permission to enter It was said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

Then she said, &#8220;O Prophet  of Allah! Today you ordered people to give alms and I had an ornament and intended to give  it as alms, but Ibn Masud said that he and his children deserved it more than anybody  else.&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Ibn Masud had spoken the truth. Your husband and  your children had more right to it than anybody else.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the Prophet sat on a pulpit and we sat around him.  Then he said, &#8220;The things I am afraid of most for your sake (concerning what will  befall you after me) is the pleasures and splendors of the world and its beauties which  will be disclosed to you.&#8221; Somebody said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Can the good bring  forth evil?&#8221; The Prophet remained silent for a while. It was said to that person,  &#8220;What is wrong with you? You are talking to the Prophet (p.b.u.h) while he is not  talking to you.&#8221; Then we noticed that he was being inspired divinely. Then the  Prophet wiped off his sweat and said, &#8220;Where is the questioner?&#8221; It seemed as if  the Prophet liked his question. Then he said, &#8220;Good never brings forth evil. Indeed  it is like what grows on the banks of a water-stream which either kill or make the animals  sick, except if an animal eats its fill the Khadira (a kind of vegetable) and then faces  the sun, and then defecates and urinates and grazes again. No doubt this wealth is sweet  and green. Blessed is the wealth of a Muslim from which he gives to the poor, the orphans  and to needy travelers. (Or the Prophet said something similar to it) No doubt, whoever  takes it illegally will be like the one who eats but is never satisfied, and his wealth  will be a witness against him on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; </font></p>

Bilal passed by us and we  asked him, &#8216;Ask the Prophet whether it is permissible for me to spend (the Zakat) on my  husband and the orphans under my protection.&#8217; And we requested Bilal not to inform the  Prophet about us.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) ordered (a person) to collect  Zakat, and that person returned and told him that Ibn Jamil, Khalid bin Al-Walid, and  Abbas bin &#8216;Abdul Muttalib had refused to give Zakat.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;What  made Ibn Jamll refuse to give Zakat though he was a poor man, and was made wealthy by  Allah and His Apostle ? But you are unfair in asking Zakat from Khalid as he is keeping  his armor for Allah&#8217;s Cause (for Jihad). As for Abbas bin &#8216;Abdul Muttalib, he is the uncle  of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) and Zakat is compulsory on him and he should pay it  double.&#8221; </font></p>

(Remember)  Whoever abstains from asking others, Allah will make him contented, and whoever tries to  make himself self-sufficient, Allah will make him self-sufficient. And whoever remains  patient, Allah will make him patient. Nobody can be given a blessing better and greater  than patience.&#8221; </font></p>

This property is like a sweet  fresh fruit; whoever takes it without greediness, he is blessed in it, and whoever takes  it with greediness, he is not blessed in it, and he is like a person who eats but is never  satisfied; and the upper (giving) hand is better than the lower (receiving) hand.&#8221;  Hakim added, &#8220;I said to Allah&#8217;s Apostle , &#8216;By Him (Allah) Who sent you with the  Truth, I shall never accept anything from anybody after you, till I leave this world.&#8217;  &#8221; Then Abu Bakr (during his caliphate) called Hakim to give him his share from the  war booty (like the other companions of the Prophet ), he refused to accept anything. Then  &#8216;Umar (during his caliphate) called him to give him his share but he refused. On that  &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Muslims! I would like you to witness that I offered Hakim his share  from this booty and he refused to take it.&#8221; So Hakim never took anything from anybody  after the Prophet till he died. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We took part in the holy battle of Tabuk in the company of  the Prophet and when we arrived at the Wadi-al-Qura, there was a woman in her garden. The  Prophet asked his companions to estimate the amount of the fruits in the garden, and  Allah&#8217;s Apostle estimated it at ten Awsuq (One Wasaq = 60 Sa&#8217;s) and 1 Sa&#8217;= 3 kg.  approximately). The Prophet said to that lady, &#8220;Check what your garden will  yield.&#8221; When we reached Tabuk, the Prophet said, &#8220;There will be a strong wind  to-night and so no one should stand and whoever has a camel, should fasten it.&#8221; So we  fastened our camels. A strong wind blew at night and a man stood up and he was blown away  to a mountain called Taiy, The King of Aila sent a white mule and a sheet for wearing to  the Prophet as a present, and wrote to the Prophet that his people would stay in their  place (and will pay Jizya taxation.) (1) When the Prophet reached Wadi-al-Qura he asked  that woman how much her garden had yielded. She said, &#8220;Ten Awsuq,&#8221; and that was  what Allah&#8217;s Apostle had estimated. Then the Prophet said, &#8220;I want to reach Medina  quickly, and whoever among you wants to accompany me, should hurry up.&#8221; The  sub-narrator Ibn Bakkar said something which meant: When the Prophet (p.b.u.h) saw Medina  he said, &#8220;This is Taba.&#8221; And when he saw the mountain of Uhud, he said,  &#8220;This mountain loves us and we love it. Shall I tell you of the best amongst the  Ansar?&#8221; They replied in the affirmative. He said, &#8220;The family of Bani-n-Najjar,  and then the family of Bani Sa&#8217;ida or Bani Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj. (The above-mentioned  are the best) but there is goodness in all the families of Ansar.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) appointed a man called Ibn  Al-Lutbiya, from the tribe of Al-Asd to collect Zakat from Bani Sulaim. When he returned,  (after collecting the Zakat) the Prophet checked the account with him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some people from &#8216;Uraina tribe came to Medina and its  climate did not suit them, so Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) allowed them to go to the herd of  camels (given as Zakat) and they drank their milk and urine (as medicine) but they killed  the shepherd and drove away all the camels. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent (men) in their pursuit  to catch them, and they were brought, and he had their hands and feet cut, and their eyes  were branded with heated pieces of iron and they were left in the Harra (a stony place at  Medina) biting the stones. (See Hadith No. 234, Vol. 1) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>took &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Talha to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to perform  Tahnik for him. (Tahnik was a custom among the Muslims that whenever a child was born they  used to take it to the Prophet who would chew a piece of date and put a part of its juice  in the child&#8217;s mouth). I saw the Prophet and he had an instrument for branding in his  hands and was branding the camels of Zakat. </font></p>

<h3 align="center">Penalty of Hunting while on Pilgrimage</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.029.047"></a>Volume 3, Book 29, Number 47:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My father set out (for Mecca) in the year of Al-Hudaibiya, and his companions assumed Ihram, but he did not. At that time the Prophet was informed that an enemy wanted to attack him, so the Prophet proceeded onwards. While my father was among his companions, some of them laughed among themselves. (My father said), &#8220;I looked up and saw an onager. I attacked, stabbed and caught it. I then sought my companions&#8217; help but they refused to help me. (Later) we all ate its meat. We were afraid that we might be left behind (separated) from the Prophet so I went in search of the Prophet and made my horse to run at a galloping speed at times and let it go slow at an ordinary speed at other times till I met a man from the tribe of Bani Ghifar at midnight. I asked him, &#8220;Where did you leave the Prophet ?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I left him at Ta&#8217;hun and he had the intention of having the midday rest at As-Suqya. I followed the trace and joined the Prophet and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Your people (companions) send you their compliments, and (ask for) Allah&#8217;s Blessings upon you. They are afraid lest they may be left behind; so please wait for them.&#8217; I added, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I hunted an onager and some of its meat is with me. The Prophet told the people to eat it though all of them were in the state of Ihram.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 29, Number 48:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That his father said &#8220;We proceeded with the Prophet in the year of Al-Hudaibiya and his companions assumed Ihram but I did not. We were informed that some enemies were at Ghaiqa and so we went on towards them. My companions saw an onager and some of them started laughing among themselves. I looked and saw it. I chased it with my horse and stabbed and caught it. I wanted some help from my companions but they refused. (I slaughtered it all alone). We all ate from it (i.e. its meat). Then I followed Allah&#8217;s Apostle lest we should be left behind. At times I urged my horse to run at a galloping speed and at other times at an ordinary slow speed. On the way I met a man from the tribe of Bani Ghifar at midnight. I asked him where he had left Allah&#8217;s Apostle . The man replied that he had left the Prophet at a place called Ta&#8217;hun and he had the intention of having the midday rest at As-Suqya. So, I followed Allah&#8217;s Apostle till I reached him and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have been sent by my companions who send you their greetings and compliments and ask for Allah&#8217;s Mercy and Blessings upon you. They were afraid lest the enemy might intervene between you and them; so please wait for them.&#8221; So he did. Then I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We have hunted an onager and have some of it (i.e. its meat) left over.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle told his companions to eat the meat although all of them were in a state of Ihram.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 29, Number 49:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were in the company of the Prophet at a place called Al-Qaha (which is at a distance of three stages of journey from Medina). Abu Qatada narrated through another group of narrators: We were in the company of the Prophet at a place called Al-Qaha and some of us had assumed Ihram while the others had not. I noticed that some of my companions were watching something, so I looked up and saw an onager. (I rode my horse and took the spear and whip) but my whip fell down (and I asked them to pick it up for me) but they said, &#8220;We will not help you by any means as we are in a state of Ihram.&#8221; So, I picked up the whip myself and attacked the onager from behind a hillock and slaughtered it and brought it to my companions. Some of them said, &#8220;Eat it.&#8221; While some others said, &#8220;Do not eat it.&#8221; So, I went to the Prophet who was ahead of us and asked him about it, He replied, &#8220;Eat it as it is Halal (i.e. it is legal to eat it).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 29, Number 50:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That his father had told him that Allah&#8217;s Apostle set out for Hajj and so did his companions. He sent a batch of his companions by another route and Abu Qatada was one of them. The Prophet said to them, &#8220;Proceed along the sea-shore till we meet all together.&#8221; So, they took the route of the sea-shore, and when they started all of them assumed Ihram except Abu Qatada. While they were proceeding on, his companions saw a group of onagers. Abu Qatada chased the onagers and attacked and wounded a she-onager. They got down and ate some of its meat and said to each other: &#8220;How do we eat the meat of the game while we are in a state of Ihram?&#8221; So, we (they) carried the rest of the she-onager&#8217;s meat, and when they met Allah&#8217;s Apostle they asked, saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We assumed Ihram with the exception of Abu Qatada and we saw (a group) of onagers. Abu Qatada attacked them and wounded a she-onager from them. Then we got down and ate from its meat. Later, we said, (to each other), &#8216;How do we eat the meat of the game and we are in a state of Ihram?&#8217; So, we carried the rest of its meat. The Prophet asked, &#8220;Did anyone of you order Abu Qatada to attack it or point at it?&#8221; They replied in the negative. He said, &#8220;Then eat what is left of its meat.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 29, Number 51:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From As-Sa&#8217;b bin Jath-thama Al-Laithi that the latter presented an onager to Allah&#8217;s Apostle while he was at Al-Abwa&#8217; or at Waddan, and he refused it. On noticing the signs of some unpleasant feeling of disappointment on his (As-Sab&#8217;s) face, the Prophet said to him, &#8220;I have only returned it because I am Muhrim.&#8221;</p>
<hr>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hafsa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;It is not sinful (of a Muhrim) to kill five kinds of animals, namely: the crow, the kite, the mouse, the scorpion and the rabid dog.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 29, Number 55:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Five kinds of animals are harmful and could be killed in the Haram (Sanctuary). These are: the crow, the kite, the scorpion, the mouse and the rabid dog.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 29, Number 56:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While we were in the company of the Prophet in a cave at Mina, when Surat-wal-Mursalat were revealed and he recited it and I heard it (directly) from his mouth as soon as he recited its revelation. Suddenly a snake sprang at us and the Prophet said (ordered us): &#8220;Kill it.&#8221; We ran to kill it but it escaped quickly. The Prophet said, &#8220;It has escaped your evil and you too have escaped its evil.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 29, Number 57:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha the wife of the Prophet:</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 29, Number 58:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin Abu Said Al-Maqburi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Shuraih, Al-&#8216;Adawi said that he had said to &#8216;Amr bin Sa&#8217;id when he was sending the troops to Mecca (to fight &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair), &#8220;O Chief! Allow me to tell you what Allah&#8217;s Apostle said on the day following the Conquest of Mecca. My ears heard that and my heart understood it thoroughly and I saw with my own eyes the Prophet when he, after Glorifying and Praising Allah, started saying, &#8216;Allah, not the people, made Mecca a sanctuary, so anybody who has belief in Allah and the Last Day should neither shed blood in it, nor should he cut down its trees. If anybody tells (argues) that fighting in it is permissible on the basis that Allah&#8217;s Apostle did fight in Mecca, say to him, &#8216;Allah allowed His Apostle and did not allow you.&#8217; &#8220;Allah allowed me only for a few hours on that day (of the conquest) and today its sanctity is valid as it was before. So, those who are present should inform those who are absent (concerning this fact.&#8221; Abu Shuraih was asked, &#8220;What did &#8216;Amr reply?&#8221; He said, (&#8216;Amr said) &#8216;O Abu Shuraih! I know better than you in this respect Mecca does not give protection to a sinner, a murderer or a thief.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Prophet said, &#8216;Allah has made Mecca, a sanctuary, so it was a sanctuary before me and will continue to be a sanctuary after me. It was made legal for me (i.e. I was allowed to fight in it) for a few hours of a day. It is not allowed to uproot its shrubs or to cut its trees, or to chase (or disturb) its game, or to pick up its luqata (fallen things) except by a person who would announce that (what he has found) publicly.&#8217; Al-&#8216;Abbas said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Except Al-ldhkhir (a kind of grass) (for it is used) by our goldsmiths and for our graves.&#8217; The Prophet then said, &#8216;Except Al-idhkhir.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Ikrima said, &#8216;Do you know what &#8220;chasing or disturbing&#8221; the game means?

<h3 align="center">Witr Prayer</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.016.105"></a>Volume 2, Book 16, Number 105:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once a person asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about the night prayer. Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;The night prayer is offered as two Rakat followed by two Rakat and so on and if anyone is afraid of the approaching dawn (Fajr prayer) he should pray one Raka and this will be a Witr for all the Rakat which he has prayed before.&#8221; Nafi&#8217; told that &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar used to say Taslim between (the first) two Rakat and (the third) odd one in the Witr prayer, when he wanted to attend to a certain matter (during that interval between the Rakat).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 106:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once I passed the night in the house of Maimuna (his aunt). I slept across the bed while Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his wife slept length-wise. The Prophet slept till midnight or nearly so and woke up rubbing his face and recited ten verses from Surat &#8220;Aal-Imran.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle went towards a leather skin and performed ablution in the most perfect way and then stood for the prayer. I did the same and stood beside him. The Prophet put his right hand on my head, twisted my ear and then prayed two Rakat five times and then ended his prayer with Witr. He laid down till the Muadh-dhin came then he stood up and offered two Rakat (Sunna of Fajr prayer) and then went out and offered the Fajr prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(See Hadith No. 183, Vol. 1)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 107:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Night prayer is offered as two Rakat followed by two Rakat and so on, and if you want to finish it, pray only one Raka which will be Witr for all the previous Rakat.&#8221; Al-Qasim said, &#8220;Since we attained the age of puberty we have seen some people offering a three-Rakat prayer as Witr and all that is permissible. I hope there will be no harm in it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 108:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to pray eleven Rakat at night and that was his night prayer and each of his prostrations lasted for a period enough for one of you to recite fifty verses before Allah&#8217;s Apostle raised his head. He also used to pray two Rakat (Sunna) before the (compulsory) Fajr prayer and then lie down on his right side till the Muadh-dhin came to him for the prayer.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 109:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Sirin:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Ibn &#8216;Umar, &#8220;What is your opinion about the two Rakat before the Fajr (compulsory) prayer, as to prolonging the recitation in them?&#8221; He said, &#8220;The Prophet (p.b.u.h) used to pray at night two Rakat followed by two and so on, and end the prayer by one Raka Witr. He used to offer two Rakat before the Fajr prayer immediately after the Adhan.&#8221; (Hammad, the sub-narrator said, &#8220;That meant (that he prayed) quickly.)&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 110:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle offered Witr prayer at different nights at various hours extending (from the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer) up to the last hour of the night.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 111:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (p.b.u.h) used to offer his night prayer while I was sleeping across in his bed. Whenever he intended to offer the Witr prayer, he used to wake me up and I would offer the Witr prayer too.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 112:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;Make s your last prayer at night.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 113:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin Yasar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was going to Mecca in the company of &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar and when I apprehended the approaching dawn, I dismounted and offered the Witr prayer and then joined him. &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Where have you been?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I apprehended the approaching dawn so I dismounted and prayed the Witr prayer.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it sufficient for you to follow the good example of Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Yes, by Allah.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to pray Witr on the back of the camel (while on a journey).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 114:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to offer (Nawafil) prayers on his Rahila (mount) facing its direction by signals, but not the compulsory prayer. He also used to pray Witr on his (mount) Rahila.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 115:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Muhammad bin Sirin:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas was asked, &#8220;Did the Prophet recite Qunut in the Fajr prayer?&#8221; Anas replied in the affirmative. He was further asked, &#8220;Did he recite Qunut before bowing?&#8221; Anas replied, &#8220;He recited Qunut after bowing for some time (for one month).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 116:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Asim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Anas bin Malik about the Qunut. Anas replied, &#8220;Definitely it was (recited)&#8221;. I asked, &#8220;Before bowing or after it?&#8221; Anas replied, &#8220;Before bowing.&#8221; I added, &#8220;So and so has told me that you had informed him that it had been after bowing.&#8221; Anas said, &#8220;He told an untruth (i.e. &#8220;was mistaken,&#8221; according to the Hijazi dialect). Allah&#8217;s Apostle recited Qunut after bowing for a period of one month.&#8221; Anas added, &#8220;The Prophet sent about seventy men (who knew the Quran by heart) towards the pagans (of Najd) who were less than they in number and there was a peace treaty between them and Allah&#8217;s Apostles (but the Pagans broke the treaty and killed the seventy men). So Allah&#8217;s Apostle recited Qunut for a period of one month asking Allah to punish them.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 117:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet recited Qunut for one month (in the Fajr prayer) asking Allah to punish the tribes of Ral and Dhakwan.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 118:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qunut used to be recited in the Maghrib and the Fajr prayers.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abbas bin Tamim&#8217;s uncle: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet (p.b.u.h) went out to offer the Istisqa&#8217; prayer  and turned (and put on) his cloak inside out. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.017.120"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 17, Number 120: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever the Prophet (p.b.u.h) lifted his head from the  bowing in the last Raka he used to say: &#8220;O Allah! Save &#8216;Aiyash bin Abi Rabi&#8217;a. O  Allah! Save Salama bin Hisham. O Allah! Save Walid bin Walid. O Allah! Save the weak  faithful believers. O Allah! Be hard on the tribes of Mudar and send (famine) years on  them like the famine years of (Prophet) Joseph .&#8221; The Prophet further said,  &#8220;Allah forgive the tribes of Ghifar and save the tribes of Aslam.&#8221; Abu Az-Zinad  (a sub-narrator) said, &#8220;The Qunut used to be recited by the Prophet in the Fajr  prayer.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 17, Number 121: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Masruq: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were with &#8216;Abdullah and he said, &#8220;When the Prophet  saw the refusal of the people to accept Islam he said, &#8220;O Allah! Send (famine) years  on them for (seven years) like the seven years (of famine during the time) of (Prophet)  Joseph.&#8221; So famine overtook them for one year and destroyed every kind of life to  such an extent that the people started eating hides, carcasses and rotten dead animals.  Whenever one of them looked towards the sky, he would (imagine himself to) see smoke  because of hunger. So Abu Sufyan went to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Muhammad! You order  people to obey Allah and to keep good relations with kith and kin. No doubt the people of  your tribe are dying, so please pray to Allah for them.&#8221; So Allah revealed:  &#8220;Then watch you For the day that The sky will bring forth a kind Of smoke Plainly  visible &#8230; Verily! You will return (to disbelief) On the day when We shall seize You with  a mighty grasp. (44.10-16) Ibn Masud added, &#8220;Al-Batsha (i.e. grasp) happened in the  battle of Badr and no doubt smoke, Al-Batsha, Al-Lizam, and the verse of Surat Ar-Rum have  all passed . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Dinar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My father said, &#8220;I heard Ibn &#8216;Umar reciting the poetic  verses of Abu Talib: And a white (person) (i.e. the Prophet) who is requested to pray for  rain and who takes care of the orphans and is the guardian of widows.&#8221; Salim&#8217;s father  (Ibn &#8216;Umar) said, &#8220;The following poetic verse occurred to my mind while I was looking  at the face of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) while he was praying for rain. He did not get down  till the rain water flowed profusely from every roof-g utter: And a white (person) who is  requested to pray for rain and who takes care of the orphans and is the guardian of widows  . . . And these were the words of Abu Talib.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 17, Number 123: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever drought threatened them, &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab,  used to ask Al-Abbas bin &#8216;Abdul Muttalib to invoke Allah for rain. He used to say, &#8220;O  Allah! We used to ask our Prophet to invoke You for rain, and You would bless us with  rain, and now we ask his uncle to invoke You for rain. O Allah ! Bless us with  rain.&#8221;(1) And so it would rain. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Zaid </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet went towards the Musalla and invoked Allah for  rain. He faced the Qibla and wore his cloak inside out, and offered two Rakat. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 17, Number 126: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sharik bin &#8216;Abdullah bin Abi Namir: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Anas bin Malik saying, &#8220;On a Friday a person  entered the main Mosque through the gate facing the pulpit while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was  delivering the Khutba. The man stood in front of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! The livestock are dying and the roads are cut off; so please pray to Allah for  rain.&#8217; &#8221; Anas added, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) raised both his hands and said,  &#8216;O Allah! Bless us with rain! O Allah! Bless us with rain! O Allah! Bless us with rain!&#8217;  &#8221; Anas added, &#8220;By Allah, we could not see any trace of cloud in the sky and  there was no building or a house between us and (the mountains of) Sila.&#8221; Anas added,  &#8220;A heavy cloud like a shield appeared from behind it (i.e. Sila&#8217; Mountain). When it  came in the middle of the sky, it spread and then rained.&#8221; Anas further said,  &#8220;By Allah! We could not see the sun for a week. Next Friday a person entered through  the same gate and at that time Allah&#8217;s Apostle was delivering the Friday&#8217;s Khutba. The man  stood in front of him and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The livestock are dying and the roads  are cut off, please pray to Allah to with-hold rain.&#8217; &#8221; Anas added, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s  Apostle I raised both his hands and said, &#8216;O Allah! Round about us and not on us. O Allah!  On the plateaus, on the mountains, on the hills, in the valleys and on the places where  trees grow.&#8217; So the rain stopped and we came out walking in the sun.&#8221; Sharik asked  Anas whether it was the same person who had asked for the rain (the last Friday). Anas  replied that he did not know. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Anas bin Malik said, &#8220;A person entered the Mosque on a  Friday through the gate facing the Daril-Qada&#8217; and Allah&#8217;s Apostle was standing delivering  the Khutba (sermon).

Bless us with rain. O  Allah! Bless us with rain. O Allah! Bless us with rain!&#8221; Anas added, &#8220;By Allah,  there were no clouds in the sky and there was no house or building between us and the  mountain of Silas&#8217;. Then a big cloud like a shield appeared from behind it (i.e. Silas  Mountain) and when it came in the middle of the sky, it spread and then rained. By Allah!  We could not see the sun for a week. The next Friday, a person entered through the same  gate and Allah&#8217;s Apostle was delivering the Friday Khutba and the man stood in front of  him and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The livestock are dying and the roads are cut off;  Please pray to Allah to withhold rain.&#8217; &#8221; Anas added, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle raised  both his hands and said, &#8216;O Allah!

Rain is  scarce; please ask Allah to bless us with rain.&#8217; So he invoked Allah for it, and it rained  so much that we could hardly reach our homes and it continued raining till the next  Friday.&#8221; Anas further said, &#8220;Then the same or some other person stood up and  said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Invoke Allah to withhold the rain.&#8217; On that, Allah&#8217;s Apostle I  said, &#8216;O Allah!

The same person came  again and said, &#8220;Houses have collapsed, roads are cut off, and the livestock are  destroyed.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 17, Number 133: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Masruq: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>One day I went to Ibn Masud who said, &#8220;When Quraish  delayed in embracing Islam, the Prophet I invoked Allah to curse them, so they were  afflicted with a (famine) year because of which many of them died and they ate the  carcasses and Abu Sufyan came to the Prophet and said, &#8216;O Muhammad! You came to order  people to keep good relation with kith and kin and your nation is being destroyed, so  invoke Allah I ? So the Prophet I recited the Holy verses of Sirat-Ad-Dukhan: &#8216;Then watch  you For the day that The sky will Bring forth a kind Of smoke Plainly visible.&#8217; (44.10)  When the famine was taken off, the people renegade once again as nonbelievers. The  statement of Allah, (in Sura &#8220;Ad-Dukhan&#8221;-44) refers to that: &#8216;On the day when We  shall seize You with a mighty grasp.&#8217; (44.16) And that was what happened on the day of the  battle of Badr.&#8221; Asbath added on the authority of Mansur, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle  prayed for them and it rained heavily for seven days. So the people complained of the  excessive rain. The Prophet said, &#8216;O Allah! (Let it rain) around us and not on us.&#8217; So the  clouds dispersed over his head and it rained over the surroundings.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle I was delivering the Khutba (sermon) on a  Friday when the people stood up, shouted and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! There is no  rain (drought), the trees have dried and the livestock are destroyed; Please pray to Allah  for rain.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle said twice, &#8220;O Allah! Bless us with rain.&#8221; By  Allah, there was no trace of cloud in the sky and suddenly the sky became overcast with  clouds and it started raining. The Prophet came down the pulpit and offered the prayer.  When he came back from the prayer (to his house) it was raining and it rained continuously  till the next Friday. When the Prophet started delivering the Friday Khutba (sermon), the  people started shouting and said to him, &#8220;The houses have collapsed and the roads are  cut off; so please pray to Allah to withhold the rain.&#8221; So the Prophet smiled and  said, &#8220;O Allah! Round about us and not on us.&#8221; So the sky became clear over  Medina but it kept on raining over the outskirts (of Medina) and not a single drop of rain  fell over Median. I looked towards the sky which was as bright and clear as a crown. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 17, Number 140: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Zaid Al-Ansari: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet went out towards the Musalla in order to offer  the Istisqa&#8217; prayer and when he intended to invoke (Allah) or started invoking, he faced  the Qibla and turned his cloak inside out. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 17, Number 141: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet never raised his hands for any invocation  except for that of Istisqa&#8217; and he used to raise them so much that the whiteness of his  armpits became visible. (Note: It may be that Anas did not see the Prophet raising his  hands, but it is narrated that the Prophet used to raise his hands for invocations other  than Istisqa. See Hadith No. 807 &amp; 808 and also see Hadith No. 612, Vol. 5). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 17, Number 142: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw the rain, he used to say,  &#8220;O Allah! Let it be a strong fruitful rain.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.017.143"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 17, Number 143: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the life-time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) the people  were afflicted with a (famine) year. While the Prophet was delivering the Khutba (sermon)  on the pulpit on a Friday, a Bedouin stood up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The  livestock are dying and the families (offspring) are hungry: please pray to Allah to bless  us with rain.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle raised both his hands towards the sky and at that time  there was not a trace of cloud in they sky. Then the clouds started gathering like  mountains. Before he got down from the pulpit I saw rain-water trickling down his beard.  It rained that day, the next day, the third day, the fourth day and till the next Friday,  when the same Bedouin or some other person stood up (during the Friday Khutba) and said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The houses have collapsed and the livestock are drowned. Please  invoke Allah for us.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle raised both his hands and said, &#8220;O  Allah! Around us and not on us.&#8221; Whichever side the Prophet directed his hand, the  clouds dispersed from there till a hole (in the clouds) was formed over Medina. The valley  of Qanat remained flowing (with water) for one month and none, came from outside who  didn&#8217;t talk about the abundant rain. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever a strong wind blew, anxiety appeared on the face  of the Prophet (fearing that wind might be a sign of Allah&#8217;s wrath). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;I was granted victory with As-Saba  and the nation of &#8216;Ad was destroyed by Ad-Dabur (westerly wind) . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The Hour (Last Day) will not be  established until (religious) knowledge will be taken away (by the death of religious  learned men), earthquakes will be very frequent, time will pass quickly, afflictions will  appear, murders will increase and money will overflow amongst you.&#8221; (See Hadith No.  85 Vol 1). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(The Prophet) said, &#8220;O Allah! Bless our Sham and our  Yemen.&#8221; People said, &#8220;Our Najd as well.&#8221; The Prophet again said, &#8220;O  Allah! Bless our Sham and Yemen.&#8221; They said again, &#8220;Our Najd as well.&#8221; On  that the Prophet said, &#8220;There will appear earthquakes and afflictions, and from there  will come out the side of the head of Satan.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle led the morning prayer in Al-Hudaibiya and  it had rained the previous night. When the Prophet (p.b.u.h) had finished the prayer he  faced the people and said, &#8220;Do you know what your Lord has said?&#8221; They replied,  &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; (The Prophet said), &#8220;Allah says, &#8216;In  this morning some of My worshipers remained as true believers and some became  non-believers; he who said that it had rained with the blessing and mercy of Allah is the  one who believes in Me and does not believe in star, but he who said it had rained because  of such and such (star) is a disbeliever in Me and is a believer in star.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;Keys of the unseen  knowledge are five which nobody knows but Allah . . . nobody knows what will happen  tomorrow; nobody knows what is in the womb; nobody knows what he will gain tomorrow;  nobody knows at what place he will die; and nobody knows when it will rain.&#8221; </font></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 7:</p>
<h3 align="center">Rubbing hands and feet with dust(Tayammum)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.007.330"></a>Volume 1, Book 7, Number 330:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) We set out with Allahs Apostle on one of his journeys till we reached Al-Baida&#8217; or Dhatul-Jaish, a necklace of mine was broken (and lost). Allah&#8217;s Apostle stayed there to search for it, and so did the people along with him. There was no water at that place, so the people went to Abu- Bakr As-Siddiq and said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see what &#8216;Aisha has done? She has made Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the people stay where there is no water and they have no water with them.&#8221; Abu Bakr came while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was sleeping with his head on my thigh, He said, to me: &#8220;You have detained Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the people where there is no water and they have no water with them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he admonished me and said what Allah wished him to say and hit me on my flank with his hand. Nothing prevented me from moving (because of pain) but the position of Allah&#8217;s Apostle on my thigh. Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up when dawn broke and there was no water. So Allah revealed the Divine Verses of Tayammum. So they all performed Tayammum. Usaid bin Hudair said, &#8220;O the family of Abu Bakr! This is not the first blessing of yours.&#8221; Then the camel on which I was riding was caused to move from its place and the necklace was found beneath it.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 331:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;I have been given five things which were not given to any one else before me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Allah made me victorious by awe, (by His frightening my enemies) for a distance of one month&#8217;s journey.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The earth has been made for me (and for my followers) a place for praying and a thing to perform Tayammum, therefore anyone of my followers can pray wherever the time of a prayer is due.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The booty has been made Halal (lawful) for me yet it was not lawful for anyone else before me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. I have been given the right of intercession (on the Day of Resurrection).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Every Prophet used to be sent to his nation only but I have been sent to all mankind.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 332:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Urwa&#8217;s father:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aisha said, &#8220;I borrowed a necklace from Asma&#8217; and it was lost. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent a man to search for it and he found it. Then the time of the prayer became due and there was no water. They prayed (without ablution) and informed Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it, so the verse of Tayammum was revealed.&#8221; Usaid bin Hudair said to &#8216;Aisha, &#8220;May Allah reward you. By Allah, whenever anything happened which you did not like, Allah brought good for you and for the Muslims in that.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Jurf and the time for the &#8216;Asr prayer became due while he was at Marbad-AnNa&#8217;am (sheep-fold), so he (performed Tayammum) and prayed there and then entered Medina when the sun was still high but he did not repeat that prayer.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 333:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Juhaim Al-Ansari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet came from the direction of Bir Jamal. A man met him and greeted him. But he did not return back the greeting till he went to a (mud) wall and smeared his hands and his face with its dust (performed Tayammum) and then returned back the greeting.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab and said, &#8220;I became Junub but no water was available.&#8221; &#8216;Ammar bin Yasir said to &#8216;Umar, &#8220;Do you remember that you and I (became Junub while both of us) were together on a journey and you didn&#8217;t pray but I rolled myself on the ground and prayed? I informed the Prophet about it and he said, &#8216;It would have been sufficient for you to do like this.&#8217; The Prophet then stroked lightly the earth with his hands and then blew off the dust and passed his hands over his face and hands.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(on the authority of his father who said) &#8216;Ammar said so (the above Statement). And Shu&#8217;ba stroked lightly the earth with his hands and brought them close to his mouth (blew off the dust) and passed them over his face and then the backs of his hands. &#8216;Ammar said, &#8220;Ablution (meaning Tayammum here) is sufficient for a Muslim if water is not available.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ammar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet stroked the earth with his hands and then passed them over his face and the backs of his hands (while demonstrating Tayammum).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 340:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Imran:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once we were traveling with the Prophet and we carried on traveling till the last part of the night and then we (halted at a place) and slept (deeply). There is nothing sweeter than sleep for a traveler in the last part of the night. So it was only the heat of the sun that made us to wake up and the first to wake up was so and so, then so and so and then so and so (the narrator &#8216;Auf said that Abu Raja&#8217; had told him their names but he had forgotten them) and the fourth person to wake up was &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab. And whenever the Prophet used to sleep, nobody would wake up him till he himself used to get up as we did not know what was happening (being revealed) to him in his sleep. So, &#8216;Umar got up and saw the condition of the people, and he was a strict man, so he said, &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221; and raised his voice with Takbir, and kept on saying loudly till the Prophet got up because of it. When he got up, the people informed him about what had happened to them. He said, &#8220;There is no harm (or it will not be harmful). Depart!&#8221; So they departed from that place, and after covering some distance the Prophet stopped and asked for some water to perform the ablution. So he performed the ablution and the call for the prayer was pronounced and he led the people in prayer. After he finished from the prayer, he saw a man sitting aloof who had not prayed with the people. He asked, &#8220;O so and so! What has prevented you from praying with us?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I am Junub and there is no water. &#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Perform Tayammum with (clean) earth and that is sufficient for you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Prophet proceeded on and the people complained to him of thirst. Thereupon he got down and called a person (the narrator &#8216;Auf added that Abu Raja&#8217; had named him but he had forgotten) and &#8216;Ali, and ordered them to go and bring water. So they went in search of water and met a woman who was sitting on her camel between two bags of water. They asked, &#8220;Where can we find water?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;I was there (at the place of water) this hour yesterday and my people are behind me.&#8221; They requested her to accompany them. She asked, &#8220;Where?&#8221; They said, &#8220;To Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; She said, &#8220;Do you mean the man who is called the Sabi, (with a new religion)?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes, the same person. So come along.&#8221; They brought her to the Prophet and narrated the whole story. He said, &#8220;Help her to dismount.&#8221; The Prophet asked for a pot, then he opened the mouths of the bags and poured some water into the pot. Then he closed the big openings of the bags and opened the small ones and the people were called upon to drink and water their animals. So they all watered their animals and they (too) all quenched their thirst and also gave water to others and last of all the Prophet gave a pot full of water to the person who was Junub and told him to pour it over his body. The woman was standing and watching all that which they were doing with her water. By Allah, when her water bags were returned the looked like as if they were more full (of water) than they had been before (Miracle of Allah&#8217;s Apostle) Then the Prophet ordered us to collect something for her; so dates, flour and Sawiq were collected which amounted to a good meal that was put in a piece of cloth. She was helped to ride on her camel and that cloth full of food-stuff was also placed in front of her and then the Prophet said to her, &#8220;We have not taken your water but Allah has given water to us.&#8221; She returned home late. Her relatives asked her: &#8220;O so and so what has delayed you?&#8221; She said, &#8220;A strange thing! Two men met me and took me to the man who is called the Sabi&#8217; and he did such and such a thing. By Allah, he is either the greatest magician between this and this (gesturing with her index and middle fingers raising them towards the sky indicating the heaven and the earth) or he is Allah&#8217;s true Apostle.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Afterwards the Muslims used to attack the pagans around her abode but never touched her village. One day she said to her people, &#8220;I think that these people leave you purposely. Have you got any inclination to Islam?&#8221; They obeyed her and all of them embraced Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu &#8216;Abdultah said: The word Saba&#8217;a means &#8220;The one who has deserted his old religion and embraced a new religion.&#8221; Abul &#8216;Ailya said, &#8220;The Sabis are a sect of people of the Scripture who recite the Book of Psalms.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 341:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Wail:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Muisa said to&#8217;Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud, &#8220;If one does not find water (for ablution) can he give up the prayer?&#8221; Abdullah replied, &#8220;If you give the permission to perform Tayammum they will perform Tayammum even if water was available if one of them found it cold.&#8221; Abu Musa said, &#8220;What about the statement of &#8216;Ammar to &#8216;Umar?&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah replied, &#8220;Umar was not satisfied by his statement.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 342:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Shaqiq bin Salama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was with &#8216;Abdullah and Abu Musa; the latter asked the former, &#8220;O Abu AbdurRahman! What is your opinion if somebody becomes Junub and no water is available?&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah replied, &#8220;Do not pray till water is found.&#8221; Abu Musa said, &#8220;What do you say about the statement of &#8216;Ammar (who was ordered by the Prophet to perform Tayammum). The Prophet said to him: &#8220;Perform Tayammum and that would be sufficient.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah replied, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see that &#8216;Umar was not satisfied by &#8216;Ammar&#8217;s statement?&#8221; Abu- Musa said, &#8220;All right, leave &#8216;Ammalr&#8217;s statement, but what will you say about this verse (of Tayammum)?&#8221; &#8216;Abqiullah kept quiet and then said, &#8220;If we allowed it, then they would probably perform Tayammum even if water was available, if one of them found it (water) cold.&#8221; The narrator added, &#8220;I said to Shaqrq, &#8220;Then did &#8216;Abdullah dislike to perform Tayammum because of this?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 343:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-A&#8217;mash:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaqiq said, &#8220;While I was sitting with &#8216;Abdullah and Abu Musa Al-Ash-&#8216;ari, the latter asked the former, &#8216;If a person becomes Junub and does not find water for one month, can he perform Tayammum and offer his prayer?&#8217; (He applied in the negative). Abu Musa said, &#8216;What do you say about this verse from Surat &#8220;Al-Ma&#8217;ida&#8221;: When you do not find water then perform Tayammum with clean earth? &#8216;Abdullah replied, &#8216;If we allowed it then they would probably perform Tayammum with clean earth even if water were available but cold.&#8217; I said to Shaqiq, &#8216;You then disliked to perform Tayammum because of this?&#8217; Shaqiq said,&#8217;Yes.&#8217; (Shaqiq added), &#8220;Abu Musa said, &#8216;Haven&#8217;t you heard the statement of &#8216;Ammar to &#8216;Umar? He said: I was sent out by Allah&#8217;s Apostle for some job and I became Junub and could not find water so I rolled myself over the dust (clean earth) like an animal does, and when I told the Prophet of that he said, &#8216;Like this would have been sufficient.&#8217; The Prophet (saying so) lightly stroked the earth with his hand once and blew it off, then passed his (left) hand over the back of his right hand or his (right) hand over the back of his left hand and then passed them over his face.&#8217; So &#8216;Abdullah said to Abu- Musa, &#8216;Don&#8217;t you know that &#8216;Umar was not satisfied with &#8216;Ammar&#8217;s statement?&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Shaqiq: While I was with &#8216;Abdullah and Abu Musa, the latter said to the former, &#8220;Haven&#8217;t you heard the statement of &#8216;Ammar to &#8216;Umar? He said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent you and me out and I became Junub and rolled myself in the dust (clean earth) (for Tayammum). When we came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle I told him about it and he said, &#8216;This would have been sufficient,&#8217; passing his hands over his face and the backs of his hands once only.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 344:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Imran bin Husain Al-Khuza&#8217;i:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw a person sitting aloof and not praying with the people. He asked him, &#8220;O so and so! What prevented you from offering the prayer with the people?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I am Junub and there is no water.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Perform Tayammum with clean earth and that will be sufficient for you.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.008.345"></a>Volume 1, Book 8, Number 345:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Dhar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;While I was at Mecca the roof of my house was opened and Gabriel descended, opened my chest, and washed it with Zam-zam water. Then he brought a golden tray full of wisdom and faith and having poured its contents into my chest, he closed it. Then he took my hand and ascended with me to the nearest heaven, when I reached the nearest heaven, Gabriel said to the gatekeeper of the heaven, &#8216;Open (the gate).&#8217; The gatekeeper asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel answered: &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; He asked, &#8216;Is there anyone with you?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Yes, Muhammad I is with me.&#8217; He asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217; Gabriel said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; So the gate was opened and we went over the nearest heaven and there we saw a man sitting with some people on his right and some on his left. When he looked towards his right, he laughed and when he looked toward his left he wept. Then he said, &#8216;Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious son.&#8217; I asked Gabriel, &#8216;Who is he?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;He is Adam and the people on his right and left are the souls of his offspring. Those on his right are the people of Paradise and those on his left are the people of Hell and when he looks towards his right he laughs and when he looks towards his left he weeps.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he ascended with me till he reached the second heaven and he (Gabriel) said to its gatekeeper, &#8216;Open (the gate).&#8217; The gatekeeper said to him the same as the gatekeeper of the first heaven had said and he opened the gate. Anas said: &#8220;Abu Dhar added that the Prophet met Adam, Idris, Moses, Jesus and Abraham, he (Abu Dhar) did not mention on which heaven they were but he mentioned that he (the Prophet ) met Adarn on the nearest heaven and Abraham on the sixth heaven. Anas said, &#8220;When Gabriel along with the Prophet passed by Idris, the latter said, &#8216;Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious brother.&#8217; The Prophet asked, &#8216;Who is he?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;He is Idris.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;I passed by Moses and he said, &#8216;Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious brother.&#8217; I asked Gabriel, &#8216;Who is he?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;He is Moses.&#8217; Then I passed by Jesus and he said, &#8216;Welcome! O pious brother and pious Prophet.&#8217; I asked, &#8216;Who is he?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;He is Jesus.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I passed by Abraham and he said, &#8216;Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious son.&#8217; I asked Gabriel, &#8216;Who is he?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;He is Abraham. The Prophet added, &#8216;Then Gabriel ascended with me to a place where I heard the creaking of the pens.&#8221; Ibn Hazm and Anas bin Malik said: The Prophet said, &#8220;Then Allah enjoined fifty prayers on my followers when I returned with this order of Allah, I passed by Moses who asked me, &#8216;What has Allah enjoined on your followers?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;He has enjoined fifty prayers on them.&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;Go back to your Lord (and appeal for reduction) for your followers will not be able to bear it.&#8217; (So I went back to Allah and requested for reduction) and He reduced it to half. When I passed by Moses again and informed him about it, he said, &#8216;Go back to your Lord as your followers will not be able to bear it.&#8217; So I returned to Allah and requested for further reduction and half of it was reduced. I again passed by Moses and he said to me: &#8216;Return to your Lord, for your followers will not be able to bear it. So I returned to Allah and He said, &#8216;These are five prayers and they are all (equal to) fifty (in reward) for My Word does not change.&#8217; I returned to Moses and he told me to go back once again. I replied, &#8216;Now I feel shy of asking my Lord again.&#8217; Then Gabriel took me till we &#8221; reached Sidrat-il-Muntaha (Lote tree of; the utmost boundry) which was shrouded in colors, indescribable. Then I was admitted into Paradise where I found small (tents or) walls (made) of pearls and its earth was of musk.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas said, &#8216;When Allah&#8217;s Apostle invaded Khaibar, we offered the Fajr prayer there yearly in the morning) when it was still dark. The Prophet rode and Abu Talha rode too and I was riding behind Abu Talha. The Prophet passed through the lane of Khaibar quickly and my knee was touching the thigh of the Prophet . He uncovered his thigh and I saw the whiteness of the thigh of the Prophet. When he entered the town, he said, &#8216;Allahu Akbar! Khaibar is ruined. Whenever we approach near a (hostile) nation (to fight) then evil will be the morning of those who have been warned.&#8217; He repeated this thrice. The people came out for their jobs and some of them said, &#8216;Muhammad (has come).&#8217; (Some of our companions added, &#8220;With his army.&#8221;) We conquered Khaibar, took the captives, and the booty was collected. Dihya came and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! Give me a slave girl from the captives.&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;Go and take any slave girl.&#8217; He took Safiya bint Huyai. A man came to the Prophet and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostles! You gave Safiya bint Huyai to Dihya and she is the chief mistress of the tribes of Quraiza and An-Nadir and she befits none but you.&#8217; So the Prophet said, &#8216;Bring him along with her.&#8217; So Dihya came with her and when the Prophet saw her, he said to Dihya, &#8216;Take any slave girl other than her from the captives.&#8217; Anas added: The Prophet then manumitted her and married her.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thabit asked Anas, &#8220;O Abu Hamza! What did the Prophet pay her (as Mahr)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Her self was her Mahr for he manumitted her and then married her.&#8221; Anas added, &#8220;While on the way, Um Sulaim dressed her for marriage (ceremony) and at night she sent her as a bride to the Prophet . So the Prophet was a bridegroom and he said, &#8216;Whoever has anything (food) should bring it.&#8217; He spread out a leather sheet (for the food) and some brought dates and others cooking butter. (I think he (Anas) mentioned As-SawTq). So they prepared a dish of Hais (a kind of meal). And that was Walrma (the marriage banquet) of Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet was given a silken Farruj as a present. He wore it while praying. When he had finished his prayer, he took it off violently as if with a strong aversion to it and said, &#8220;It is not the dress of Allah-fearing pious people.&#8221;</p>

I saw the people taking the utilized water impatiently and whoever got some of it rubbed it on his body and those who could not get any took the moisture from the others&#8217; hands. Then I saw Bilal carrying an &#8216;Anza (a spear-headed stick) which he planted in the ground. The Prophet came out tucking up his red cloak, and led the people in prayer and offered two Rakat (facing the Ka&#8217;ba) taking &#8216;Anza as a Sutra for his prayer. I saw the people and animals passing in front of him beyond the &#8216;Anza.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Sahl bin Sa&#8217;d was asked about the (Prophet&#8217;s) pulpit as to what thing it was made of? Sahl replied: &#8220;None remains alive amongst the people, who knows about it better than I. It was made of tamarisk (wood) of the forest. So and so, the slave of so and so prepared it for Allah&#8217;s Apostle . When it was constructed and place (in the Mosque), Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood on it facing the Qibla and said &#8216;Allahu Akbar&#8217;, and the people stood behind him (and led the people in prayer). He recited and bowed and the people bowed behind him. Then he raised his head and stepped back, got down and prostrated on the ground and then he again ascended the pulpit, recited, bowed, raised his head and stepped back, got down and prostrate on the ground. So, this is what I know about the pulpit.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad bin Hanbal said, &#8220;As the Prophet was at a higher level than the people, there is no harm according to the above-mentioned Hadith if the Imam is at a higher level than his followers during the prayers.&#8221;</p>

He swore that he would not go to his wives for one month and he stayed in a Mashruba (attic room) having stairs made of date palm trunks. So his companions came to visit him, and he led them in prayer sitting, whereas his companions were standing. When he finished the prayer, he said, &#8220;Imam is meant to be followed, so when he says &#8216;Allahu Akbar,&#8217; say &#8216;Allahu Akbar&#8217; and when he bows, bow and when he prostrates, prostrate and if he prays standing pray, standing. After the 29th day the Prophet came down (from the attic room) and the people asked him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You swore that you will not go to your wives for one month.&#8221; He said, &#8220;The month is 29 days.&#8221;</p>

When he turned his face to us he said, &#8220;If there had been anything changed in the prayer, surely I would have informed you but I am a human being like you and liable to forget like you.

So came the Divine Inspiration: And take you (people) the station of Abraham as a place of prayer (for some of your prayers e.g. two Rakat of Tawaf of Ka&#8217;ba)&#8221;. (2.125)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. And as regards the (verse of) the veiling of the women, I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I wish you ordered your wives to cover themselves from the men because good and bad ones talk to them.&#8217; So the verse of the veiling of the women was revealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Once the wives of the Prophet made a united front against the Prophet and I said to them, &#8216;It may be if he (the Prophet) divorced you, (all) that his Lord (Allah) will give him instead of you wives better than you.&#8217; So this verse (the same as I had said) was revealed.&#8221; (66.5).</p>

I gave him permission and he did not sit on entering the house but said to me, &#8220;Where do you like me to pray?&#8221; I pointed to a place in my house. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood there and said, &#8216;Allahu Akbar&#8217;, and we all got up and aligned behind him and offered a two-Rak&#8217;at prayer and ended it with Taslim. We requested him to stay for a meal called &#8220;Khazira&#8221; which we had prepared for him. Many members of our family gathered in the house and one of them said, &#8220;Where is Malik bin Al-Dukhaishin or Ibn Al-Dukhshun?&#8221; One of them replied, &#8220;He is a hypocrite and does not love Allah and His Apostle.&#8221; Hearing that, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Do not say so. Haven&#8217;t you seen that he said, &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah&#8217; for Allah&#8217;s sake only?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better. We have seen him helping and advising hypocrites.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah has forbidden the (Hell) fire for those who say, &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah&#8217; for Allah&#8217;s sake only.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Um Habiba and Um Salama mentioned about a church they had seen in Ethiopia in which there were pictures. They told the Prophet about it, on which he said, &#8220;If any religious man dies amongst those people they would build a place of worship at his grave and make these pictures in it. They will be the worst creature in the sight of Allah on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet arrived Medina he dismounted at &#8216;Awali-i-Medina amongst a tribe called Banu &#8216;Amr bin &#8216;Auf. He stayed there For fourteen nights. Then he sent for Bani An-Najjar and they came armed with their swords. As if I am looking (just now) as the Prophet was sitting over his Rahila (Mount) with Abu Bakr riding behind him and all Banu An-Najjar around him till he dismounted at the courtyard of Abu Aiyub&#8217;s house. The Prophet loved to pray wherever the time for the prayer was due even at sheep-folds. Later on he ordered that a mosque should be built and sent for some people of Banu-An-Najjar and said, &#8220;O Banu An-Najjar! Suggest to me the price of this (walled) piece of land of yours.&#8221; They replied, &#8220;No! By Allah! We do not demand its price except from Allah.&#8221; Anas added: There were graves of pagans in it and some of it was unleveled and there were some date-palm trees in it. The Prophet ordered that the graves of the pagans be dug out and the unleveled land be level led and the date-palm trees be cut down . (So all that was done). They aligned these cut date-palm trees towards the Qibla of the mosque (as a wall) and they also built two stone side-walls (of the mosque). His companions brought the stones while reciting some poetic verses. The Prophet was with them and he kept on saying, &#8220;There is no goodness except that of the Hereafter, O Allah! So please forgive the Ansars and the emigrants. &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 8, Number 456:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle in his fatal illness came out with a piece of cloth tied round his head and sat on the pulpit. After thanking and praising Allah he said, &#8220;There is no one who had done more favor to me with life and property than Abu Bakr bin Abi Quhafa. If I were to take a Khalil, I would certainly have taken Abu- Bakr but the Islamic brotherhood is superior. Close all the small doors in this mosque except that of Abu Bakr.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;The Prophet arrived at Mecca and sent for &#8216;Uthman bin Talha. He opened the gate of the Ka&#8217;ba and the Prophet, Bilal, Usama bin Zaid and &#8216;Uthman bin Talha entered the Ka&#8217;ba and then they closed its door (from inside). They stayed there for an hour, and then came out.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;I quickly went to Bilal and asked him (whether the Prophet had prayed). Bilal replied, &#8216;He prayed in it.&#8217; I asked, &#8216;Where?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Between the two pillars.&#8217; &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;I forgot to ask how many Rakat he (the Prophet) had prayed in the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I was standing in the mosque and somebody threw a gravel at me. I looked and found that he was &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab. He said to me, &#8220;Fetch those two men to me.&#8221; When I did, he said to them, &#8220;Who are you? (Or) where do you come from?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;We are from Ta&#8217;if.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Were you from this city (Medina) I would have punished you for raising your voices in the mosque of Allah&#8217;s Apostle</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">During the life-time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle I asked Ibn Abi Hadrad in the mosque to pay the debts which he owed to me and our voices grew so loud that Allah&#8217;s Apostle heard them while he was in his house. So he came to us after raising the curtain of his room. The Prophet said, &#8220;O Ka&#8217;b bin Malik!&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Labaik, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; He gestured with his hand to me to reduce the debt to one half. I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle have done it.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said (to Ibn Hadrad), &#8220;Get up and pay it.&#8221;</p>

He replied, &#8216;Pray two Rakat at a time and then two and then two and so on, and if you are afraid of the dawn (the approach of the time of the Fajr prayer) pray one Rak&#8217;a and that will be the witr for all the Rakat which you have offered.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;The last Rakat of the night prayer should be odd for the Prophet ordered it to be so.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 8, Number 462:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to the Prophet while he was delivering the sermon and asked him how to offer the night prayers. The Prophet replied, &#8216;Pray two Rakat at a time and then two and then two and so on and if you are afraid of dawn (the approach of the time of the Fajr prayer) pray one Rak&#8217;a and that will be the with for all the Rakat which you have prayed.&#8221; Narrated &#8216;Ubaidullah bin &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: A man called the Prophet while he was in the mosque.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">While Allah&#8217;s Apostle was sitting in the mosque (with some people) three men came, two of them came in front of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the third one went away, and then one of them found a place in the circle and sat there while the second man sat behind the gathering, and the third one went away. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle finished his preaching, he said, &#8220;Shall I tell you about these three persons? One of them betook himself to Allah and so Allah accepted him and accommodated him; the second felt shy before Allah so Allah did the same for him and sheltered him in His Mercy (and did not punish him), while the third turned his face from Allah, and went away, so Allah turned His face from him likewise.</p>
<hr>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 8, Number 465:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) I had seen my parents following Islam since I attained the age of puberty. Not a day passed but the Prophet visited us, both in the mornings and evenings. My father Abii Bakr thought of building a mosque in the courtyard of his house and he did so. He used to pray and recite the Qur&#8217;an in it. The pagan women and their children used to stand by him and look at him with surprise. Abu Bakr was a Softhearted person and could not help weeping while reciting the Quran. The chiefs of the Quraish pagans became afraid of that (i.e. that their children and women might be affected by the recitation of Quran).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 8, Number 466:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The prayer offered in congregation is twenty five times more superior (in reward) to the prayer offered alone in one&#8217;s house or in a business center, because if one performs ablution and does it perfectly, and then proceeds to the mosque with the sole intention of praying, then for each step which he takes towards the mosque, Allah upgrades him a degree in reward and (forgives) crosses out one sin till he enters the mosque. When he enters the mosque he is considered in prayer as long as he is waiting for the prayer and the angels keep on asking for Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for him and they keep on saying: &#8216;O Allah! Be Merciful to him, O Allah! Forgive him, as long as he keeps on sitting at his praying place and does not pass wind. (See Hadith No. 620).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 8, Number 467:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar or Ibn &#8216;Amr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet clasped his hands, by interlacing his fingers. Narrated &#8216;Abdullah that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr! What will be your condition when you will be left with the sediments of (worst) people?&#8221; (They will be in conflict with each other).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 8, Number 468:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;A faithful believer to a faithful believer is like the bricks of a wall, enforcing each other.&#8221; While (saying that) the Prophet clasped his hands, by interlacing his fingers.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 8, Number 469:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrates Ibn Sirin:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Huraira said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle led us in one of the two &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayers (Abu Huraira named that prayer but I forgot it).&#8221; Abu Huraira added, &#8220;He prayed two Rakat and then finished the prayer with Tasllm. He stood up near a piece of wood Lying across the mosque and leaned on it in such a way as if he was angry. Then he put his right hand over the left and clasped his hands by interlacing his fingers and then put his J right cheek on the back of his left hand. The people who were in haste left the mosque through its gates. They wondered whether the prayer was reduced. And amongst them were Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar but they hesitated to ask the Prophet. A long-handed man called Dhul-Yadain asked the Prophet, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Have you; forgotten or has the prayer been reduced?&#8217; The Prophet replied, &#8216;I have neither forgotten nor has the prayer been reduced&#8217; The Prophet added, &#8216;Is what Dhul Yadain has said true?&#8217; They (the people) said, &#8216;Yes, it is true.&#8217; The Prophet stood up again and led the prayer, completing the remaining prayer, forgotten by him, and performed Talsrm, and then said, &#8216;Allahu Akbar.&#8217; And then he did a prostration as he used to prostrate or longer than that. He then raised his head saying, &#8216;Allahu Akbar; he then again said, &#8216;Allahu Akbar&#8217;, and prostrated as he used to prostrate or longer than that. Then he raised his head and said, &#8216;Allahu Akbar.&#8217; &#8221; (The subnarrator added, &#8220;I think that they asked (Ibn Sirin) whether the Prophet completed the prayer with Taslim. He replied, &#8220;I heard that &#8216;Imran bin Husain had said, &#8216;Then he (the Prophet) did Taslim.&#8221;)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi&#8217; on the authority of Ibn &#8216;Umar who said, &#8220;I used to pray at those places.&#8221; Musa the narrator added, &#8220;I asked Salim on which he said, &#8216;I agree with Nafi&#8217; concerning those places, except the mosque situated at the place called Sharaf Ar-Rawha.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Once&#8217;Umar bin &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Aziz delayed the prayer and &#8216;Urwa bin Az-Zubair went to him and said, &#8220;Once in &#8216;Iraq, Al-MughTra bin Shu&#8217;ba delayed his prayers and Abi Mas&#8217;ud Al-Ansari went to him and said, &#8216;O Mughira! What is this? Don&#8217;t you know that once Gabriel came and offered the prayer (Fajr prayer) and Allah&#8217;s Apostle prayed too, then he prayed again (Zuhr prayer) and so did Allah&#8217;s Apostle and again he prayed (&#8216;Asr prayers and Allah&#8217;s Apostle did the same; again he prayed (Maghrib-prayer) and so did Allah&#8217;s Apostle and again prayed (&#8216;Isha prayer) and so did Allah&#8217;s Apostle and (Gabriel) said, &#8216;I was ordered to do so (to demonstrate the prayers prescribed to you)?'&#8221; &#8216;Umar (bin &#8216;Abdul &#8216;AzTz) said to &#8216;Urwa, &#8220;Be sure of what you Say. Did Gabriel lead Allah&#8217;s Apostle at the stated times of the prayers?&#8221; &#8216;Urwa replied, &#8220;Bashir bin Abi Mas&#8217;ud narrated like this on the authority of his father.&#8221; Urwa added, &#8220;Aisha told me that Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to pray &#8216;Asr prayer when the sun-shine was still inside her residence (during the early time of &#8216;Asr).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Once a delegation of &#8216;Abdul Qais came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;We belong to such and such branch of the tribe of Rab&#8217;a and we can only come to you in the sacred months. Order us to do something good so that we may (carry out) take it from you and also invite to it our people whom we have left behind (at home).&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8221; I order you to do four things and forbid you from four things. (The first four are as follows):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. To believe in Allah. (And then he: explained it to them i.e.) to testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and (Muhammad) am Allah&#8217;s Apostle</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. To offer prayers perfectly (at the stated times):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. To pay Zakat (obligatory charity)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. To give me Khumus</p>

You need not be afraid of it as there is a closed door between you and it.&#8217; &#8216;Umar asked, Will the door be broken or opened?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;It will be broken.&#8217; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;Then it will never be closed again.&#8217; I was asked whether &#8216;Umar knew that door.

After the completion of the prayer, he faced us and said, &#8220;Do you know the importance of this night? Nobody present on the surface of the earth to-night will be living after one hundred years from this night.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 575).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 10, Number 540:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Muhammad bin &#8216;Amr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We asked Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah about the prayers of the Prophet . He said, &#8220;He used to pray Zuhr prayer at mid-day, the &#8216;Asr when the sun was still hot, and the Maghrib after sunset (at its stated time). The &#8216;Isha was offered early if the people gathered, and used to be delayed if their number was less; and the morning prayer was offered when it was still dark. &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 10, Number 541:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle once delayed the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer and that was during the days when Islam still had not spread. The Prophet did not come out till &#8216;Umar informed him that the women and children had slept. Then he came out and said to the people of the mosque:&#8221;None amongst the dwellers of the earth has been waiting for it (&#8216;Isha prayer) except you.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 10, Number 542:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My companions, who came with me in the boat and I landed at a place called Baqi Buthan. The Prophet was in Medina at that time. One of us used to go to the Prophet by turns every night at the time of the Isha prayer. Once I along with my companions went to the Prophet and he was busy in some of his affairs, so the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer was delayed to the middle of the night He then came out and led the people (in prayer). After finishing from the prayer, he addressed the people present there saying, &#8220;Be patient! Don&#8217;t go away. Have the glad tiding. It is from the blessing of Allah upon you that none amongst mankind has prayed at this time save you.&#8221; Or said, &#8220;None except you has prayed at this time.&#8221; Abu Muisa added, &#8216;So we returned happily after what we heard from Alllah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221;</p>

Then the Prophet came out and said, &#8216;None amongst the dwellers of the earth has been waiting for it (the prayer) except you.&#8221; Urwa said, &#8220;Nowhere except in Medina the prayer used to be offered (in those days).&#8221; He further said, &#8220;The Prophet used to offer the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer in the period between the disappearance of the twilight and the end of the first third of the night.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Juraij from Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Once Allah&#8217;s Apostle was busy (at the time of the &#8216;Isha&#8217;), so the prayer was delayed so much so that we slept and woke up and slept and woke up again. The Prophet came out and said, &#8216;None amongst the dwellers of the earth but you have been waiting for the prayer.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar did not find any harm in praying it earlier or in delaying it unless he was afraid that sleep might overwhelm him and he might miss the prayer, and sometimes he used to sleep before the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer. Ibn Juraij said, &#8220;I said to &#8216;Ata&#8217;, &#8216;I heard Ibn &#8216;Abbas saying: Once Allah&#8217;s Apostle delayed the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer to such an extent that the people slept and got up and slept again and got up again. Then &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab I, stood up and reminded the Prophet I of the prayer.&#8217; &#8216;Ata&#8217; said, &#8216;Ibn &#8216;Abbas said: The Prophet came out as if I was looking at him at this time, and water was trickling from his head and he was putting his hand on his head and then said, &#8216;Hadn&#8217;t I thought it hard for my followers, I would have ordered them to pray (&#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer) at this time.&#8217; I asked &#8216;Ata&#8217; for further information, how the Prophet had kept his hand on his head as he was told by Ibn &#8216;Abbas. &#8216;Ata&#8217; separated his fingers slightly and put their tips on the side of the head, brought the fingers downwards approximating them till the thumb touched the lobe of the ear at the side of the temple and the beard on the face. He neither slowed nor hurried in this action but he acted like that. The Prophet said: &#8220;Hadn&#8217;t I thought it hard for my followers I would have ordered them to pray at this time.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jarir bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were with the Prophet on a full moon night. He looked at the moon and said, &#8220;You will certainly see your Lord as you see this moon, and there will be no trouble in seeing Him. So if you can avoid missing (through sleep, business, etc.) a prayer before the rising of the sun (Fajr) and before its setting (&#8216;Asr) you must do so. He (the Prophet ) then recited the following verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And celebrate the praises Of Your Lord before The rising of the sun And before (its) setting.&#8221; (50.39)</p>

(The narrator forgot what Abu Barza had said about the Maghrib prayer), and the Prophet preferred to pray the &#8216;Isha&#8217; late and disliked to sleep before it or talk after it. And he used to return after finishing the morning prayer at such a time when it was possible for one to recognize the person sitting by his side and he (the Prophet) used to recite 60 to 100 &#8216;Ayat&#8217; (verses) of the Qur&#8217;an in it.&#8221;</p>

He came and led the prayer, and after finishing it, he addressed us and said, &#8216;All the people prayed and then slept and you had been in prayer as long as you were waiting for it.&#8221; Al-Hasan said, &#8220;The people are regarded as performing good deeds as long as they are waiting for doing good deeds.&#8221; Al-Hasan&#8217;s statement is a portion of Anas&#8217;s Hadith from the Prophet .</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet prayed one of the&#8217;lsha&#8217; prayer in his last days and after finishing it with Taslim, he stood up and said, &#8220;Do you realize (the importance of) this night? Nobody present on the</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">surface of the earth to-night would be living after the completion of one hundred years from this night.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people made a mistake in grasping the meaning of this statement of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and they indulged in those things which are said about these narrators (i.e. some said that the Day of Resurrection will be established after 100 years etc.) But the Prophet said, &#8220;Nobody present on the surface of earth tonight would be living after the completion of 100 years from this night&#8221;; he meant &#8220;When that century (people of that century) would pass away.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 10, Number 576:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu &#8216;Uthman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdur Rahman bin Abi Bakr said, &#8220;The Suffa Companions were poor people and the Prophet said, &#8216;Whoever has food for two persons should take a third one from them (Suffa companions). And whosoever has food for four persons he should take one or two from them&#8217; Abu Bakr took three men and the Prophet took ten of them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdur Rahman added, my father my mother and I were there (in the house). (The sub-narrator is in doubt whether &#8216;Abdur Rahman also said, &#8216;My wife and our servant who was common for both my house and Abu Bakr&#8217;s house). Abu Bakr took his supper with the Prophet and remained there till the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer was offered. Abu Bakr went back and stayed with the Prophet till the Prophet took his meal and then Abu Bakr returned to his house after a long portion of the night had passed. Abu Bakr&#8217;s wife said, &#8216;What detained you from your guests (or guest)?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Have you not served them yet?&#8217; She said, &#8216;They refused to eat until you come. The food was served for them but they refused.&#8221; &#8216;Abdur Rahman added, &#8220;I went away and hid myself (being afraid of Abu Bakr) and in the meantime he (Abu Bakr) called me, &#8216;O Ghunthar (a harsh word)!&#8217; and also called me bad names and abused me and then said (to his family), &#8216;Eat. No welcome for you.&#8217; Then (the supper was served). Abu Bakr took an oath that he would not eat that food. The narrator added: By Allah, whenever any one of us (myself and the guests of Suffa companions) took anything from the food, it increased from underneath. We all ate to our fill and the food was more than it was before its serving.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr looked at it (the food) and found it as it was before serving or even more than that. He addressed his wife (saying) &#8216;O the sister of Bani Firas! What is this?&#8217; She said, &#8216;O the pleasure of my eyes! The food is now three times more than it was before.&#8217; Abu Bakr ate from it, and said, &#8216;That (oath) was from Satan&#8217; meaning his oath (not to eat). Then he again took a morsel (mouthful) from it and then took the rest of it to the Prophet. So that meal was with the Prophet. There was a treaty between us and some people, and when the period of that treaty had elapsed the Prophet divided us into twelve (groups) (the Prophet&#8217;s companions) each being headed by a man. Allah knows how many men were under the command of each (leader). So all of them (12 groups of men) ate of that meal.&#8221;</p>
