<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ka&#8217;b bin &#8216;Ujra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I came to the Prophet and he said to me, &#8220;Come near.&#8221; So I went near to him and he said, &#8220;Are your lice troubling you?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;(Shave your head and) make expiation in the form of fasting, Sadaqa (giving in charity), or offering a sacrifice.&#8221; (The sub-narrator) Aiyub said, &#8220;Fasting should be for three days, and the Nusuk (sacrifice) is to be a sheep, and the Sadaqa is to be given to six poor persons.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 700:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;I am ruined!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;What is the matter with you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I had sexual relation with my wife (while I was fasting) in Ramadan.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Have you got enough to manumit a slave?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Can you fast for two successive months?&#8221; The man said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Can you feed sixty poor persons?&#8221; The man said, &#8220;No.&#8221; Then the Prophet said to him, &#8220;Sit down,&#8221; and he sat down. Afterwards an &#8216;Irq, i.e., a big basket containing dates was brought to the Prophet and the Prophet said to him, &#8220;Take this and give it in charity.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;To poorer people than we?&#8221; On that, the Prophet smiled till his premolar teeth became visible, and then told him, &#8220;Feed your family with it.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 157, Vol 3)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;I am ruined!&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have done a sexual relation with my wife (while fasting) in Ramadan.&#8221; The Prophet said to him?&#8221; &#8220;Can you afford to manumit a slave?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Can you fast for two successive months?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Can you feed sixty poor persons?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; Then an Ansari man came with an Irq (a big basket full of dates). The Prophet said (to the man), &#8220;Take this (basket) and give it in charity.&#8221; That man said, &#8220;To poorer people than we, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle? By Him Who has sent you with the Truth! There is no house in between the two mountains (of the city of Medina) poorer than we.&#8221; So the Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Go and feed it to your family.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to the Prophets and said, &#8220;I am ruined!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;What is the matter with you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have done a sexual relation with my wife (while fasting) in Ramadan&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Can you afford to manumit a slave?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Can you fast for two successive months?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Can you feed sixty poor persons?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have nothing.&#8221; Later on an Irq (big basket) containing dates was given to the Prophet, and the Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Take this basket and give it in charity.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;To poorer people than we? Indeed, there is nobody between its (i.e., Medina&#8217;s) two mountains who is poorer than we.&#8221; The Prophet then said, &#8220;Take it and feed your family with it.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 703:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Ju&#8217;aid bin Abdur-Rahman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Sa&#8217;ib bin Yazid said, &#8220;The Sa&#8217; at the time of the Prophet was equal to one Mudd plus one-third of a Mudd of your time, and then it was increased in the time of Caliph &#8216;Umar bin &#8216;Abdul Aziz.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 704:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Umar used to give the Zakat of Ramadan (Zakat-al-Fitr) according to the Mudd of the Prophet, the first Mudd, and he also used to give things for expiation for oaths according to the Mudd of the Prophet. Abu Qutaiba said, &#8220;Malik said to us, &#8216;Our Mudd (i.e., of Medina) is better than yours and we do not see any superiority except in the Mudd of the Prophet!&#8217; Malik further said, to me, &#8216;If a ruler came to you and fixed a Mudd smaller than the one of the Prophet, by what Mudd would you measure what you give (for expiation or Zakat-al-Fitr?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;We would give it according to the Mudd of the Prophet&#8217; On that, Malik said, &#8216;Then, don&#8217;t you see that we have to revert to the Mudd of the Prophet ultimately?'&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;If somebody manumits a Muslim slave, Allah will save from the Fire every part of his body for freeing the corresponding parts of the slave&#8217;s body, even his private parts will be saved from the Fire) because of freeing the slave&#8217;s private parts.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jabir said: An Ansari man made his slave a Mudabbar and he had no other property than him. When the Prophet heard of that, he said (to his companions), &#8220;Who wants to buy him (i.e., the slave) for me?&#8221; Nu&#8217;aim bin An-Nahham bought him for eight hundred Dirhams. I heard Jabir saying, &#8220;That was a coptic slave who died in the same year.&#8221;</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 709:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;ari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle along with a group of people from (the tribe of) Al-Ash&#8217;ari, asking for mounts. The Prophet said, &#8220;By Allah, I will not give you anything to ride, and I have nothing to mount you on.&#8221; We stayed there as long as Allah wished, and after that, some camels were brought to the Prophet and he ordered that we be given three camels. When we set out, some of us said to others, &#8220;Allah will not bless us, as we all went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle asking him for mounts, and although he had sworn that he would not give us mounts, he did give us.&#8221; So we returned to the Prophet; and mentioned that to him. He said, &#8220;I have not provided you with mounts, but Allah has. By Allah, Allah willing, if I ever take an oath, and then see that another is better than the first, I make expiration for my (dissolved) oath, and do what is better and make expiration.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 710:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hammad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the same narration above (i.e. 709), &#8220;I make expiation for my dissolved oath, and I do what is better, or do what is better and make expiation.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Prophet) Solomon said, &#8220;Tonight I will sleep with (my) ninety wives, each of whom will get a male child who will fight for Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221; On that, his companion (Sufyan said that his companion was an angel) said to him, &#8220;Say, &#8220;If Allah will (Allah willing).&#8221; But Solomon forgot (to say it). He slept with all his wives, but none of the women gave birth to a child, except one who gave birth to a halfboy. Abu Huraira added: The Prophet said, &#8220;If Solomon had said, &#8220;If Allah will&#8221; (Allah willing), he would not have been unsuccessful in his action, and would have attained what he had desired.&#8221; Once Abu Huraira added: Allah apostle said, &#8220;If he had accepted.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We were sitting with Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;sari, and as there were ties of friendship and mutual favors between us and his tribe. His meal was presented before him and there was chicken meat in it. Among those who were present there was a man from Bani Taimillah having a red complexion as a non-Arab freed slave, and that man did not approach the meal. Abu Musa said to him, &#8220;Come along! I have seen Allah&#8217;s Apostle eating of that (i.e., chicken).&#8221; The man said, &#8220;I have seen it (chickens) eating something I regarded as dirty, and so I have taken an oath that I shall not eat (its meat) chicken.&#8221; Abu Musa said, &#8220;Come along! I will inform you about it (i.e., your oath).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once we went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle in company with a group of Ash&#8217;airiyin, asking him for mounts while he was distributing some camels from the camels of Zakat. (Aiyub said, &#8220;I think he said that the Prophet was in an angry mood at the time.&#8221;) The Prophet said, &#8216;By Allah! I will not give you mounts, and I have nothing to mount you on.&#8217; After we had left, some camels of booty were brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and he said, &#8220;Where are those Ash&#8217;ariyin? Where are those Ash&#8217;ariyin?&#8221; So we went (to him) and he gave us five very fat good-looking camels. We mounted them and went away, and then I said to my companions, &#8216;We went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to give us mounts, but he took an oath that he would not give us mounts, and then later on he sent for us and gave us mounts, perhaps Allah&#8217;s Apostle forgot his oath. By Allah, we will never be successful, for we have taken advantage of the fact that Allah&#8217;s Apostle forgot to fulfill his oath. So let us return to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to remind him of his oath.&#8217; We returned and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We came to you and asked you for mounts, but you took an oath that you would not give us mounts) but later on you gave us mounts, and we thought or considered that you have forgotten your oath.&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;Depart, for Allah has given you Mounts. By Allah, Allah willing, if I take an oath and then later find another thing better than that, I do what is better, and make expiation for the oath.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;(O &#8216;Abdur-Rahman!) Do not seek to be a ruler, for, if you are given the authority of ruling without your asking for it, then Allah will help you; but if you are given it by your asking, then you will be held responsible for it (i.e. Allah will not help you ) . And if you take an oath to do something and later on find another thing, better than that, then do what is better and make expiation for (the dissolution of) your oath.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;For every prophet there is one  (special invocation (that will not be rejected) with which he appeals (to Allah), and I  want to keep such an invocation for interceding for my followers in the Hereafter.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that the Prophet said, &#8220;For every prophet there is an  invocation that surely will be responded by Allah,&#8221; (or said), &#8220;For every  prophet there was an invocation with which he appealed to Allah, and his invocation was  accepted (in his lifetime), but I kept my (this special) invocation to intercede for my  followers on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 75, Number 318: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Shaddad bin Aus: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said &#8220;The most superior way of asking for  forgiveness from Allah is: &#8216;Allahumma anta Rabbi la ilaha illa anta, Anta Khalaqtani wa  ana abduka, wa ana &#8216;ala ahdika wa wa&#8217;dika mastata&#8217;tu, A&#8217;udhu bika min Sharri ma sana&#8217;tu,  abu&#8217;u Laka bini&#8217;matika &#8216;alaiya, wa Abu Laka bidhanbi faghfirli innahu la yaghfiru  adhdhunuba illa anta.&#8221; The Prophet added. &#8220;If somebody recites it during the day  with firm faith in it, and dies on the same day before the evening, he will be from the  people of Paradise; and if somebody recites it at night with firm faith in it, and dies  before the morning, he will be from the people of Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 75, Number 319: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying.&#8221; By Allah! I ask for  forgiveness from Allah and turn to Him in repentance more than seventy times a day.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 75, Number 320: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Harith bin Suwaid: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud related to us two narrations: One from  the Prophet and the other from himself, saying: A believer sees his sins as if he were  sitting under a mountain which, he is afraid, may fall on him; whereas the wicked person  considers his sins as flies passing over his nose and he just drives them away like  this.&#8221; Abu Shihab (the sub-narrator) moved his hand over his nose in illustration.  (Ibn Mas&#8217;ud added): Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah is more pleased with the repentance  of His slave than a man who encamps at a place where his life is jeopardized, but he has  his riding beast carrying his food and water. He then rests his head and sleeps for a  short while and wakes to find his riding beast gone. (He starts looking for it) and  suffers from severe heat and thirst or what Allah wished (him to suffer from). He then  says, &#8216;I will go back to my place.&#8217; He returns and sleeps again, and then (getting up), he  raises his head to find his riding beast standing beside him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 75, Number 321: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah is more pleased with the  repentance of His slave than anyone of you is pleased with finding his camel which he had  lost in the desert. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 75, Number 322: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet used to pray eleven Rakat in the late part of  the night, and when dawn appeared, he would offer two Rakat and then lie on his right side  till the Muadhdhin came to inform him (that the morning prayer was due). </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.075.323"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 75, Number 323: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara bin &#8216;Azib: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to me, &#8220;When you want to go to  bed, perform ablution as you do for prayer, then lie down on your right side and say:  &#8216;Allahumma aslamtu wajhi ilaika, wa fauwadtu Amri ilaika wa aljatu zahri ilaika, raghbatan  wa rahbatan ilaika, lamalja&#8217;a wa la manja mink a ill a ilaika. Amantu bikitabi kalladhi  anzalta wa bi nabiyyikal-ladhi arsalta&#8217;. If you should die then (after reciting this) you  will die on the religion of Islam (i.e., as a Muslim); so let these words be the last you  say (before going to bed)&#8221; While I was memorizing it, I said, &#8220;Wa  birasiulikal-ladhi arsalta (in Your Apostle whom You have sent).&#8217; The Prophet said,  &#8220;No, but say: Wa binabiyyi-kalladhi arsalta (in Your Prophet whom You have  sent).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Hudhaifa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet went to bed, he would say: &#8220;Bismika  amutu wa ahya.&#8221; and when he got up he would say:&#8221; Al-hamdu lillahil-ladhi ahyana  ba&#8217;da ma amatana wa ilaihin-nushur.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet went to bed at night, he would put his  hand under his cheek and then say, &#8220;Allahumma bismika amutu wa ahya,&#8221; and when  he got up, he would say, &#8220;Al-Hamdu lil-lahi al-ladhi ahyana ba&#8217;da ma amatana, wa  ilaihi an-nushur.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>One night I slept at the house of Maimuna. The Prophet woke  up, answered the call of nature, washed his face and hands, and then slept. He got up  (late at night), went to a water skin, opened the mouth thereof and performed ablution not  using much water, yet he washed all the parts properly and then offered the prayer. I got  up and straightened my back in order that the Prophet might not feel that I was watching  him, and then I performed the ablution, and when he got up to offer the prayer, stood on  his left. He caught hold of my ear and brought me over to his right side. He offered  thirteen Rak&#8217;at in all and then lay down and slept till he started blowing out his breath  as he used to do when he slept. In the meantime Bilal informed the Prophet of the  approaching time for the (Fajr) prayer, and the Prophet offered the Fajr (Morning) prayer  without performing new ablution. He used to say in his invocation, Allaihumma ij&#8217;al fi  qalbi nuran wa fi basari nuran, wa fi sam&#8217;i nuran, wa&#8217;an yamini nuran, wa&#8217;an yasari nuran,  wa fawqi nuran, wa tahti nuran, wa amami nuran, wa khalfi nuran, waj&#8217;al li nuran.&#8221;  Kuraib (a sub narrator) said, &#8220;I have forgotten seven other words, (which the Prophet  mentioned in this invocation). I met a man from the offspring of Al-&#8216;Abbas and he narrated  those seven things to me, mentioning, &#8216;(Let there be light in) my nerves, my flesh, my  blood, my hair and my body,&#8217; and he also mentioned two other things.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Fatima complained about the blisters on her hand because of  using a mill-stone. She went to ask the Prophet for servant, but she did not find him (at  home) and had to inform &#8216;Aisha of her need. When he came, &#8216;Aisha informed him about it.  Ali added: The Prophet came to us when we had gone to our beds. When I was going to get  up, he said, &#8220;&#8216;Stay in your places,&#8221; and sat between us, till I felt the  coolness of the feet on my chest. The Prophet then said, &#8220;Shall I not tell you of a  thing which is better for you than a servant? When you (both) go to your beds, say &#8216;Allahu  Akbar&#8217; thirty-four times, and &#8216;Subhan Allah&#8217; thirty-three times, &#8216;Alhamdu &#8216;illah&#8217;  thirty-three times, for that is better for you than a servant.&#8221; Ibn Sirin said,  &#8220;Subhan Allah&#8217; (is to be said for) thirty-four times.&#8221; </font></p>

Then he should say, &#8216;I testify that none has the  right to be worshipped except Allah, and that Muhammad is His slave and His Apostle,&#8217; and  then he can select whatever he likes to celebrate (Allah&#8217;s) Praises.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We went out with the Prophet to Khaibar. A man among the  people said, &#8220;O &#8216;Amir! Will you please recite to us some of your poetic verses?&#8221;  So &#8216;Amir got down and started chanting among them, saying, &#8220;By Allah! Had it not been  for Allah, we would not have been guided.&#8221; &#8216;Amir also said other poetic verses which  I do not remember. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Who is this (camel) driver?&#8221; The  people said, &#8220;He is &#8216;Amir bin Al-Akwa&#8217;,&#8221; He said, &#8220;May Allah bestow His  Mercy on him.&#8221; A man from the People said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Would that you  let us enjoy his company longer.&#8221; When the people (Muslims) lined up, the battle  started, and &#8216;Amir was struck with his own sword (by chance) by himself and died. In the  evening, the people made a large number of fires (for cooking meals). Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said, &#8220;What is this fire? What are you making the fire for?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;For cooking the meat of donkeys.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Throw away what is in the pots  and break the pots!&#8221; A man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! May we throw away what is  in them and wash them?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Never mind, you may do so.&#8221; (See Hadith  No. 509, Vol. 5). </font></p>

(The sub-narrator, Sufyan, quoting Jarir, perhaps said, &#8220;I  went out with a group of men from my nation.&#8221;) and came to Dhi-al-Khalasa and burnt  it, and then came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have not come to you  till I left it like a camel with a skin disease.&#8221; The Prophet then invoked good upon  Ahmas and their cavalry (fighters). </font></p>

If you come  to some people who are engaged in a talk, don&#8217;t start interrupting their talk by  preaching, lest you should cause them to be bored. You should rather keep quiet, and if  they ask you, then preach to them at the time when they are eager to hear what you say.  And avoid the use of rhymed prose in invocation for I noticed that Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his  companions always avoided it.&#8221; </font></p>

I seek refuge with you (Allah) from  (worries) care and grief, from incapacity and laziness, from miserliness and cowardice,  from being heavily in debt and from being overpowered by other men.&#8221; I kept on  serving him till he returned from (the battle of) Khaibar. He then brought Safiya, the  daughter of Huyay whom he had got (from the booty). I saw him making a kind of cushion  with a cloak or a garment for her. He then let her ride behind him. When we reached a  place called As-Sahba&#8217;, he prepared (a special meal called) Hais, and asked me to invite  the men who (came and) ate, and that was the marriage banquet given on the consummation of  his marriage to her. Then he proceeded till the mountain of Uhud appeared, whereupon he  said, &#8220;This mountain loves us and we love it.&#8221; When he approached Medina, he  said, &#8220;O Allah! I make the land between its (i.e., Medina&#8217;s) two mountains a  sanctuary, as the prophet Abraham made Mecca a sanctuary. O Allah! Bless them (the people  of Medina) in their Mudd and the Sa&#8217; (units of measuring).&#8221; </font></p>

Cleanse my  heart with the water of snow and hail, and cleanse my heart from all sins as a white  garment is cleansed from filth, and let there be a far away distance between me and my  sins as You made the East and West far away from each other. O Allah! I seek refuge with  You from laziness, sins, and from being in debt.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that Allah&#8217;s Apostle was affected by magic, so much that he  used to think that he had done something which in fact, he did not do, and he invoked his  Lord (for a remedy). Then (one day) he said, &#8220;O &#8216;Aisha!) Do you know that Allah has  advised me as to the problem I consulted Him about?&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! What&#8217;s that?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Two men came to me and one of them sat at my  head and the other at my feet, and one of them asked his companion, &#8216;What is wrong with  this man?&#8217; The latter replied, &#8216;He is under the effect of magic.&#8217; The former asked, &#8216;Who  has worked magic on him?&#8217; The latter replied, &#8216;Labid bin Al-A&#8217;sam.&#8217; The former asked,  &#8216;With what did he work the magic?&#8217; The latter replied, &#8216;With a comb and the hair, which  are stuck to the comb, and the skin of pollen of a date-palm tree.&#8217; The former asked,  &#8216;Where is that?&#8217; The latter replied, &#8216;It is in Dharwan.&#8217; Dharwan was a well in the  dwelling place of the (tribe of) Bani Zuraiq. Allah&#8217;s Apostle went to that well and  returned to &#8216;Aisha, saying, &#8216;By Allah, the water (of the well) was as red as the infusion  of Hinna, (1) and the date-palm trees look like the heads of devils.&#8217; &#8216;Aisha added,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me and informed me about the well. I asked the Prophet, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle, why didn&#8217;t you take out the skin of pollen?&#8217; He said, &#8216;As for me, Allah has cured  me and I hated to draw the attention of the people to such evil (which they might learn  and harm others with).&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Hisham&#8217;s father: &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s  Apostle was bewitched, so he invoked Allah repeatedly requesting Him to cure him from that  magic).&#8221; Hisham then narrated the above narration. (See Hadith No. 658, Vol. 7) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;There are two expressions which are  very easy for the tongue to say, but they are very heavy in the balance and are very dear  to The Beneficent (Allah), and they are, &#8216;Subhan Allah Al-&#8216;Azim and &#8216;Subhan Allah wa  bihamdihi.'&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 75, Number 416: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa: The Prophet said, &#8220;The example of  the one who celebrates the Praises of his Lord (Allah) in comparison to the one who does  not celebrate the Praises of his Lord, is that of a living creature compared to a dead  one.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 75, Number 417: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah &#8216;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah has some angels who look  for those who celebrate the Praises of Allah on the roads and paths. And when they find  some people celebrating the Praises of Allah, they call each other, saying, &#8220;Come to  the object of your pursuit.&#8217; &#8221; He added, &#8220;Then the angels encircle them with  their wings up to the sky of the world.&#8221; He added. &#8220;(after those people  celebrated the Praises of Allah, and the angels go back), their Lord, asks them (those  angels)&#8212;-though He knows better than them&#8212;-&#8216;What do My slaves say?&#8217; The angels reply,  &#8216;They say: Subhan Allah, Allahu Akbar, and Alham-du-lillah, Allah then says &#8216;Did they see  Me?&#8217; The angels reply, &#8216;No! By Allah, they didn&#8217;t see You.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah says, How it would have been if they saw Me?&#8217; The  angels reply, &#8216;If they saw You, they would worship You more devoutly and celebrate Your  Glory more deeply, and declare Your freedom from any resemblance to anything more often.&#8217;  Allah says (to the angels), &#8216;What do they ask Me for?&#8217; The angels reply, &#8216;They ask You for  Paradise.&#8217; Allah says (to the angels), &#8216;Did they see it?&#8217; The angels say, &#8216;No! By Allah, O  Lord! They did not see it.&#8217; Allah says, How it would have been if they saw it?&#8217; The angels  say, &#8216;If they saw it, they would have greater covetousness for it and would seek It with  greater zeal and would have greater desire for it.&#8217; Allah says, &#8216;From what do they seek  refuge?&#8217; The angels reply, &#8216;They seek refuge from the (Hell) Fire.&#8217; Allah says, &#8216;Did they  see it?&#8217; The angels say, &#8216;No By Allah, O Lord! They did not see it.&#8217; Allah says, How it  would have been if they saw it?&#8217; The angels say, &#8216;If they saw it they would flee from it  with the extreme fleeing and would have extreme fear from it.&#8217; Then Allah says, &#8216;I make  you witnesses that I have forgiven them.&#8221;&#8216; Allah&#8217;s Apostle added, &#8220;One of the  angels would say, &#8216;There was so-and-so amongst them, and he was not one of them, but he  had just come for some need.&#8217; Allah would say, &#8216;These are those people whose companions  will not be reduced to misery.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;ari: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet started ascending a high place or hill. A man  (amongst his companions) ascended it and shouted in a loud voice, &#8220;La ilaha  illal-lahu wallahu Akbar.&#8221; (At that time) Allah&#8217;s Apostle was riding his mule.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;You are not calling upon a deaf or an absent one.&#8221; and  added, &#8220;O Abu Musa (or, O &#8216;Abdullah)! Shall I tell you a sentence from the treasure  of Paradise?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;La haul a wala quwwata illa  billah,&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah has ninety-nine Names, i.e., one hundred minus one,  and whoever believes in their meanings and acts accordingly, will enter Paradise; and  Allah is Witr (one) and loves &#8216;the Witr&#8217; (i.e., odd numbers). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were waiting for &#8216;Abdullah (bin Mas&#8217;ud). Yazid bin  Muawiya came. I said (to him), &#8220;Will you sit down?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No, but I  will go into the house (of Ibn Mas&#8217;ud) and let your companion (Ibn Mas&#8217;ud) come out to  you; and if he should not (come out), I will come out and sit (with you).&#8221; Then  &#8216;Abdullah came out, holding the hand of Yazid, addressed us, saying, &#8220;I know that you  are assembled here, but the reason that prevents me from coming out to you, is that  Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to preach to us at intervals during the days, lest we should become  bored.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some people from the tribe of &#8216;Ukl came to the Prophet and  embraced Islam. The climate of Medina did not suit them, so the Prophet ordered them to go  to the (herd of milch) camels of charity and to drink, their milk and urine (as a  medicine). They did so, and after they had recovered from their ailment (became healthy)  they turned renegades (reverted from Islam) and killed the shepherd of the camels and took  the camels away. The Prophet sent (some people) in their pursuit and so they were (caught  and) brought, and the Prophets ordered that their hands and legs should be cut off and  that their eyes should be branded with heated pieces of iron, and that their cut hands and  legs should not be cauterized, till they die. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A group of people from &#8216;Ukl (tribe) came to the Prophet and  they were living with the people of As-Suffa, but they became ill as the climate of Medina  did not suit them, so they said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Provide us with milk.&#8221; The  Prophet said, I see no other way for you than to use the camels of Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221;  So they went and drank the milk and urine of the camels, (as medicine) and became healthy  and fat. Then they killed the shepherd and took the camels away. When a help-seeker came  to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, he sent some men in their pursuit, and they were captured and brought  before mid day. The Prophet ordered for some iron pieces to be made red hot, and their  eyes were branded with them and their hands and feet were cut off and were not cauterized.  Then they were put at a place called Al-Harra, and when they asked for water to drink they  were not given till they died. (Abu Qilaba said, &#8220;Those people committed theft and  murder and fought against Allah and His Apostle.&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A group of people from &#8216;Ukl (or &#8216;Uraina) tribe &#8212;-but I  think he said that they were from &#8216;Ukl came to Medina and (they became ill, so) the  Prophet ordered them to go to the herd of (Milch) she-camels and told them to go out and  drink the camels&#8217; urine and milk (as a medicine). So they went and drank it, and when they  became healthy, they killed the shepherd and drove away the camels. This news reached the  Prophet early in the morning, so he sent (some) men in their pursuit and they were  captured and brought to the Prophet before midday. He ordered to cut off their hands and  legs and their eyes to be branded with heated iron pieces and they were thrown at  Al-Harra, and when they asked for water to drink, they were not given water. (Abu Qilaba  said, &#8220;Those were the people who committed theft and murder and reverted to disbelief  after being believers (Muslims), and fought against Allah and His Apostle&#8221;). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Seven (people) will be shaded by  Allah by His Shade on the Day of Resurrection when there will be no shade except His  Shade. (They will be), a just ruler, a young man who has been brought up in the worship of  Allah, a man who remembers Allah in seclusion and his eyes are then flooded with tears, a  man whose heart is attached to mosques (offers his compulsory congregational prayers in  the mosque), two men who love each other for Allah&#8217;s Sake, a man who is called by a  charming lady of noble birth to commit illegal sexual intercourse with her, and he says,  &#8216;I am afraid of Allah,&#8217; and (finally), a man who gives in charity so secretly that his  left hand does not know what his right hand has given.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I will narrate to you a narration which nobody will narrate  to you after me. I heard that form the Prophet. I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;The Hour  sill not be established&#8221; or said: &#8220;From among the portents of the Hour is that  the religious knowledge will betaken away (by the death of religious Scholars) and general  ignorance (of religion) will appear; and the drinking of alcoholic drinks will be very  common, and (open) illegal sexual intercourse will prevail, and men will decrease in  number while women will increase so much so that, for fifty women there will only be one  man to look after them.&#8221; </font></p>

On that, Ibn Salam said to the Jew, &#8220;Lift up your hand.&#8221; Behold! The Divine  Verse of the Rajam was under his hand.

Then I asked a learned  man about this case and he informed me that my son should receive one hundred lashes and  be exiled for one year, and the man&#8217;s wife should be stoned to death.&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I will judge you according to the Laws of  Allah. Your one-hundred sheep and the slave are to be returned to you, and your son has to  receive one-hundred lashes and be exiled for one year. O Unais!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I used to teach (the Qur&#8217;an to) some people of the  Muhajirln (emigrants), among whom there was &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin &#8216;Auf. While I was in his  house at Mina, and he was with &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab during &#8216;Umar&#8217;s last Hajj, Abdur-Rahman  came to me and said, &#8220;Would that you had seen the man who came today to the Chief of  the Believers (&#8216;Umar), saying, &#8216;O Chief of the Believers! What do you think about  so-and-so who says, &#8216;If &#8216;Umar should die, I will give the pledge of allegiance to  such-and-such person, as by Allah, the pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr was nothing but a  prompt sudden action which got established afterwards.&#8217; &#8216;Umar became angry and then said,  &#8216;Allah willing, I will stand before the people tonight and warn them against those people  who want to deprive the others of their rights (the question of rulership).&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;I said, &#8216;O Chief of the  believers! Do not do that, for the season of Hajj gathers the riff-raff and the rubble,  and it will be they who will gather around you when you stand to address the people. And I  am afraid that you will get up and say something, and some people will spread your  statement and may not say what you have actually said and may not understand its meaning,  and may interpret it incorrectly, so you should wait till you reach Medina, as it is the  place of emigration and the place of Prophet&#8217;s Traditions, and there you can come in touch  with the learned and noble people, and tell them your ideas with confidence; and the  learned people will understand your statement and put it in its proper place.&#8217; On that,  &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;By Allah! Allah willing, I will do this in the first speech I will deliver  before the people in Medina.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn Abbas added: We reached Medina by the end of the month  of Dhul-Hijja, and when it was Friday, we went quickly (to the mosque) as soon as the sun  had declined, and I saw Sa&#8217;id bin Zaid bin &#8216;Amr bin Nufail sitting at the corner of the  pulpit, and I too sat close to him so that my knee was touching his knee, and after a  short while &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab came out, and when I saw him coming towards us, I said to  Said bin Zaid bin &#8216;Amr bin Nufail &#8220;Today &#8216;Umar will say such a thing as he has never  said since he was chosen as Caliph.&#8221; Said denied my statement with astonishment and  said, &#8220;What thing do you expect &#8216;Umar to say the like of which he has never said  before?&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the meantime, &#8216;Umar sat on the pulpit and when the  callmakers for the prayer had finished their call, &#8216;Umar stood up, and having glorified  and praised Allah as He deserved, he said, &#8220;Now then, I am going to tell you  something which (Allah) has written for me to say. I do not know; perhaps it portends my  death, so whoever understands and remembers it, must narrate it to the others wherever his  mount takes him, but if somebody is afraid that he does not understand it, then it is  unlawful for him to tell lies about me. Allah sent Muhammad with the Truth and revealed  the Holy Book to him, and among what Allah revealed, was the Verse of the Rajam (the  stoning of married person (male &amp; female) who commits illegal sexual intercourse, and  we did recite this Verse and understood and memorized it. Allah&#8217;s Apostle did carry out  the punishment of stoning and so did we after him. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I am afraid that after a long time has passed, somebody  will say, &#8216;By Allah, we do not find the Verse of the Rajam in Allah&#8217;s Book,&#8217; and thus they  will go astray by leaving an obligation which Allah has revealed. And the punishment of  the Rajam is to be inflicted to any married person (male &amp; female), who commits  illegal sexual intercourse, if the required evidence is available or there is conception  or confession. And then we used to recite among the Verses in Allah&#8217;s Book: &#8216;O people! Do  not claim to be the offspring of other than your fathers, as it is disbelief  (unthankfulness) on your part that you claim to be the offspring of other than your real  father.&#8217; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Do not praise me excessively as Jesus, son of Marry  was praised, but call me Allah&#8217;s Slave and His Apostles.&#8217; (O people!) I have been informed  that a speaker amongst you says, &#8216;By Allah, if &#8216;Umar should die, I will give the pledge of  allegiance to such-and-such person.&#8217; One should not deceive oneself by saying that the  pledge of allegiance given to Abu Bakr was given suddenly and it was successful. No doubt,  it was like that, but Allah saved (the people) from its evil, and there is none among you  who has the qualities of Abu Bakr. Remember that whoever gives the pledge of allegiance to  anybody among you without consulting the other Muslims, neither that person, nor the  person to whom the pledge of allegiance was given, are to be supported, lest they both  should be killed. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>And no doubt after the death of the Prophet we were  informed that the Ansar disagreed with us and gathered in the shed of Bani Sa&#8217;da. &#8216;Ali and  Zubair and whoever was with them, opposed us, while the emigrants gathered with Abu Bakr.  I said to Abu Bakr, &#8216;Let&#8217;s go to these Ansari brothers of ours.&#8217; So we set out seeking  them, and when we approached them, two pious men of theirs met us and informed us of the  final decision of the Ansar, and said, &#8216;O group of Muhajirin (emigrants) ! Where are you  going?&#8217; We replied, &#8216;We are going to these Ansari brothers of ours.&#8217; They said to us, &#8216;You  shouldn&#8217;t go near them. Carry out whatever we have already decided.&#8217; I said, &#8216;By Allah, we  will go to them.&#8217; And so we proceeded until we reached them at the shed of Bani Sa&#8217;da.  Behold! There was a man sitting amongst them and wrapped in something. I asked, &#8216;Who is  that man?&#8217; They said, &#8216;He is Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada.&#8217; I asked, &#8216;What is wrong with him?&#8217; They  said, &#8216;He is sick.&#8217; After we sat for a while, the Ansar&#8217;s speaker said, &#8216;None has the  right to be worshipped but Allah,&#8217; and praising Allah as He deserved, he added, &#8216;To  proceed, we are Allah&#8217;s Ansar (helpers) and the majority of the Muslim army, while you,  the emigrants, are a small group and some people among you came with the intention of  preventing us from practicing this matter (of caliphate) and depriving us of it.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the speaker had finished, I intended to speak as I had  prepared a speech which I liked and which I wanted to deliver in the presence of Abu Bakr,  and I used to avoid provoking him. So, when I wanted to speak, Abu Bakr said, &#8216;Wait a  while.&#8217; I disliked to make him angry. So Abu Bakr himself gave a speech, and he was wiser  and more patient than I. By Allah, he never missed a sentence that I liked in my own  prepared speech, but he said the like of it or better than it spontaneously. After a pause  he said, &#8216;O Ansar! You deserve all (the qualities that you have attributed to yourselves,  but this question (of Caliphate) is only for the Quraish as they are the best of the Arabs  as regards descent and home, and I am pleased to suggest that you choose either of these  two men, so take the oath of allegiance to either of them as you wish. And then Abu Bakr  held my hand and Abu Ubada bin Abdullah&#8217;s hand who was sitting amongst us. I hated nothing  of what he had said except that proposal, for by Allah, I would rather have my neck  chopped off as expiator for a sin than become the ruler of a nation, one of whose members  is Abu Bakr, unless at the time of my death my own-self suggests something I don&#8217;t feel at  present.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>And then one of the Ansar said, &#8216;I am the pillar on which  the camel with a skin disease (eczema) rubs itself to satisfy the itching (i.e., I am a  noble), and I am as a high class palm tree! O Quraish. There should be one ruler from us  and one from you.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then there was a hue and cry among the gathering and their  voices rose so that I was afraid there might be great disagreement, so I said, &#8216;O Abu  Bakr! Hold your hand out.&#8217; He held his hand out and I pledged allegiance to him, and then  all the emigrants gave the Pledge of allegiance and so did the Ansar afterwards. And so we  became victorious over Sa&#8217;d bin Ubada (whom Al-Ansar wanted to make a ruler). One of the  Ansar said, &#8216;You have killed Sa&#8217;d bin Ubada.&#8217; I replied, &#8216;Allah has killed Sa&#8217;d bin  Ubada.&#8217; Umar added, &#8220;By Allah, apart from the great tragedy that had happened to us  (i.e. the death of the Prophet), there was no greater problem than the allegiance pledged  to Abu Bakr because we were afraid that if we left the people, they might give the Pledge  of allegiance after us to one of their men, in which case we would have given them our  consent for something against our real wish, or would have opposed them and caused great  trouble. So if any person gives the Pledge of allegiance to somebody (to become a Caliph)  without consulting the other Muslims, then the one he has selected should not be granted  allegiance, lest both of them should be killed.&#8221; </font></p>

Decide his case according to Allah&#8217;s Laws. My son was a laborer working  for this person, and he committed illegal sexual intercourse with his wife, and the people  told me that my son should be stoned to death, but I offered one-hundred sheep and a slave  girl as a ransom for him. Then I asked the religious learned people, and they told me that  my son should be flogged with one-hundred stripes and be exiled for one year.&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I will judge you according to Allah&#8217;s  Laws.

One of them put his hand over the verse of the Rajam and read what was before  and after it. Abdullah bin Salam said to him, &#8220;Lift up your hand.&#8221; Where he  lifted it there appeared the verse of the Rajam. So they said, &#8220;O Muhammad! He has  said the truth, the verse of the Rajam is in it (Torah).&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle  ordered that the two persons (guilty of illegal sexual intercourse) be stoned to death,  and so they were stoned, and I saw the man bending over the woman so as to protect her  from the stones. </font></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 78:</p>
<h3 align="center">Oaths and Vows</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.078.618"></a>Volume 8, Book 78, Number 618:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr As-Siddiq had never broken his oaths till Allah revealed the expiation for the oaths. Then he said, &#8220;If I take an oath to do something and later on I find something else better than the first one, then I do what is better and make expiation for my oath.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 619:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Samura:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Samura! Do not seek to be a ruler, because if you are given authority for it, then you will be held responsible for it, but if you are given it without asking for it, then you will be helped in it (by Allah): and whenever you take an oath to do something and later you find that something else is better than the first, then do the better one and make expiation for your oath.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 620:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I went to the Prophet along with a group of Al-Ash&#8217;ariyin in order to request him to provide us with mounts. He said, &#8220;By Allah, I will not provide you with mounts and I haven&#8217;t got anything to mount you on.&#8221; Then we stayed there as long as Allah wished us to stay, and then three very nice looking she-camels were brought to him and he made us ride them. When we left, we, or some of us, said, &#8220;By Allah, we will not be blessed, as we came to the Prophet asking him for mounts, and he swore that he would not give us any mounts but then he did give us. So let us go back to the Prophet and remind him (of his oath).&#8221; When we returned to him (and reminded him of the fact), he said, &#8220;I did not give you mounts, but it is Allah Who gave you. By Allah, Allah willing, if I ever take an oath to do something and then I find something else than the first, I will make expiation for my oath and do the thing which is better (or do something which is better and give the expiation for my oath).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 621:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;We (Muslims) are the last in the world, but will be foremost on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle also said, &#8220;By Allah, if anyone of you insists on fulfilling an oath by which he may harm his family, he commits a greater sin in Allah&#8217;s sight than that of dissolving his oath and making expiation for it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 622:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Anyone who takes an oath through which his family may be harmed, and insists on keeping it, he surely commits a sin greater (than that of dissolving his oath). He should rather compensate for that oath by making expiation.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 623:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent an army detachment and made Usama bin Zaid its commander. Some people criticized (spoke badly of) Usama&#8217;s leadership. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up saying, &#8220;If you people are criticizing Usama&#8217;s leadership, you have already criticized the leadership of his father before. But Wa-aimullah (i.e., By Allah), he (i.e. Zaid) deserved the leadership, and he was one of the most beloved persons to me; and now this (his son Usama) is one of the dearest persons to me after him.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 745, Vol. 5)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 624:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The oath of the Prophet used to be: &#8220;No, by Him who turns the hearts.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 625:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin Samura:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;If Caesar is ruined, there will be no Caesar after him; and if Khosrau is ruined, there will be no Khosrau, after him; and, by Him in Whose Hand my soul is, surely you will spend their treasures in Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 626:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If Khosrau is ruined, there will be no Khosrau after him; and if Caesar is ruined, there will be no Caesar after him. By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad&#8217;s soul is, surely you will spend their treasures in Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 627:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;O followers of Muhammad! By Allah, if you knew what I know, you would weep much and laugh little.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 628:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Hisham:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were with the Prophet and he was holding the hand of &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab. &#8216;Umar said to Him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You are dearer to me than everything except my own self.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;No, by Him in Whose Hand my soul is, (you will not have complete faith) till I am dearer to you than your own self.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar said to him, &#8220;However, now, by Allah, you are dearer to me than my own self.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Now, O &#8216;Umar, (now you are a believer).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 629:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira and Zaid bin Khalid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Two men had a dispute in the presence of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. One of them said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Judge between us according to Allah&#8217;s Laws.&#8221; The other who was wiser, said, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Judge between us according to Allah&#8217;s Laws and allow me to speak. The Prophet said, &#8220;Speak.&#8221; He said, &#8220;My son was a laborer serving this (person) and he committed illegal sexual intercourse with his wife, The people said that my son is to be stoned to death, but I ransomed him with one-hundred sheep and a slave girl. Then I asked the learned people, who informed me that my son should receive one hundred lashes and will be exiled for one year, and stoning will be the lot for the man&#8217;s wife.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Indeed, by Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I will judge between you according to Allah&#8217;s Laws: As for your sheep and slave girl, they are to be returned to you.&#8221; Then he scourged his son one hundred lashes and exiled him for one year. Then Unais Al-Aslami was ordered to go to the wife of the second man, and if she confessed (the crime), then stone her to death. She did confess, so he stoned her to death.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 630:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Do you think if the tribes of Aslam, Ghifar, Muzaina and Juhaina are better than the tribes of Tamim, &#8216;Amir bin Sa&#8217;sa&#8217;a, Ghatfan and Asad, they (the second group) are despairing and losing?&#8221; They (the Prophet&#8217;s companions) said, &#8220;Yes, (they are).&#8221; He said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, they (the first group) are better than them (the second group).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 631:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Humaid As-Sa&#8217;idi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle employed an employee (to collect Zakat). The employee returned after completing his job and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! This (amount of Zakat) is for you, and this (other amount) was given to me as a present.&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you stay at your father&#8217;s or mother&#8217;s house and see if you would be given presents or not?&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up in the evening after the prayer, and having testified that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and praised and glorified Allah as He deserved, he said, &#8220;Now then ! What about an employee whom we employ and then he comes and says, &#8216;This amount (of Zakat) is for you, and this (amount) was given to me as a present&#8217;? Why didn&#8217;t he stay at the house of his father and mother to see if he would be given presents or not? By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad&#8217;s soul is, none of you will steal anything of it (i.e. Zakat) but will bring it by carrying it over his neck on the Day of Resurrection. If it has been a camel, he will bring it (over his neck) while it will be grunting, and if it has been a cow, he will bring it (over his neck), while it will be mooing; and if it has been a sheep, he will bring it (over his neck) while it will be bleeding.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;I have preached you (Allah&#8217;s Message).&#8221; Abu Humaid said, &#8220;Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle raised his hands so high that we saw the whiteness of his armpits.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 632:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu-l-Qasim (the Prophet) said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad&#8217;s soul is, if you know that which I know, you would weep much and laugh little.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 633:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Dhar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I reached him (the Prophet ) while in the shade of the Ka&#8217;ba; he was saying, &#8220;They are the losers, by the Lord of the Ka&#8217;ba! They are the losers, by the Lord of the Ka&#8217;ba!&#8221; I said (to myself ), &#8220;What is wrong with me? Is anything improper detected in me? What is wrong with me? Then I sat beside him and he kept on saying his statement. I could not remain quiet, and Allah knows in what sorrowful state I was at that time. So I said, &#8216; Who are they (the losers)? Let My father and mother be sacrificed for you, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He said, &#8220;They are the wealthy people, except the one who does like this and like this and like this (i.e., spends of his wealth in Allah&#8217;s Cause).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;(The Prophet) Solomon once said, &#8216;Tonight I will sleep with ninety women, each of whom will bring forth a (would-be) cavalier who will fight in Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221; On this, his companion said to him, &#8220;Say: Allah willing!&#8221; But he did not say Allah willing. Solomon then slept with all the women, but none of them became pregnant but one woman who later delivered a half-man. By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad&#8217;s soul is, if he (Solomon) had said, &#8216;Allah willing&#8217; (all his wives would have brought forth boys) and they would have fought in Allah&#8217;s Cause as cavaliers. &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zahdam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a relation of love and brotherhood between this tribe of Jarm and Al-Ash&#8217;ariyin. Once we were with Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;ari, and then a meal containing chicken was brought to Abu Musa, and there was present, a man from the tribe of Taimillah who was of red complexion as if he were from non-Arab freed slaves. Abu Musa invited him to the meal. He said, &#8220;I have seen chickens eating dirty things, so I deemed it filthy and took an oath that I would never eat chicken.&#8221; On that, Abu Musa said, &#8220;Get up, I will narrate to you about that. Once a group of the Ash&#8217;ariyin and I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and asked him to provide us with mounts; he said, &#8216;By Allah, I will never give you any mounts nor do I have anything to mount you on.&#8217; Then a few camels of war booty were brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle , and he asked about us, saying, &#8216;Where are the Ash-&#8216;ariyin?&#8217; He then ordered five nice camels to be given to us, and when we had departed, we said, &#8216;What have we done? Allah&#8217;s Apostle had taken the oath not to give us any mounts, and that he had nothing to mount us on, and later he gave us that we might ride? Did we take advantage of the fact that Allah&#8217;s Apostle had forgotten his oath? By Allah, we will never succeed.&#8217; So we went back to him and said to him, &#8216;We came to you to give us mounts, and you took an oath that you would not give us any mounts and that you had nothing to mount us on.&#8217; On that he said, &#8216;I did not provide you with mounts, but Allah did. By Allah, if I take an oath to do something, and then find something else better than it, I do that which is better and make expiation for the dissolution of the oath.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

When he sat there (at the house of his daughter), the child was brought to him, and he took him into his lap while the child&#8217;s breath was disturbed in his chest.

<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard &#8216;Urwa bin Az-Zubair, Said bin Al-Musaiyab, &#8216;Alqama bin Waqqas and &#8216;Ubaidullah bin &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Uqba relating from &#8216;Aisha, the wife of the Prophet the narration of the people (i.e. the liars) who spread the slander against her and they said what they said, and how Allah revealed her innocence. Each of them related to me a portion of that narration. (They said that &#8216;Aisha said), &#8221;Then Allah revealed the ten Verses starting with:&#8211;&#8216;Verily! Those who spread the slander..&#8217; (24.11-21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All these verses were in proof of my innocence. Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah some financial aid because of his relation to him, said, &#8220;By Allah, I will never give anything (in charity) to Mistah, after what he has said about &#8216;Aisha&#8221; Then Allah revealed:&#8211; &#8216;And let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (any sort of help) to their kins men&#8230;.&#8217; (24.22) On that, Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Yes, by Allah, I like that Allah should forgive me.&#8221; and then resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him and said, &#8220;By Allah! I will never withhold it from him.&#8221;</p>

We asked him to provide us with mounts, but he swore that he would not give us any. Later on he said, &#8220;By Allah, Allah willing, if ever I take an oath (to do something) and later on I find something else better than the first, then I do the better one and give expiation for the dissolution of my oath.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.077.593">Volume 8, Book 77, Number 593: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle, the truthful and truly-inspired, said,  &#8220;Each one of you collected in the womb of his mother for forty days, and then turns  into a clot for an equal period (of forty days) and turns into a piece of flesh for a  similar period (of forty days) and then Allah sends an angel and orders him to write four  things, i.e., his provision, his age, and whether he will be of the wretched or the  blessed (in the Hereafter). Then the soul is breathed into him. And by Allah, a person  among you (or a man) may do deeds of the people of the Fire till there is only a cubit or  an arm-breadth distance between him and the Fire, but then that writing (which Allah has  ordered the angel to write) precedes, and he does the deeds of the people of Paradise and  enters it; and a man may do the deeds of the people of Paradise till there is only a cubit  or two between him and Paradise, and then that writing precedes and he does the deeds of  the people of the Fire and enters it.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.077.594"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 594: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah puts an angel in charge of  the uterus and the angel says, &#8216;O Lord, (it is) semen! O Lord, (it is now ) a clot! O  Lord, (it is now) a piece of flesh.&#8217; And then, if Allah wishes to complete its creation,  the angel asks, &#8216;O Lord, (will it be) a male or a female? A wretched (an evil doer) or a  blessed (doer of good)? How much will his provisions be? What will his age be?&#8217; So all  that is written while the creature is still in the mother&#8217;s womb.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 595: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Imran bin Husain: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Can the people of  Paradise be known (differentiated) from the people of the Fire; The Prophet replied,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;Why do people (try to) do (good) deeds?&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;Everyone will do the deeds for which he has been created to do or he  will do those deeds which will be made easy for him to do.&#8221; (i.e. everybody will find  easy to do such deeds as will lead him to his destined place for which he has been  created). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet ; was asked about the offspring of the pagans.  He said, &#8220;Allah knows what they would have done (were they to live).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 597: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle was asked about the offspring of the  pagans. He said, &#8220;Allah knows what they would have done (were they to live).&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;No child  is born but has the Islamic Faith, but its parents turn it into a Jew or a Christian. It  is as you help the animals give birth. Do you find among their offspring a mutilated one  before you mutilate them yourself?&#8221; The people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What do  you think about those (of them) who die young?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah knows  what they would have done (were they to live).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;No woman should ask for the  divorce of her sister (Muslim) so as to take her place, but she should marry the man  (without compelling him to divorce his other wife), for she will have nothing but what  Allah has written for her.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 599: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Usama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once while I was with the Prophet and Sa&#8217;d, Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b  and Mu&#8217;adh were also sitting with him, there came to him a messenger from one of his  daughters, telling him that her child was on the verge of death. The Prophet told the  messenger to tell her, &#8220;It is for Allah what He takes, and it is for Allah what He  gives, and everything has its fixed time (limit). So (she should) be patient and look for  Allah&#8217;s reward.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.077.600"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 600: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That while he was sitting with the Prophet a man from the  Ansar came and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We get slave girls from the war captives and  we love property; what do you think about coitus interruptus?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;Do you do that? It is better for you not to do it, for there is no soul which Allah  has ordained to come into existence but will be created.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.077.601"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 601: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Hudhaifa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet once delivered a speech in front of us wherein  he left nothing but mentioned (about) everything that would happen till the Hour. Some of  us stored that our minds and some forgot it. (After that speech) I used to see events  taking place (which had been referred to in that speech) but I had forgotten them (before  their occurrence). Then I would recognize such events as a man recognizes another man who  has been absent and then sees and recognizes him. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.077.602"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 602: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ali: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were sitting with the Prophet who had a stick with  which he was scraping the earth, he lowered his head and said, &#8220;There is none of you  but has his place assigned either in the Fire or in Paradise.&#8221; Thereupon a man from  the people said, &#8220;Shall we not depend upon this, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;No, but carry on and do your deeds, for everybody finds it easy to do such  deeds (as will lead him to his place).&#8221; The Prophet then recited the Verse: &#8216;As for  him who gives (in charity) and keeps his duty to Allah..&#8217; (92.5) </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.077.603"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 603: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We witnessed along with Allah&#8217;s Apostle the Khaibar  (campaign). Allah&#8217;s Apostle told his companions about a man who claimed to be a Muslim,  &#8220;This man is from the people of the Fire.&#8221; When the battle started, the man  fought very bravely and received a great number of wounds and got crippled. On that, a man  from among the companions of the Prophet came and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do you  know what the man you described as of the people of the Fire has done? He has fought very  bravely for Allah&#8217;s Cause and he has received many wounds.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;But he is indeed one of the people of the Fire.&#8221; Some of the Muslims were about  to have some doubt about that statement. So while the man was in that state, the pain  caused by the wounds troubled him so much that he put his hand into his quiver and took  out an arrow and committed suicide with it. Off went some men from among the Muslims to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah has made your statement true.  So-and-so has committed suicide.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Bilal! Get up and  announce in public: None will enter Paradise but a believer, and Allah may support this  religion (Islam) with a wicked man.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.077.604"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 604: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sa&#8217;d: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>There was a man who fought most bravely of all the Muslims  on behalf of the Muslims in a battle (Ghazwa) in the company of the Prophet. The Prophet  looked at him and said. &#8220;If anyone would like to see a man from the people of the  Fire, let him look at this (brave man).&#8221; On that, a man from the People (Muslims)  followed him, and he was in that state i.e., fighting fiercely against the pagans till he  was wounded, and then he hastened to end his life by placing his sword between his breasts  (and pressed it with great force) till it came out between his shoulders. Then the man  (who was watching that person) went quickly to the Prophet and said, &#8220;I testify that  you are Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet asked him, &#8220;Why do you say that?&#8221; He  said, &#8220;You said about so-and-so, &#8216;If anyone would like to see a man from the people  of the Fire, he should look at him.&#8217; He fought most bravely of all of us on behalf of the  Muslims and I knew that he would not die as a Muslim (Martyr). So when he got wounded, he  hastened to die and committed suicide.&#8221; There-upon the Prophet said, &#8220;A man may  do the deeds of the people of the Fire while in fact he is one of the people of Paradise,  and he may do the deeds of the people of Paradise while in fact he belongs to the people  of Fire, and verily, (the rewards of) the deeds are decided by the last actions  (deeds)&#8221;. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 605: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet forbade vowing and said, &#8220;In fact, vowing  does not prevent anything, but it makes a miser to spend his property.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.077.606"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 606: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said (that Allah said), &#8220;Vowing does not  bring to the son of Adam anything I have not already written in his fate, but vowing is  imposed on him by way of fore ordainment. Through vowing I make a miser spend of his  wealth.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 607: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were with Allah&#8217;s Apostle in a holy battle, we  never went up a hill or reached its peak or went down a valley but raised our voices with  Takbir. Allah&#8217;s Apostle came close to us and said, &#8220;O people! Don&#8217;t exert yourselves,  for you do not call a deaf or an absent one, but you call the All-Listener, the  All-Seer.&#8221; The Prophet then said, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah bin Qais! Shall I teach you a  sentence which is from the treasures of Paradise? ( It is): &#8216;La haula wala quwata illa  billah. (There is neither might nor power except with Allah).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That the Prophet said, &#8220;No Caliph is appointed but has  two groups of advisors: One group advises him to do good and urges him to adopt it, and  the other group advises him to do bad and urges him to adopt it; and the protected is the  one whom Allah protects.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 609: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I did not see anything so resembling minor sins as what Abu  Huraira said from the Prophet, who said, &#8220;Allah has written for the son of Adam his  inevitable share of adultery whether he is aware of it or not: The adultery of the eye is  the looking (at something which is sinful to look at), and the adultery of the tongue is  to utter (what it is unlawful to utter), and the innerself wishes and longs for (adultery)  and the private parts turn that into reality or refrain from submitting to the  temptation.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(regarding the Verse) &#8220;And We granted the vision  (Ascension to the heavens &#8220;Miraj&#8221;) which We showed you (O Muhammad as an actual  eye witness) but as a trial for mankind.&#8217; (17.60): Allah&#8217;s Apostle actually saw with his  own eyes the vision (all the things which were shown to him) on the night of his Night  Journey to Jerusalem (and then to the heavens). The cursed tree which is mentioned in the  Qur&#8217;an is the tree of Az-Zaqqum. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 611: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Adam and Moses argued with each  other. Moses said to Adam. &#8216;O Adam! You are our father who disappointed us and turned us  out of Paradise.&#8217; Then Adam said to him, &#8216;O Moses! Allah favored you with His talk (talked  to you directly) and He wrote (the Torah) for you with His Own Hand. Do you blame me for  action which Allah had written in my fate forty years before my creation?&#8217; So Adam  confuted Moses, Adam confuted Moses,&#8221; the Prophet added, repeating the Statement  three times. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the freed slave of Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba) Muawiya wrote to  Mughira. &#8216;Write to me what you heard the Prophet saying after his prayer.&#8217; So Al-Mughira  dictated to me and said, &#8220;I heard the Prophet saying after the prayer, &#8216;None has the  right to be worshipped but Allah Alone Who has no partner. O Allah! No-one can withhold  what You give, and none can give what You withhold, and the fortune of a man of means is  useless before You (i.e., only good deeds are of value).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about the plague. He said,  &#8220;That was a means of torture which Allah used to send upon whom-so-ever He wished,  but He made it a source of mercy for the believers, for anyone who is residing in a town  in which this disease is present, and remains there and does not leave that town, but has  patience and hopes for Allah&#8217;s reward, and knows that nothing will befall him except what  Allah has written for him, then he will get such reward as that of a martyr.&#8221; </font></p>

O Allah! Send down Sakina  (calmness) upon us and make our feet firm when we meet (the enemy). The pagans have  rebelled against us, but if they want to put us in affliction (i.e., fight us) we refuse  (to flee).&#8221; (See Hadith No. 430, Vol. 5). </font></p>

The Prophet stopped to give the people  verdicts. In the meantime, a beautiful woman From the tribe of Khath&#8217;am came, asking the  verdict of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Al-Fadl started looking at her as her beauty attracted him.  The Prophet looked behind while Al-Fadl was looking at her; so the Prophet held out his  hand backwards and caught the chin of Al-Fadl and turned his face (to the owner sides in  order that he should not gaze at her. She said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The obligation of  Performing Hajj enjoined by Allah on His worshipers, has become due (compulsory) on my  father who is an old man and who cannot sit firmly on the riding animal. Will it be  sufficient that I perform Hajj on his behalf?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When we prayed with the Prophet we used to say: As-Salam be  on Allah from His worshipers, As-Salam be on Gabriel, As-Salam be on Michael, As-Salam be  on so-and-so. When the Prophet finished his prayer, he faced us and said, &#8220;Allah  Himself is As-Salam (Peace), so when one sits in the prayer, one should say,  &#8216;At-Tahiyatu-lillahi Was-Salawatu, Wat-Taiyibatu, As-Salamu &#8216;Alaika aiyuhan-Nabiyyu wa  Rah-matul-lahi wa Barakatuhu, As-Salamu &#8216;Alaina wa &#8216;ala &#8216;Ibadillahi assalihin, for if he  says so, then it will be for all the pious slave of Allah in the Heavens and the Earth.  (Then he should say), &#8216;Ash-hadu an la ilaha illalllahu wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan &#8216;Abduhu  wa rasulu-hu,&#8217; and then he can choose whatever speech (i.e. invocation) he wishes &#8221;  (See Hadith No. 797, Vol. 1) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered us to do seven (things): to visit  the sick, to follow the funeral processions, to say Tashmit to a sneezer, to help the  weak, to help the oppressed ones, to propagate As-Salam (greeting), and to help others to  fulfill their oaths (if it is not sinful). He forbade us to drink from silver utensils, to  wear gold rings, to ride on silken saddles, to wear silk clothes, Dibaj (thick silk  cloth), Qassiy and Istabraq (two kinds of silk).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man asked the Prophet, &#8220;What Islamic traits are the  best?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Feed the people, and greet those whom you know and  those whom you do not know.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that he was a boy of ten at the time when the Prophet  emigrated to Medina. He added: I served Allah&#8217;s Apostle for ten years (the last part of  his life time) and I know more than the people about the occasion whereupon the order of  Al-Hijab was revealed (to the Prophet). Ubai b n Ka&#8217;b used to ask me about it. It was  revealed (for the first time) during the marriage of Allah&#8217;s Apostle with Zainab bint  Jahsh. In the morning, the Prophet was a bride-groom of her and he Invited the people, who  took their meals and went away, but a group of them remained with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and they  prolonged their stay. Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up and went out, and I too, went out along with  him till he came to the lintel of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s dwelling place. Allah&#8217;s Apostle thought that  those people had left by then, so he returned, and I too, returned with him till he  entered upon Zainab and found that they were still sitting there and had not yet gone. The  Prophet went out again, and so did I with him till he reached the lintel of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s  dwelling place, and then he thought that those people must have left by then, so he  returned, and so did I with him, and found those people had gone. At that time the Divine  Verse of Al-Hijab was revealed, and the Prophet set a screen between me and him (his  family). </font></p>

The Prophet showed as if he wanted to get up, but they did not get up. When he noticed  that, he got up, and some of the people also got up and went away, while some others kept  on sitting. When the Prophet returned to enter, he found the people still sitting, but  then they got up and left. So I told the Prophet of their departure and he came and went  in. I intended to go in but the Prophet put a screen between me and him, for Allah  revealed:&#8211; &#8216;O you who believe! Enter not the Prophet&#8217;s houses..&#8217; (33.53) </font></p>

The wives of  the Prophet used to go out to answer the call of nature at night only at Al-Manasi.&#8217; Once  Sauda, the daughter of Zam&#8217;a went out and she was a tall woman. &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab saw  her while he was in a gathering, and said, &#8220;I have recognized you, O Sauda!&#8221; He  (&#8216;Umar) said so as he was anxious for some Divine orders regarding the veil (the veiling  of women.) So Allah revealed the Verse of veiling. (Al-Hijab; a complete body cover  excluding the eyes). (See Hadith No. 148, Vol. 1) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Usama bin Zaid said, &#8220;The Prophet rode over a donkey  with a saddle underneath which there was a thick soft Fadakiya velvet sheet. Usama bin  Zaid was his companion rider, and he was going to pay a visit to Sa&#8217;d bin Ubada (who was  sick) at the dwelling place of Bani Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj, and this incident happened  before the battle of Badr. The Prophet passed by a gathering in which there were Muslims  and pagan idolators and Jews, and among them there was &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul, and  there was &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha too. When a cloud of dust raised by the animal covered that  gathering, &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai covered his nose with his Rida (sheet) and said (to the  Prophet), &#8220;Don&#8217;t cover us with dust.&#8221; The Prophet greeted them and then stopped,  dismounted and invited them to Allah (i.e., to embrace Islam) and also recited to them the  Holy Quran. &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai&#8217; bin Salul said, &#8220;O man! There is nothing better than  what you say, if what you say is the truth. So do not trouble us in our gatherings. Go  back to your mount (or house,) and if anyone of us comes to you, tell (your tales) to  him.&#8221; On that &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha said, &#8220;(O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!) Come to us and  bring it(what you want to say) in our gatherings, for we love that.&#8221; So the Muslims,  the pagans and the Jews started quarreling till they were about to fight and clash with  one another. The Prophet kept on quietening them (till they all became quiet). He then  rode his animal, and proceeded till he entered upon Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada, he said, &#8220;O  Sa&#8217;d, didn&#8217;t you hear what Abu Habbab said? (He meant &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai). He said  so-and-so.&#8221; Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Excuse and forgive him,  for by Allah, Allah has given you what He has given you. The people of this town decided  to crown him (as their chief) and make him their king. But when Allah prevented that with  the Truth which He had given you, it choked him, and that was what made him behave in the  way you saw him behaving.&#8221; So the Prophet excused him. </font></p>

We said (to her) &#8220;Where is  the letter which is with you?&#8221; She said, &#8220;I have no letter with me.&#8221; So we  made her camel kneel down and searched her mount (baggage etc) but could not find  anything. My two companions said, &#8220;We do not see any letter.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I  know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not tell a lie. By Allah, if you (the lady) do not bring out  the letter, I will strip you of your clothes&#8217; When she noticed that I was serious, she put  her hand into the knot of her waist sheet, for she was tying a sheet round herself, and  brought out the letter. So we proceeded to Allah&#8217;s Apostle with the letter. The Prophet  said (to Habib), &#8220;What made you o what you have done, O Hatib?&#8221; Hatib replied,  &#8220;I have done nothing except that I believe in Allah and His Apostle, and I have not  changed or altered (my religion). But I wanted to do the favor to the people (pagans of  Mecca) through which Allah might protect my family and my property, as there is none among  your companions but has someone in Mecca through whom Allah protects his property (against  harm). The Prophet said, &#8220;Habib has told you the truth, so do not say to him  (anything) but good.&#8221; &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab said, &#8220;Verily he has betrayed Allah,  His Apostle, and the believers! Allow me to chop his neck off!&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;O &#8216;Umar! What do you know; perhaps Allah looked upon the Badr warriors and said, &#8216;Do  whatever you like, for I have ordained that you will be in Paradise.'&#8221; On that &#8216;Umar  wept and said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know best.&#8221; </font></p>

Peace be on us and on the pious slaves of Allah, I testify  that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and I also testify that Muhammad is  Allah&#8217;s slave and His Apostle.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Ali bin Abu Talib came out of the house of the Prophet  during his fatal ailment. The people asked (&#8216;Ali), &#8220;O Abu Hasan! How is the health of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle this morning?&#8221; &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;This morning he is better, with the  grace of Allah.&#8221; Al-&#8216;Abbas held Ali by the hand and said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see him  (about to die)? By Allah, within three days you will be the slave of the stick (i.e.,  under the command of another ruler). By Allah, I think that Allah&#8217;s Apostle will die from  his present ailment, for I know the signs of death on the faces of the offspring of &#8216;Abdul  Muttalib. So let us go to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to ask him who will take over the Caliphate. If  the authority is given to us, we will know it, and if it is given to somebody else we will  request him to recommend us to him. &#8221; &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;By Allah! If we ask Allah&#8217;s  Apostle for the rulership and he refuses, then the people will never give it to us.  Besides, I will never ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle for it.&#8221; (See Hadith No 728, Vol 5) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was walking with the Prophet at the Hurra of Medina  in the evening, the mountain of Uhud appeared before us. The Prophet said, &#8220;O Abu  Dhar! I would not like to have gold equal to Uhud (mountain) for me, unless nothing of it,  not even a single Dinar remains of it with me, for more than one day or three days, except  that single Dinar which I will keep for repaying debts. I will spend all of it (the whole  amount) among Allah&#8217;s slaves like this and like this and like this.&#8221; The Prophet  pointed out with his hand to illustrate it and then said, &#8220;O Abu Dhar!&#8221; I  replied, &#8220;Labbaik wa Sa&#8217;daik, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He said, &#8220;Those who have  much wealth (in this world) will be the least rewarded (in the Hereafter) except those who  do like this and like this (i.e., spend their money in charity).&#8221; Then he ordered me,  &#8220;Remain at your place and do not leave it, O Abu Dhar, till I come back.&#8221; He  went away till he disappeared from me. Then I heard a voice and feared that something  might have happened to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and I intended to go (to find out) but I  remembered the statement of Allah&#8217;s Apostle that I should not leave, my place, so I kept  on waiting (and after a while the Prophet came), and I said to him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle, I heard a voice and I was afraid that something might have happened to you, but  then I remembered your statement and stayed (there). The Prophet said, &#8220;That was  Gabriel who came to me and informed me that whoever among my followers died without  joining others in worship with Allah, would enter Paradise.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! Even if he had committed illegal sexual intercourse and theft?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Even if he had committed illegal sexual intercourse and theft &#8216; </font></p>

Which sin is the  greatest in Allah&#8217;s Sight?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;To set up a rival unto Allah  though He Alone created you . &#8221; The man said, &#8220;What is next?&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;To kill your son lest he should share your food with you.&#8221; The man said,  &#8220;What is next?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;To commit illegal sexual intercourse  with the wife of your neighbor.&#8221; So Allah revealed in confirmation of this  narration:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;And those who invoke not with Allah, any other god. Nor  kill, such life as Allah has forbidden except for just cause nor commit illegal sexual  intercourse. And whoever does this shall receive the punishment.&#8217; (25.68) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Miqdad bin &#8216;Amr Al-Kindi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>An ally of Bani Zuhra who took part in the battle of Badr  with the Prophet, that he said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If I meet an unbeliever and we  have a fight, and he strikes my hand with the sword and cuts it off, and then takes refuge  from me under a tree, and says, &#8216;I have surrendered to Allah (i.e. embraced Islam),&#8217; may I  kill him after he has said so?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Do not kill him.&#8221;  Al-Miqdad said, &#8220;But O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He had chopped off one of my hands and he  said that after he had cut it off. May I kill him?&#8221; The Prophet said. &#8220;Do not  kill him for if you kill him, he would be in the position in which you had been before you  kill him, and you would be in the position in which he was before he said the  sentence.&#8221; The Prophet also said to Al-Miqdad, &#8220;If a faithful believer conceals  his faith (Islam) from the disbelievers, and then when he declares his Islam, you kill  him, (you will be sinful). Remember that you were also concealing your faith (Islam) at  Mecca before.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;No human being is killed unjustly,  but a part of responsibility for the crime is laid on the first son of Adam who invented  the tradition of killing (murdering) on the earth. (It is said that he was Qabil). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the year of the Conquest of Mecca, the tribe of Khuza&#8217;a  killed a man from the tribe of Bam Laith in revenge for a killed person belonging to them  in the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up saying, &#8220;Allah held  back the (army having) elephants from Mecca, but He let His Apostle and the believers  overpower the infidels (of Mecca). Beware! (Mecca is a sanctuary)! Verily! Fighting in  Mecca was not permitted for anybody before me, nor will it be permitted for anybody after  me; It was permitted for me only for a while (an hour or so) of that day. No doubt! It is  at this moment a sanctuary; its thorny shrubs should not be uprooted; its trees should not  be cut down; and its Luqata (fallen things) should not be picked up except by the one who  would look for its owner. And if somebody is killed, his closest relative has the right to  choose one of two things, i.e., either the Blood money or retaliation by having the killer  killed.&#8221; Then a man from Yemen, called Abu Shah, stood up and said, &#8220;Write that)  for me, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said (to his companions), &#8220;Write  that for Abu Shah.&#8221; Then another man from Quraish got up, saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! Except Al-Idhkhir (a special kind of grass) as we use it in our houses and for  graves.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Except Al-idhkkir.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>For the children of Israel the punishment for crime was  Al-Qisas only (i.e., the law of equality in punishment) and the payment of Blood money was  not permitted as an alternate. But Allah said to this nation (Muslims): &#8216;O you who  believe! Qisas is prescribed for you in case of murder, &#8230;..(up to) &#8230;end of the Verse.  (2.178) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Abbas added: Remission (forgiveness) in this Verse,  means to accept the Blood-money in an intentional murder. Ibn &#8216;Abbas added: The Verse:  &#8216;Then the relatives should demand Blood-money in a reasonable manner.&#8217; (2.178) means that  the demand should be reasonable and it is to be compensated with handsome gratitude. </font></p>

If fifty of them testified that a married man had committed illegal sexual intercourse in  Damascus but they had not seen him (doing so), would you stone him?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;If fifty of them testified that a man had committed theft in  Hums, would you cut off his hand though they did not see him?&#8221; He replied,  &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;By Allah, Allah&#8217;s Apostle never killed anyone except in one  of the following three situations: (1) A person who killed somebody unjustly, was killed  (in Qisas,) (2) a married person who committed illegal sexual intercourse and (3) a man  who fought against Allah and His Apostle and deserted Islam and became an apostate.&#8221;  Then the people said, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t Anas bin Malik narrate that Allah&#8217;s Apostle cut off the  hands of the thieves, branded their eyes and then, threw them in the sun?&#8221; I said,  &#8220;I shall tell you the narration of Anas. Anas said: &#8220;Eight persons from the  tribe of &#8216;Ukl came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and gave the Pledge of allegiance for Islam (became  Muslim). The climate of the place (Medina) did not suit them, so they became sick and  complained about that to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. He said (to them ), &#8220;Won&#8217;t you go out with  the shepherd of our camels and drink of the camels&#8217; milk and urine (as medicine)?&#8221;  They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; So they went out and drank the camels&#8217; milk and urine, and  after they became healthy, they killed the shepherd of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and took away all  the camels. This news reached Allah&#8217;s Apostle , so he sent (men) to follow their traces  and they were captured and brought (to the Prophet). He then ordered to cut their hands  and feet, and their eyes were branded with heated pieces of iron, and then he threw them  in the sun till they died.&#8221; I said, &#8220;What can be worse than what those people  did? They deserted Islam, committed murder and theft.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then &#8216;Anbasa bin Said said, &#8220;By Allah, I never heard a  narration like this of today.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O &#8216;Anbasa! You deny my narration?&#8221;  &#8216;Anbasa said, &#8220;No, but you have related the narration in the way it should be  related. By Allah, these people are in welfare as long as this Sheikh (Abu Qilaba) is  among them.&#8221; I added, &#8220;Indeed in this event there has been a tradition set by  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. The narrator added: Some Ansari people came to the Prophet and discussed  some matters with him, a man from amongst them went out and was murdered. Those people  went out after him, and behold, their companion was swimming in blood. They returned to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said to him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, we have found our companion who  had talked with us and gone out before us, swimming in blood (killed).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle went out and asked them, &#8220;Whom do you suspect or whom do you think has killed  him?&#8221; They said, &#8220;We think that the Jews have killed him.&#8221; The Prophet sent  for the Jews and asked them, &#8220;Did you kill this (person)?&#8221; They replied,  &#8220;No.&#8221; He asked the Al-Ansars, &#8220;Do you agree that I let fifty Jews take an  oath that they have not killed him?&#8221; They said, &#8220;It matters little for the Jews  to kill us all and then take false oaths.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then would you like to  receive the Diya after fifty of you have taken an oath (that the Jews have killed your  man)?&#8221; They said, &#8220;We will not take the oath.&#8221; Then the Prophet himself  paid them the Diya (Blood-money).&#8221; The narrator added, &#8220;The tribe of Hudhail  repudiated one of their men (for his evil conduct) in the Pre-lslamic period of Ignorance.  </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then, at a place called Al-Batha&#8217; (near Mecca), the man  attacked a Yemenite family at night to steal from them, but a. man from the family noticed  him and struck him with his sword and killed him. The tribe of Hudhail came and captured  the Yemenite and brought him to &#8216;Umar during the Hajj season and said, &#8220;He has killed  our companion.&#8221; The Yemenite said, &#8220;But these people had repudiated him (i.e.,  their companion).&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Let fifty persons of Hudhail swear that they had  not repudiated him.&#8221; So forty-nine of them took the oath and then a person belonging  to them, came from Sham and they requested him to swear similarly, but he paid  one-thousand Dirhams instead of taking the oath. They called another man instead of him  and the new man shook hands with the brother of the deceased. Some people said, &#8220;We  and those fifty men who had taken false oaths (Al-Qasama) set out, and when they reached a  place called Nakhlah, it started raining so they entered a cave in the mountain, and the  cave collapsed on those fifty men who took the false oath, and all of them died except the  two persons who had shaken hands with each other. They escaped death but a stone fell on  the leg of the brother of the deceased and broke it, whereupon he survived for one year  and then died.&#8221; I further said, &#8220;&#8216;Abdul Malik bin Marwan sentenced a man to  death in Qisas (equality in punishment) for murder, basing his judgment on Al-Qasama, but  later on he regretted that judgment and ordered that the names of the fifty persons who  had taken the oath (Al-Qasama), be erased from the register, and he exiled them in  Sham.&#8221; </font></p>

So when Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw him, he said (to him), &#8220;If  I had been sure that you were looking at me (through the door), I would have poked your  eye with this (sharp iron bar).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle added, &#8220;The asking for  permission to enter has been enjoined so that one may not look unlawfully (at what there  is in the house without the permission of its people).&#8221; </font></p>

While I was  passing by the Jews, I heard him saying, &#8216;By Him Who chose Moses above all the human  beings.&#8217; I said (protestingly), &#8216;Even above Muhammad?&#8217; So I became furious and slapped  him.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Do not give me preference to other prophets, for the  people will become unconscious on the Day of Resurrection and I will be the first to gain  conscious, and behold, I will Find Moses holding one of the pillars of the Throne (of  Allah). Then I will not know whether he has become conscious before me or he has been  exempted because of his unconsciousness at the mountain (during his worldly life) which he  received.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hands  my life is! Were it not for some men who dislike to be left behind and for whom I do not  have means of conveyance, I would not stay away (from any Holy Battle). I would love to be  martyred in Allah&#8217;s Cause and come to life and then get, martyred and then come to life  and then get martyred and then get resurrected and then get martyred. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 90, Number 333: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-A&#8217;rai: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Huraira said, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;By Him in  Whose Hand my life is, I would love to fight in Allah&#8217;s Cause and then get martyred and  then resurrected (come to life) and then get martyred and then resurrected (come to life)  and then get martyred, and then resurrected (come to life) and then get martyred and then  resurrected (come to life).&#8221; Abu Huraira used to repeat those words three times and I  testify to it with Allah&#8217;s Oath. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 90, Number 334: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;If I had gold equal to the mountain  of Uhud, I would love that, before three days had passed, not a single Dinar thereof  remained with me if I found somebody to accept it excluding some amount that I would keep  for the payment of my debts.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 90, Number 335: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If I had formerly known hat I  came to know lately, I would not have driven the Hadi with me and would have finished the  state of Ihram along with the people when they finished it </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.090.336"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 90, Number 336: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and we assumed  the state of Ihram of Hajj and arrived at Mecca on the fourth of Dhul-Hijja. The Prophet  ordered us to perform the Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba and (Sa&#8217;i) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa  and use our lhram just for &#8216;Umra, and finish the state of Ihram unless we had our Hadi  with us. None of us had the Hadi with him except the Prophet and Talha. 1AIj came from  Yemen and brought the Hadi with him. &#8216;Ali said, &#8216;I had assumed the state of Ihram with the  same intention as that with which Allah&#8217;s Apostle had assumed it. The people said,  &#8220;How can we proceed to Mina and our male organs are dribbling?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said, &#8220;If I had formerly known what I came to know latterly, I would not have brought  the Hadi, and had there been no Hadi with me, I would have finished my Ihram.&#8221; Suraqa  (bin Malik) met the Prophet while he was throwing pebbles at the Jamrat-al-&#8216;Aqaba, and  asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Is this (permitted) for us only?&#8221; The Prophet  replied. &#8220;No, it is forever&#8221; &#8216;Aisha had arrived at Mecca while she was  menstruating, therefore the Prophet ordered her to perform all the ceremonies of Hajj  except the Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba, and not to perform her prayers unless and until she  became clean . When they encamped at Al-Batha, &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You  are proceeding after performing both Hajj and &#8216;Umra while I am proceeding with Hajj  only?&#8221; So the Prophet ordered &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to go with her to  At-Tan&#8217;im, and so she performed the &#8216;Umra in Dhul-Hijja after the days of the Hajj. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 90, Number 337: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>One night the Prophet was unable to sleep and said,  &#8220;Would that a righteous man from my companions guarded me tonight.&#8221; Suddenly we  heard the clatter of arms, whereupon the Prophet said, &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; It was said,  &#8220;I am Sa&#8217;d, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have come to guard you.&#8221; The Prophet then slept  so soundly that we heard him snoring. Abu &#8216;Abdullah said: &#8216;Aisha said: Bilal said,  &#8220;Would that I but stayed overnight in a valley with Idhkhir and Jalil (two kinds of  grass) around me (i.e., in Mecca).&#8221; Then I told that to the Prophet . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 90, Number 338: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Not to wish to be the like  except of two men. A man whom Allah has given the (knowledge of the) Qur&#8217;an and he recites  it during the hours of night and day and the one who wishes says: If I were given the same  as this (man) has been given, I would do what he does, and a man whom Allah has given  wealth and he spends it in the just and right way, in which case the one who wishes says,  &#8216;If I were given the same as he has been given, I would do what he does.&#8217; &#8221; (See  Hadith No. 543 and 544, Vol 6) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 90, Number 339: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>If I had not heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;You should not  long for death,&#8221; I would have longed (for it). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 90, Number 340: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Qais: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We went to pay a visit to Khabbab bin Al-Art and he had got  himself branded at seven spots over his body. He said, &#8220;If Allah&#8217;s Apostle had not  forbidden us to invoke Allah for death, I would have invoked for it.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.090.341"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 90, Number 341: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sa&#8217;d bin Ubaid: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the Maula of &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Azhar) Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said, &#8220;None of you should long for death, for if he is a good man, he may increase  his good deeds, and if he is an evil-doer, he may stop the evil deeds and repent.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 90, Number 342: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet was carrying earth with us on the day of the  battle of Al-Ahzab (confederates) and I saw that the dust was covering the whiteness of  his abdomen, and he (the Prophet ) was saying, &#8220;(O Allah) ! Without You, we would not  have been guided, nor would we have given in charity, nor would we have prayed. So (O  Allah!) please send tranquility (Sakina) upon us as they, (the chiefs of the enemy tribes)  have rebelled against us. And if they intend affliction (i.e. want to frighten us and  fight against us) then we would not (flee but withstand them). And the Prophet used to  raise his voice with it. (See Hadith No. 430 and 432, Vol. 5) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 90, Number 343: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Abi Aufa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Do not long for meeting your  enemy, and ask Allah for safety (from all sorts of evil).&#8221; (See Hadith No. 266, Vol.  4) </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.090.344"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 90, Number 344: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Qasim bin Muhammad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Abbas mentioned the case of a couple on whom the  judgment of Lian has been passed. &#8216;Abdullah bin Shaddad said, &#8220;Was that the lady in  whose case the Prophet said, &#8220;If I were to stone a lady to death without a proof  (against her)?&#8217; &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;No! That was concerned with a woman who  though being a Muslim used to arouse suspicion by her outright misbehavior.&#8221; (See  Hadith No. 230, Vol.7) </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.090.345"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 90, Number 345: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ata: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>One night the Prophet delayed the Isha&#8217; prayer whereupon  &#8216;Umar went to him and said, &#8220;The prayer, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The women and children  had slept.&#8221; The Prophet came out with water dropping from his head, and said,  &#8220;Were I not afraid that it would be hard for my followers (or for the people), I  would order them to pray Isha prayer at this time.&#8221; (Various versions of this Hadith  are given by the narrators with slight differences in expression but not in content). </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.090.346"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 90, Number 346: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Were I not afraid that it would  be hard on my followers, I would order them to use the siwak (as obligatory, for cleaning  the teeth) </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.090.347"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 90, Number 347: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet fasted Al-Wisal on the last days of the month.  Some people did the same, and when the news reached the Prophet he said, &#8220;If the  month had been prolonged for me, then I would have fasted Wisal for such a long time that  the most exaggerating ones among you would have given up their exaggeration. I am not like  you; my Lord always makes me eat and drink.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.090.348"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 90, Number 348: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle forbade Al-Wisal. The people said (to him),  &#8220;But you fast Al-&#8216;Wisal,&#8221; He said, &#8220;Who among you is like me? When I sleep  (at night), my Lord makes me eat and drink. But when the people refused to give up  Al-Wisal, he fasted Al-Wisal along with them for two days and then they saw the crescent  whereupon the Prophet said, &#8220;If the crescent had not appeared I would have fasted for  a longer period,&#8221; as if he intended to punish them herewith. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 90, Number 349: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked the Prophet about the wall (outside the Ka&#8217;ba).  &#8220;Is it regarded as part of the Ka&#8217;ba?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; I said,  &#8220;Then why didn&#8217;t the people include it in the Ka&#8217;ba?&#8221; He said, &#8220;(Because)  your people ran short of money.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;Then why is its gate so high?&#8221;  He replied, &#8221;Your people did so in order to admit to it whom they would and forbid whom  they would. Were your people not still close to the period of ignorance, and were I not  afraid that their hearts might deny my action, then surely I would include the wall in the  Ka&#8217;ba and make its gate touch the ground.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I would not feel sorry for one who dies because of receiving a legal punishment, except the drunk, for if he should die (when being punished), I would give blood money to his family because no fixed punishment has been ordered by Allah&#8217;s Apostle for the drunk.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ubada bin As-Samit:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were with the Prophet in a gathering and he said, &#8216;Swear allegiance to me that you will not worship anything besides Allah, Will not steal, and will not commit illegal sexual intercourse.&#8221; And then (the Prophet) recited the whole Verse (i.e. 60:12). The Prophet added, &#8216;And whoever among you fulfills his pledge, his reward is with Allah; and whoever commits something of such sins and receives the legal punishment for it, that will be considered as the expiation for that sin, and whoever commits something of such sins and Allah screens him, it is up to Allah whether to excuse or punish him.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 81, Number 776:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah Apostle said in Hajjat-al-Wada, &#8220;Which month (of the year) do you think is most sacred?&#8221; The people said, &#8220;This current month of ours (the month of Dhull-Hijja).&#8221; He said, &#8220;Which town (country) do you think is the most sacred?&#8221; They said, &#8220;This city of ours (Mecca).&#8221; He said, &#8220;Which day do you think is the most sacred?&#8221; The people said, &#8220;This day of ours.&#8221; He then said, &#8220;Allah, the Blessed, the Supreme, has made your blood, your property and your honor as sacred as this day of yours in this town of yours, in this month of yours (and such protection cannot be slighted) except rightfully.&#8221; He then said thrice, &#8220;Have I conveyed Allah&#8217;s Message (to you)?&#8221; The people answered him each time saying, &#8216;Yes.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8216;May Allah be merciful to you (or, woe on you)!

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 81, Number 777:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever the Prophet was given an option between two things, he used to select the easier of the tow as long as it was not sinful; but if it was sinful, he would remain far from it. By Allah, he never took revenge for himself concerning any matter that was presented to him, but when Allah&#8217;s Limits were transgressed, he would take revenge for Allah&#8217;s Sake.</p>
<hr>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Usama approached the Prophet on behalf of a woman (who had committed theft). The Prophet said, &#8220;The people before you were destroyed because they used to inflict the legal punishments on the poor and forgive the rich. By Him in Whose Hand my soul is! If Fatima (the daughter of the Prophet ) did that (i.e. stole), I would cut off her hand.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 81, Number 779:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Quraish people became very worried about the Makhzumiya lady who had committed theft. They said, &#8220;Nobody can speak (in favor of the lady) to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and nobody dares do that except Usama who is the favorite of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. &#8221; When Usama spoke to Allah&#8217;s Apostle about that matter, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Do you intercede (with me) to violate one of the legal punishment of Allah?&#8221; Then he got up and addressed the people, saying, &#8220;O people! The nations before you went astray because if a noble person committed theft, they used to leave him, but if a weak person among them committed theft, they used to inflict the legal punishment on him. By Allah, if Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad committed theft, Muhammad will cut off her hand.!&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 81, Number 793:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ubada bin As-Samit:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I gave the pledge of allegiance to the Prophet with a group of people, and he said, &#8220;I take your pledge that you will not worship anything besides Allah, will not steal, will not commit infanticide, will not slander others by forging false statements and spreading it, and will not disobey me in anything good. And whoever among you fulfill all these (obligations of the pledge), his reward is with Allah. And whoever commits any of the above crimes and receives his legal punishment in this world, that will be his expiation and purification. But if Allah screens his sin, it will be up to Allah, Who will either punish or forgive him according to His wish.&#8221; Abu Abdullah said: &#8220;If a thief repents after his hand has been cut off, the his witness well be accepted. Similarly, if any person upon whom any legal punishment has been inflicted, repents, his witness will be accepted.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Rabi bin Hirash: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Uqba bin &#8216;Amr said to Hudhaifa, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you relate to  us of what you have heard from Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I heard him saying,  &#8220;When Al-Dajjal appears, he will have fire and water along with him. What the people  will consider as cold water, will be fire that will burn (things). So, if anyone of you  comes across this, he should fall in the thing which will appear to him as fire, for in  reality, it will be fresh cold water.&#8221; Hudhaifa added, &#8220;I also heard him saying,  &#8216;From among the people preceding your generation, there was a man whom the angel of death  visited to capture his soul. (So his soul was captured) and he was asked if he had done  any good deed.&#8217; He replied, &#8216;I don&#8217;t remember any good deed.&#8217; He was asked to think it  over. He said, &#8216;I do not remember, except that I used to trade with the people in the  world and I used to give a respite to the rich and forgive the poor (among my debtors). So  Allah made him enter Paradise.&#8221; Hudhaifa further said, &#8220;I also heard him saying,  &#8216;Once there was a man on his death-bed, who, losing every hope of surviving said to his  family: When I die, gather for me a large heap of wood and make a fire (to burn me). When  the fire eats my meat and reaches my bones, and when the bones burn, take and crush them  into powder and wait for a windy day to throw it (i.e. the powder) over the sea. They did  so, but Allah collected his particles and asked him: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Why did you do so? He replied: For fear of You. So Allah  forgave him.&#8221; &#8216;Uqba bin &#8216;Amr said, &#8220;I heard him saying that the Israeli used to  dig the grave of the dead (to steal their shrouds).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 660: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha and Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On his death-bed Allah&#8217;s Apostle put a sheet over his-face  and when he felt hot, he would remove it from his face. When in that state (of putting and  removing the sheet) he said, &#8220;May Allah&#8217;s Curse be on the Jews and the Christians for  they build places of worship at the graves of their prophets.&#8221; (By that) he intended  to warn (the Muslim) from what they (i.e. Jews and Christians) had done. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 661: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The Israelis used to be ruled and  guided by prophets: Whenever a prophet died, another would take over his place. There will  be no prophet after me, but there will be Caliphs who will increase in number.&#8221; The  people asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What do you order us (to do)?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Obey the one who will be given the pledge of allegiance first. Fulfil their (i.e.  the Caliphs) rights, for Allah will ask them about (any shortcoming) in ruling those Allah  has put under their guardianship.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 662: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;You will follow the wrong ways, of  your predecessors so completely and literally that if they should go into the hole of a  mastigure, you too will go there.&#8221; We said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do you mean the  Jews and the Christians?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Whom else?&#8221; (Meaning, of course, the  Jews and the Christians.) </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.056.663"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 663: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people mentioned the fire and the bell (as means  proposed for announcing the time of prayer) and by such a suggestion they referred to the  Jews and the Christians. But Bilal was ordered, &#8220;Pronounce the words of the Adhan  (i.e. call for the prayer) twice and the Iqama once only.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.056.664"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 664: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That she used to hate that one should keep his hands on his  flanks while praying. She said that the Jew used to do so. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.056.665"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 665: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Your period (i.e. the Muslims&#8217;  period) in comparison to the periods of the previous nations, is like the period between  the &#8216;Asr prayer and sunset. And your example in comparison to the Jews and the Christians  is like the example of a person who employed some laborers and asked them, &#8216;Who will work  for me till midday for one Qirat each?&#8217; The Jews worked for half a day for one Qirat each.  The person asked, &#8216;Who will do the work for me from midday to the time of the &#8216;Asr  (prayer) for one Qirat each?&#8217; The Christians worked from midday till the &#8216;Asr prayer for  one Qirat. Then the person asked, &#8216;Who will do the work for me from the &#8216;Asr till sunset  for two Qirats each?&#8217; &#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;It is you (i.e. Muslims) who are  doing the work from the Asr till sunset, so you will have a double reward. The Jews and  the Christians got angry and said, &#8216;We have done more work but got less wages.&#8217; Allah  said, &#8216;Have I been unjust to you as regards your rights?&#8217; They said, &#8216;No.&#8217; So Allah said,  &#8216;Then it is My Blessing which I bestow on whomever I like. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard &#8216;Umar saying, &#8220;May Allah Curse so-and-so!  Doesn&#8217;t he know that the Prophet said, &#8216;May Allah curse the Jews for, though they were  forbidden (to eat) fat, they liquefied it and sold it. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Convey (my teachings) to the people  even if it were a single sentence, and tell others the stories of Bani Israel (which have  been taught to you), for it is not sinful to do so. And whoever tells a lie on me  intentionally, will surely take his place in the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The Jews and the Christians do  not dye (their grey hair), so you shall do the opposite of what they do (i.e. dye your  grey hair and beards).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 669: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jundub: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Amongst the nations before you  there was a man who got a wound, and growing impatient (with its pain), he took a knife  and cut his hand with it and the blood did not stop till he died. Allah said, &#8216;My Slave  hurried to bring death upon himself so I have forbidden him (to enter) Paradise.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that he heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Allah willed to  test three Israelis who were a Leper, a blind man and a bald-headed man. So, he sent them  an angel who came to the leper and said, &#8216;What thing do you like most?&#8217; He replied,  &#8220;Good color and good skin, for the people have a strong aversion to me.&#8217; The angel  touched him and his illness was cured, and he was given a good color and beautiful skin.  The angel asked him, &#8216;What kind of property do you like best?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Camels (or  cows).&#8217; (The narrator is in doubt, for either the leper or the bald-headed man demanded  camels and the other demanded cows.) So he (i.e. the leper) was given a pregnant  she-camei, and the angel said (to him), &#8216;May Allah bless you in it.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The angel then went to the bald-headed man and said, &#8216;What  thing do you like most?&#8217; He said, &#8216;I like good hair and wish to be cured of this disease,  for the people feel repulsion for me.&#8217; The angel touched him and his illness was cured,  and he was given good hair. The angel asked (him), &#8216;What kind of property do you like  bests&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Cows,&#8217; The angel gave him a pregnant cow and said, &#8216;May Allah bless  you in it.&#8217; The angel went to the blind man and asked, &#8216;What thing do you like best?&#8217; He  said, &#8216;(I like) that Allah may restore my eye-sight to me so that I may see the people.&#8217;  The angel touched his eyes and Allah gave him back his eye-sight. The angel asked him,  &#8220;What kind of property do you like best?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Sheep.&#8217; The angel gave him a  pregnant sheep. Afterwards, all the three pregnant animals gave birth to young ones, and  multiplied and brought forth so much that one of the (three) men had a herd of camels  filling a valley, and one had a herd of cows filling a valley, and one had a flock of  sheep filling a valley. Then the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a leper,  went to the leper and said, I am a poor man, who has lost all means of livelihood while on  a journey. So none will satisfy my need except Allah and then you. In the Name of Him Who  has given you such nice color and beautiful skin, and so much property, I ask you to give  me a camel so that I may reach my destination. The man replied, &#8216;I have many obligations  (so I cannot give you).&#8217; The angel said, &#8216;I think I know you; were you not a leper to whom  the people had a strong aversion? Weren&#8217;t you a poor man, and then Allah gave you (all  this property).&#8217; He replied, &#8216;(This is all wrong), I got this property through inheritance  from my fore-fathers&#8217; The angel said, &#8216;If you are telling a lie, then let Allah make you  as you were before. &#8216; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a  bald man, went to the bald man and said to him the same as he told the first one, and he  too answered the same as the first one did. The angel said, &#8216;If you are telling a lie,  then let Allah make you as you were before.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The angel, disguised in the shape of a blind man, went to  the blind man and said, &#8216;I am a poor man and a traveler, whose means of livelihood have  been exhausted while on a journey. I have nobody to help me except Allah, and after Him,  you yourself. I ask you in the Name of Him Who has given you back your eye-sight to give  me a sheep, so that with its help, I may complete my journey&#8217; The man said, &#8216;No doubt, I  was blind and Allah gave me back my eye-sight; I was poor and Allah made me rich; so take  anything you wish from my property. By Allah, I will not stop you for taking anything (you  need) of my property which you may take for Allah&#8217;s sake.&#8217; The angel replied, &#8216;Keep your  property with you. You (i.e 3 men) have been tested and Allah is pleased with you and is  angry with your two companions.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 671: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Once three persons (from the  previous nations) were traveling, and suddenly it started raining and they took shelter in  a cave. The entrance of the cave got closed while they were inside. They said to each  other, &#8216;O you! Nothing can save you except the truth, so each of you should ask Allah&#8217;s  Help by referring to such a deed as he thinks he did sincerely (i.e. just for gaining  Allah&#8217;s Pleasure).&#8217; So one of them said, &#8216;O Allah! You know that I had a laborer who  worked for me for one Faraq (i.e. three Sas) of rice, but he departed, leaving it (i.e.  his wages). I sowed that Faraq of rice and with its yield I bought cows (for him). Later  on when he came to me asking for his wages, I said (to him), &#8216;Go to those cows and drive  them away.&#8217; He said to me, &#8216;But you have to pay me only a Faraq of rice,&#8217; I said to him,  &#8216;Go to those cows and take them, for they are the product of that Faraq (of rice).&#8217; So he  drove them. O Allah! If you consider that I did that for fear of You, then please remove  the rock.&#8217; The rock shifted a bit from the mouth of the cave. The second one said, &#8216;O  Allah, You know that I had old parents whom I used to provide with the milk of my sheep  every night. One night I was delayed and when I came, they had slept, while my wife and  children were crying with hunger. I used not to let them (i.e. my family) drink unless my  parents had drunk first. So I disliked to wake them up and also disliked that they should  sleep without drinking it, I kept on waiting (for them to wake) till it dawned. O Allah!  If You consider that I did that for fear of you, then please remove the rock.&#8217; So the rock  shifted and they could see the sky through it. The (third) one said, &#8216;O Allah! You know  that I had a cousin (i.e. my paternal uncle&#8217;s daughter) who was most beloved to me and I  sought to seduce her, but she refused, unless I paid her one-hundred Dinars (i.e. gold  pieces). So I collected the amount and brought it to her, and she allowed me to sleep with  her. But when I sat between her legs, she said, &#8216;Be afraid of Allah, and do not deflower  me but legally. &#8216;I got up and left the hundred Dinars (for her). O Allah! If You consider  that I did that for fear of you than please remove the rock. So Allah saved them and they  came out (of the cave).&#8221; (This Hadith indicates that one can only ask Allah for help  directly or through his performed good deeds. But to ask Allah through dead or absent  prophets, saints, spirits, holy men, angels etc. is absolutely forbidden in Islam and it  is a kind of disbelief.) </font></p>

(After a while) they passed by a lady who was  being pulled and teased (by the people). The child&#8217;s mother said, &#8216;O Allah! Do not make my  child like her.&#8217; The child said, &#8216;O Allah! Make me like her.&#8217; Then he said, &#8216;As for the  rider, he is an infidel, while the lady is accused of illegal sexual intercourse (falsely)  and she says: Allah is sufficient for me (He knows the truth).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Amongst the men of Bani Israel  there was a man who had murdered ninety-nine persons. Then he set out asking (whether his  repentance could be accepted or not). He came upon a monk and asked him if his repentance  could be accepted. The monk replied in the negative and so the man killed him. He kept on  asking till a man advised to go to such and such village. (So he left for it) but death  overtook him on the way. While dying, he turned his chest towards that village (where he  had hoped his repentance would be accepted), and so the angels of mercy and the angels of  punishment quarrelled amongst themselves regarding him. Allah ordered the village (towards  which he was going) to come closer to him, and ordered the village (whence he had come),  to go far away, and then He ordered the angels to measure the distances between his body  and the two villages. So he was found to be one span closer to the village (he was going  to). So he was forgiven.&#8221; </font></p>

A cow speaks!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I believe this, and Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar  too, believe it, although neither of them was present there. While a person was amongst  his sheep, a wolf attacked and took one of the sheep. The man chased the wolf till he  saved it from the wolf, where upon the wolf said, &#8216;You have saved it from me; but who will  guard it on the day of the wild beasts when there will be no shepherd to guard them except  me (because of riots and afflictions)? &#8216; &#8221; The people said surprisingly,  &#8220;Glorified be Allah!

By Allah, if Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad stole, I  would cut off her hand.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Muawiya bin Abu Sufyan came to Medina for the last  time, he delivered a sermon before us. He took out a tuft of hair and said, &#8220;I never  thought that someone other than the Jews would do such a thing (i.e. use false hair). The  Prophet named such a practice, &#8216;Az-Zur&#8217; (i.e. falsehood),&#8221; meaning the use of false  hair. </font></p>

You see that the best amongst the people in  this respect (i.e. ambition of ruling) are those who hate it most.

Those men are the ignorant amongst you. Beware of such hopes as make the people  go astray, for I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;Authority of ruling will remain with  Quraish, and whoever bears hostility to them, Allah will destroy him as long as they abide  by the laws of the religion.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

(&#8216;Abdullah) bin AzZubair said, &#8221; &#8216;Aisha should be stopped from doing  so.&#8221; (When &#8216;Aisha heard this), she said protestingly, &#8220;Shall I be stopped from  doing so? I vow that I will never talk to &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair.&#8221; On that, Ibn  Az-Zubair asked some people from Quraish and particularly the two uncles of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle to intercede with her, but she refused (to talk to him). Az-Zuhriyun, the uncles  of the Prophet, including &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad bin &#8216;Abd Yaghuth and Al-Miswar bin  Makhrama said to him, &#8220;When we ask for the permission to visit her, enter her house  along with us (without taking her leave).&#8221; He did accordingly (and she accepted their  intercession). He sent her ten slaves whom she manumitted as an expiation for (not  keeping) her vow. &#8216;Aisha manumitted more slaves for the same purpose till she manumitted  forty slaves. She said, &#8220;I wish I had specified what I would have done in case of not  fulfilling my vow when I made the vow, so that I might have done it easily.&#8221; </font></p>

So, a portion of the night had passed when &#8216;Ali saw him and realized  that he was a stranger. Abu Dhar followed him (to his house), but neither of them asked  the other about anything till it was morning, when he carried his water-skin and food and  went to the Mosque. He spent that day without being observed by the Prophet till it was  night, when he returned to his sleeping place. &#8216;Ali again passed by him and said,  &#8220;Hasn&#8217;t the man (i.e. Abu Dhar) recognized his dwelling place yet?&#8221; So, &#8216;Ali let  him get up and took him (to his house), but neither of them asked the other about  anything, till it was the third day when &#8216;Ali had the same experience with him and Abu  Dhar again stayed with him. &#8216;Ali then asked, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you tell me what has brought you  here?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;If you give me a promise and a convention that you will  guide me, then I will tell you.&#8221; When &#8216;Ali did, Abu Dhar informed him (of his  purpose). &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;It is the Truth, and he (i.e. Muhammad) is the Apostle of  Allah. So when the morning comes, follow me, and if I should perceive any danger  threatening you, I will give you a hint by pretending to go to the watercloset. But if I  carried on walking, follow me till you enter the place that I will enter.&#8221; Abu Dhur  agreed and followed &#8216;Ali till he entered the place of the Prophet and Abu Dhur entered  with him. He then listened to the speech of the Prophet and embraced Islam on that very  spot. The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Go back to your people and inform them (of this  religion) till you receive my (further) orders.&#8221; Abu Dhur said, &#8220;By Him in Whose  Hands my life is! I will proclaim my conversion to Islam publicly amongst them (i.e.  infidels).&#8221; He went out till he reached the Mosque and announced as loudly as  possible, &#8220;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that  Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah.&#8221; The people then got up and beat him till they  knocked him down. Al-Abbas came and threw himself over him (to protect him) saying, Woe to  you! Don&#8217;t you know that he is from Ghifar and there is the route (road) to your merchants  towards Sham (i.e. through the place where this tribe dwells)?&#8221; Thus he saved him  from them. Abu Dhar did the same on the next day and the people beat him again and  Al-&#8216;Abbas drew himself over him (to save him as before). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Jamra: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Abbas said to us, &#8220;Shall I tell you the story of  Abu Dhar&#8217;s conversion to Islam?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Abu Dhar  said: I was a man from the tribe of Ghifar. We heard that a man had appeared in Mecca,  claiming to be a Prophet. ! said to my brother, &#8216;Go to that man and talk to him and bring  me his news.&#8217; He set out, met him and returned. I asked him, &#8216;What is the news with you?&#8217;  He said, &#8216;By Allah, I saw a man enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil.&#8217; I  said to him, &#8216;You have not satisfied me with this little information.&#8217; So, I took a  waterskin and a stick and proceeded towards Mecca. Neither did I know him (i.e. the  Prophet ), nor did I like to ask anyone about him. I Kept on drinking Zam zam water and  staying in the Mosque. Then &#8216;Ali passed by me and said, &#8216;It seems you are a stranger?&#8217; I  said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He proceeded to his house and I accompanied him. Neither did he ask me  anything, nor did I tell him anything. Next morning I went to the Mosque to ask about the  Prophet but no-one told me anything about him. Ali passed by me again and asked, &#8216;Hasn&#8217;t  the man recognized his dwelling place yet&#8217; I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Come along with me.&#8217; He  asked me, &#8216;What is your business? What has brought you to this town?&#8217; I said to him, &#8216;If  you keep my secret, I will tell you.&#8217; He said, &#8216;I will do,&#8217; I said to him, &#8216;We have heard  that a person has appeared here, claiming to be a Prophet. I sent my brother to speak to  him and when he returned, he did not bring a satisfactory report; so I thought of meeting  him personally.&#8217; &#8216;Ali said (to Abu Dhar), &#8216;You have reached your goal; I am going to him  just now, so follow me, and wherever I enter, enter after me. If I should see someone who  may cause you trouble, I will stand near a wall pretending to mend my shoes (as a  warning), and you should go away then.&#8217; &#8216;Ali proceeded and I accompanied him till he  entered a place, and I entered with him to the Prophet to whom I said, &#8216;Present (the  principles of) Islam to me.&#8217; When he did, I embraced Islam &#8216;immediately. He said to me, &#8216;O  Abu Dhar! Keep your conversion as a secret and return to your town; and when you hear of  our victory, return to us. &#8216; I said, &#8216;By H him Who has sent you with the Truth, I will  announce my conversion to Islam publicly amongst them (i.e. the infidels),&#8217; Abu Dhar went  to the Mosque, where some people from Quraish were present, and said, &#8216;O folk of Quraish !  I testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and I (also) testify that  Muhammad is Allah&#8217;s Slave and His Apostle.&#8217; (Hearing that) the Quraishi men said, &#8216;Get at  this Sabi (i.e. Muslim) !&#8217; They got up and beat me nearly to death. Al &#8216;Abbas saw me and  threw himself over me to protect me. He then faced them and said, &#8216;Woe to you! You want to  kill a man from the tribe of Ghifar, although your trade and your communications are  through the territory of Ghifar?&#8217; They therefore left me. The next morning I returned (to  the Mosque) and said the same as I have said on the previous day. They again said, &#8216;Get at  this Sabi!&#8217; I was treated in the same way as on the previous day, and again Al-Abbas found  me and threw himself over me to protect me and told them the same as he had said the day  before.&#8217; So, that was the conversion of Abu Dhar (may Allah be Merciful to him) to  Islam.&#8221; </font></p>

He used to offer four Rakat, let  alone their beauty and length, and then four Rakat, let alone their beauty and length.  Afterwards he would offer three Rakat.

The first (of the three angels) said, &#8220;Which of them is he?&#8221;  The second said, &#8220;He is the best of them.&#8221; That was all that happened then, and  he did not see them till they came at another night and he perceived their presence with  his heart, for the eyes of the Prophet were closed when he was asleep, but his heart was  not asleep (not unconscious). This is characteristic of all the prophets: Their eyes sleep  but their hearts do not sleep. Then Gabriel took charge of the Prophet and ascended along  with him to the Heaven. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That they were with the Prophet on a journey. They  travelled the whole night, and when dawn approached, they took a rest and sleep  overwhelmed them till the sun rose high in the sky. The first to get up was Abu Bakr.  Allah&#8217;s Apostles used not to be awakened from his sleep, but he would wake up by himself.  &#8216;Umar woke up and then Abu Bakr sat by the side of the Prophet&#8217;s head and started saying:  Allahu-Akbar raising his voice till the Prophet woke up, (and after traveling for a while)  he dismounted and led us in the morning prayer. A man amongst the people failed to join us  in the prayer. When the Prophet had finished the prayer, he asked (the man), &#8220;O  so-and-so! What prevented you from offering the prayer with us?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I  am Junub,&#8221; Alllah&#8217;s Apostle ordered him to perform Tayammam with clean earth. The man  then offered the prayer. Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered me and a few others to go ahead of him.  We had become very thirsty. While we were on our way (looking for water), we came across a  lady (riding an animal), hanging her legs between two water-skins. We asked her,  &#8220;Where can we get water?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;Oh ! There is no water.&#8221; We  asked, &#8220;how far is your house from the water?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;A distance of  a day and a night travel.&#8221; We said, &#8220;Come on to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8220;She  asked, &#8220;What is Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; So we brought her to Allah&#8217;s Apostle against  her will, and she told him what she had told us before and added that she was the mother  of orphans. So the Prophet ordered that her two water-skins be brought and he rubbed the  mouths of the water-skins. As we were thirsty, we drank till we quenched our thirst and we  were forty men. We also filled all our waterskins and other utensils with water, but we  did not water the camels. The waterskin was so full that it was almost about to burst. The  Prophet then said, &#8220;Bring what (foodstuff) you have.&#8221; So some dates and pieces  of bread were collected for the lady, and when she went to her people, she said, &#8220;I  have met either the greatest magician or a prophet as the people claim.&#8221; So Allah  guided the people of that village through that lady. She embraced Islam and they all  embraced Islam. </font></p>

He asked, &#8216;What is wrong with you?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;We have no water either for performing  ablution or for drinking except what is present in front of you.&#8217; So he placed his hand in  that pot and the water started flowing among his fingers like springs. We all drank and  performed ablution (from it).&#8221; I asked Jabir, &#8220;How many were you?&#8221; he  replied, &#8220;Even if we had been one-hundred-thousand, it would have been sufficient for  us, but we were fifteen-hundred.&#8221; </font></p>

Have you  got any food?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; She brought out some loaves of barley and  took out a veil belonging to her, and wrapped the bread in part of it and put it under my  arm and wrapped part of the veil round me and sent me to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. I went carrying  it and found Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the Mosque sitting with some people. When I stood there,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8220;Has Abu Talha sent you?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes&#8221;. He  asked, &#8220;With some food? I said, &#8220;Yes&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said to the men  around him, &#8220;Get up!&#8221; He set out (accompanied by them) and I went ahead of them  till I reached Abu Talha and told him (of the Prophet&#8217;s visit). Abu Talha said, &#8220;O Um  Sulaim! Allah&#8217;s Apostle is coming with the people and we have no food to feed them.&#8221;  She said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; So Abu Talha went out to receive  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Allah&#8217;s Apostle came along with Abu Talha. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O  Um Sulaim! Bring whatever you have.&#8221; She brought the bread which Allah&#8217;s Apostle  ordered to be broken into pieces. Um Sulaim poured on them some butter from an oilskin.  Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle recited what Allah wished him to recite, and then said, &#8220;Let ten  persons come (to share the meal).&#8221; Ten persons were admitted, ate their fill and went  out. Then he again said, &#8220;Let another ten do the same.&#8221; They were admitted, ate  their fill and went out.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The companions of Suffa were poor people. The Prophet once  said, &#8220;Whoever has food enough for two persons, should take a third one (from among  them), and whoever has food enough for four persons, should take a fifth or a sixth (or  said something similar).&#8221; Abu Bakr brought three persons while the Prophet took ten.  And Abu Bakr with his three family member (who were I, my father and my mother) (the  sub-narrator is in doubt whether &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;My wife and my servant who was  common for both my house and Abu Bakr&#8217;s house.&#8221;) Abu Bakr took his supper with the  Prophet and stayed there till he offered the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayers. He returned and stayed till  Allah&#8217;s Apostle took his supper. After a part of the night had passed, he returned to his  house. His wife said to him, &#8220;What has detained you from your guests?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Have you served supper to them?&#8221; She said, &#8220;They refused to take supper)  until you come. They (i.e. some members of the household) presented the meal to them but  they refused (to eat)&#8221; I went to hide myself and he said, &#8220;O Ghunthar!&#8221; He  invoked Allah to cause my ears to be cut and he rebuked me. He then said (to them): Please  eat!&#8221; and added, I will never eat the meal.&#8221; By Allah, whenever we took a  handful of the meal, the meal grew from underneath more than that handful till everybody  ate to his satisfaction; yet the remaining food was more than the original meal. Abu Bakr  saw that the food was as much or more than the original amount. He called his wife,  &#8220;O sister of Bani Firas!&#8221; She said, &#8220;O pleasure of my eyes. The food has  been tripled in quantity.&#8221; Abu Bakr then started eating thereof and said, &#8220;It  (i.e. my oath not to eat) was because of Sa all.&#8221; He took a handful from it, and  carried the rest to the Prophet. SO that food was with the Prophet . There was a treaty  between us and some people, and when the period of that treaty had elapsed, he divided US  into twelve groups, each being headed by a man. Allah knows how many men were under the  command of each leader. Anyhow, the Prophet surely sent a leader with each group. Then all  of them ate of that meal. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, the people of  Medina suffered from drought. So while the Prophet was delivering a sermon on a Friday a  man got up saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The horses and sheep have perished. Will you  invoke Allah to bless us with rain?&#8221; The Prophet lifted both his hands and invoked.  The sky at that time was as clear as glass. Suddenly a wind blew, raising clouds that  gathered together, and it started raining heavily. We came out (of the Mosque) wading  through the flowing water till we reached our homes. It went on raining till the next  Friday, when the same man or some other man stood up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  The houses have collapsed; please invoke Allah to withhold the rain.&#8221; On that the  Prophet smiled and said, &#8220;O Allah, (let it rain) around us and not on us.&#8221; I  then looked at the clouds to see them separating forming a sort of a crown round Medina. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet used to stand by a tree or a date-palm on  Friday. Then an Ansari woman or man said. &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we make a pulpit  for you?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;If you wish.&#8221; So they made a pulpit for him and when  it was Friday, he proceeded towards the pulpit (for delivering the sermon). The date-palm  cried like a child! The Prophet descended (the pulpit) and embraced it while it continued  moaning like a child being quietened. The Prophet said, &#8220;It was crying for (missing)  what it used to hear of religious knowledge given near to it.&#8221; </font></p>

You need not fear those (afflictions) as there is a closed door  between you and them.&#8221; &#8216;Umar asked, &#8220;Will that door be opened or broken?&#8221;  Hudhaifa replied, &#8220;No, it will be broken.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Then it is very  likely that the door will not be closed again.&#8221; Later on the people asked Hudhaifa,  &#8220;Did &#8216;Umar know what that door meant?&#8221; He said. &#8220;Yes, &#8216;Umar knew it as  everyone knows that there will be night before the tomorrow morning. I narrated to &#8216;Umar  an authentic narration, not lies.&#8221; We dared not ask Hudhaifa; therefore we requested  Masruq who asked him, &#8220;What does the door stand for?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Umar.&#8221;  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Adi bin Hatim: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was in the city of the Prophet, a man came and  complained to him (the Prophet, ) of destitution and poverty. Then another man came and  complained of robbery (by highwaymen). The Prophet said, &#8220;Adi! Have you been to  Al-Hira?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t been to it, but I was informed about it.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;If you should live for a long time, you will certainly see that a lady in a  Howdah traveling from Al-Hira will (safely reach Mecca and) perform the Tawaf of the  Ka&#8217;ba, fearing none but Allah.&#8221; I said to myself, &#8220;What will happen to the  robbers of the tribe of Tai who have spread evil through out the country?&#8221; The  Prophet further said. &#8220;If you should live long, the treasures of Khosrau will be  opened (and taken as spoils).&#8221; I asked, &#8220;You mean Khosrau, son of Hurmuz?&#8221;  He said, &#8220;Khosrau, son of Hurmuz; and if you should live long, you will see that one  will carry a handful of gold or silver and go out looking for a person to accept it from  him, but will find none to accept it from him. And any of you, when meeting Allah, will  meet Him without needing an interpreter between him and Allah to interpret for him, and  Allah will say to him: &#8216;Didn&#8217;t I send a messenger to teach you?&#8217; He will say: &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Allah  will say: &#8216;Didn&#8217;t I give you wealth and do you favors?&#8217; He will say: &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Then he will  look to his right and see nothing but Hell, and look to his left and see nothing but  Hell.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Adi further said: I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;Save  yourself from the (Hell) Fire even with half a date (to be given in charity) and if you do  not find a half date, then with a good pleasant word.&#8221; &#8216;Adi added: (later on) I saw a  lady in a Howdah traveling from Al-Hira till she performed the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, fearing  none but Allah. And I was one of those who opened (conquered) the treasures of Khosrau,  son of Hurmuz. If you should live long, you will see what the Prophet Abu-l-Qasim had  said: &#8216;A person will come out with a handful. of gold&#8230;etc. </font></p>

You will see their actions and disapprove of them.&#8221; I said,  &#8220;Will there by any evil after that good?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, there will be some  people who will invite others to the doors of Hell, and whoever accepts their invitation  to it will be thrown in it (by them).&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were with Allah&#8217;s Apostle who was distributing  (i.e. some property), there came Dhu-l-Khuwaisira, a man from the tribe of Bani Tamim and  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do Justice.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Woe to you! Who  could do justice if I did not? I would be a desperate loser if I did not do justice.&#8221;  &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allow me to chop his head off.&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;Leave him, for he has companions who pray and fast in such a way that you will  consider your fasting negligible in comparison to theirs. They recite Qur&#8217;an but it does  not go beyond their throats (i.e. they do not act on it) and they will desert Islam as an  arrow goes through a victim&#8217;s body, so that the hunter, on looking at the arrow&#8217;s blade,  would see nothing on it; he would look at its Risaf and see nothing: he would look at its  Na,di and see nothing, and he would look at its Qudhadh ( 1 ) and see nothing (neither  meat nor blood), for the arrow has been too fast even for the blood and excretions to  smear. The sign by which they will be recognized is that among them there will be a black  man, one of whose arms will resemble a woman&#8217;s breast or a lump of meat moving loosely.  Those people will appear when there will be differences amongst the people.&#8221; I  testify that I heard this narration from Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I testify that &#8216;Ali bin Abi  Talib fought with such people, and I was in his company. He ordered that the man  (described by the Prophet ) should be looked for. The man was brought and I looked at him  and noticed that he looked exactly as the Prophet had described him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I relate the traditions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle to you for I  would rather fall from the sky than attribute something to him falsely. But when I tell  you a thing which is between you and me, then no doubt, war is guile. I heard Allah&#8217;s  Apostle saying, &#8220;In the last days of this world there will appear some young foolish  people who will use (in their claim) the best speech of all people (i.e. the Qur&#8217;an) and  they will abandon Islam as an arrow going through the game. Their belief will not go  beyond their throats (i.e. they will have practically no belief), so wherever you meet  them, kill them, for he who kills them shall get a reward on the Day of  Resurrection.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We complained to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (of the persecution  inflicted on us by the infidels) while he was sitting in the shade of the Ka&#8217;ba, leaning  over his Burd (i.e. covering sheet). We said to him, &#8220;Would you seek help for us?  Would you pray to Allah for us?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Among the nations before you a  (believing) man would be put in a ditch that was dug for him, and a saw would be put over  his head and he would be cut into two pieces; yet that (torture) would not make him give  up his religion. His body would be combed with iron combs that would remove his flesh from  the bones and nerves, yet that would not make him abandon his religion. By Allah, this  religion (i.e. Islam) will prevail till a traveler from Sana (in Yemen) to Hadrarmaut will  fear none but Allah, or a wolf as regards his sheep, but you (people) are hasty. </font></p>

He asked Thabit, &#8220;What&#8217;s the  matter?&#8221; Thabit replied, &#8220;An evil situation: A man used to raise his voice over  the voice of the Prophet and so all his good deeds have been annulled and he is from the  people of Hell.&#8221; The man went back and told the Prophet that Thabit had said  so-and-so. (The sub-narrator, Musa bin Anas said, &#8220;The man went to Thabit again with  glad tidings).&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Go and say to Thabit: &#8216;You are not  from the people of Fire, but from the people of Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Bakr came to my father who was at home and purchased a  saddle from him. He said to &#8216;Azib. &#8220;Tell your son to carry it with me.&#8221; So I  carried it with him and my father followed us so as to take the price (of the saddle). My  father said, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! Tell me what happened to you on your night journey with  Allah&#8217;s Apostle (during Migration).&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, we travelled the whole night  and also the next day till midday. when nobody could be seen on the way ( because of the  severe heat) . Then there appeared a long rock having shade beneath it, and the sunshine  had not come to it yet. So we dismounted there and I levelled a place and covered it with  an animal hide or dry grass for the Prophet to sleep on (for a while). I then said,  &#8216;Sleep, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and I will guard you.&#8217; So he slept and I went out to guard him.  Suddenly I saw a shepherd coming with his sheep to that rock with the same intention we  had when we came to it. I asked (him). &#8216;To whom do you belong, O boy?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;I  belong to a man from Medina or Mecca.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Do your sheep have milk?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217;  I said, &#8216;Will you milk for us?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He caught hold of a sheep and I asked him  to clean its teat from dust, hairs and dirt. (The sub-narrator said that he saw Al-Bara&#8217;  striking one of his hands with the other, demonstrating how the shepherd removed the  dust.) The shepherd milked a little milk in a wooden container and I had a leather  container which I carried for the Prophet to drink and perform the ablution from. I went  to the Prophet, hating to wake him up, but when I reached there, the Prophet had already  awakened; so I poured water over the middle part of the milk container, till the milk was  cold. Then I said, &#8216;Drink, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8217; He drank till I was pleased. Then he asked,  &#8216;Has the time for our departure come?&#8217; I said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; So we departed after midday. Suraqa  bin Malik followed us and I said, &#8216;We have been discovered, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8217; He said,  Don&#8217;t grieve for Allah is with us.&#8217; The Prophet invoked evil on him (i.e. Suraqa) and so  the legs of his horse sank into the earth up to its belly. (The subnarrator, Zuhair is not  sure whether Abu Bakr said, &#8220;(It sank) into solid earth.&#8221;) Suraqa said, &#8216;I see  that you have invoked evil on me. Please invoke good on me, and by Allah, I will cause  those who are seeking after you to return.&#8217; The Prophet invoked good on him and he was  saved. Then, whenever he met somebody on the way, he would say, &#8216;I have looked for him  here in vain.&#8217; So he caused whomever he met to return. Thus Suraqa fulfilled his  promise.&#8221; </font></p>

No, for  it is a fever which boils in (the body of) an old man, and will lead him to the  grave.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, then may it be as you say.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>There was a Christian who embraced Islam and read  Surat-al-Baqara and Al-Imran, and he used to write (the revelations) for the Prophet.  Later on he returned to Christianity again and he used to say: &#8220;Muhammad knows  nothing but what I have written for him.&#8221; Then Allah caused him to die, and the  people buried him, but in the morning they saw that the earth had thrown his body out.  They said, &#8220;This is the act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our  companion and took his body out of it because he had run away from them.&#8221; They again  dug the grave deeply for him, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown  his body out. They said, &#8220;This is an act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the  grave of our companion and threw his body outside it, for he had run away from them.&#8221;  They dug the grave for him as deep as they could, but in the morning they again saw that  the earth had thrown his body out. So they believed that what had befallen him was not  done by human beings and had to leave him thrown (on the ground). </font></p>

He stood before Musailama (and his companions) and said, &#8220;If you asked me even this  piece (of a leaf), I would not give it to you. You cannot avoid the fate you are destined  to, by Allah. If you reject Islam, Allah will destroy you. I think that you are most  probably the same person whom I have seen in the dream.&#8221; Abu Huraira told me that  Allah&#8217;s Apostle; said, &#8220;While I was sleeping, I saw (in a dream) two gold bracelets  round my arm, and that worried me too much. Then I was instructed divinely in my dream, to  blow them off and so I blew them off, and they flew away. I interpreted the two bracelets  as symbols of two liars who would appear after me. And so one of them was Al-Ansi and the  other was Musailama Al-Kadhdhab from Al-Yamama.&#8221; </font></p>

I thought that it was Al-Yamama or  Hajar, but it came to be Medina i.e. Yathrib. In the same dream I saw myself moving a  sword and its blade got broken. It came to symbolize the defeat which the Muslims suffered  from, on the Day of Uhud. I moved the sword again, and it became normal as before, and  that was the symbol of the victory Allah bestowed upon Muslims and their gathering  together. I saw cows in my dream, and by Allah, that was a blessing, and they symbolized  the believers on the Day of Uhud. And the blessing was the good Allah bestowed upon us and  the reward of true belief which Allah gave us after the day of Badr. </font></p>

Umaiya  said to Sad, &#8220;Will you wait till midday when the people are (at their homes), then  you may go and perform the Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba?&#8221; So, while Sad was going around the  Ka&#8217;ba, Abu Jahl came and asked, &#8220;Who is that who is performing Tawaf?&#8221; Sad  replied, &#8220;I am Sad.&#8221; Abu Jahl said, &#8220;Are you circumambulating the Ka&#8217;ba  safely although you have given refuge to Muhammad and his companions?&#8221; Sad said,  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and they started quarreling. Umaiya said to Sad, &#8220;Don&#8217;t shout at  Abi-l-Hakam (i.e. Abu Jahl), for he is chief of the valley (of Mecca).&#8221; Sad then said  (to Abu Jahl). &#8216;By Allah, if you prevent me from performing the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, I will  spoil your trade with Sham.&#8221; Umaiya kept on saying to Sad, &#8220;Don&#8217;t raise your  voice.&#8221; and kept on taking hold of him. Sad became furious and said, (to Umaiya),  &#8220;Be away from me, for I have heard Muhammad saying that he will kill you.&#8221;  Umaiiya said, &#8220;Will he kill me?&#8221; Sad said, &#8220;Yes,.&#8221; Umaiya said,  &#8220;By Allah!

They said, &#8220;Muhammad has told the truth; the Torah has the Verse of Rajm. The  Prophet then gave the order that both of them should be stoned to death. (&#8216;Abdullah bin  &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I saw the man leaning over the woman to shelter her from the  stones.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 839: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;A horse may be kept for one of  three purposes: for a man it may be a source of reward; for another it may be a means of  living; and for a third it may be a burden (a source of committing sins). As for the one  for whom it is a source of reward, he is the one who keeps his horse for the sake of Jihad  in Allah&#8217;s Cause; he ties it with a long rope on a pasture or in a garden. So whatever its  rope allows it to eat, will be regarded as good rewardable deeds (for its owner). And if  it breaks off its rope and jumps over one or two hillocks, even its dung will be  considered amongst his good deeds. And if it passes by a river and drinks water from it,  that will be considered as good deeds for his benefit) even if he has had no intention of  watering it. A horse is a shelter for the one who keeps it so that he may earn his living  honestly and takes it as a refuge to keep him from following illegal ways (of gaining  money), and does not forget the rights of Allah (i.e. paying the Zakat and allowing others  to use it for Allah&#8217;s Sake). But a horse is a burden (and a source of committing sins for  him who keeps it out of pride and pretense and with the intention of harming the  Muslims.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet was asked about donkeys. He replied,  &#8220;Nothing has been revealed to be concerning them except this comprehensive Verse  (which covers everything) :&#8211;&#8216;Then whosoever has done good equal to the weight of an atom  (or a small ant), Shall see it (its reward) And whosoever has done evil equal to the  weight of an atom (or a small ) ant), Shall see it (Its punishment).&#8221; (99.7-8) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle reached Khaibar in the early morning and  the people of Khaibar came out with their spades, and when they saw the Prophet they said,  &#8220;Muhammad and his army!&#8221; and returned hurriedly to take refuge in the fort. The  Prophet raised his hands and said, &#8220;Allah is Greater! Khaibar is ruined ! If we  approach a nation, then miserable is the morning of those who are warned.&#8221; </font></p>

I hear many narrations  from you but I forget them.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Spread your covering sheet.&#8221; I  spread my sheet and he moved both his hands as if scooping something and emptied them in  the sheet and said, &#8220;Wrap it.&#8221; I wrapped it round my body, and since then I have  never forgotten a single Hadith. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A group of three men came to the houses of the wives of the  Prophet asking how the Prophet worshipped (Allah), and when they were informed about that,  they considered their worship insufficient and said, &#8220;Where are we from the Prophet  as his past and future sins have been forgiven.&#8221; Then one of them said, &#8220;I will  offer the prayer throughout the night forever.&#8221; The other said, &#8220;I will fast  throughout the year and will not break my fast.&#8221; The third said, &#8220;I will keep  away from the women and will not marry forever.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to them and  said, &#8220;Are you the same people who said so-and-so? By Allah, I am more submissive to  Allah and more afraid of Him than you; yet I fast and break my fast, I do sleep and I also  marry women.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that he asked &#8216;Aisha about the Statement of Allah: &#8216;If you  fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry (other)  women of your choice, two or three or four; but if you fear that you shall not be able to  deal justly (with them), then only one, or (the captives) that your right hands possess.  That will be nearer to prevent you from doing injustice.&#8217; (4.3) &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;O my  nephew! (This Verse has been revealed in connection with) an orphan girl under the  guardianship of her guardian who is attracted by her wealth and beauty and intends to  marry her with a Mahr less than what other women of her standard deserve. So they (such  guardians) have been forbidden to marry them unless they do justice to them and give them  their full Mahr, and they are ordered to marry other women instead of them.&#8221; </font></p>

I have something to say to you.&#8221; So both of them  went aside and &#8216;Uthman said, &#8220;O Abu &#8216;Abdur-Rah. man! Shall we marry you to a virgin  who will make you remember your past days?&#8221; When &#8216;Abdullah felt that he was not in  need of that, he beckoned me (to join him) saying, &#8220;O &#8216;Alqama!&#8221; Then I heard him  saying (in reply to &#8216;Uthman), &#8220;As you have said that, (I tell you that) the Prophet  once said to us, &#8216;O young people! Whoever among you is able to marry, should marry, and  whoever is not able to marry, is recommended to fast, as fasting diminishes his sexual  power. </font></p>

This Verse refers to the orphan girl who is under the guardianship of her guardian who  likes her beauty and wealth and wishes to (marry her and) curtails her Mahr. Such  guardians have been forbidden to marry them unless they do justice by giving them their  full Mahr, and they have been ordered to marry other than them. The people asked for the  verdict of Allah&#8217;s Apostle after that, so Allah revealed: &#8216;They ask your instruction  concerning the women . . . whom you desire to marry.&#8217; (4.127) So Allah revealed to them  that if the orphan girl had beauty and wealth, they desired to marry her and for her  family status. They can only marry them if they give them their full Mahr. And if they had  no desire to marry them because of their lack of wealth and beauty, they would leave them  and marry other women. So, as they used to leave them, when they had no interest, in them,  they were forbidden to marry them when they had such interest, unless they treated them  justly and gave them their full Mahr Apostle said, &#8216;If at all there is evil omen, it is in  the horse, the woman and the house.&#8221; a lady is to be warded off.

Such  a man should marry women of his liking other than her, two or three or four. &#8216;Prohibited  to you (for marriage) are: &#8230;your foster-mothers (who suckled you).&#8217; (4.23) Marriage is  prohibited between persons having a foster suckling relationship corresponding to a blood  relationship which renders marriage unlawful. </font></p>

I became more angry with him than with &#8216;Uthman. I waited for  a few days and then Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked for her hand, and I gave her in marriage to him.  Afterwards I met Abu Bakr who said, &#8216;Perhaps you became angry with me when you presented  Hafsa to me and I did not give you a reply?&#8217; I said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Abu Bakr said, &#8216;Nothing  stopped me to respond to your offer except that I knew that Allah&#8217;s Apostle had mentioned  her, and I never wanted to let out the secret of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. And if Allah&#8217;s Apostle  had refused her, I would have accepted her.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

Even if I have not married Um Salama, she would  not be lawful for me to marry, for her father is my foster brother.&#8221; &#8216;And there is no  blame on you if you make hint of betrothal or conceal it in your hearts. Allah is  Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.&#8217; (2.235) Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Hint your intention of  marrying&#8217; is made by saying (to the widow) for example: &#8220;I want to marry, and I wish  that Allah will make a righteous lady available for me.&#8217; &#8221; Al-Qasim said: One may say  to the widow: &#8216;I hold all respect for you, and I am interested in you; Allah will bring  you much good, or something similar &#8216;Ata said: One should hint his intention, and should  not declare it openly. One may say: &#8216;I have some need. Have good tidings. Praise be to  Allah; you are fit to remarry.&#8217; She (the widow) may say in reply: I am listening to what  you say,&#8217; but she should not make a promise. Her guardian should not make a promise (to  somebody to get her married to him) without her knowledge. But if, while still in the  Iddat period, she makes a promise to marry somebody, and he ultimately marries her, they  are not to be separated by divorce (i.e., the marriage is valid). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A woman came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! I have come to you to present myself to you (for marriage).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle  glanced at her. He looked at her carefully and fixed his glance on her and then lowered  his head. When the lady saw that he did not say anything, she sat down. A man from his  companions got up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If you are not in need of her, then  marry her to me.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Have you got anything to offer.&#8221; The  man said, &#8216;No, by Allah, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Go to  your family and try to find something.&#8221; So the man went and returned, saying,  &#8220;No, by Allah, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have not found anything.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Go again and look for something, even if it were an iron ring.&#8221; He went and  returned, saying, &#8220;No, by Allah, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I could not find even an iron  ring, but this is my Izar (waist sheet).&#8217; He had no Rida (upper garment). He added,  &#8220;I give half of it to her.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said &#8220;What will she do with  your Izar? If you wear it, she will have nothing over herself thereof (will be naked); and  if she wears it, then you will have nothing over yourself thereof &#8216; So the man sat for a  long period and then got up (to leave). When Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw him leaving, he ordered  that he e called back. When he came, the Prophet asked (him), &#8220;How much of the Qur&#8217;an  do you know (by heart)?&#8221; The man replied, I know such Sura and such Sura and such  Sura,&#8221; naming the suras. The Prophet said, &#8220;Can you recite it by heart?&#8221; He  said, &#8216;Yes.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Go I let you marry her for what you know of the  Quran (as her Mahr). </font></p>

He said, &#8220;I married my  sister to a man and he divorced her, and when her days of &#8216;Idda (three menstrual periods)  were over, the man came again and asked for her hand, but I said to him, &#8216;I married her to  you and made her your bed (your wife) and favored you with her, but you divorced her. Now  you come to ask for her hand again? No, by Allah, she will never go back to you (again)!&#8217;  That man was not a bad man and his wife wanted to go back to him. So Allah revealed this  Verse: &#8216;Do not prevent them.&#8217; (2.232) So I said, &#8216;Now I will do it (let her go back to  him), O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221;So he married her to him again. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(regarding His Statement): &#8216;They ask your instruction  concerning the women. Say: Allah instructs you about them &#8230;&#8217; (4.127) It is about the  female orphan who is under the guardianship of a man with whom she shares her property and  he does not want to marry her and dislikes that someone else should marry her, lest he  should share the property with him, so he prevents her from marrying. So Allah forbade  such a guardian to do so (i.e. to prevent her from marrying). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with  orphan girls (to the end of the verse) that your right hands possess?&#8221; (4.3) Aisha  said, &#8220;O my nephew! It was about the female orphan under the protection of her  guardian who was interested in her beauty and wealth and wanted to marry her with a little  or reduced Mahr. So such guardians were forbidden to marry female orphans unless they deal  with them justly and give their full Mahr; and they were ordered to marry women other than  them.&#8221;&#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;(Later) the people asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle, for instructions,  and then Allah revealed: &#8216;They ask your instruction concerning the women . . . And yet  whom you desire to marry.&#8217; (4.127) So Allah revealed to them in this Verse that-if a  female orphan had wealth and beauty, they desired to marry her and were interested in her  noble descent and the reduction of her Mahr; but if she was not desired by them because of  her lack in fortune and beauty they left her and married some other woman. So, as they  used to leave her when they had no interest in her, they had no right to marry her if they  had the desire to do so, unless they deal justly with her and gave her a full amount of  Mahr.&#8221; </font></p>

I  invited the Muslims to a banquet which included neither meat nor bread. The Prophet  ordered for the leather dining sheets to be spread, and then dates, dried yogurt and  butter were provided over it, and that was the Walima (banquet) of the Prophet. The  Muslims asked whether Safiyya would be considered as his wife or as a slave girl of what  his right hands possessed. Then they said, &#8220;If the Prophet screens her from the  people, then she Is the Prophet&#8217;s wife but if he does not screen her, then she is a slave  girl.&#8221; So when the Prophet proceeded, he made a place for her (on the camel) behind  him and screened her from people. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;Whenever the Prophet passed by (my mother Um-Sulaim)  he used to enter her and greet her. Anas further said: Once the Prophet way a bridegroom  during his marriage with Zainab, Um Sulaim said to me, &#8220;Let us give a gift to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle .&#8221; I said to her, &#8220;Do it.&#8221; So she prepared Haisa (a sweet dish)  made from dates, butter and dried yoghurt and she sent it with me to him. I took it to him  and he said, &#8220;Put it down,&#8221; and ordered me to call some men whom he named, and  to invite whomever I would meet. I did what he ordered me to do, and when I returned, I  found the house crowded with people and saw the Prophet keeping his hand over the Haisa  and saying over it whatever Allah wished (him to say). Then he called the men in batches  of ten to eat of it, and he said to them, &#8220;Mention the Name of Allah, and each man  should eat of the dish the nearest to him.&#8221; When all of them had finished their  meals, some of them left and a few remained there talking, over which I felt unhappy. Then  the Prophet went out towards the dwelling places (of his wives) and I too, went out after  him and told him that those people had left. Then he returned and entered his dwelling  place and let the curtains fall while I was in (his) dwelling place, and he was reciting  the Verses:&#8211; &#8216;O you who believe! Enter not the Prophet&#8217;s house until leave is given you  for a meal, (and then) not (as early as) to what for its preparation. But when you are  invited, enter, and when you have taken your meals, disperse without sitting for a talk.  Verily such (behavior) annoys the Prophet; and he would be shy of (asking) you (to go),  but Allah is not shy of (telling you) the Truth.&#8217; (33-53) Abu Uthman said: Anas said,  &#8220;I served the Prophet for ten years.&#8221; </font></p>

It was  revealed for the first time when Allah&#8217;s Apostle had consummated his marriage with Zainab  bint Jahsh. When the day dawned, the Prophet was a bridegroom and he invited the people to  a banquet, so they came, ate, and then all left except a few who remained with the Prophet  for a long time. The Prophet got up and went out, and I too went out with him so that  those people might leave too. The Prophet proceeded and so did I, till he came to the  threshold of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s dwelling place. Then thinking that these people have left by then,  he returned and so did I along with him till he entered upon Zainab and behold, they were  still sitting and had not gone. So the Prophet again went away and I went away along with  him. When we reached the threshold of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s dwelling place, he thought that they had  left, and so he returned and I too, returned along with him and found those people had  left. Then the Prophet drew a curtain between me and him, and the Verses of Al-Hijab were  revealed. </font></p>

Sad said to &#8216;Abdur-Rahman,  &#8220;I will divide and share my property with you and will give one of my two wives to  you.&#8221; &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;May Allah bless you, your wives and property (I am  not in need of that; but kindly show me the way to the market).&#8221; So &#8216;Abdur-Rahman  went to the market and traded there gaining a profit of some dried yoghurt and butter, and  married (an Ansari woman).

He does not ask about whatever is in the house.&#8221; The sixth one said, &#8220;If  my husband eats. he eats too much (leaving the dishes empty), and if he drinks he leaves  nothing, and if he sleeps he sleeps alone (away from me) covered in garments and does not  stretch his hands here and there so as to know how I fare (get along).&#8221; The seventh  one said, &#8220;My husband is a wrong-doer or weak and foolish. All the defects are  present in him. He may injure your head or your body or may do both.&#8221; The eighth one  said, &#8220;My husband is soft to touch like a rabbit and smells like a Zarnab (a kind of  good smelling grass).&#8221; The ninth one said, &#8220;My husband is a tall generous man  wearing a long strap for carrying his sword. His ashes are abundant and his house is near  to the people who would easily consult him.&#8221; The tenth one said, &#8220;My husband is  Malik, and what is Malik? Malik is greater than whatever I say about him. (He is beyond  and above all praises which can come to my mind). Most of his camels are kept at home  (ready to be slaughtered for the guests) and only a few are taken to the pastures. When  the camels hear the sound of the lute (or the tambourine) they realize that they are going  to be slaughtered for the guests.&#8221; The eleventh one said, &#8220;My husband is Abu Zar  and what is Abu Zar (i.e., what should I say about him)? He has given me many ornaments  and my ears are heavily loaded with them and my arms have become fat (i.e., I have become  fat). And he has pleased me, and I have become so happy that I feel proud of myself. He  found me with my family who were mere owners of sheep and living in poverty, and brought  me to a respected family having horses and camels and threshing and purifying grain .  Whatever I say, he does not rebuke or insult me. When I sleep, I sleep till late in the  morning, and when I drink water (or milk), I drink my fill. The mother of Abu Zar and what  may one say in praise of the mother of Abu Zar? Her saddle bags were always full of  provision and her house was spacious. As for the son of Abu Zar, what may one say of the  son of Abu Zar? His bed is as narrow as an unsheathed sword and an arm of a kid (of four  months) satisfies his hunger. As for the daughter of Abu Zar, she is obedient to her  father and to her mother. She has a fat well-built body and that arouses the jealousy of  her husband&#8217;s other wife. As for the (maid) slave girl of Abu Zar, what may one say of the  (maid) slavegirl of Abu Zar? She does not uncover our secrets but keeps them, and does not  waste our provisions and does not leave the rubbish scattered everywhere in our  house.&#8221; The eleventh lady added, &#8220;One day it so happened that Abu Zar went out  at the time when the milk was being milked from the animals, and he saw a woman who had  two sons like two leopards playing with her two breasts. (On seeing her) he divorced me  and married her. Thereafter I married a noble man who used to ride a fast tireless horse  and keep a spear in his hand. He gave me many things, and also a pair of every kind of  livestock and said, &#8216;Eat (of this), O Um Zar, and give provision to your relatives.&#8221;  She added, &#8220;Yet, all those things which my second husband gave me could not fill the  smallest utensil of Abu Zar&#8217;s.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha then said: Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to me, &#8220;I  am to you as Abu Zar was to his wife Um Zar.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 62, Number 119: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas : </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I had been eager to ask &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab about the two  ladies from among the wives of the Prophet regarding whom Allah said &#8216;If you two (wives of  the Prophet namely Aisha and Hafsa) turn in repentance to Allah, your hearts are indeed so  inclined (to oppose what the Prophet likes). (66.4) till &#8216;Umar performed the Hajj and I  too, performed the Hajj along with him. (On the way) &#8216;Umar went aside to answer the call  of nature, and I also went aside along with him carrying a tumbler full of water, and when  &#8216;Umar had finished answering the call of nature, I poured water over his hands and he  performed the ablution. Then I said to him, &#8220;O chief of the Believers! Who were the  two ladies from among the wives of the Prophet regarding whom Allah said: &#8216;If you two  (wives of the Prophet) turn in repentance to Allah your hearts are indeed so inclined (to  oppose what the Prophet likes)?&#8221; (66.4) He said, &#8220;I am astonished at your  question, O Ibn Abbas. They were &#8216;Aisha and Hafsa.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar went on narrating the  Hadith and said, &#8220;I and an Ansari neighbor of mine from Bani Umaiyya bin Zaid who  used to live in Awali-al-Medina, used to visit the Prophet in turn. He used to go one day  and I another day. When I went, I would bring him the news of what had happened that day  regarding the Divine Inspiration and other things, and when he went, he used to do the  same for me. We, the people of Quraish used to have the upper hand over our wives, but  when we came to the Ansar, we found that their women had the upper hand over their men, so  our women also started learning the ways of the Ansari women. I shouted at my wife and she  retorted against me and I disliked that she should answer me back. She said to me, &#8216;Why  are you so surprised at my answering you back? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet answer  him back and some of them may leave (does not speak to) him throughout the day till the  night.&#8217; The (talk) scared me and I said to her, &#8216;Whoever has done so will be ruined!&#8217; Then  I proceeded after dressing myself, and entered upon Hafsa and said to her, &#8216;Does anyone of  you keep the Prophet angry till night?&#8217; She said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; I said, &#8216;You are a ruined losing  person! Don&#8217;t you fear that Allah may get angry for the anger of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and thus  you will be ruined? So do not ask more from the Prophet and do not answer him back and do  not give up talking to him. Ask me whatever you need and do not be tempted to imitate your  neighbor (i.e., &#8216;Aisha) in her manners for she is more charming than you and more beloved  to the Prophet .&#8221; Umar added,&#8221;At that time a talk was circulating among us that  (the tribe of) Ghassan were preparing their horses to invade us. My Ansari companion, on  the day of his turn, went (to the town) and returned to us at night and knocked at my door  violently and asked if I was there. I became horrified and came out to him. He said,  &#8216;Today a great thing has happened.&#8217; I asked, &#8216;What is it? Have (the people of) Ghassan  come?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No, but (What has happened) is greater and more horrifying than that:  Allah&#8217;s Apostle; has divorced his wives. &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;The Prophet kept away from his  wives and I said &#8220;Hafsa is a ruined loser.&#8217; I had already thought that most probably  this (divorce) would happen in the near future. So I dressed myself and offered the  morning prayer with the Prophet and then the Prophet; entered an upper room and stayed  there in seclusion. I entered upon Hafsa and saw her weeping. I asked, &#8216;What makes you  weep? Did I not warn you about that? Did the Prophet divorce you all?&#8217; She said, &#8216;I do not  know. There he is retired alone in the upper room.&#8217; I came out and sat near the pulpit and  saw a group of people sitting around it and some of them were weeping. I sat with them for  a while but could not endure the situation, so I went to the upper room where the Prophet;  was and said to a black slave of his, &#8216;Will you get the permission (of the Prophet ) for  &#8216;Umar (to enter)?&#8217; The slave went in, talked to the Prophet about it and then returned  saying, &#8216;I have spoken to the Prophet and mentioned you but he kept quiet.&#8217; Then I  returned and sat with the group of people sitting near the pulpit. but I could not bear  the situation and once again I said to the slave, &#8216;Will you get the permission for &#8216;Umar?&#8217;  He went in and returned saying, &#8216;I mentioned you to him but he kept quiet.&#8217; So I returned  again and sat with the group of people sitting near the pulpit, but I could not bear the  situation, and so I went to the slave and said, &#8216;Will you get the permission for &#8216;Umar?&#8217;  He went in and returned to me saying, &#8216;I mentioned you to him but he kept quiet.&#8217; When I  was leaving, behold! The slave called me, saying, &#8216;The Prophet has given you permission.&#8217;  Then I entered upon Allah&#8217;s Apostle and saw him Lying on a bed made of stalks of date palm  leaves and there was no bedding between it and him. The stalks left marks on his side and  he was leaning on a leather pillow stuffed with date-palm fires. I greeted him and while  still standing I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Have you divorced your wives?&#8217; He looked at me  and said, &#8216;No.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Allah Akbar!&#8217; And then, while still standing, I said chatting,  &#8216;Will you heed what I say, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle? We, the people of Quraish used to have power  over our women, but when we arrived at Medina we found that the men (here) were  overpowered by their women.&#8217; The Prophet smiled and then I said to him, &#8216;Will you heed  what I say, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle? I entered upon Hafsa and said to her, &#8220;Do not be  tempted to imitate your companion (&#8216;Aisha), for she is more charming than you and more  beloved to the Prophet.&#8217; &#8221; The Prophet smiled for a second time. When I saw him  smiling, I sat down. Then I looked around his house, and by Allah, I could not see  anything of importance in his house except three hides, so I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  Invoke Allah to make your followers rich, for the Persians and the Romans have been made  prosperous and they have been given (the pleasures of the world), although they do not  worship Allah.&#8217; Thereupon the Prophet sat up as he was reclining. and said, &#8216;Are you of  such an opinion, O the son of Al-Khattab? These are the people who have received the  rewards for their good deeds in this world.&#8217; I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Ask Allah to  forgive me.&#8217; Then the Prophet kept away from his wives for twenty-nine days because of the  story which Hafsa had disclosed to &#8216;Aisha. The Prophet had said, &#8216;I will not enter upon  them (my wives) for one month,&#8217; because of his anger towards them, when Allah had  admonished him. So, when twenty nine days had passed, the Prophet first entered upon  &#8216;Aisha. &#8216;Aisha said to him, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You had sworn that you would not enter  upon us for one month, but now only twenty-nine days have passed, for I have been counting  them one by one.&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;The (present) month is of twenty nine days.&#8217; &#8216;Aisha  added, &#8216;Then Allah revealed the Verses of the option. (2) And out of all his-wives he  asked me first, and I chose him.&#8217; Then he gave option to his other wives and they said  what &#8216;Aisha had said . &#8221; (1) The Prophet, &#8216; had decided to abstain from eating a  certain kind of food because of a certain event, so Allah blamed him for doing so. Some of  his wives were the cause of him taking that decision, therefore he deserted them for one  month. See Quran: (66.4) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>During the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, the sun eclipsed.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle offered the prayer of (the) eclipse) and so did the people along with him.  He performed a long Qiyam (standing posture) during which Surat-al-Baqara could have been  recited; then he performed a pro-longed bowing, then raised his head and stood for a long  time which was slightly less than that of the first Qiyam (and recited Qur&#8217;an). Then he  performed a prolonged bowing again but the period was shorter than the period of the first  bowing, then he stood up and then prostrated. Again he stood up, but this time the period  of standing was less than the first standing. Then he performed a prolonged bowing but of  a lesser duration than the first, then he stood up again for a long time but for a lesser  duration than the first. Then he performed a prolonged bowing but of lesser duration than  the first, and then he again stood up, and then prostrated and then finished his prayer.  By then the sun eclipse had cleared. The Prophet then said, &#8220;The sun and the moon are  two signs among the signs of Allah, and they do not eclipse because of the death or birth  of someone, so when you observe the eclipse, remember Allah (offer the eclipse  prayer).&#8221; They (the people) said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We saw you stretching your  hand to take something at this place of yours, then we saw you stepping backward.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;I saw Paradise (or Paradise was shown to me), and I stretched my hand to pluck  a bunch (of grapes), and had I plucked it, you would have eaten of it as long as this  world exists. Then I saw the (Hell) Fire, and I have never before, seen such a horrible  sight as that, and I saw that the majority of its dwellers were women.&#8221; The people  asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What is the reason for that?&#8221; He replied,  &#8220;Because of their ungratefulness.&#8221; It was said. &#8220;Do they disbelieve in  Allah (are they ungrateful to Allah)?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;They are not thankful to  their husbands and are ungrateful for the favors done to them. Even if you do good to one  of them all your life, when she seems some harshness from you, she will say, &#8220;I have  never seen any good from you.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We got female captives in the war booty and we used to do  coitus interruptus with them. So we asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it and he said, &#8220;Do  you really do that?&#8221; repeating the question thrice, &#8220;There is no soul that is  destined to exist but will come into existence, till the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Aisha said that whenever the Prophet intended to go on a  journey, he drew lots among his wives (so as to take one of them along with him). During  one of his journeys the lot fell on &#8216;Aisha and Hafsa. When night fell the Prophet would  ride beside &#8216;Aisha and talk with her. One night Hafsa said to &#8216;Aisha, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you ride  my camel tonight and I ride yours, so that you may see (me) and I see (you) (in new  situation)?&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;Yes, (I agree.)&#8221; So &#8216;Aisha rode, and then the  Prophet came towards &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s camel on which Hafsa was riding. He greeted Hafsa and then  proceeded (beside her) till they dismounted (on the way). &#8216;Aisha missed him, and so, when  they dismounted, she put her legs in the Idhkhir and said, &#8220;O Lord (Allah)! Send a  scorpion or a snake to bite me for I am not to blame him (the Prophet ). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Az-Zubair married me, he had no real property or any  slave or anything else except a camel which drew water from the well, and his horse. I  used to feed his horse with fodder and drew water and sew the bucket for drawing it, and  prepare the dough, but I did not know how to bake bread. So our Ansari neighbors used to  bake bread for me, and they were honorable ladies. I used to carry the date stones on my  head from Zubair&#8217;s land given to him by Allah&#8217;s Apostle and this land was two third  Farsakh (about two miles) from my house. One day, while I was coming with the date stones  on my head, I met Allah&#8217;s Apostle along with some Ansari people. He called me and then,  (directing his camel to kneel down) said, &#8220;Ikh! Ikh!&#8221; so as to make me ride  behind him (on his camel). I felt shy to travel with the men and remembered Az-Zubair and  his sense of Ghira, as he was one of those people who had the greatest sense of Ghira.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle noticed that I felt shy, so he proceeded. I came to Az-Zubair and said,  &#8220;I met Allah&#8217;s Apostle while I was carrying a load of date stones on my head, and he  had some companions with him. He made his camel kneel down so that I might ride, but I  felt shy in his presence and remembered your sense of Ghira (See the glossary). On that  Az-Zubair said, &#8220;By Allah, your carrying the date stones (and you being seen by the  Prophet in such a state) is more shameful to me than your riding with him.&#8221; (I  continued serving in this way) till Abu Bakr sent me a servant to look after the horse,  whereupon I felt as if he had set me free. </font></p>

He gave the sound dish to the wife whose dish had been broken and kept the broken one at  the house where it had been broken. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;When anyone of you is away from  his house for a long time, he should not return to his family at night.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I was with Allah&#8217;s Apostle in a Ghazwa, and when we  returned, I wanted to hurry, while riding a slow camel. A rider came behind me. I looked  back and saw that the rider was Allah&#8217;s Apostle . He said (to me), &#8220;What makes you in  such a hurry?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I am newly married.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Did you  marry a virgin or a matron?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;(Not a virgin but) a matron.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you marry a young girl with whom you could play and who could play  with you?&#8221; Then when we approached (Medina) and were going to enter (it), the Prophet  said, &#8220;Wait till you enter (your homes) at night (in the first part of the night) so  that the ladies with unkempt hair may comb their hair, and those whose husbands have been  absent (for a long time) may shave their pubic hair.&#8221; (The sub-narrator, Hashim said:  A reliable narrator told me that the Prophet added in this Hadith: &#8220;(Seek to beget)  children! Children, O Jabir!&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;If you enter (your town) at night  (after coming from a journey), do not enter upon your family till the woman whose husband  was absent (from the house) shaves her pubic hair and the woman with unkempt hair, combs  her hair&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle further said, &#8220;(O Jabir!) Seek to have offspring, seek  to have offspring!&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were with the Prophet in Ghazwa, and when we returned  and approached Medina, I wanted to hurry while riding a slow camel. A rider overtook me  and pricked my camel with a spear which he had, whereupon my camel started running as fast  as any other fast camel you may see. I looked back, and behold, the rider was Allah&#8217;s  Apostle . I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I am newly married &#8221; He asked, &#8220;Have  you got married?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;A virgin or a  matron?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;(Not a virgin) but a matron&#8221; He said, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t  you marry a young girl so that you could play with her and she with you?&#8221; When we  reached (near Medina) and were going to enter it, the Prophet said, &#8220;Wait till you  enter your home early in the night so that the lady whose hair is unkempt may comb her  hair and that the lady whose husband has been away may shave her pubic hair.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Hazim: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people differed about the type of treatment which had  been given to Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the day (of the battle) of Uhud. So they asked Sahl bin  Sad As-Sa&#8217;id who was the only surviving Companion (of the Prophet) at Medina. He replied,  &#8220;Nobody Is left at Medina who knows it better than I. Fatima was washing the blood  off his face and &#8216;Ali was bringing water in his shield, and then a mat of date-palm leaves  was burnt and (the ash) was inserted into the wound.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Abis: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Ibn &#8216;Abbas answering a man who asked him, &#8220;Did  you attend the prayer of &#8216;Id al Adha or &#8216;Id-al-Fitr with Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas  replied, &#8220;Yes, and had it not been for my close relationship with him, I could not  have offered it.&#8221; (That was because of his young age). Ibn &#8216;Abbas further said,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle went out and offered the Id prayer and then delivered the sermon.&#8221;  Ibn &#8216;Abbas did not mention anything about the Adhan (the call for prayer) or the Iqama. He  added, &#8220;Then the Prophet went to the women and instructed them and gave them  religious advice and ordered them to give alms and I saw them reaching out (their hands  to) their ears and necks (to take off the earrings and necklaces, etc.) and throwing (it)  towards Bilal. Then the Prophet returned with Bilal to his house . &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;A time will come upon the people, when a group of people will wage a holy war and it will be said, &#8216;Is there amongst you anyone who has accompanied Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; And so victory will be bestowed on them. Then a time will come upon the people when a group of people will wage a holy war, and it will be said, &#8220;Is there amongst you a none who has accompanied the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; And so victory will be bestowed on them. Then a time will come upon the people when a group of people will wage a holy war, and it will be said, &#8220;Is there amongst you anyone who has been in the company of the companions of the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; And victory will be bestowed on them.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 2:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Imran bin Husain:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;The best of my followers are those living in my generation (i.e. my contemporaries). and then those who will follow the latter&#8221; &#8216;Imran added, &#8220;I do not remember whether he mentioned two or three generations after his generation, then the Prophet added, &#8216;There will come after you, people who will bear witness without being asked to do so, and will be treacherous and untrustworthy, and they will vow and never fulfill their vows, and fatness will appear among them.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 3:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The best people are those living in my generation, and then those who will follow them, and then those who will follow the latter. Then there will come some people who will bear witness before taking oaths, and take oaths before bearing witness.&#8221; (Ibrahim, a sub-narrator said, &#8220;They used to beat us for witnesses and covenants when we were still children.&#8221;)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 4:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr bought a (camel) saddle from &#8216;Azib for thirteen Dirhams. Abu Bakr said to &#8216;Azib, &#8220;Tell Al-Bara&#8217; to carry the saddle for me.&#8221; &#8216;Azib said, &#8220;No, unless you relate to me what happened to you and Allah &#8216;s Apostle when you left Mecca while the pagans were in search of you.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;We left Mecca and we travel led continuously for that night and the following day till it was midday. I looked (around) searching for shade to take as shelter, and suddenly I came across a rock, and found a little shade there. So I cleaned the place and spread a bed for the Prophet in the shade and said to him, &#8216;Lie down, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8217; So the Prophet lay down and I went out, looking around to see if there was any person pursuing us. Suddenly I saw a shepherd driving his sheep towards the rock, seeking what we had already sought from it. I asked him, &#8216;To whom do you belong, O boy?&#8217; He said, &#8216;I belong to a man from Quraish.&#8217; He named the man and I recognized him. I asked him, &#8216;Is there any milk with your sheep?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Will you then milk (some) for us?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Then I asked him to tie the legs of one of the sheep and clean its udder, and then ordered him to clean his hands from dust. Then the shepherd cleaned his hands by striking his hands against one another. After doing so, he milked a small amount of milk. I used to keep for Allah&#8217;s Apostle a leather water-container, the mouth of which was covered with a piece of cloth. I poured water on the milk container till its lower part was cold. Then I took the milk to the Prophet whom I found awake. I said to him, &#8216;Drink, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8217; So he drank till I became pleased. Then I said, &#8216;It is time for us to move, O Allahs Apostle!&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; So we set out while the people (i.e. Quraish pagans) were searching for us, but none found us except Suraiqa bin Malik bin Jushum who was riding his horse. I said, &#8216;These are our pursuers who have found us. O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8217; He said, &#8216;Do not grieve, for Allah is with us.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to the Prophet while I was in the Cave. &#8220;If any of them should look under his feet, he would see us.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! What do you think of two (persons) the third of whom is Allah?&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle addressed the people saying, &#8220;Allah has given option to a slave to choose this world or what is with Him. The slave has chosen what is with Allah.&#8221; Abu Bakr wept, and we were astonished at his weeping caused by what the Prophet mentioned as to a Slave ( of Allah) who had been offered a choice, (we learned later on) that Allah&#8217;s Apostle himself was the person who was given the choice, and that Abu Bakr knew best of all of us. Allah&#8217;s Apostle added, &#8220;The person who has favored me most of all both with his company and wealth, is Abu Bakr. If I were to take a Khalil other than my Lord, I would have taken Abu Bakr as such, but (what relates us) is the Islamic brotherhood and friendliness. All the gates of the Mosque should be closed except the gate of Abu Bakr.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was sitting with the Prophet, Abu Bakr came, lifting up one corner of h is garment uncovering h is knee. The Prophet said, &#8220;Your companion has had a quarrel.&#8221; Abu Bakr greeted (the Prophet ) and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! There was something (i.e. quarrel) between me and the Son of Al-Khattab. I talked to him harshly and then regretted that, and requested him to forgive me, but he refused. This is why I have come to you.&#8221; The Prophet said thrice, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! May Allah forgive you.&#8221; In the meanwhile, &#8216;Umar regretted (his refusal of Abu Bakr&#8217;s excuse) and went to Abu Bakr&#8217;s house and asked if Abu Bakr was there. They replied in the negative. So he came to the Prophet and greeted him, but signs of displeasure appeared on the face of the Prophet till Abu Bakr pitied (&#8216;Umar), so he knelt and said twice, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! By Allah! I was more unjust to him (than he to me).&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah sent me (as a Prophet) to you (people) but you said (to me), &#8216;You are telling a lie,&#8217; while Abu Bakr said, &#8216;He has said the truth,&#8217; and consoled me with himself and his money.&#8221; He then said twice, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you then give up harming my companion?&#8221; After that nobody harmed Abu Bakr.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;While a shepherd was amongst his sheep, a wolf attacked them and took away one sheep. When the shepherd chased the wolf, the wolf turned towards him and said, &#8216;Who will be its guard on the day of wild animals when nobody except I will be its shepherd. And while a man was driving a cow with a load on it, it turned towards him and spoke to him saying, &#8216;I have not been created for this purpose, but for ploughing.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;Glorified be Allah.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;But I believe in it and so does Abu Bakr end &#8216;Umar.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;While I was sleeping, I saw myself standing at a well, on it there was a bucket. I drew water from the well as much as Allah wished. Then Ibn Abi Quhafa (i.e. Abu Bakr) took the bucket from me and brought out one or two buckets (of water) and there was weakness in his drawing the water. May Allah forgive his weakness for him. Then the bucket turned into a very big one and Ibn Al-Khattab took it over and I had never seen such a mighty person amongst the people as him in performing such hard work, till the people drank to their satisfaction and watered their camels that knelt down there.&#8221;</p>

This is good.&#8217; He who is amongst those who pray will be called from the gate of the prayer (in Paradise) and he who is from the people of Jihad will be called from the gate of Jihad, and he who is from those&#8217; who give in charity (i.e. Zakat) will be called from the gate of charity, and he who is amongst those who observe fast will be called from the gate of fasting, the gate of Raiyan.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;He who is called from all those gates will need nothing,&#8221; He added, &#8220;Will anyone be called from all those gates, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, and I hope you will be among those, O Abu Bakr.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 19:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) Allah&#8217;s Apostle died while Abu Bakr was at a place called As-Sunah (Al-&#8216;Aliya) &#8216;Umar stood up and said, &#8220;By Allah! Allah&#8217;s Apostle is not dead!&#8221; &#8216;Umar (later on) said, &#8220;By Allah! Nothing occurred to my mind except that.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Verily! Allah will resurrect him and he will cut the hands and legs of some men.&#8221; Then Abu Bakr came and uncovered the face of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, kissed him and said, &#8220;Let my mother and father be sacrificed for you, (O Allah&#8217;s Apostle), you are good in life and in death. By Allah in Whose Hands my life is, Allah will never make you taste death twice.&#8221; Then he went out and said, &#8220;O oath-taker! Don&#8217;t be hasty.&#8221; When Abu Bakr spoke, &#8216;Umar sat down. Abu Bakr praised and glorified Allah and said, No doubt! Whoever worshipped Muhammad, then Muhammad is dead, but whoever worshipped Allah, then Allah is Alive and shall never die.&#8221; Then he recited Allah&#8217;s Statement.:&#8211; &#8220;(O Muhammad) Verily you will die, and they also will die.&#8221; (39.30) He also recited:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Muhammad is no more than an Apostle; and indeed many Apostles have passed away, before him, If he dies Or is killed, will you then Turn back on your heels? And he who turns back On his heels, not the least Harm will he do to Allah And Allah will give reward to those Who are grateful.&#8221; (3.144)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people wept loudly, and the Ansar were assembled with Sad bin &#8216;Ubada in the shed of Bani Saida. They said (to the emigrants). &#8220;There should be one &#8216;Amir from us and one from you.&#8221; Then Abu Bakr, Umar bin Al-Khattab and Abu &#8216;baida bin Al-Jarrah went to them. &#8216;Umar wanted to speak but Abu Bakr stopped him. &#8216;Umar later on used to say, &#8220;By Allah, I intended only to say something that appealed to me and I was afraid that Abu Bakr would not speak so well. Then Abu Bakr spoke and his speech was very eloquent. He said in his statement, &#8220;We are the rulers and you (Ansars) are the ministers (i.e. advisers),&#8221; Hubab bin Al-Mundhir said, &#8220;No, by Allah we won&#8217;t accept this. But there must be a ruler from us and a ruler from you.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;No, we will be the rulers and you will be the ministers, for they (i.e. Quarish) are the best family amongst the &#8216;Arabs and of best origin. So you should elect either &#8216;Umar or Abu &#8216;Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah as your ruler.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said (to Abu Bakr), &#8220;No but we elect you, for you are our chief and the best amongst us and the most beloved of all of us to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; So &#8216;Umar took Abu Bakr&#8217;s hand and gave the pledge of allegiance and the people too gave the pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr. Someone said, &#8220;You have killed Sad bin Ubada.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Allah has killed him.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said (in another narration), (&#8220;When the Prophet was on his death-bed) he looked up and said thrice, (Amongst) the Highest Companion (See Qur&#8217;an 4.69)&#8217; Aisha said, Allah benefited the people by their two speeches. &#8216;Umar frightened the people some of whom were hypocrites whom Allah caused to abandon Islam because of &#8216;Umar&#8217;s speech. Then Abu Bakr led the people to True Guidance and acquainted them with the right path they were to follow so that they went out reciting:&#8211; &#8220;Muhammad is no more than an Apostle and indeed many Apostles have passed away before him..&#8221; (3.144)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We went out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle on one of his journeys till we reached Al-Baida or Dhatul-Jaish where my necklace got broken (and lost). Allah&#8217;s Apostle stopped to search for it and the people too stopped with him. There was no water at that place and they had no water with them. So they went to Abu Bakr and said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see what &#8216;Aisha has done? She has made Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the people stop where there is no water and they have no water with them. Abu Bakr came while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was sleeping with his head on my thigh and said, &#8220;You detained Allah Apostle and the people where there is no water and they have no water.&#8221; He then admonished me and said what Allah wished and pinched me at my flanks with his hands, but I did not move because the head of Allah&#8217;s Apostle was on my thigh .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on sleeping till be got up in the morning and found no water. Then Allah revealed the Divine Verse of Tayammum, and the people performed Tayammum. Usaid bin AlHudair said. &#8220;O family of Abu Bakr! This is not the first blessings of yours.&#8221; We urged the camel on which I was sitting to get up from its place and the necklace was found under it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I performed ablution in my house and then went out and said, &#8220;Today I shall stick to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and stay with him all this day of mine (in his service).&#8221; I went to the Mosque and asked about the Prophet . They said, &#8220;He had gone in this direction.&#8221; So I followed his way, asking about him till he entered a place called Bir Aris. I sat at its gate that was made of date-palm leaves till the Prophet finished answering the call of nature and performed ablution. Then I went up to him to see him sitting at the well of Aris at the middle of its edge with his legs uncovered, hanging in the well. I greeted him and went back and sat at the gate. I said, &#8220;Today I will be the gatekeeper of the Prophet.&#8221; Abu Bakr came and pushed the gate. I asked, &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Abu Bakr.&#8221; I told him to wait, went in and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Abu Bakr asks for permission to enter.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Admit him and give him the glad tidings that he will be in Paradise.&#8221; So I went out and said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;Come in, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle gives you the glad tidings that you will be in Paradise&#8221; Abu Bakr entered and sat on the right side of Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the built edge of the well and hung his legs n the well as the Prophet did and uncovered his legs. I then returned and sat (at the gate). I had left my brother performing ablution and he intended to follow me. So I said (to myself). &#8220;If Allah wants good for so-and-so (i.e. my brother) He will bring him here.&#8221; Suddenly somebody moved the door. I asked, &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;&#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab.&#8221; I asked him to wait, went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, greeted him and said, &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission to enter.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Admit him, and give him the glad tidings that he will be in Paradise.&#8221; I went to &#8220;Umar and said &#8220;Come in, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle, gives you the glad tidings that you will be in Paradise.&#8221; So he entered and sat beside Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the built edge of the well on the left side and hung his legs in the well. I returned and sat (at the gate) and said, (to myself), &#8220;If Allah wants good for so-and-so, He will bring him here.&#8221; Somebody came and moved the door. I asked &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Uthman bin Affan.&#8221; I asked him to wait and went to the Prophet and informed him. He said, &#8220;Admit him, and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise, I asked him to wait and went to the Prophet and informed him. He said, &#8220;Admit him, and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise after a calamity that will befall him.&#8221; So I went up to him and said to him, &#8220;Come in; Allah&#8217;s Apostle gives you the glad tidings of entering Paradise after a calamity that will befall you. &#8220;Uthman then came in and found that the built edge of the well was occupied, so he sat opposite to the Prophet on the other side. Said bin Al-Musaiyab said, &#8220;I interpret this (narration) in terms of their graves.&#8221;</p>

May Allah always keep you smiling.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;These women who have been here, roused my wonder, for as soon as they heard your voice, they quickly put on their veils. &#8220;&#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You have more right to be feared by them than I.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar addressed the women saying, &#8220;O enemies of yourselves! You fear me more than you do Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes, for you are harsher and sterner than Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Ibn Al-Khattab! By Him in Whose Hands my life is! Never does Satan find you going on a way, but he takes another way other than yours.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">When (the dead body of) &#8216;Umar was put on his deathbed, the people gathered around him and invoked (Allah) and prayed for him before the body was taken away, and I was amongst them. Suddenly I felt somebody taking hold of my shoulder and found out that he was &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib. &#8216;Ali invoked Allah&#8217;s Mercy for &#8216;Umar and said, &#8220;O &#8216;Umar! You have not left behind you a person whose deeds I like to imitate and meet Allah with more than I like your deeds. By Allah! I always thought that Allah would keep you with your two companions, for very often I used to hear the Prophet saying, &#8216;I, Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar went (somewhere); I, Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar entered (somewhere); and I, Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar went out.&#8221;&#8216;</p>

Never mind what has happened to you, for you have been in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and you kept good relations with him and you parted with him while he was pleased with you. Then you were in the company of Abu Bakr and kept good relations with him and you parted with him (i.e. he died) while he was pleased with you. Then you were in the company of the Muslims, and you kept good relations with them, and if you leave them, you will leave them while they are pleased with you.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, (to Ibn &#8220;Abbas), &#8220;As for what you have said about the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his being pleased with me, it is a favor, Allah did to me; and as for what you have said about the company of Abu Bakr and his being pleased with me, it is a favor Allah did to me; and concerning my impatience which you see, is because of you and your companions. By Allah! If (at all) I had gold equal to the earth, I would have ransomed myself with it from the Punishment of Allah before I meet Him.&#8221;</p>

The Prophet said to me &#8220;Open (the gate) and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise.&#8221; I opened (the gate) for him, and behold! It was &#8216;Umar. I informed him of what the Prophet had said, and he praised Allah. Then another man came and asked me to open the gate. The Prophet said to me. &#8220;Open (the gate) for him and inform him of the glad tidings, of entering Paradise with a calamity which will befall him. &#8221; Behold !

It was &#8216;Uthman bin &#8216;Affan. &#8216;Asim, in another narration, said that the Prophet was sitting in a place where there was water, and he was uncovering both his knees or his knee, and when &#8216;Uthman entered, he covered them (or it).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad bin &#8216;Abu Yaghuth said (to me), &#8220;What forbids you to talk to &#8216;Uthman about his brother Al-Walid because people have talked much about him?&#8221; So I went to &#8216;Uthman and when he went out for prayer I said (to him), &#8220;I have something to say to you and it is a piece of advice for you &#8221; &#8216;Uthman said, &#8220;O man, from you.&#8221; (Umar said: I see that he said, &#8220;I seek Refuge with Allah from you.&#8221;) So I left him and went to them. Then the messenger of Uthman came and I went to him (i.e. &#8216;Uthman), &#8216;Uthman asked, &#8220;What is your advice?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Allah sent Muhammad with the Truth, and revealed the Divine Book (i.e. Quran) to him; and you were amongst those who followed Allah and His Apostle, and you participated in the two migrations (to Ethiopia and to Medina) and enjoyed the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and saw his way. No doubt, the people are talking much about Al-Walid.&#8221; &#8216;Uthman said, &#8220;Did you receive your knowledge directly from Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; I said, &#8220;No, but his knowledge did reach me and it reached (even) to a virgin in her seclusion.&#8221; &#8216;Uthman said, &#8220;And then Allah sent Muhammad with the Truth and I was amongst those who followed Allah and His Apostle and I believed in what ever he (i.e. the Prophet) was sent with, and participated in two migrations, as you have said, and I enjoyed the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and gave the pledge of allegiance him. By Allah! I never disobeyed him, nor did I cheat him till Allah took him unto Him. Then I treated Abu Bakr and then &#8216;Umar similarly and then I was made Caliph. So, don&#8217;t I have rights similar to theirs?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then what are these talks reaching me from you people? Now, concerning what you mentioned about the question of Al-Walid, Allah willing, I shall deal with him according to what is right.&#8221; Then he called &#8216;Ali and ordered him to flog him, and &#8216;Ali flogged him (i.e. Al-Walid) eighty lashes.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Uthman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the son of Muhib) An Egyptian who came and performed the Hajj to the Kaba saw some people sitting. He enquire, &#8220;Who are these people?&#8221; Somebody said, &#8220;They are the tribe of Quraish.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Who is the old man sitting amongst them?&#8221; The people replied, &#8220;He is &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Ibn Umar! I want to ask you about something; please tell me about it. Do you know that &#8216;Uthman fled away on the day (of the battle) of Uhud?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The (Egyptian) man said, &#8220;Do you know that &#8216;Uthman was absent on the day (of the battle) of Badr and did not join it?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;Do you know that he failed to attend the Ar Ridwan pledge and did not witness it (i.e. Hudaibiya pledge of allegiance)?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;Allahu Akbar!&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Let me explain to you (all these three things). As for his flight on the day of Uhud, I testify that Allah has excused him and forgiven him; and as for his absence from the battle of Badr, it was due to the fact that the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle was his wife and she was sick then. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to him, &#8220;You will receive the same reward and share (of the booty) as anyone of those who participated in the battle of Badr (if you stay with her).&#8217; As for his absence from the Ar-Ridwan pledge of allegiance, had there been any person in Mecca more respectable than &#8216;Uthman (to be sent as a representative). Allah&#8217;s Apostle would have sent him instead of him. No doubt, Allah&#8217;s Apostle had sent him, and the incident of the Ar-Ridwan pledge of Allegiance happened after &#8216;Uthman had gone to Mecca. Allah&#8217;s Apostle held out his right hand saying, &#8216;This is &#8216;Uthman&#8217;s hand.&#8217; He stroke his (other) hand with it saying, &#8216;This (pledge of allegiance) is on the behalf of &#8216;Uthman.&#8217; Then Ibn &#8216;Umar said to the man, &#8216;Bear (these) excuses in mind with you.&#8217;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet ascended the mountain of Uhud and Abu Bakr, &#8216;Umar and &#8216;Uthman were accompanying him. The mountain gave a shake (i.e. trembled underneath them) . The Prophet said, &#8220;O Uhud ! Be calm.&#8221; I think that the Prophet hit it with his foot, adding, &#8220;For upon you there are none but a Prophet, a Siddiq and two martyrs.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 50:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amr bin Maimun:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I saw &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab a few days before he was stabbed in Medina. He was standing with Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman and &#8216;Uthman bin Hunaif to whom he said, &#8220;What have you done? Do you think that you have imposed more taxation on the land (of As-Swad i.e. &#8216;Iraq) than it can bear?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;We have imposed on it what it can bear because of its great yield.&#8221; &#8216;Umar again said, &#8220;Check whether you have imposed on the land what it can not bear.&#8221; They said, &#8220;No, (we haven&#8217;t).&#8221; &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;If Allah should keep me alive I will let the widows of Iraq need no men to support them after me.&#8221; But only four days had elapsed when he was stabbed (to death ). The day he was stabbed, I was standing and there was nobody between me and him (i.e. Umar) except Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas. Whenever Umar passed between the two rows, he would say, &#8220;Stand in straight lines.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he saw no defect (in the rows), he would go forward and start the prayer with Takbir. He would recite Surat Yusuf or An-Nahl or the like in the first Rak&#8217;a so that the people may have the time to Join the prayer. As soon as he said Takbir, I heard him saying, &#8220;The dog has killed or eaten me,&#8221; at the time he (i.e. the murderer) stabbed him. A non-Arab infidel proceeded on carrying a double-edged knife and stabbing all the persons he passed by on the right and left (till) he stabbed thirteen persons out of whom seven died. When one of the Muslims saw that, he threw a cloak on him. Realizing that he had been captured, the non-Arab infidel killed himself, &#8216;Umar held the hand of &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Auf and let him lead the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who were standing by the side of &#8216;Umar saw what I saw, but the people who were in the other parts of the Mosque did not see anything, but they lost the voice of &#8216;Umar and they were saying, &#8220;Subhan Allah! Subhan Allah! (i.e. Glorified be Allah).&#8221; Abdur-Rahman bin Auf led the people a short prayer. When they finished the prayer, &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Ibn &#8216;Abbas! Find out who attacked me.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas kept on looking here and there for a short time and came to say. &#8220;The slave of Al Mughira.&#8221; On that &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;The craftsman?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;May Allah curse him. I did not treat him unjustly. All the Praises are for Allah Who has not caused me to die at the hand of a man who claims himself to be a Muslim. No doubt, you and your father (Abbas) used to love to have more non-Arab infidels in Medina.&#8221; Al-Abbas had the greatest number of slaves. Ibn &#8216;Abbas said to &#8216;Umar. &#8220;If you wish, we will do.&#8221; He meant, &#8220;If you wish we will kill them.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;You are mistaken (for you can&#8217;t kill them) after they have spoken your language, prayed towards your Qibla, and performed Hajj like yours.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Umar was carried to his house, and we went along with him, and the people were as if they had never suffered a calamity before. Some said, &#8220;Do not worry (he will be Alright soon).&#8221; Some said, &#8220;We are afraid (that he will die).&#8221; Then an infusion of dates was brought to him and he drank it but it came out (of the wound) of his belly. Then milk was brought to him and he drank it, and it also came out of his belly. The people realized that he would die. We went to him, and the people came, praising him. A young man came saying, &#8220;O chief of the believers! Receive the glad tidings from Allah to you due to your company with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and your superiority in Islam which you know. Then you became the ruler (i.e. Caliph) and you ruled with justice and finally you have been martyred.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I wish that all these privileges will counterbalance (my shortcomings) so that I will neither lose nor gain anything.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the young man turned back to leave, his clothes seemed to be touching the ground. &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Call the young man back to me.&#8221; (When he came back) &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O son of my brother! Lift your clothes, for this will keep your clothes clean and save you from the Punishment of your Lord.&#8221; &#8216;Umar further said, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar! See how much I am in debt to others.&#8221; When the debt was checked, it amounted to approximately eighty-six thousand. &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;If the property of &#8216;Umar&#8217;s family covers the debt, then pay the debt thereof; otherwise request it from Bani &#8216;Adi bin Ka&#8217;b, and if that too is not sufficient, ask for it from Quraish tribe, and do not ask for it from any one else, and pay this debt on my behalf.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar then said (to &#8216;Abdullah), &#8220;Go to &#8216;Aisha (the mother of the believers) and say: &#8220;Umar is paying his salutation to you. But don&#8217;t say: &#8216;The chief of the believers,&#8217; because today I am not the chief of the believers. And say: &#8220;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission to be buried with his two companions (i.e. the Prophet, and Abu Bakr).&#8221; Abdullah greeted &#8216;Aisha and asked for the permission for entering, and then entered to her and found her sitting and weeping. He said to her, &#8220;&#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab is paying his salutations to you, and asks the permission to be buried with his two companions.&#8221; She said, &#8220;I had the idea of having this place for myself, but today I prefer Umar to myself.&#8221; When he returned it was said (to &#8216;Umar), &#8220;&#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar has come.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Make me sit up.&#8221; Somebody supported him against his body and &#8216;Umar asked (&#8216;Abdullah), &#8220;What news do you have?&#8221; He said, &#8220;O chief of the believers! It is as you wish. She has given the permission.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Praise be to Allah, there was nothing more important to me than this. So when I die, take me, and greet &#8216;Aisha and say: &#8220;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission (to be buried with the Prophet ), and if she gives the permission, bury me there, and if she refuses, then take me to the grave-yard of the Muslims.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Hafsa (the mother of the believers) came with many other women walking with her. When we saw her, we went away. She went in (to &#8216;Umar) and wept there for sometime. When the men asked for permission to enter, she went into another place, and we heard her weeping inside. The people said (to &#8216;Umar), &#8220;O chief of the believers! Appoint a successor.&#8221; Umar said, &#8220;I do not find anyone more suitable for the job than the following persons or group whom Allah&#8217;s Apostle had been pleased with before he died.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar mentioned &#8216;Ali, &#8216;Uthman, AzZubair, Talha, Sad and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman (bin Auf) and said, &#8220;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar will be a witness to you, but he will have no share in the rule. His being a witness will compensate him for not sharing the right of ruling. If Sad becomes the ruler, it will be alright: otherwise, whoever becomes the ruler should seek his help, as I have not dismissed him because of disability or dishonesty.&#8221; &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;I recommend that my successor takes care of the early emigrants; to know their rights and protect their honor and sacred things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also recommend that he be kind to the Ansar who had lived in Medina before the emigrants and Belief had entered their hearts before them. I recommend that the (ruler) should accept the good of the righteous among them and excuse their wrong-doers, and I recommend that he should do good to all the people of the towns (Al-Ansar), as they are the protectors of Islam and the source of wealth and the source of annoyance to the enemy. I also recommend that nothing be taken from them except from their surplus with their consent. I also recommend that he do good to the &#8216;Arab bedouin, as they are the origin of the &#8216;Arabs and the material of Islam. He should take from what is inferior, amongst their properties and distribute that to the poor amongst them. I also recommend him concerning Allah&#8217;s and His Apostle&#8217;s protectees (i.e. Dhimmis) to fulfill their contracts and to fight for them and not to overburden them with what is beyond their ability.&#8221; So when &#8216;Umar expired, we carried him out and set out walking. &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar greeted (&#8216;Aisha) and said, &#8220;&#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks for the permission.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;Bring him in.&#8221; He was brought in and buried beside his two companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he was buried, the group (recommended by &#8216;Umar) held a meeting. Then &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said, &#8221; Reduce the candidates for rulership to three of you.&#8221; Az-Zubair said, &#8220;I give up my right to Ali.&#8221; Talha said, &#8220;I give up my right to &#8216;Uthman,&#8221; Sad, &#8216;I give up my right to &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf.&#8221; &#8216;Abdur-Rahman then said (to &#8216;Uthman and &#8216;Ali), &#8220;Now which of you is willing to give up his right of candidacy to that he may choose the better of the (remaining) two, bearing in mind that Allah and Islam will be his witnesses.&#8221; So both the sheiks (i.e. &#8216;Uthman and &#8216;Ali) kept silent. &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;Will you both leave this matter to me, and I take Allah as my Witness that I will not choose but the better of you?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; So &#8216;Abdur-Rahman took the hand of one of them (i.e. &#8216;Ali) and said, &#8220;You are related to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and one of the earliest Muslims as you know well. So I ask you by Allah to promise that if I select you as a ruler you will do justice, and if I select &#8216;Uthman as a ruler you will listen to him and obey him.&#8221; Then he took the other (i.e. &#8216;Uthman) aside and said the same to him. When &#8216;Abdur-Rahman secured (their agreement to) this covenant, he said, &#8220;O &#8216;Uthman! Raise your hand.&#8221; So he (i.e. &#8216;Abdur-Rahman) gave him (i.e. &#8216;Uthman) the solemn pledge, and then &#8216;Ali gave him the pledge of allegiance and then all the (Medina) people gave him the pledge of allegiance.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Tomorrow I will give the flag to a man with whose leadership Allah will grant (the Muslim) victory.&#8221; So the people kept on thinking the whole night as to who would be given the flag. The next morning the people went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and every one of them hoped that he would be given the flag. The Prophet said, &#8220;Where is Ali bin Abi Talib?&#8221; The people replied, &#8220;He is suffering from eye trouble, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Send for him and bring him to me.&#8221; So when &#8216;Ali came, the Prophet spat in his eyes and invoked good on him, and he became alright as if he had no ailment. The Prophet then gave him the flag. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall I fight them (i.e. enemy) till they become like us?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Proceed to them steadily till you approach near to them and then invite them to Islam and inform them of their duties towards Allah which Islam prescribes for them, for by Allah, if one man is guided on the right path (i.e. converted to Islam) through you, it would be better for you than (a great number of) red camels.&#8221;</p>

Then he said, &#8220;How could I remain behind Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; So &#8216;Ali set out following the Prophet , When it was the eve of the day in the morning of which Allah helped (the Muslims) to conquer it, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I will give the flag (to a man), or tomorrow a man whom Allah and His Apostle love will take the flag,&#8221; or said, &#8220;A man who loves Allah and His Apostle; and Allah will grant victory under his leadership.&#8221; Suddenly came &#8216;Ali whom we did not expect. The people said, &#8220;This is &#8216;Ali.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave him the flag and Allah granted victory under his leadership.</p>

How (was this name given to &#8216;Ali)?&#8221; Sahl said, &#8220;&#8216;Ali went to Fatima and then came out and slept in the Mosque. The Prophet asked Fatima, &#8220;Where is your cousin?&#8221; She said, &#8220;In the Mosque.&#8221; The Prophet went to him and found that his (i.e. Ali&#8217;s) covering sheet had slipped of his back and dust had soiled his back. The Prophet started wiping the dust off his back and said twice, &#8220;Get up! O Abu Turab (i.e. O. man with the dust).&#8221;</p>

Ibn &#8216;Umar mentioned his good deeds and said, &#8220;It is all true, and that is his house in the midst of the houses of the Prophet.

Ali added &#8220;So the Prophet came to us, while we had gone to our bed I wanted to get up but the Prophet said, &#8220;Remain at your place&#8221;. Then he sat down between us till I found the coolness of his feet on my chest. Then he said, &#8220;Shall I teach you a thing which is better than what you have asked me? When you go to bed, say, &#8216;Allahu-Akbar&#8217; thirty-four times, and &#8216;Subhan Allah thirty-three times, and &#8216;Alhamdu-lillah thirty-three times for that is better for you both than a servant.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The people used to say, &#8220;Abu Huraira narrates too many narrations.&#8221; In fact I used to keep close to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and was satisfied with what filled my stomach. I ate no leavened bread and dressed no decorated striped clothes, and never did a man or a woman serve me, and I often used to press my belly against gravel because of hunger, and I used to ask a man to recite a Quranic Verse to me although I knew it, so that he would take me to his home and feed me. And the most generous of all the people to the poor was Ja&#8217;far bin Abi Talib. He used to take us to his home and offer us what was available therein. He would even offer us an empty folded leather container (of butter) which we would split and lick whatever was in it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatima sent somebody to Abu Bakr asking him to give her her inheritance from the Prophet from what Allah had given to His Apostle through Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting). She asked for the Sadaqa (i.e. wealth assigned for charitable purposes) of the Prophet at Medina, and Fadak, and what remained of the Khumus (i.e., one-fifth) of the Khaibar booty. Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;We (Prophets), our property is not inherited, and whatever we leave is Sadaqa, but Muhammad&#8217;s Family can eat from this property, i.e. Allah&#8217;s property, but they have no right to take more than the food they need.&#8217; By Allah! I will not bring any change in dealing with the Sadaqa of the Prophet (and will keep them) as they used to be observed in his (i.e. the Prophet&#8217;s) life-time, and I will dispose with it as Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to do,&#8221; Then &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and that Muhammad is His Apostle,&#8221; and added, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! We acknowledge your superiority.&#8221; Then he (i.e. &#8216;Ali) mentioned their own relationship to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and their right. Abu Bakr then spoke saying, &#8220;By Allah in Whose Hands my life is. I love to do good to the relatives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle rather than to my own relatives&#8221; Abu Bark added: Look at Muhammad through his family (i.e. if you are no good to his family you are not good to him).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ali demanded the hand of the daughter of Abu Jahl. Fatima heard of this and went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Your people think that you do not become angry for the sake of your daughters as &#8216;Ali is now going to marry the daughter of Abu Jahl. &#8220;On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up and after his recitation of Tashah-hud. I heard him saying, &#8220;Then after! I married one of my daughters to Abu Al-&#8216;As bin Al-Rabi&#8217; (the husband of Zainab, the daughter of the Prophet ) before Islam and he proved truthful in whatever he said to me. No doubt, Fatima is a part of me, I hate to see her being troubled. By Allah, the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Enemy cannot be the wives of one man.&#8221; So &#8216;Ali gave up that engagement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Al-Miswar further said: I heard the Prophet talking and he mentioned a son-in-law of his belonging to the tribe of Bani &#8216;Abd-Shams.

The Qa&#8217;if said.

The Prophet said, &#8216;If a reputable man amongst the children of Bani Israel committed a theft, they used to forgive him, but if a poor man committed a theft, they would cut his hand. But I would cut even the hand of Fatima (i.e. the daughter of the Prophet) if she committed a theft.&#8221;</p>

<h3 align="center">Supporting the Family</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.064.263"></a>Volume 7, Book 64, Number 263:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Mas&#8217;ud Al-Ansari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;When a Muslim spends something on his family intending to receive Allah&#8217;s reward it is regarded as Sadaqa for him.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 264:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah said, &#8216;O son of Adam! Spend, and I shall spend on you.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 265:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The one who looks after a widow or a poor person is like a Mujahid (warrior) who fights for Allah&#8217;s Cause, or like him who performs prayers all the night and fasts all the day.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 266:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet visited me at Mecca while I was ill. I said (to him), &#8220;I have property; May I bequeath all my property in Allah&#8217;s Cause?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Half of it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;One third of it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;One-third (is alright), yet it is still too much, for you&#8217;d better leave your inheritors wealthy than leave them poor, begging of others. Whatever you spend will be considered a Sadaqa for you, even the mouthful of food you put in the mouth of your wife. Anyhow Allah may let you recover, so that some people may benefit by you and others be harmed by you.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 267:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-&#8216;Amash:</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 268:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Prophet said, &#8216;The best alms is that which is given when one is rich, and a giving hand is better than a taking one, and you should start first to support your dependents.&#8217; A wife says, &#8216;You should either provide me with food or divorce me.&#8217; A slave says, &#8216;Give me food and enjoy my service.&#8221; A son says, &#8220;Give me food; to whom do you leave me?&#8221; The people said, &#8220;O Abu Huraira! Did you hear that from Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No, it is from my own self.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 269:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The best alms is that which you give when you are rich, and you should start first to support your dependants.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 270:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to sell the dates of the garden of Bani An-Nadir and store for his family so much food as would cover their needs for a whole year.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 271:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Malik bin Aus bin Al-Hadathan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once I set out to visit &#8216;Umar (bin Al-Khattab). (While I was sitting there with him his gate-keeper, Yarfa, came and said, &#8220;Uthman AbdurRahman (bin &#8216;Auf), Az-Zubair and Sad (bin Abi Waqqas) are seeking permission (to meet you).&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes. So he admitted them and they entered, greeted, and sat down. After a short while Yarfa came again and said to &#8216;Umar &#8216;Shall I admit &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas?&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He admitted them and when they entered, they greeted and sat down. &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;O Chief of the Believers! Judge between me and this (&#8216;Ali).&#8221; The group, &#8216;Uthman and his companions Sad, &#8216;O Chief of the Believers! Judge between them and relieve one from the other.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said. Wait! I beseech you by Allah, by Whose permission both the Heaven and the Earth stand fast ! Do you know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said. &#8216;We (Apostles) do not bequeath anything to our heirs, but whatever we leave is to be given in charity.&#8217; And by that Allah&#8217;s Apostles meant himself?&#8221; The group said, &#8220;He did say so.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then turned towards &#8216;All and &#8216;Abbas and said. &#8220;I beseech you both by Allah, do you know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said that?&#8221; They said, &#8216;Yes &#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Now, let me talk to you about this matter. Allah favored His Apostle with something of this property (war booty) which He did not give to anybody else. And Allah said:&#8211; &#8216;And what Allah has bestowed on His Apostle (as Fai Booty) from them for which you made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry . . . Allah is Able to do all things.&#8217; (59.6) So this property was especially granted to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. But by Allah he neither withheld it from you, nor did he keep it for himself and deprive you of it, but he gave it all to you and distributed it among you till only this remained out of it. And out of this property Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to provide his family with their yearly needs, and whatever remained, he would spend where Allah&#8217;s Property (the revenues of Zakat) used to be spent. Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on acting like this throughout his lifetime. Now I beseech you by Allah, do you know that?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar said to &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas, &#8220;I beseech you by Allah, do you both know that?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;When Allah had taken His Apostle unto Him, Abu Bakr said, &#8216;I am the successor of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. So he took charge of that property and did with it the same what Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to do, and both of you knew all about it then.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar turned towards &#8216;Ali and Abbas and said, &#8220;You both claim that Abu- Bakr was so-and-so! But Allah knows that he was honest, sincere, pious and right (in that matter). Then Allah caused Abu Bakr to die, and i said, &#8216;I am the successor of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr.&#8217; So I kept this property in my possession for the first two years of my rule, and I used to do the same with it as Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr used to do. Later both of you (&#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas) came to me with the same claim and the same problem. (O &#8216;Abbas!) You came to me demanding your share from (the inheritance of) the son of your brother, and he (&#8216;Ali) came to me demanding his wives share from (the inheritance of) her father. So I said to you, &#8216;If you wish I will hand over this property to you, on condition that you both promise me before Allah that you will manage it in the same way as Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr did, and as I have done since the beginning of my rule; otherwise you should not speak to me about it.&#8217; So you both said, &#8216;Hand over this property to us on this condition.&#8217; And on this condition I handed it over to you. I beseech you by Allah, did I hand it over to them on that condition?&#8221; The group said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then faced &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas and said, &#8220;I beseech you both by Allah, did I hand it over to you both on that condition?&#8221; They both said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;Do you want me now to give a decision other than that? By Him with Whose permission (order) both the Heaven and the Earth stand fast, I will never give any decision other than that till the Hour is established! But if you are unable to manage it (that property), then return it to me and I will be sufficient for it on your behalf . &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Hind bint &#8216;Utba came and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Abu Sufyan is a miser so is it sinful of me to feed our children from his property?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;No except if you take for your needs what is just and reasonable. &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 273:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 274:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ali:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatima went to the Prophet complaining about the bad effect of the stone hand-mill on her hand. She heard that the Prophet had received a few slave girls. But (when she came there) she did not find him, so she mentioned her problem to &#8216;Aisha. When the Prophet came, &#8216;Aisha informed him about that. &#8216;Ali added, &#8220;So the Prophet came to us when we had gone to bed. We wanted to get up (on his arrival) but he said, &#8216;Stay where you are.&#8221; Then he came and sat between me and her and I felt the coldness of his feet on my abdomen. He said, &#8220;Shall I direct you to something better than what you have requested? When you go to bed say &#8216;Subhan Allah&#8217; thirty-three times, &#8216;Alhamdulillah&#8217; thirty three times, and Allahu Akbar&#8217; thirty four times, for that is better for you than a servant.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatima came to the Prophet asking for a servant. He said, &#8220;May I inform you of something better than that? When you go to bed, recite &#8220;Subhan Allah&#8217; thirty three times, &#8216;Alhamdulillah&#8217; thirty three times, and &#8216;Allahu Akbar&#8217; thirty four times. &#8216;All added, &#8216;I have never failed to recite it ever since.&#8221; Somebody asked, &#8220;Even on the night of the battle of Siffin?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No, even on the night of the battle of Siffin.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked &#8216;Aisha &#8220;What did the Prophet use to do at home?&#8221; She said, &#8220;He used to work for his family, and when he heard the Adhan (call for the prayer), he would go out.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Hind bint &#8216;Utba said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Abu Sufyan is a miser and he does not give me what is sufficient for me and my children.

Have you married?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;A virgin or a matron?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;A matron.&#8221; he said, &#8220;Why not a virgin, so that you might play with her and she with you, and you might amuse her and she amuse you.&#8221; I said, &#8221; &#8216;Abdullah (my father) died and left girls, and I dislike to marry a girl like them, so I married a lady (matron) so that she may look after them.&#8221; On that he said, &#8220;May Allah bless you,&#8221; or &#8220;That is good.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 281:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;I am ruined!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Why?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I had sexual intercourse with my wife while fasting (in the month of Ramadan).&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Manumit a slave (as expiation).&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I cannot afford that.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Then fast for two successive months.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I cannot.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Then feed sixty poor persons.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have nothing to do that.&#8221; In the meantime a basket full of dates was brought to the Prophet . He said, &#8220;Where is the questioner.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;I am here.&#8221; The Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Give this (basket of dates) in charity (as expiation).&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall I give it to poorer people than us? By Him Who sent you with the Truth, there is no family between Medina&#8217;s two mountains poorer than us.&#8221; The Prophet smiled till his pre-molar teeth became visible. He then said, &#8220;Then take it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 282:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Um Salama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall I get a reward (in the Hereafter) if I spend on the children of Abu Salama and do not leave them like this and like this (i.e., poor) but treat them like my children?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, you will be rewarded for that which you will spend on them.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 283:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hind (bint &#8216;Utba) said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Abu Sufyan is a miser. Is there any harm if I take of his property what will cover me and my children&#8217;s needs?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Take (according to your needs) in a reasonable manner.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 284:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A dead man in debt used to be brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle who would ask, &#8220;Has he left anything to re pay his debts?&#8221; If he was informed that he had left something to cover his debts the Prophet would offer the funeral prayer for him; otherwise he would say to the Muslims present there), &#8220;Offer the funeral prayer for your friend:&#8221;but when Allah helped the Prophet to gain victory (on his expeditions), he said, &#8220;I am closer to the Believers than themselves, so. if one of the Believers dies in debt, I will repay it, but if he leaves wealth, it will be for his heirs.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 285:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Um Habiba:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Will you marry my sister, the daughter of Abu Sufyan.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Do you like that?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes, for I am not your only wife, and the person I like most to share the good with me, is my sister.&#8221; He said, &#8220;That is not lawful for me.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We have heard that you want to marry Durra, the daughter of Abu Salama.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You mean the daughter of Um Salama?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Even if she were not my step-daughter, she is unlawful for me, for she is my foster niece. Thuwaiba suckled me and Abu Salama. So you should not present to me your daughters and sisters.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ursa: Thuwaiba had been a slave girl whom Abu Lahab had emancipated.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ghailan bin Jarir: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked Anas, &#8220;Tell me about the name &#8216;Al-Ansar.; Did  you call yourselves by it or did Allah call you by it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Allah called  us by it.&#8221; We used to visit Anas (at Basra) and he used to narrate to us the virtues  and deeds of the Ansar, and he used to address me or a person from the tribe of Al-Azd and  say, &#8220;Your tribe did so-and-so on such-and-such a day.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 121: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The day of Bu&#8217;ath (i.e. Day of fighting between the two  tribes of the Ansar, the Aus and Khazraj) was brought about by Allah for the good of His  Apostle so that when Allah&#8217;s Apostle reached (Medina), the tribes of Medina had already  divided and their chiefs had been killed and wounded. So Allah had brought about the  battle for the good of H is Apostle in order that they (i.e. the Ansar) might embrace  Islam. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 122: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On the day of the Conquest of Mecca, when the Prophet had  given (from the booty) the Quraish, the Ansar said, &#8220;By Allah, this is indeed very  strange: While our swords are still dribbling with the blood of Quraish, our war booty are  distributed amongst them.&#8221; When this news reached the Prophet he called the Ansar and  said, &#8220;What is this news that has reached me from you?&#8221; They used not to tell  lies, so they replied, &#8220;What has reached you is true.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it  please you that the people take the booty to their homes and you take Allah&#8217;s Apostle to  your homes? If the Ansar took their way through a valley or a mountain pass, I would take  the Ansar&#8217;s valley or a mountain pass.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 123: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet or Abul-Qasim said, &#8220;If the Ansar took  their way through a valley or a mountain pass, I would take Ansar&#8217;s valley. And but for  the migration, I would have been one of the Ansar.&#8221; Abu Huraira used to say,  &#8220;The Prophet is not unjust (by saying so). May my parents be sacrificed for him, for  the Ansar sheltered and helped him,&#8221; or said a similar sentence. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 124: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sa&#8217;d&#8217;s father: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the emigrants reached Medina. Allah&#8217;s Apostle  established the bond of fraternity between &#8216;Abdur-Rahman and Sad bin Ar-Rabi. Sad said to  &#8216;Abdur-Rahman, &#8220;I am the richest of all the Ansar, so I want to divide my property  (between us), and I have two wives, so see which of the two you like and tell me, so that  I may divorce her, and when she finishes her prescribed period (i.e. &#8216;Idda) of divorce,  then marry her.&#8221; Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;May Allah bless your family and property  for you; where is your market?&#8221; So they showed him the Qainuqa&#8217; market. (He went  there and) returned with a profit in the form of dried yogurt and butter. He continued  going (to the market) till one day he came, bearing the traces of yellow scent. The  Prophet asked, &#8220;What is this (scent)?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I got married.&#8221;  The Prophet asked, &#8220;How much Mahr did you give her?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I gave  her a date-stone of gold or a gold piece equal to the weight of a date-stone.&#8221; (The  narrator, Ibrahim, is in doubt as to which is correct.) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 125: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf came to us, Allah&#8217;s Apostle  made a bond of fraternity between him and Sad bin Ar-Rabi&#8217; who was a rich man, Sad said,  &#8220;The Ansar know that I am the richest of all of them, so I will divide my property  into two parts between me and you, and I have two wives; see which of the two you like so  that I may divorce her and you can marry her after she becomes lawful to you by her  passing the prescribed period (i.e. &#8216;Idda) of divorce. &#8216;Abdur Rahman said, &#8220;May Allah  bless you your family (i.e. wives) for you.&#8221; (But &#8216;Abdur-Rahman went to the market)  and did not return on that day except with some gain of dried yogurt and butter. He went  on trading just a few days till he came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle bearing the traces of yellow  scent over his clothes. Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked him, &#8220;What is this scent?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;I have married a woman from the Ansar.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked,  &#8220;How much Mahr have you given?&#8221; He said, &#8220;A date-stone weight of gold or a  golden date-stone.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Arrange a marriage banquet even with a  sheep.&#8221; </font></p>

Let my parents be sacrificed for your sake! Please  don&#8217;t raise your head and make it visible, lest an arrow of the enemy should hit you. Let  my neck and chest be wounded instead of yours.&#8221; (On that day) I saw &#8216;Aisha, the  daughter of Abu Bakr and Um Sulaim both lifting their dresses up so that I was able to see  the ornaments of their legs, and they were carrying the water skins of their arms to pour  the water into the mouths of the thirsty people and then go back and fill them and come to  pour the water into the mouths of the people again.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Qais bin Ubad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was sitting in the Mosque of Medina, there entered  a man (Abdullah bin Salam) with signs of solemnity over his face. The people said,  &#8220;He is one of the people of Paradise.&#8221; He prayed two light Rakat and then left.  I followed him and said, &#8220;When you entered the Mosque, the people said, &#8216;He is one of  the people of Paradise.&#8217; &#8221; He said, &#8220;By Allah, one ought not say what he does  not know; and I will tell you why. In the lifetime of the Prophet I had a dream which I  narrated to him. I saw as if I were in a garden.&#8221; He then described its extension and  greenery. He added: In its center there was an iron pillar whose lower end was fixed in  the earth and the upper end was in the sky, and at its upper end there was a (ring-shaped)  hand-hold. I was told to climb it. I said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t.&#8221; &#8220;Then a servant came  to me and lifted my clothes from behind and I climbed till I reached the top (of the  pillar). Then I got hold of the hand-hold, and I was told to hold it tightly, then I woke  up and (the effect of) the hand-hold was in my hand. I narrated al I that to the Prophet  who said, &#8216;The garden is Islam, and the hand-hold is the Most Truth-worthy Hand-Hold. So  you will remain as a Muslim till you die.&#8221; The narrator added: &#8220;The man was  &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When I came to Medina. I met Abdullah bin Salam. He said,  &#8220;Will you come to me so that I may serve you with Sawiq (i.e. powdered barley) and  dates, and let you enter a (blessed) house that in which the Prophet entered?&#8221; Then  he added, &#8220;You are In a country where the practice of Riba (i.e. usury) is prevalent;  so if somebody owe you something and he sends you a present of a load of chopped straw or  a load of barley or a load of provender then do not take it, as it is Riba.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle has never refused to admit me since I  embraced Islam, and whenever he saw me, he would smile. (In another narration) Jarir bin  &#8216;Abdullah narrated: There was a house called Dhul-Khalasa in the Pre-lslamic Period and it  was also called Al-Ka&#8217;ba Al-Yamaniya or Al-Ka&#8217;ba Ash-Shamiya. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to me,  &#8220;Will you relieve me from Dhul-Khalasa?&#8221; So I left for it with 150 cavalrymen  from the tribe of Ahmas and then we destroyed it and killed whoever we found there. Then  we came to the Prophet and informed him about it. He invoked good upon us and upon the  tribe of Ahmas. </font></p>

My father!&#8221; By Allah,  they did not stop till they killed him (i.e. Hudaifa&#8217;s father). Hudhaifa said, &#8220;May  Allah forgive you!&#8221; The sub-narrator said, &#8220;By Allah, because of what Hudhaifa  said, he remained in a good state till he met Allah (i.e. died).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Aisha: I did not feel jealous of any of the wives of the  Prophet as much as I did of Khadija (although) she died before he married me, for I often  heard him mentioning her, and Allah had told him to give her the good tidings that she  would have a palace of Qasab (i.e. pipes of precious stones and pearls in Paradise), and  whenever he slaughtered a sheep, he would send her women-friends a good share of it. </font></p>

When I sometimes said to him, &#8220;(You treat Khadija in  such a way) as if there is no woman on earth except Khadija,&#8221; he would say,  &#8220;Khadija was such-and-such, and from her I had children.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: Once Hala bint Khuwailid, Khadija&#8217;s  sister, asked the permission of the Prophet to enter. On that, the Prophet remembered the  way Khadija used to ask permission, and that upset him. He said, &#8220;O Allah!  Hala!&#8221; So I became jealous and said, &#8220;What makes you remember an old woman  amongst the old women of Quraish an old woman (with a teethless mouth) of red gums who  died long ago, and in whose place Allah has given you somebody better than her?&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet met Zaid bin &#8216;Amr bin Nufail in the bottom of  (the valley of) Baldah before any Divine Inspiration came to the Prophet. A meal was  presented to the Prophet but he refused to eat from it. (Then it was presented to Zaid)  who said, &#8220;I do not eat anything which you slaughter in the name of your stone idols.  I eat none but those things on which Allah&#8217;s Name has been mentioned at the time of  slaughtering.&#8221; Zaid bin &#8216;Amr used to criticize the way Quraish used to slaughter  their animals, and used to say, &#8220;Allah has created the sheep and He has sent the  water for it from the sky, and He has grown the grass for it from the earth; yet you  slaughter it in other than the Name of Allah. He used to say so, for he rejected that  practice and considered it as something abominable. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: Zaid bin &#8216;Amr bin Nufail went to Sham,  inquiring about a true religion to follow. He met a Jewish religious scholar and asked him  about their religion. He said, &#8220;I intend to embrace your religion, so tell me some  thing about it.&#8221; The Jew said, &#8220;You will not embrace our religion unless you  receive your share of Allah&#8217;s Anger.&#8221; Zaid said, &#8220;&#8216;I do not run except from  Allah&#8217;s Anger, and I will never bear a bit of it if I have the power to avoid it. Can you  tell me of some other religion?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I do not know any other religion  except the Hanif.&#8221; Zaid enquired, &#8220;What is Hanif?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Hanif is  the religion of (the prophet) Abraham who was neither a Jew nor a Christian, and he used  to worship None but Allah (Alone)&#8221; Then Zaid went out and met a Christian religious  scholar and told him the same as before. The Christian said, &#8220;You will not embrace  our religion unless you get a share of Allah&#8217;s Curse.&#8221; Zaid replied, &#8220;I do not  run except from Allah&#8217;s Curse, and I will never bear any of Allah&#8217;s Curse and His Anger if  I have the power to avoid them. Will you tell me of some other religion?&#8221; He replied,  &#8220;I do not know any other religion except Hanif.&#8221; Zaid enquired, &#8220;What is  Hanif?&#8221; He replied, Hanif is the religion of (the prophet) Abraham who was neither a  Jew nor a Christian and he used to worship None but Allah (Alone)&#8221; When Zaid heard  their Statement about (the religion of) Abraham, he left that place, and when he came out,  he raised both his hands and said, &#8220;O Allah! I make You my Witness that I am on the  religion of Abraham.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Asma bint Abi Bakr: I saw Zaid bin Amr bin Nufail  standing with his back against the Ka&#8217;ba and saying, &#8220;O people of Quraish! By Allah,  none amongst you is on the religion of Abraham except me.&#8221; He used to preserve the  lives of little girls: If somebody wanted to kill his daughter he would say to him,  &#8220;Do not kill her for I will feed her on your behalf.&#8221; So he would take her, and  when she grew up nicely, he would say to her father, &#8220;Now if you want her, I will  give her to you, and if you wish, I will feed her on your behalf.&#8221; </font></p>

The Prophet  ordered his companions to perform &#8216;Umra (with that lhram instead of Hajj). They asked,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

So she spoke and said, &#8220;Who are  you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;A man from the Emigrants.&#8221; She asked, &#8220;Which  Emigrants?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;From Quraish.&#8221; She asked, &#8220;From what branch  of Quraish are you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;You ask too many questions; I am Abu Bakr.&#8221;  She said, &#8220;How long shall we enjoy this good order (i.e. Islamic religion) which  Allah has brought after the period of ignorance?&#8221; He said, &#8220;You will enjoy it as  long as your Imams keep on abiding by its rules and regulations.&#8221; She asked,  &#8220;What are the Imams?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Were there not heads and chiefs of your  nation who used to order the people and they used to obey them?&#8221; She said,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;So they (i.e. the Imams) are those whom I meant.&#8221; </font></p>

They (i.e. my masters) accused me of  stealing it and they tortured me to such an extent that they even looked for it in my  private parts.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The first event of Qasama in the pre-lslamic period of  ignorance was practiced by us (i.e. Banu Hashim). A man from Banu Hashim was employed by a  Quraishi man from another branch-family. The (Hashimi) laborer set out with the Quraishi  driving his camels. There passed by him another man from Banu Hashim. The leather rope of  the latter&#8217;s bag had broken so he said to the laborer, &#8220;Will you help me by giving me  a rope in order to tie the handle of my bag lest the camels should run away from me?&#8221;  The laborer gave him a rope and the latter tied his bag with it. When the caravan halted,  all the camels&#8217; legs were tied with their fetters except one camel. The employer asked the  laborer, &#8220;Why, from among all the camels has this camel not been fettered?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;There is no fetter for it.&#8221; The Quraishi asked, &#8220;Where is its  fetter?&#8221; and hit the laborer with a stick that caused his death (later on Just before  his death) a man from Yemen passed by him. The laborer asked (him), &#8220;Will you go for  the pilgrimage?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I do not think I will attend it, but perhaps I  will attend it.&#8221; The (Hashimi) laborer said, &#8220;Will you please convey a message  for me once in your life?&#8221; The other man said, &#8220;yes.&#8221; The laborer wrote:  &#8216;When you attend the pilgrimage, call the family of Quraish, and if they respond to you,  call the family of Banu Hashim, and if they respond to you, ask about Abu Talib and tell  him that so-and-so has killed me for a fetter.&#8221; Then the laborer expired. When the  employer reached (Mecca), Abu Talib visited him and asked, &#8220;What has happened to our  companion?&#8221; He said, &#8220;He became ill and I looked after him nicely (but he died)  and I buried him.&#8221; Then Abu Talib said, &#8220;The deceased deserved this from  you.&#8221; After some time, the messenger whom the laborer has asked to convey the  message, reached during the pilgrimage season. He called, &#8220;O the family of  Quraish!&#8221; The people replied, &#8220;This is Quraish.&#8221; Then he called, &#8220;O  the family of Banu Hashim!&#8221; Again the people replied, &#8220;This is Banu  Hashim.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;Who is Abu Talib?&#8221; The people replied, &#8220;This is  Abu Talib.&#8221; He said, &#8220;&#8216;So-and-so has asked me to convey a message to you that  so-and-so has killed him for a fetter (of a camel).&#8221; Then Abu Talib went to the  (Quraishi) killer and said to him, &#8220;Choose one of three alternatives: (i) If you  wish, give us one-hundred camels because you have murdered our companion, (ii) or if you  wish, fifty of your men should take an oath that you have not murdered our companion, and  if you do not accept this, (iii) we will kill you in Qisas.&#8221; The killer went to his  people and they said, &#8220;We will take an oath.&#8221; Then a woman from Banu Hashim who  was married to one of them (i.e.the Quraishis) and had given birth to a child from him,  came to Abu Talib and said, &#8220;O Abu Talib! I wish that my son from among the fifty  men, should be excused from this oath, and that he should not take the oath where the  oath-taking is carried on.&#8221; Abu Talib excused him. Then another man from them came  (to Abu Talib) and said, &#8220;O Abu Talib! You want fifty persons to take an oath instead  of giving a hundred camels, and that means each man has to give two camels (in case he  does not take an oath). So there are two camels I would like you to accept from me and  excuse me from taking an oath where the oaths are taken. Abu Talib accepted them from him.  Then 48 men came and took the oath. Ibn &#8216;Abbas further said:) By Him in Whose Hand my life  is, before the end of that year, none of those 48 persons remained alive. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah caused the day of Buath to take place before Allah&#8217;s  Apostle was sent (as an Apostle) so that when Allah&#8217;s Apostle reached Medina, those people  had already divided (in different groups) and their chiefs had been killed or wounded. So  Allah made that day precede Allah&#8217;s Apostle so that they (i.e. the Ansar) might embrace  Islam. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: To run along the valley between two  green pillars of Safa and Marwa (mountains) was not Sunna, but the people in the  pre-islamic period of ignorance used to run along it, and used to say: &#8220;We do not  cross this rain stream except running strongly. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I came to the Prophet while he was leaning against his  sheet cloak in the shade of the Ka&#8217;ba. We were suffering greatly from the pagans in those  days. i said (to him). &#8220;Will you invoke Allah (to help us)?&#8221; He sat down with a  red face and said, &#8220;(A believer among) those who were before you used to be combed  with iron combs so that nothing of his flesh or nerves would remain on his bones; yet that  would never make him desert his religion. A saw might be put over the parting of his head  which would be split into two parts, yet all that would never make him abandon his  religion. Allah will surely complete this religion (i.e. Islam) so that a traveler from  Sana to Hadra-maut will not be afraid of anybody except Allah.&#8221; (The sub-narrator,  Baiyan added, &#8220;Or the wolf, lest it should harm his sheep.&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While the Prophet was prostrating, surrounded by some of  Quraish, &#8216;Uqba bin Abi Mu&#8217;ait brought the intestines (i.e. abdominal contents) of a camel  and put them over the back of the Prophet. The Prophet did not raise his head, (till)  Fatima, came and took it off his back and cursed the one who had done the harm. The  Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah! Destroy the chiefs of Quraish, Abu Jahl bin Hisham, &#8216;Utba bin  Rabi&#8217;al, Shaba bin Rabi&#8217;a, Umaiya bin Khalaf or Ubai bin Khalaf.&#8221; (The sub-narrator  Shu&#8217;ba, is not sure of the last name.) I saw these people killed on the day of Badr battle  and thrown in the well except Umaiya or Ubai whose body parts were mutilated but he was  not thrown in the well. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Said bin Jubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;AbdurRahman bin Abza said, &#8220;Ask Ibn &#8216;Abbas about  these two Qur&#8217;anic Verses: &#8216;Nor kill such life as Allah has made sacred, Except for just  cause.&#8217; (25.168) &#8220;And whoever kills a believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell.  (4.93) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So I asked Ibn &#8216;Abbas who said, &#8220;When the Verse that  is in Sura-al-Furqan was revealed, the pagans of Mecca said, &#8216;But we have slain such life  as Allah has made sacred, and we have invoked other gods along with Allah, and we have  also committed fornication.&#8217; So Allah revealed:&#8211; &#8216;Except those who repent, believe, and  do good&#8211; (25.70) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So this Verse was concerned with those people. As for the  Verse in Surat-an-Nisa (4-93), it means that if a man, after understanding Islam and its  laws and obligations, murders somebody, then his punishment is to dwell in the (Hell) Fire  forever.&#8221; Then I mentioned this to Mujahid who said, &#8220;Except the one who regrets  (one&#8217;s crime) . &#8221; </font></p>

Abu Bakr came and caught him by his shoulder and pushed  him away from the Prophet and said, &#8220;Do you want to kill a man just because he says,  &#8216;My Lord is Allah?&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

When he finished, I walked with him and asked, &#8220;What about the bone  and the animal dung?&#8221; He said, &#8220;They are of the food of Jinns. The delegate of  Jinns of (the city of) Nasibin came to me&#8211;and how nice those Jinns were&#8211;and asked me for  the remains of the human food. I invoked Allah for them that they would never pass by a  bone or animal dung but find food on them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Abu Dhar received the news of the Advent of the  Prophet he said to his brother, &#8220;Ride to this valley (of Mecca) and try to find out  the truth of the person who claims to be a prophet who is informed of the news of Heaven.  Listen to what he says and come back to me.&#8221; So his brother set out and came to the  Prophet and listened to some of his talks, and returned to Abu Dhar and said to him.  &#8220;I have seen him enjoining virtuous behavior and saying something that is not  poetry.&#8221; Abu Dhar said, &#8220;You have not satisfied me as to what I wanted.&#8221; He  then took his journey-food and carried a water-skin of his, containing some water till be  reached Mecca. He went to the Mosque and searched for the Prophet and though he did not  know him, he hated to ask anybody about him. When a part of the night had passed away,  &#8216;Ali saw him and knew that he was a stranger. So when Abu Dhar saw &#8216;Ali, he followed him,  and none of them asked his companion about anything, and when it was dawn, Abu Dhar took  his journey food and his water-skin to the Mosque and stayed there all the day long  without being perceived by the Prophet, and when it was evening, he came back to his  retiring place. &#8216;Ali passed by him and said, &#8220;Has the man not known his dwelling  place yet?&#8221; So &#8216;Ali awakened him and took him with him and none of them spoke to the  other about anything. When it was the third day. &#8216;Ali did the same and Abu Dhar stayed  with him. Then &#8216;Ali said &#8220;Will you tell me what has brought you here?&#8221; Abu Dhar  said, &#8220;If you give me a firm promise that you will guide me, then I will tell  you.&#8221; &#8216;Ali promised him, and he informed &#8216;Ali about the matter. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;It  is true, and he is the Apostle of Allah. Next morning when you get up, accompany me, and  if I see any danger for you, I will stop as if to pass water, but if I go on, follow me  and enter the place which I will enter.&#8221; Abu Dhar did so, and followed &#8216;Ali till he  entered the place of the Prophet, and Abu Dhar went in with him, Abu Dhar listened to some  of the Prophet&#8217;s talks and embraced Islam on the spot. The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Go  back to your people and inform them (about it) till you receive my order.&#8221; Abu Dhar  said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my life is, I will proclaim my conversion loudly amongst  them (i.e. the pagans).&#8221; So he went out, and when he reached the Mosque, he said as  loudly as possible, &#8220;I bear witness that None has the right to be worshipped except  Allah, and Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah.&#8221; The People got up and beat him  painfully. Then Al-Abbas came and knelt over him ((to protect him) and said (to the  people), &#8220;Woe to you! Don&#8217;t you know that this man belongs to the tribe of Ghifar and  your trade to Sha&#8217;m is through their way?&#8221; So he rescued him from them. Abu Dhar  again did the same the next day. They beat him and took vengeance on him and again  Al-Abbas knelt over him (to protect him). </font></p>

Call the man  to me.&#8221; When the man was called to him, he told him of his thought.

An  (unseen) creature shouted at him, and I have never heard harsher than his voice. He was  crying, &#8216;O you bold evil-doer! A matter of success! An eloquent man is saying: None has  the right to be worshipped except you (O Allah).&#8217; On that the people fled, but I said, &#8216;I  shall not go away till I know what is behind this.&#8217; Then the cry came again: &#8216;O you bold  evil-doer! A matter of success! An eloquent man is saying: None has the right to be  worshipped except Allah.&#8217; I then went away and a few days later it was said, &#8220;A  prophet has appeared.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ubaidullah bin &#8216;Adi bin Al-Khiyar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad  bin &#8216;Abu Yaghuth had said to him, &#8220;What prevents you from speaking to your uncle  &#8216;Uthman regarding his brother Al-Walid bin &#8216;Uqba?&#8221; The people were speaking against  the latter for what he had done. &#8216;Ubaidullah said, &#8220;So I kept waiting for &#8216;Uthman,  and when he went out for the prayer, I said to him, &#8216;I have got something to say to you as  a piece of advice.&#8217; &#8216;Uthman said, &#8216;O man! I seek Refuge with Allah from you. So I went  away. When I finished my prayer, I sat with Al-Miswar and Ibn &#8216;Abu Yaghuth and talked to  both of them of what I had said to &#8216;Uthman and what he had said to me. They said, &#8216;You  have done your duty.&#8217; So while I was sitting with them. &#8216;Uthman&#8217;s Messenger came to me.  They said, &#8216;Allah has put you to trial.&#8221; I set out and when I reached &#8216;Uthman, he  said, &#8216;What is your advice which you mentioned a while ago?&#8217; I recited Tashahhud and  added, &#8216;Allah has sent Muhammad and has revealed the Holy Book (i.e. Quran) to him. You (O  Uthman!) were amongst those who responded to the call of Allah and His Apostle and had  faith in him. And you took part in the first two migrations (to Ethiopia and to Medina),  and you enjoyed the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and learned his traditions and advice. Now  the people are talking much about Al-Walid bin &#8216;Uqba and so it is your duty to impose on  him the legal punishment.&#8217; &#8216;Uthman then said to me, &#8216;O my nephew! Did you ever meet  Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8217; I said, &#8216;No, but his knowledge has reached me as it has reached the  virgin in her seclusion.&#8217; &#8216;Uthman then recited Tashahhud and said, &#8216;No doubt, Allah has  sent Muhammad with the Truth and has revealed to him His Holy Book (i.e. Quran) and I was  amongst those who responded to the call of Allah and His Apostle and I had faith in  Muhammad&#8217;s Mission, and I had performed the first two migrations as you have said, and I  enjoyed the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and gave the pledge of allegiance to him. By Allah,  I never disobeyed him and never cheated him till Allah caused him to die. Then Allah made  Abu Bakr Caliph, and by Allah, I was never disobedient to him, nor did I cheat him. Then  &#8216;Umar became Caliph, and by Allah, I was never disobedient to him, nor did I cheat him.  Then I became Caliph. Have I not then the same rights over you as they had over me?&#8217; I  replied in the affirmative. &#8216;Uthman further said, &#8216;The what are these talks which are  reaching me from you? As for what you ha mentioned about Al-Walid bin &#8216;Uqb; Allah willing,  I shall give him the leg; punishment justly. Then Uthman ordered that Al-Walid be flogged  fort lashes. He ordered &#8216;Ali to flog him an he himself flogged him as well.&#8221; </font></p>

We used to greet you in the past and you used to reply to  us.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Verily The Mind is occupied and busy with more important matter  during the prayer.&#8221; (So one cannot return One&#8217;s greetings.) </font></p>

Say: None  has the right to be worshipped except Allah, an expression I will defend your case with,  before Allah.&#8221; Abu Jahl and &#8216;Abdullah bin Umaya said, &#8220;O Abu Talib! Will you  leave the religion of &#8216;Abdul Muttalib?&#8221; So they kept on saying this to him so that  the last statement he said to them (before he died) was: &#8220;I am on the religion of  &#8216;Abdul Muttalib.&#8221; Then the Prophet said, &#8221; I will keep on asking for Allah&#8217;s  Forgiveness for you unless I am forbidden to do so.&#8221; Then the following Verse was  revealed:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;It is not fitting for the Prophet and the believers  to ask Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness for the pagans, even if they were their near relatives, after  it has become clear to them that they are the dwellers of the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; (9.113) </font></p>

Then a gold tray of Belief was brought to me and my heart  was washed and was filled (with Belief) and then returned to its original place. Then a  white animal which was smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey was brought to  me.&#8221; (On this Al-Jarud asked, &#8220;Was it the Buraq, O Abu Hamza?&#8221; I (i.e.  Anas) replied in the affirmative). The Prophet said, &#8220;The animal&#8217;s step (was so wide  that it) reached the farthest point within the reach of the animal&#8217;s sight. I was carried  on it, and Gabriel set out with me till we reached the nearest heaven. </font></p>

This is Aaron; pay him your greetings.&#8217; I greeted him and  he returned the greeting to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious  Prophet.&#8217; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the sixth heaven and asked for its gate to be  opened. It was asked. &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Who is  accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217;  Gabriel replied in the affirmative.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When I went (over the sixth heaven), there I saw Moses.  Gabriel said (to me),&#8217; This is Moses; pay him your greeting. So I greeted him and he  returned the greetings to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious  Prophet.&#8217; When I left him (i.e. Moses) he wept. Someone asked him, &#8216;What makes you weep?&#8217;  Moses said, &#8216;I weep because after me there has been sent (as Prophet) a young man whose  followers will enter Paradise in greater numbers than my followers.&#8217; Then Gabriel ascended  with me to the seventh heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, &#8216;Who is  it?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was asked,&#8217; Who is accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel replied,  &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217; Gabriel replied in the affirmative.

Its fruits were like the jars of Hajr (i.e. a place near  Medina) and its leaves were as big as the ears of elephants. Gabriel said, &#8216;This is the  Lote Tree of the utmost boundary) . Behold ! There ran four rivers, two were hidden and  two were visible, I asked, &#8216;What are these two kinds of rivers, O Gabriel?&#8217; He replied,&#8217;  As for the hidden rivers, they are two rivers in Paradise and the visible rivers are the  Nile and the Euphrates.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Al-Bait-ul-Ma&#8217;mur (i.e. the Sacred House) was shown to  me and a container full of wine and another full of milk and a third full of honey were  brought to me. I took the milk. Gabriel remarked, &#8216;This is the Islamic religion which you  and your followers are following.&#8217; Then the prayers were enjoined on me: They were fifty  prayers a day. When I returned, I passed by Moses who asked (me), &#8216;What have you been  ordered to do?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;I have been ordered to offer fifty prayers a day.&#8217; Moses said,  &#8216;Your followers cannot bear fifty prayers a day, and by Allah, I have tested people before  you, and I have tried my level best with Bani Israel (in vain). Go back to your Lord and  ask for reduction to lessen your followers&#8217; burden.&#8217; So I went back, and Allah reduced ten  prayers for me. Then again I came to Moses, but he repeated the same as he had said  before. Then again I went back to Allah and He reduced ten more prayers. When I came back  to Moses he said the same, I went back to Allah and He ordered me to observe ten prayers a  day. When I came back to Moses, he repeated the same advice, so I went back to Allah and  was ordered to observe five prayers a day. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When I came back to Moses, he said, &#8216;What have you been  ordered?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;I have been ordered to observe five prayers a day.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Your  followers cannot bear five prayers a day, and no doubt, I have got an experience of the  people before you, and I have tried my level best with Bani Israel, so go back to your  Lord and ask for reduction to lessen your follower&#8217;s burden.&#8217; I said, &#8216;I have requested so  much of my Lord that I feel ashamed, but I am satisfied now and surrender to Allah&#8217;s  Order.&#8217; When I left, I heard a voice saying, &#8216;I have passed My Order and have lessened the  burden of My Worshipers.&#8221; </font></p>

She called me, and I went to her, not  knowing what she wanted to do to me. She caught me by the hand and made me stand at the  door of the house. I was breathless then, and when my breathing became Allright, she took  some water and rubbed my face and head with it. Then she took me into the house. There in  the house I saw some Ansari women who said, &#8220;Best wishes and Allah&#8217;s Blessing and a  good luck.&#8221; Then she entrusted me to them and they prepared me (for the marriage).  Unexpectedly Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me in the forenoon and my mother handed me over to  him, and at that time I was a girl of nine years of age. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered us to cover his head and put  some Idhkhir (i.e. a special kind of grass) on his feet. (On the other hand) some of us  have had their fruits ripened (in this world) and they are collecting them.&#8221; </font></p>

Today Allah has made Islam triumphant, and  today a believer can worship his Lord wherever he likes.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sat on the pulpit and said, &#8220;Allah has  given one of His Slaves the choice of receiving the splendor and luxury of the worldly  life whatever he likes or to accept the good (of the Hereafter) which is with Allah. So he  has chosen that good which is with Allah.&#8221; On that Abu Bakr wept and said, &#8220;Our  fathers and mothers be sacrificed for you.&#8221; We became astonished at this. The people  said, &#8220;Look at this old man! Allah&#8217;s Apostle talks about a Slave of Allah to whom He  has given the option to choose either the splendor of this worldly life or the good which  is with Him, while he says. &#8216;our fathers and mothers be sacrifice(i for you.&#8221; But it  was Allah&#8217;s Apostle who had been given option, and Abu Bakr knew it better than we.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle added, &#8220;No doubt, I am indebted to Abu Bakr more than to anybody else  regarding both his companionship and his wealth. And if I had to take a Khalil from my  followers, I would certainly have taken Abu Bakr, but the fraternity of Islam is.  sufficient. Let no door (i.e. Khoukha) of the Mosque remain open, except the door of Abu  Bakr.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="005.058.245"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 245: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the wife of the Prophet) I never remembered my parents  believing in any religion other than the true religion (i.e. Islam), and (I don&#8217;t  remember) a single day passing without our being visited by Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the morning  and in the evening. When the Muslims were put to test (i.e. troubled by the pagans), Abu  Bakr set out migrating to the land of Ethiopia, and when he reached Bark-al-Ghimad, Ibn  Ad-Daghina, the chief of the tribe of Qara, met him and said, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! Where are  you going?&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;My people have turned me out (of my country), so  I want to wander on the earth and worship my Lord.&#8221; Ibn Ad-Daghina said, &#8220;O Abu  Bakr! A man like you should not leave his home-land, nor should he be driven out, because  you help the destitute, earn their livings, and you keep good relations with your Kith and  kin, help the weak and poor, entertain guests generously, and help the calamity-stricken  persons. Therefore I am your protector. Go back and worship your Lord in your town.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So Abu Bakr returned and Ibn Ad-Daghina accompanied him. In  the evening Ibn Ad-Daghina visited the nobles of Quraish and said to them. &#8220;A man  like Abu Bakr should not leave his homeland, nor should he be driven out. Do you (i.e.  Quraish) drive out a man who helps the destitute, earns their living, keeps good relations  with his Kith and kin, helps the weak and poor, entertains guests generously and helps the  calamity-stricken persons?&#8221; So the people of Quraish could not refuse Ibn  Ad-Daghina&#8217;s protection, and they said to Ibn Ad-Daghina, &#8220;Let Abu Bakr worship his  Lord in his house. He can pray and recite there whatever he likes, but he should not hurt  us with it, and should not do it publicly, because we are afraid that he may affect our  women and children.&#8221; Ibn Ad-Daghina told Abu Bakr of all that. Abu Bakr stayed in  that state, worshipping his Lord in his house. He did not pray publicly, nor did he recite  Quran outside his house. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then a thought occurred to Abu Bakr to build a mosque in  front of his house, and there he used to pray and recite the Quran. The women and children  of the pagans began to gather around him in great number. They used to wonder at him and  look at him. Abu Bakr was a man who used to weep too much, and he could not help weeping  on reciting the Quran. That situation scared the nobles of the pagans of Quraish, so they  sent for Ibn Ad-Daghina. When he came to them, they said, &#8220;We accepted your  protection of Abu Bakr on condition that he should worship his Lord in his house, but he  has violated the conditions and he has built a mosque in front of his house where he prays  and recites the Quran publicly. We are now afraid that he may affect our women and  children unfavorably. So, prevent him from that. If he likes to confine the worship of his  Lord to his house, he may do so, but if he insists on doing that openly, ask him to  release you from your obligation to protect him, for we dislike to break our pact with  you, but we deny Abu Bakr the right to announce his act publicly.&#8221; Ibn Ad-Daghina  went to Abu- Bakr and said, (&#8220;O Abu Bakr!) You know well what contract I have made on  your behalf; now, you are either to abide by it, or else release me from my obligation of  protecting you, because I do not want the &#8216;Arabs hear that my people have dishonored a  contract I have made on behalf of another man.&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;I release you  from your pact to protect me, and am pleased with the protection from Allah.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>At that time the Prophet was in Mecca, and he said to the  Muslims, &#8220;In a dream I have been shown your migration place, a land of date palm  trees, between two mountains, the two stony tracts.&#8221; So, some people migrated to  Medina, and most of those people who had previously migrated to the land of Ethiopia,  returned to Medina. Abu Bakr also prepared to leave for Medina, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle said  to him, &#8220;Wait for a while, because I hope that I will be allowed to migrate  also.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Do you indeed expect this? Let my father be sacrificed  for you!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; So Abu Bakr did not migrate for the sake  of Allah&#8217;s Apostle in order to accompany him. He fed two she-camels he possessed with the  leaves of As-Samur tree that fell on being struck by a stick for four months. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>One day, while we were sitting in Abu Bakr&#8217;s house at noon,  someone said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;This is Allah&#8217;s Apostle with his head covered coming at a  time at which he never used to visit us before.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;May my parents  be sacrificed for him. By Allah, he has not come at this hour except for a great  necessity.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle came and asked permission to enter, and he was allowed  to enter. When he entered, he said to Abu Bakr. &#8220;Tell everyone who is present with  you to go away.&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;There are none but your family. May my  father be sacrificed for you, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;i have been  given permission to migrate.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Shall I accompany you? May my  father be sacrificed for you, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! May my father be sacrificed for  you, take one of these two she-camels of mine.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;(I  will accept it) with payment.&#8221; So we prepared the baggage quickly and put some  journey food in a leather bag for them. Asma, Abu Bakr&#8217;s daughter, cut a piece from her  waist belt and tied the mouth of the leather bag with it, and for that reason she was  named Dhat-un-Nitaqain (i.e. the owner of two belts). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr reached a cave on the  mountain of Thaur and stayed there for three nights. &#8216;Abdullah bin Abi Bakr who was  intelligent and a sagacious youth, used to stay (with them) aver night. He used to leave  them before day break so that in the morning he would be with Quraish as if he had spent  the night in Mecca. He would keep in mind any plot made against them, and when it became  dark he would (go and) inform them of it. &#8216;Amir bin Fuhaira, the freed slave of Abu Bakr,  used to bring the milch sheep (of his master, Abu Bakr) to them a little while after  nightfall in order to rest the sheep there. So they always had fresh milk at night, the  milk of their sheep, and the milk which they warmed by throwing heated stones in it. &#8216;Amir  bin Fuhaira would then call the herd away when it was still dark (before daybreak). He did  the same in each of those three nights. Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr had hired a man from  the tribe of Bani Ad-Dail from the family of Bani Abd bin Adi as an expert guide, and he  was in alliance with the family of Al-&#8216;As bin Wail As-Sahmi and he was on the religion of  the infidels of Quraish. The Prophet and Abu Bakr trusted him and gave him their two  she-camels and took his promise to bring their two she camels to the cave of the mountain  of Thaur in the morning after three nights later. And (when they set out), &#8216;Amir bin  Fuhaira and the guide went along with them and the guide led them along the sea-shore. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The nephew of Suraqa bin Ju&#8217;sham said that his father  informed him that he heard Suraqa bin Ju&#8217;sham saying, &#8220;The messengers of the heathens  of Quraish came to us declaring that they had assigned for the persons why would kill or  arrest Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr, a reward equal to their bloodmoney. While I was  sitting in one of the gatherings of my tribe. Bani Mudlij, a man from them came to us and  stood up while we were sitting, and said, &#8220;O Suraqa! No doubt, I have just seen some  people far away on the seashore, and I think they are Muhammad and his companions.&#8221;  Suraqa added, &#8220;I too realized that it must have been they. But I said &#8216;No, it is not  they, but you have seen so-and-so, and so-and-so whom we saw set out.&#8217; I stayed in the  gathering for a while and then got up and left for my home. and ordered my slave-girl to  get my horse which was behind a hillock, and keep it ready for me. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then I took my spear and left by the back door of my house  dragging the lower end of the spear on the ground and keeping it low. Then I reached my  horse, mounted it and made it gallop. When I approached them (i.e. Muhammad and Abu Bakr),  my horse stumbled and I fell down from it, Then I stood up, got hold of my quiver and took  out the divining arrows and drew lots as to whether I should harm them (i.e. the Prophet  and Abu Bakr) or not, and the lot which I disliked came out. But I remounted my horse and  let it gallop, giving no importance to the divining arrows. When I heard the recitation of  the Quran by Allah&#8217;s Apostle who did not look hither and thither while Abu Bakr was doing  it often, suddenly the forelegs of my horse sank into the ground up to the knees, and I  fell down from it. Then I rebuked it and it got up but could hardly take out its forelegs  from the ground, and when it stood up straight again, its fore-legs caused dust to rise up  in the sky like smoke. Then again I drew lots with the divining arrows, and the lot which  I disliked, came out. So I called upon them to feel secure. They stopped, and I remounted  my horse and went to them. When I saw how I had been hampered from harming them, it came  to my mind that the cause of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (i.e. Islam) will become victorious. So I  said to him, &#8220;Your people have assigned a reward equal to the bloodmoney for your  head.&#8221; Then I told them all the plans the people of Mecca had made concerning them.  Then I offered them some journey food and goods but they refused to take anything and did  not ask for anything, but the Prophet said, &#8220;Do not tell others about us.&#8221; Then  I requested him to write for me a statement of security and peace. He ordered &#8216;Amr bin  Fuhaira who wrote it for me on a parchment, and then Allah&#8217;s Apostle proceeded on his way.  </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Urwa bin Az-Zubair: Allah&#8217;s Apostle met Az-Zubair  in a caravan of Muslim merchants who were returning from Sham. Az-Zubair provided Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and Abu Bakr with white clothes to wear. When the Muslims of Medina heard the news  of the departure of Allah&#8217;s Apostle from Mecca (towards Medina), they started going to the  Harra every morning . They would wait for him till the heat of the noon forced them to  return. One day, after waiting for a long while, they returned home, and when they went  into their houses, a Jew climbed up the roof of one of the forts of his people to look for  some thing, and he saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his companions dressed in white clothes,  emerging out of the desert mirage. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Jew could not help shouting at the top of his voice,  &#8220;O you &#8216;Arabs! Here is your great man whom you have been waiting for!&#8221; So all  the Muslims rushed to their arms and received Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the summit of Harra. The  Prophet turned with them to the right and alighted at the quarters of Bani &#8216;Amr bin &#8216;Auf,  and this was on Monday in the month of Rabi-ul-Awal. Abu Bakr stood up, receiving the  people while Allah&#8217;s Apostle sat down and kept silent. Some of the Ansar who came and had  not seen Allah&#8217;s Apostle before, began greeting Abu Bakr, but when the sunshine fell on  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr came forward and shaded him with his sheet only then the  people came to know Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Allah&#8217;s Apostle stayed with Bani &#8216;Amr bin &#8216;Auf for  ten nights and established the mosque (mosque of Quba) which was founded on piety. Allah&#8217;s  Apostle prayed in it and then mounted his she-camel and proceeded on, accompanied by the  people till his she-camel knelt down at (the place of) the Mosque of Allah&#8217;s Apostle at  Medina. Some Muslims used to pray there in those days, and that place was a yard for  drying dates belonging to Suhail and Sahl, the orphan boys who were under the guardianship  of &#8216;Asad bin Zurara. When his she-camel knelt down, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;This  place, Allah willing, will be our abiding place.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then called the two  boys and told them to suggest a price for that yard so that he might take it as a mosque.  The two boys said, &#8220;No, but we will give it as a gift, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Apostle then built a mosque there. The Prophet himself started carrying unburnt  bricks for its building and while doing so, he was saying &#8220;This load is better than  the load of Khaibar, for it is more pious in the Sight of Allah and purer and better  rewardable.&#8221; He was also saying, &#8220;O Allah! The actual reward is the reward in  the Hereafter, so bestow Your Mercy on the Ansar and the Emigrants.&#8221; Thus the Prophet  recited (by way of proverb) the poem of some Muslim poet whose name is unknown to me. </font></p>

Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle felt  thirsty and he passed by a shepherd. Abu Bakr said, &#8220;I took a bowl and milked a  little milk in it and brought it to the Prophet and he drank till I was pleased.&#8221; </font></p>

The  Prophet asked for a date, chewed it, and put some of its juice in the child&#8217;s mouth. So,  the first thing that entered the child&#8217;s stomach was the saliva of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Then  the Prophet rubbed the child&#8217;s palate with a date and invoked for Allah&#8217;s Blessings on  him, and he was the first child born amongst the Emigrants in the Islamic Land (i.e.  Medina). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle arrived at Medina with Abu Bakr, riding  behind him on the same camel. Abu Bakr was an elderly man known to the people, while  Allah&#8217;s Apostle was a youth that was unknown. Thus, if a man met Abu Bakr, he would day,  &#8220;O Abu Bakr! Who is this man in front of you?&#8221; Abu Bakr would say, &#8220;This  man shows me the Way,&#8221; One would think that Abu Bakr meant the road, while in fact,  Abu Bakr meant the way of virtue and good. Then Abu Bakr looked behind and saw a  horse-rider persuing them. He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! This is a horse-rider  persuing us.&#8221; The Prophet looked behind and said, &#8220;O Allah! Cause him to fall  down.&#8221; So the horse threw him down and got up neighing. After that the rider, Suraqa  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! Order me whatever you want.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Stay where you are and do not allow anybody to reach us.&#8221; So, in the first part  of the day Suraqa was an enemy of Allah&#8217;s Prophet and in the last part of it, he was a  protector. Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle alighted by the side of the Al-Harra and sent a message to  the Ansar, and they came to Allah&#8217;s Prophet and Abu Bakr, and having greeted them, they  said, &#8220;Ride (your she-camels) safe and obeyed.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr  rode and the Ansar, carrying their arms, surrounded them. The news that Allah&#8217;s Prophet  had come circulated in Medina. The people came out and were eagerly looking and saying  &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Prophet has come! Allah&#8217;s Prophet has come! So the Prophet went on till he  alighted near the house of Abu Aiyub. While the Prophet was speaking with the family  members of Abu Aiyub, &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam heard the news of his arrival while he himself  was picking the dates for his family from his family garden. He hurried to the Prophet  carrying the dates which he had collected for his family from the garden. He listened to  Allah&#8217;s Prophet and then went home. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Allah&#8217;s Prophet said, &#8220;Which is the nearest of  the houses of our Kith and kin?&#8221; Abu Aiyub replied, &#8220;Mine, O Allah&#8217;s Prophet!  This is my house and this is my gate.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Go and prepare a place  for our midday rest.&#8221; Abu Aiyub said, &#8220;Get up (both of you) with Allah&#8217;s  Blessings.&#8221; So when Allah&#8217;s Prophet went into the house, &#8216;Abdullah bin Salaim came  and said &#8220;I testify that you (i.e. Muhammad) are Apostle of Allah and that you have  come with the Truth. The Jews know well that I am their chief and the son of their chief  and the most learned amongst them and the son of the most learned amongst them. So send  for them (i.e. Jews) and ask them about me before they know that I have embraced Islam,  for if they know that they will say about me things which are not correct.&#8221; So  Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent for them, and they came and entered. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to them,  &#8220;O (the group of) Jews! Woe to you: be afraid of Allah. By Allah except Whom none has  the right to be worshipped, you people know for certain, that I am Apostle of Allah and  that I have come to you with the Truth, so embrace Islam.&#8221; The Jews replied, &#8220;We  do not know this.&#8221; So they said this to the Prophet and he repeated it thrice. Then  he said, &#8220;What sort of a man is &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam amongst you?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;He is our chief and the son of our chief and the most learned man, and the son of  the most learned amongst us.&#8221; He said, &#8220;What would you think if he should  embrace Islam?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Allah forbid! He can not embrace Islam.&#8221; He  said, &#8221; What would you think if he should embrace Islam?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Allah  forbid! He can not embrace Islam.&#8221; He said, &#8220;What would you think if he should  embrace Islam?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Allah forbid! He can not embrace Islam.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;O Ibn Salaim! Come out to them.&#8221; He came out and said, &#8220;O (the group  of) Jews! 8e afraid of Allah except Whom none has the right to be worshipped. You know for  certain that he is Apostle of Allah and that he has brought a True Religion!&#8217; They said,  &#8220;You tell a lie.&#8221; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle turned them out. </font></p>

Some of us passed away without  eating anything of their rewards in this world. One of these was Mus&#8217;ab bin &#8216;Umar who was  martyred on the day of the battle of Uhud. We did not find anything to shroud his body  with except a striped cloak. When we covered his head with it, his feet remained  uncovered, and when we covered his feet with it, his head remained uncovered. So Allah&#8217;s  Apostle ordered us to cover his head with it and put some Idhkhir (i.e. a kind of grass)  over his feet. And there are some amongst us whose fruits have ripened and they are  collecting them (i.e. they have received their rewards in this world). </font></p>

Then &#8216;Umar sent me again (to the Prophet ) and said, &#8216;Go and see whether he is awake.&#8217; I  went to him and entered his place and gave him the pledge of allegiance.

Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Close observers were appointed by our  enemies to watch us. So we went out at night and travelled throughout the night and the  following day till it was noon, then we perceived a rock and went towards it, and there  was some shade under it. I spread a cloak I had with me for Allah&#8217;s Apostle and then the  Prophet layed on it. I went out to guard him and all of a sudden I saw a shepherd coming  with his sheep looking for the same, the shade of the rock as we did, I asked him, &#8216;O boy,  to whom do you belong?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;I belong to so-and-so.&#8217; I asked him, &#8216;Is there some  milk in your sheep?&#8217; He replied in the affirmative. I asked him, &#8216;Will you milk?&#8217; He  replied in the affirmative. Then he got hold of one of his sheep. I said to him, &#8216;Remove  the dust from its udder.&#8217; Then he milked a little milk. I had a water-skin with me which  was tied with a piece of cloth. I had prepared the water-skin for Allah&#8217;s Apostle . So I  poured some water over the milk (container) till its bottom became cold. Then I brought  the milk to the Prophet and said, &#8216;Drink, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle drank till I  became pleased. Then we departed and the pursuers were following us.&#8221; Al-Bara added:  I then went with Abu Bakr into his home (carrying that saddle) and there I saw his  daughter &#8216;Aisha Lying in a bed because of heavy fever and I saw her father Abu Bakr  kissing her cheek and saying, &#8220;How are you, little daughter?&#8221; </font></p>

He said, &#8220;O Allah, make us love Medina as much as or more than we used to love Mecca,  O Allah, make it healthy and bless its Sa&#8217; and Mud (i.e. measures), and take away its  fever to Al-Juhfa.&#8221; </font></p>

The season of Hajj is the season when there comes the scum of the  people (besides the good amongst them), so I recommend that you should wait till you go  back to Medina, for it is the place of Migration and Sunna (i.e. the Prophet&#8217;s tradition),  and there you will be able to refer the matter to the religious scholars and the nobles  and the people of wise opinions.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I will speak of it in Medina on  my very first sermon I will deliver there.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>An Ansari woman who gave the pledge of allegiance to the  Prophet that the Ansar drew lots concerning the dwelling of the Emigrants. &#8216;Uthman bin  Maz&#8217;un was decided to dwell with them (i.e. Um al-&#8216;Ala&#8217;s family), &#8216;Uthman fell ill and I  nursed him till he died, and we covered him with his clothes. Then the Prophet came to us  and I (addressing the dead body) said, &#8220;O Abu As-Sa&#8217;ib, may Allah&#8217;s Mercy be on you!  I bear witness that Allah has honored you.&#8221; On that the Prophet said, &#8220;How do  you know that Allah has honored him?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I do not know. May my father  and my mother be sacrificed for you, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! But who else is worthy of it (if  not &#8216;Uthman)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;As to him, by Allah, death has overtaken him, and I  hope the best for him. By Allah, though I am the Apostle of Allah, yet I do not know what  Allah will do to me,&#8221; By Allah, I will never assert the piety of anyone after him.  That made me sad, and when I slept I saw in a dream a flowing stream for &#8216;Uthman bin  Maz&#8217;un. I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and told him of it. He remarked, &#8220;That symbolizes  his (good) deeds.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The day of Bu&#8217;ath was a day (i.e. battle) which Allah  caused to take place just before the mission of His Apostle so that when Allah&#8217;s Apostle  came to Medina, they (the tribes) had divided (into hostile groups) and their nobles had  been killed; and all that facilitated their conversion to Islam. </font></p>

Abu Bakr said twice. &#8220;Musical  instrument of Satan!&#8221; But the Prophet said, &#8220;Leave them Abu Bakr, for every  nation has an &#8216;Id (i.e. festival) and this day is our &#8216;Id.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah&#8217;s Apostle arrived at Medina, he alighted at the  upper part of Medina among the people called Bani &#8216;Amr bin &#8216;Auf and he stayed with them  for fourteen nights. Then he sent for the chiefs of Bani An-Najjar, and they came,  carrying their swords. As if I am just now looking at Allah&#8217;s Apostle on his she-camel  with Abu Bakr riding behind him (on the same camel) and the chiefs of Bani An-Najjar  around him till he dismounted in the courtyard of Abu Aiyub&#8217;s home. The Prophet used to  offer the prayer wherever the prayer was due, and he would pray even in sheepfolds. Then  he ordered that the mosque be built. He sent for the chiefs of Banu An-Najjar, and when  they came, he said, &#8220;O Banu An-Najjar! Suggest to me the price of this garden of  yours.&#8221; They replied &#8220;No! By Allah, we do not demand its price except from  Allah.&#8221; In that garden there were the (following) things that I will tell you: Graves  of pagans, unleveled land with holes and pits etc., and date-palm trees. Allah&#8217;s Apostle  ordered that the graves of the pagans be dug up and, the unleveled land be leveled and the  date-palm trees be cut down. The trunks of the trees were arranged so as to form the wall  facing the Qibla. The Stone pillars were built at the sides of its gate. The companions of  the Prophet were carrying the stones and reciting some lyrics, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle . . was  with them and they were saying, &#8220;O Allah! There is no good Excel the good of the  Hereafter, so bestow victory on the Ansar and the Emigrants. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the year of Hajjat-ul-Wada&#8217; the Prophet visited me when  I fell ill and was about to die because of that illness. I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  I am very ill as you see, and I am a rich man and have no heir except my only daughter.  Shall I give 2/3 of my property in charity?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; I said,  &#8220;Shall I then give one half of it in charity?&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Sad! Give 1/3  (in charity) and even 1/3 is too much. No doubt, it is better to leave your children rich  than to leave them poor, reduced to begging from others. And Allah will reward you for  whatever you spend with the intention of gaining Allah&#8217;s Pleasure even if it were a  mouthful of food you put into your wives mouth.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Am  I to be left behind (in Mecca) after my companions have gone?&#8221; He said, &#8220;If you  should be left behind, you will be upgraded and elevated for every deed you will do with a  desire to achieve Allah&#8217;s Pleasure. I hope that you will live long so that some people  will benefit by you while others will be harmed. O Allah! Please fulfill the migration of  my companions and do not make them turn back on their heels. But (we feel sorry for) the  unlucky Sad bin Khaulah.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle lamented his death in Mecca. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Auf came to Medina and the Prophet  established the bond of brotherhood between him and Sad bin Ar-Rabi-al-Ansari, Saud  suggested that &#8216;Abdur-Rahman should accept half of his property and family. &#8216;Abdur Rahman  said, &#8220;May Allah bless you in your family and property; guide me to the market.&#8221;  So &#8216;Abdur-Rahman (while doing business in the market) made some profit of some condensed  dry yoghurt and butter. After a few days the Prophet saw him wearing clothes stained with  yellow perfume. The Prophet asked, &#8220;What is this, O &#8216;Abdur-Rahman?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have married an Ansar&#8217; woman.&#8221; The Prophet asked,  &#8220;What have you given her as Mahr?&#8221; He (i.e. &#8216;Abdur-Rahman) said, &#8220;A piece  of gold, about the weight of a date stone.&#8221; Then the Prophet said, Give a banquet,  even though of a sheep.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the news of the arrival of the Prophet at Medina  reached &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam, he went to him to ask him about certain things, He said,  &#8220;I am going to ask you about three things which only a Prophet can answer: What is  the first sign of The Hour? What is the first food which the people of Paradise will eat?  Why does a child attract the similarity to his father or to his mother?&#8221; The Prophet  replied, &#8220;Gabriel has just now informed me of that.&#8221; Ibn Salam said, &#8220;He  (i.e. Gabriel) is the enemy of the Jews amongst the angels. The Prophet said, &#8220;As for  the first sign of The Hour, it will be a fire that will collect the people from the East  to the West. As for the first meal which the people of Paradise will eat, it will be the  caudate (extra) lobe of the fish-liver. As for the child, if the man&#8217;s discharge proceeds  the woman&#8217;s discharge, the child attracts the similarity to the man, and if the woman&#8217;s  discharge proceeds the man&#8217;s, then the child attracts the similarity to the woman.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On this, &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam said, &#8220;I testify that  None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and that you are the Apostle of  Allah.&#8221; and added, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Jews invent such lies as make one  astonished, so please ask them about me before they know about my conversion to I slam .  &#8221; The Jews came, and the Prophet said, &#8220;What kind of man is &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam  among you?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;The best of us and the son of the best of us and the  most superior among us, and the son of the most superior among us. &#8220;The Prophet said,  &#8220;What would you think if &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam should embrace Islam?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;May Allah protect him from that.&#8221; The Prophet repeated his question and they  gave the same answer. Then &#8216;Abdullah came out to them and said, &#8220;I testify that None  has the right to be worshipped except Allah and that Muhammad is the Apostle of  Allah!&#8221; On this, the Jews said, &#8220;He is the most wicked among us and the son of  the most wicked among us.&#8221; So they degraded him. On this, he (i.e. &#8216;Abdullah bin  Salam) said, &#8220;It is this that I was afraid of, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle. </font></p>

By Allah, when I sold them in the market, nobody objected to it.&#8221; Then I  asked Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib (about it) he said, &#8220;We used to make such a transaction when  the Prophet came to Medina. So he said, &#8216;There is no harm in it if it is done from hand to  hand, but it is not allowed on credit.&#8217; Go to Zaid bin Al- Arqam and ask him about it for  he was the greatest trader of all of us.&#8221; So I asked Zaid bin Al-Arqam., and he said  the same (as Al-Bara) did.&#8221; </font></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 66:</p>
<h3 align="center">Sacrifice on Occasion of Birth (`Aqiqa)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.066.376"></a>Volume 7, Book 66, Number 376:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A son was born to me and I took him to the Prophet who named him Ibrahim, did Tahnik for him with a date, invoked Allah to bless him and returned him to me. (The narrator added: That was Abu Musa&#8217;s eldest son.)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 377:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A boy was brought to the Prophet to do Tahnik for him, but the boy urinated on him, whereupon the Prophet had water poured on the place of urine.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 378:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I conceived &#8216;Abdullah bin AzZubair at Mecca and went out (of Mecca) while I was about to give birth. I came to Medina and encamped at Quba&#8217;, and gave birth at Quba&#8217;. Then I brought the child to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and placed it (on his lap). He asked for a date, chewed it, and put his saliva in the mouth of the child. So the first thing to enter its stomach was the saliva of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Then he did its Tahnik with a date, and invoked Allah to bless him. It was the first child born in the Islamic era, therefore they (Muslims) were very happy with its birth, for it had been said to them that the Jews had bewitched them, and so they would not produce any offspring.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 379p:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Talha had a child who was sick. Once, while Abu Talha was out, the child died. When Abu Talha returned home, he asked, &#8220;How does my son fare?&#8221; Um Salaim (his wife) replied, &#8220;He is quieter than he has ever been.&#8221; Then she brought supper for him and he took his supper and slept with her. When he had finished, she said (to him), &#8220;Bury the child (as he&#8217;s dead).&#8221; Next morning Abu Talha came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and told him about that. The Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Did you sleep with your wife last night?&#8221; Abu Talha said, &#8220;Yes&#8221;. The Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah! Bestow your blessing on them as regards that night of theirs.&#8221; Um Sulaim gave birth to a boy. Abu Talha told me to take care of the child till it was taken to the Prophet. Then Abu Talha took the child to the Prophet and Um Sulaim sent some dates along with the child. The Prophet took the child (on his lap) and asked if there was something with him. The people replied, &#8220;Yes, a few dates.&#8221; The Prophet took a date, chewed it, took some of it out of his mouth, put it into the child&#8217;s mouth and did Tahnik for him with that, and named him &#8216;Abdullah.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 379i:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As above.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 380:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salman bin &#8216;Amir Ad-Dabbi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;&#8216;Aqiqa is to be offered for a (newly born) boy, so slaughter (an animal) for him, and relieve him of his suffering.&#8221; (Note: It has been quoted in Fateh-AL-Bari that the majority of the Religious Scholars agrees to the Hadith narrated in Sahih At-TlRMlZY that the Prophet was asked about Aqiqa and he ordered 2 sheep for a boy and one sheep for a girl and that is his tradition &#8220;SUNNA&#8221;.)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 381:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Habib bin Ash-Shahid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Sirin told me to ask Al-Hassan from whom he had heard the narration of &#8216;Aqiqa. I asked him and he said, &#8220;From Samura bin Jundab.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 382:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Neither Fara&#8217; nor &#8216;Atira (is permissible):&#8221; Al-Fara&#8217; nor &#8216;Atira (is permissible):&#8221; Al-Fara&#8217; was the first offspring (of camels or sheep) which the pagans used to offer (as a sacrifice) to their idols. And Al-&#8216;Atira was (a sheep which was to be slaughtered) during the month of Rajab.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 383:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Neither Fara&#8217; nor &#8216;Atira) is permissible).&#8221; Al-Fara&#8217; was the first offspring (they got of camels or sheep) which they (pagans) used to offer (as a sacrifice) to their idols. &#8216;Atira was (a sheep which used to be slaughtered) during the month of Rajab.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 61:</p>
<h3 align="center">Virtues of the Qur&#8217;an</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="006.061.502"></a>Volume 6, Book 61, Number 502:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha and Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet remained in Mecca for ten years, during which the Qur&#8217;an used to be revealed to him; and he stayed in Medina for ten years.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 503:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu &#8216;Uthman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was informed that Gabriel came to the Prophet while Um Salama was with him. Gabriel started talking (to the Prophet). Then the Prophet asked Um Salama, &#8220;Who is this?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;He is Dihya (al-Kalbi).&#8221; When Gabriel had left, Um Salama said, &#8220;By Allah, I did not take him for anybody other than him (i.e. Dihya) till I heard the sermon of the Prophet wherein he informed about the news of Gabriel.&#8221; The subnarrator asked Abu &#8216;Uthman: From whom have you heard that? Abu &#8216;Uthman said: From Usama bin Zaid.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 504:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Every Prophet was given miracles because of which people believed, but what I have been given, is Divine Inspiration which Allah has revealed to me. So I hope that my followers will outnumber the followers of the other Prophets on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 505:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah sent down His Divine Inspiration to His Apostle continuously and abundantly during the period preceding his death till He took him unto Him. That was the period of the greatest part of revelation; and Allah&#8217;s Apostle died after that.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 506:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jundub:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once the Prophet fell ill and did not offer the night prayer (Tahajjud prayer) for a night or two. A woman (the wife of Abu Lahab) came to him and said, &#8220;O Muhammad ! I do not see but that your Satan has left you.&#8221; Then Allah revealed (Surat-Ad-Duha):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;By the fore-noon, and by the night when it darkens (or is still); Your Lord has not forsaken you, nor hated you.&#8217; (93)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 507:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Caliph &#8216;Uthman ordered Zaid bin Thabit, Said bin Al-As, &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Harith bin Hisham to write the Quran in the form of a book (Mushafs) and said to them. &#8220;In case you disagree with Zaid bin Thabit (Al-Ansari) regarding any dialectic Arabic utterance of the Quran, then write it in the dialect of Quraish, for the Quran was revealed in this dialect.&#8221; So they did it.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 508:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Safwan bin Ya&#8217;la bin Umaiya:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ya&#8217;la used to say, &#8220;I wish I could see Allah&#8217;s Apostle at the time he is being inspired Divinely.&#8221; When the Prophet was at Al-Ja&#8217;rana and was shaded by a garment hanging over him and some of his companions were with him, a man perfumed with scent came and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What is your opinion regarding a man who assumes Ihram and puts on a cloak after perfuming his body with scent?&#8221; The Prophet waited for a while, and then the Divine Inspiration descended upon him. &#8216;Umar pointed out to Ya&#8217;la, telling him to come. Ya&#8217;la came and pushed his head (underneath the screen which was covering the Prophet ) and behold! The Prophet&#8217;s face was red and he kept on breathing heavily for a while and then he was relieved. Thereupon he said, &#8220;Where is the questioner who asked me about &#8216;Umra a while ago?&#8221; The man was sought and then was brought before the Prophet who said (to him), &#8220;As regards the scent which you perfumed your body with, you must wash it off thrice, and as for your cloak, you must take it off; and then perform in your &#8216;Umra all those things which you perform in Hajj.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 509:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Thabit:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr As-Siddiq sent for me when the people! of Yamama had been killed (i.e., a number of the Prophet&#8217;s Companions who fought against Musailama). (I went to him) and found &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab sitting with him. Abu Bakr then said (to me), &#8220;Umar has come to me and said: &#8220;Casualties were heavy among the Qurra&#8217; of the! Qur&#8217;an (i.e. those who knew the Quran by heart) on the day of the Battle of Yalmama, and I am afraid that more heavy casualties may take place among the Qurra&#8217; on other battlefields, whereby a large part of the Qur&#8217;an may be lost. Therefore I suggest, you (Abu Bakr) order that the Qur&#8217;an be collected.&#8221; I said to &#8216;Umar, &#8220;How can you do something which Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not do?&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;By Allah, that is a good project. &#8220;Umar kept on urging me to accept his proposal till Allah opened my chest for it and I began to realize the good in the idea which &#8216;Umar had realized.&#8221; Then Abu Bakr said (to me). &#8216;You are a wise young man and we do not have any suspicion about you, and you used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah&#8217;s Apostle. So you should search for (the fragmentary scripts of) the Qur&#8217;an and collect it in one book).&#8221; By Allah If they had ordered me to shift one of the mountains, it would not have been heavier for me than this ordering me to collect the Qur&#8217;an. Then I said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;How will you do something which Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not do?&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;By Allah, it is a good project.&#8221; Abu Bakr kept on urging me to accept his idea until Allah opened my chest for what He had opened the chests of Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar. So I started looking for the Qur&#8217;an and collecting it from (what was written on) palmed stalks, thin white stones and also from the men who knew it by heart, till I found the last Verse of Surat At-Tauba (Repentance) with Abi Khuzaima Al-Ansari, and I did not find it with anybody other than him. The Verse is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Verily there has come unto you an Apostle (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty..(till the end of Surat-Baraa&#8217; (At-Tauba) (9.128-129) Then the complete manuscripts (copy) of the Qur&#8217;an remained with Abu Bakr till he died, then with &#8216;Umar till the end of his life, and then with Hafsa, the daughter of &#8216;Umar.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 510:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman came to Uthman at the time when the people of Sham and the people of Iraq were Waging war to conquer Arminya and Adharbijan. Hudhaifa was afraid of their (the people of Sham and Iraq) differences in the recitation of the Qur&#8217;an, so he said to &#8216;Uthman, &#8220;O chief of the Believers! Save this nation before they differ about the Book (Quran) as Jews and the Christians did before.&#8221; So &#8216;Uthman sent a message to Hafsa saying, &#8220;Send us the manuscripts of the Qur&#8217;an so that we may compile the Qur&#8217;anic materials in perfect copies and return the manuscripts to you.&#8221; Hafsa sent it to &#8216;Uthman. &#8216;Uthman then ordered Zaid bin Thabit, &#8216;Abdullah bin AzZubair, Said bin Al-As and &#8216;AbdurRahman bin Harith bin Hisham to rewrite the manuscripts in perfect copies. &#8216;Uthman said to the three Quraishi men, &#8220;In case you disagree with Zaid bin Thabit on any point in the Qur&#8217;an, then write it in the dialect of Quraish, the Qur&#8217;an was revealed in their tongue.&#8221; They did so, and when they had written many copies, &#8216;Uthman returned the original manuscripts to Hafsa. &#8216;Uthman sent to every Muslim province one copy of what they had copied, and ordered that all the other Qur&#8217;anic materials, whether written in fragmentary manuscripts or whole copies, be burnt. Said bin Thabit added, &#8220;A Verse from Surat Ahzab was missed by me when we copied the Qur&#8217;an and I used to hear Allah&#8217;s Apostle reciting it. So we searched for it and found it with Khuzaima bin Thabit Al-Ansari. (That Verse was): &#8216;Among the Believers are men who have been true in their covenant with Allah.&#8217; (33.23)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 511:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Thabit:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr sent for me and said, &#8220;You used to write the Divine Revelations for Allah&#8217;s Apostle : So you should search for (the Qur&#8217;an and collect) it.&#8221; I started searching for the Qur&#8217;an till I found the last two Verses of Surat At-Tauba with Abi Khuzaima Al-Ansari and I could not find these Verses with anybody other than him. (They were):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Verily there has come unto you an Apostle (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty &#8230;&#8217; (9.128-129)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 512:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was revealed: &#8216;Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) and those who strive and fight in the Cause of Allah.&#8217; (4.95)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Call Zaid for me and let him bring the board, the inkpot and the scapula bone (or the scapula bone and the ink pot).&#8221;&#8216; Then he said, &#8220;Write: &#8216;Not equal are those Believers who sit..&#8221;, and at that time &#8216;Amr bin Um Maktum, the blind man was sitting behind the Prophet . He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What is your order For me (as regards the above Verse) as I am a blind man?&#8221; So, instead of the above Verse, the following Verse was revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame etc.) and those who strive and fight in the cause of Allah.&#8217; (4.95)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 513:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Gabriel recited the Qur&#8217;an to me in one way. Then I requested him (to read it in another way), and continued asking him to recite it in other ways, and he recited it in several ways till he ultimately recited it in seven different ways.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 514:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Hisham bin Hakim reciting Surat Al-Furqan during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I listened to his recitation and noticed that he recited in several different ways which Allah&#8217;s Apostle had not taught me. I was about to jump over him during his prayer, but I controlled my temper, and when he had completed his prayer, I put his upper garment around his neck and seized him by it and said, &#8220;Who taught you this Sura which I heard you reciting?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle taught it to me.&#8221; I said, &#8220;You have told a lie, for Allah&#8217;s Apostle has taught it to me in a different way from yours.&#8221; So I dragged him to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said (to Allah&#8217;s Apostle),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I heard this person reciting Surat Al-Furqan in a way which you haven&#8217;t taught me!&#8221; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Release him, (O &#8216;Umar!) Recite, O Hisham!&#8221; Then he recited in the same way as I heard him reciting. Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;It was revealed in this way,&#8221; and added, &#8220;Recite, O &#8216;Umar!&#8221; I recited it as he had taught me. Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8220;It was revealed in this way. This Qur&#8217;an has been revealed to be recited in seven different ways, so recite of it whichever (way) is easier for you (or read as much of it as may be easy for you).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 515:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Yusuf bin Mahk:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was with Aisha, the mother of the Believers, a person from Iraq came and asked, &#8220;What type of shroud is the best?&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;May Allah be merciful to you! What does it matter?&#8221; He said, &#8220;O mother of the Believers! Show me (the copy of) your Qur&#8217;an,&#8221; She said, &#8220;Why?&#8221; He said, &#8220;In order to compile and arrange the Qur&#8217;an according to it, for people recite it with its Suras not in proper order.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;What does it matter which part of it you read first? (Be informed) that the first thing that was revealed thereof was a Sura from Al-Mufassal, and in it was mentioned Paradise and the Fire. When the people embraced Islam, the Verses regarding legal and illegal things were revealed. If the first thing to be revealed was: &#8216;Do not drink alcoholic drinks.&#8217; people would have said, &#8216;We will never leave alcoholic drinks,&#8217; and if there had been revealed, &#8216;Do not commit illegal sexual intercourse, &#8216;they would have said, &#8216;We will never give up illegal sexual intercourse.&#8217; While I was a young girl of playing age, the following Verse was revealed in Mecca to Muhammad: &#8216;Nay! But the Hour is their appointed time (for their full recompense), and the Hour will be more grievous and more bitter.&#8217; (54.46) Sura Al-Baqara (The Cow) and Surat An-Nisa (The Women) were revealed while I was with him.&#8221; Then &#8216;Aisha took out the copy of the Qur&#8217;an for the man and dictated to him the Verses of the Suras (in their proper order) .</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 516:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Surat Bani-lsrael, Al-Kahf (The Cave), Maryam, Taha, Al-Anbiya&#8217; (The prophets) are amongst my first earnings and my old property, and (in fact) they are my old property.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 517:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I learnt, &#8216;Glorify the Name of your Lord the Most High&#8217; (Surat al-A&#8217;la) No 87, before the Prophet came (to Medina) .</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah said, &#8220;I learnt An-Naza&#8217;ir which the Prophet used to recite in pairs in each Rak&#8217;a.&#8221; Then Abdullah got up and Alqama accompanied him to his house, and when Alqama came out, we asked him (about those Suras). He said, &#8220;They are twenty Suras that start from the beginning of Al-Mufassal, according to the arrangement done be Ibn Mas&#8217;ud, and end with the Suras starting with Ha Mim, e.g. Ha Mim (the Smoke). and &#8220;About what they question one another?&#8221; (78.1)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 519:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet was the most generous person, and he used to become more so (generous) particularly in the month of Ramadan because Gabriel used to meet him every night of the month of Ramadan till it elapsed. Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to recite the Qur&#8217;an for him. When Gabriel met him, he used to become more generous than the fast wind in doing good.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 520:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu-Huraira: Gabriel used to repeat the recitation of the Qur&#8217;an with the Prophet once a year, but he repeated it twice with him in the year he died. The Prophet used to stay in I&#8217;tikaf for ten days every year (in the month of Ramadan), but</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr mentioned &#8216;Abdullah bin Masud and said, &#8220;I shall ever love that man, for I heard the Prophet saying, &#8216;Take (learn) the Qur&#8217;an from four: &#8216;Abdullah bin Masud, Salim, Mu&#8217;adh and Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Once &#8216;Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud delivered a sermon before us and said, &#8220;By Allah, I learnt over seventy Suras direct from Allah&#8217;s Apostle . By Allah, the companions of the Prophet came to know that I am one of those who know Allah&#8217;s Book best of all of them, yet I am not the best of them.&#8221; Shaqiq added: I sat in his religious gathering and I did not hear anybody opposing him (in his speech).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Umar bin Khattab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Hisham bin Hakim bin Hizam reciting Surat-al-Furqan during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and I listened to his recitation and noticed that he recited it in several ways which Allah&#8217;s Apostle had not taught me. So I was on the point of attacking him in the prayer, but I waited till he finished his prayer, and then I seized him by the collar and said, &#8220;Who taught you this Surah which I have heard you reciting?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle taught it to me.&#8221; I said, &#8220;You are telling a lie; By Allah! Allah&#8217;s Apostle taught me (in a different way) this very Surah which I have heard you reciting.&#8221; So I took him, leading him to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I heard this person reciting Surat-al-Furqan in a way that you did not teach me, and you have taught me Surat-al-Furqan.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;O Hisham, recite!&#8221; So he recited in the same way as I heard him recite it before. On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;It was revealed to be recited in this way.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Recite, O &#8216;Umar!&#8221; So I recited it as he had taught me. Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8220;It was revealed to be recited in this way.&#8221; Allah&#8221; Apostle added, &#8220;The Quran has been revealed to be recited in several different ways, so recite of it that which is easier for you.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding His (Allah&#8217;s) Statement:&#8211; &#8216;Move not your tongue concerning (the Qur&#8217;an) to make haste therewith.&#8217; (75.16) And whenever Gabriel descended to Allah&#8217;s Apostle with the Divine Inspiration, Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to move his tongue and lips, and that used to be hard for him, and one could easily recognize that he was being inspired Divinely. So Allah revealed the Verse which occurs in the Surah starting with &#8220;I do swear by the Day of Resurrection.&#8217; (75.1) i.e. &#8216;Move not your tongue concerning (the Qur&#8217;an) to make haste then with. It is for Us to collect it (in your mind) (O Muhammad) an give you the ability to recite it &#8216;by heart.&#8217; (75.16-17) which means: It is for us to collect it (in your mind) and give you the ability to recite it by heart. And when We have recited it to you (O Muhammad) through Gabriel then follow you its recital. (75.18) means: &#8216;When We reveal it (the Qur&#8217;an) to you, Listen to it.&#8217; for then: It is for Us to explain it and make it clear to you&#8217; (75.19) i.e. It is up to Us to explain it through your tongue. So, when Gabriel came to him, Allah&#8217;s Apostle would listen to him attentively, and as soon as Gabriel left, he would recite the Revelations, as Allah had promised him.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Shubruma said, &#8220;I wanted to see how much of the Qur&#8217;an can be enough (to recite in prayer) and I could not find a Surah containing less than three Verses, therefore I said to myself), &#8220;One ought not to recite less than three (Quranic) Verses (in prayer).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">My father got me married to a lady of a noble family, and often used to ask my wife about me, and she used to reply, &#8220;What a wonderful man he is! He never comes to my bed, nor has he approached me since he married me.&#8221; When this state continued for a long period, my father told the story to the Prophet who said to my father, &#8220;Let me meet him.&#8221; Then I met him and he asked me, &#8220;How do you fast?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I fast daily,&#8221; He asked, &#8220;How long does it take you to finish the recitation of the whole Quran?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I finish it every night.&#8221; On that he said, &#8220;Fast for three days every month and recite the Qur&#8217;an (and finish it) in one month.&#8221; I said, &#8220;But I have power to do more than that.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then fast for three days per week.&#8221; I said, &#8220;i have the power to do more than that.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Therefore, fast the most superior type of fasting, (that is, the fasting of (prophet) David who used to fast every alternate day; and finish the recitation of the whole Qur&#8217;an In seven days.&#8221; I wish I had accepted the permission of Allah&#8217;s Apostle as I have become a weak old man. It is said that &#8216;Abdullah used to recite one-seventh of the Qur&#8217;an during the day-time to some of his family members, for he used to check his memorization of what he would recite at night during the daytime so that it would be easier for him to read at night. And whenever he wanted to gain some strength, he used to give up fasting for some days and count those days to fast for a similar period, for he disliked to leave those things which he used to do during the lifetime of the Prophet.</p>

<h3 align="center">Hunting, Slaughtering</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.067.384"></a>Volume 7, Book 67, Number 384:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Adi bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked the Prophet about the game killed by a Mi&#8217;rad (i.e. a sharp-edged piece of wood or a piece of wood provided with a sharp piece of iron used for hunting). He said, &#8220;If the game is killed with its sharp edge, eat of it, but if it is killed with its shaft, with a hit by its broad side then the game is (unlawful to eat) for it has been beaten to death.&#8221; I asked him about the game killed by a trained hound. He said, &#8220;If the hound catches the game for you, eat of it, for killing the game by the hound, is like its slaughtering. But if you see with your hound or hounds another dog, and you are afraid that it might have shared in hunting the game with your hound and killed it, then you should not eat of it, because you have mentioned Allah&#8217;s name on (sending) your hound only, but you have not mentioned it on some other hound</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 385:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Adi bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about the Mi&#8217;rad. He said, &#8220;If you hit the game with its sharp edge, eat it, but if the Mi&#8217;rad hits the game with its shaft with a hit by its broad side do not eat it, for it has been beaten to death with a piece of wood. (i.e. unlawful).&#8221; I asked, &#8220;If I let loose my trained hound after a game?&#8221; He said, &#8220;If you let loose your trained hound after game, and mention the name of Allah, then you can eat.&#8221; I said, &#8220;If the hound eats of the game?&#8221; He said &#8220;Then you should not eat of it, for the hound has hunted the game for itself and not for you.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Some times I send my hound and then I find some other hound with it?&#8221; He said &#8220;Don&#8217;t eat the game, as you have mentioned the Name of Allah on your dog only and not on the other.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 386:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Adi bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We let loose our trained hounds after a game?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Eat what they hunt for you.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Even if they killed (the game)?&#8221; He replied, &#8216;Even if they killed (the game).&#8221; I said, &#8216;We also hit (the game) with the Mi&#8217;rad?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Eat of the animal which the Mi&#8217;rad kills by piercing its body, but do not eat of the animal which is killed by the broad side of the Mi&#8217;rad.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 387:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Tha&#8217;laba Al-Khushani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! We are living in a land ruled by the people of the Scripture; Can we take our meals in their utensils? In that land there is plenty of game and I hunt the game with my bow and with my hound that is not trained and with my trained hound. Then what is lawful for me to eat?&#8221; He said, &#8220;As for what you have mentioned about the people of the Scripture, if you can get utensils other than theirs, do not eat out of theirs, but if you cannot get other than theirs, wash their utensils and eat out of it. If you hunt an animal with your bow after mentioning Allah&#8217;s Name, eat of it. and if you hunt something with your trained hound after mentioning Allah&#8217;s Name, eat of it, and if you hunt something with your untrained hound (and get it before it dies) and slaughter it, eat of it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 388:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Maghaffal:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that he saw a man throwing stones with two fingers (at something) and said to him, &#8220;Do not throw stones, for Allah&#8217;s Apostle has forbidden throwing stones, or e used to dislike it.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah added: Throwing stones will neither hunt the game, nor kill (or hurt) an enemy, but it may break a tooth or gouge out an eye.&#8221; Afterwards &#8216;Abdullah once again saw the man throwing stones. He said to him, &#8220;I tell you that Allah&#8217;s Apostle has forbidden or disliked the throwing the stones (in such a way), yet you are throwing stones! I shall not talk to you for such-and-such a period.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 389:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever keeps a (pet) dog which is neither a watch dog nor a hunting dog, will get a daily deduction of two Qirat from his good deeds.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 390:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;If someone keeps a dog neither for hunting, nor for guarding livestock, the reward (for his good deeds) will be reduced by two Qirats per day.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 391:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If someone keeps a dog neither for guarding livestock, nor for hunting, his good deeds will decrease (in reward) by two Qirats a day.&#8217;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 392:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Adi bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle. &#8220;We hunt with the help of these hounds.&#8221; He said, &#8220;If you let loose your trained hounds after a game, and mention the name of Allah, then you can eat what the hounds catch for you, even if they killed the game. But you should not eat of it if the hound has eaten of it, for then it is likely that the hound has caught the game for itself. And if other hounds join your hound in hunting the game, then do not eat of it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 393:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Adi bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;If you let loose your hound after a game and mention Allah&#8217;s Name on sending it, and the hound catches the game and kills it, then you can eat of it. But if the hound eats of it, then you should not eat thereof, for the hound has caught it for itself. And if along with your hound, join other hounds, and Allah&#8217;s Name was not mentioned at the time of their sending, and they catch an animal and kill it, you should not ea: of it, for you will not know which of them has killed it. And if you have thrown an arrow at the game and then find it (dead) two or three days later and, it bears no mark other than the wound inflicted by your arrow, then you can eat of it. But if the game is found (dead) in water, then do not eat of it.&#8221; And it has also been narrated by &#8216;Adi bin Hatim that he asked the Prophet &#8220;If a hunter throws an arrow at the game and after tracing it for two or three days he finds it dead but still bearing his arrow, (can he eat of it)?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;He can eat if he wishes.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 394:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Adi bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I let loose my hound after a game and mention Allah&#8217;s Name on sending it.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;If you let loose your hound after a game and you mention Allah&#8217;s Name on sending it and the hound catches and kills the game and eats of it, then you should not eat of it, for it has killed it for itself.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Sometimes when I send my hound after a game, I find another hound along with it and I do not know which of them has caught the game.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You must not eat of it because you have not mentioned, the Name of Allah except on sending your own hound, and you did not mention it on the other hound.&#8221; Then I asked him about the game hunted with a Mi&#8217;rad (i.e. a sharp edged piece of wood or a piece of wood provided with a sharp piece of iron used for hunting). He said, &#8220;If the game is killed with its sharp edge, you can eat of it, but if it is killed by its broad side (shaft), you cannot eat of it, for then it is like an animal beaten to death with a pie</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 395:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Adi Bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8220;We hunt with these hounds.&#8221; He said, &#8220;If you send your trained hounds after a game and mention Allah&#8217;s Name on sending, you can eat of what they catch for you. But if the hound eats of the game, then you must not eat of it, for I am afraid that the hound caught it for itself, and if another hound joins your hounds (during the hunt), you should not eat of the game.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 396:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Tha&#8217;laba Al-Khushani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We are living in the land of the people of the Scripture and we take our meals in their utensils, and in the land there is game and I hunt with my bow and trained or untrained hounds; please tell me what is lawful for us of that.&#8221; He said, &#8220;As for your saying that you are living in the land of the people of the Scripture and that you eat in their utensils, if you can get utensils other than theirs, do not eat in their utensils, but if you do not find (other than theirs), then wash their utensils and eat in them. As for your saying that you are in the land of game, if you hung something with your bow, and have mentioned Allah&#8217;s Name while hunting, then you can eat (the game). And if you hunt something with your trained hound, and have mentioned Allah&#8217;s Name on sending it for hunting then you can eat (the game). But if you hunt something with your untrained hound and you were able to slaughter it before its death, you can eat of it.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We provoked a rabbit at Marr Az-Zahran till it started jumping. My companions chased it till they got tired. But I alone ran after it and caught it and brought it to Abu Talha. He sent both its legs to the Prophet who accepted them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 398:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that once he was with Allah&#8217;s Apostle (on the way to Mecca). When he had covered some of the way to Mecca, he and some companions of his, who were in the state of lhram. remained behind the Prophet while Abu Qatada himself was not in the state of Ihram. Abu Qatada, seeing an onager rode his horse and asked his companions to hand him a whip, but they refused. He then asked them to hand him his spear, but they refused. Then he took it himself and attacked the onager and killed it. Some of the Companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle ate of it, but some others refused to eat. When they met Allah&#8217;s Apostle they asked him about that. He said, &#8220;It was meal given to you by Allah.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 399:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the same Hadith above, but he added); The Prophet asked, &#8220;Is there any of its meat left with you?&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 400:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was with the Prophet (on a journey) between Mecca and Medina, and all of them, (i.e. the Prophet and his companions) were in the state of Ihram, while I was not in that state. I was riding my horse and I used to be fond of ascending mountains. So while I was doing so I noticed that the people were looking at something. I went to see what it was, and behold it was an onager. I asked my companions, &#8220;What is that?&#8221; They said, &#8220;We do not know.&#8221; I said, &#8220;It is an onager.&#8217; They said, &#8220;It is what you have seen.&#8221; I had left my whip, so I said to them, &#8220;Hand to me my whip.&#8221; They said, &#8220;We will not help you in that (in hunting the onager).&#8221; I got down, took my whip and chased the animal (on my horse) and did not stop till I killed it. I went to them and said, &#8220;Come on, carry it!&#8221; But they said, &#8220;We will not even touch it.&#8221; At last I alone carried it and brought it to them. Some of them ate of it and some refused to eat of it. I said (to them), &#8220;I will ask the Prophet about it (on your behalf).&#8221; When I met the Prophet, I told him the whole story. He said to me, &#8220;Has anything of it been left with you?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Eat, for it is a meal Allah has offered to you.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We went out in a campaign and the army was called The Army of the Khabt, and Abu &#8216;Ubaida was our commander. We were struck with severe hunger. Then the sea threw a huge dead fish called Al-&#8216;Anbar, the like of which had never been seen. We ate of it for half a month, and then Abu &#8216;Ubaida took one of its bones (and made an arch of it) so that a rider could easily pass under it.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 402:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sent us as an army unit of three hundred warriors under the command of Abu &#8216;Ubaida to ambush a caravan of the Quraish. But we were struck with such severe hunger that we ate the Khabt (desert bushes), so our army was called the Army of the Khabt. Then the sea threw a huge fish called Al-&#8216;Anbar and we ate of it for half a month and rubbed our bodies with its fat till our bodies became healthy. Then Abu Ubaida took one of its ribs and fixed it over the ground and a rider passed underneath it. There was a man amongst us who slaughtered three camels when hunger became severe, and he slaughtered three more, but after that Abu &#8216;Ubaida forbade him to do so.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We are living in the land of the people of the Scripture, and we take our meals in their utensils, and there is game in that land and I hunt with my bow and with my trained hound and with my untrained hound.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;As for your saying that you are in the land of people of the Scripture, you should not eat in their utensils unless you find no alternative, in which case you must wash the utensils and then eat in them As for your saying that you are in the land of game, if you hunt something with your bow, mention Allah&#8217;s Name (while hunting the game) and eat; and if you hunt something with your trained hound, mention Allah&#8217;s Name on sending and eat; and if you hunt something with your untrained hound and get it alive, slaughter it and you can eat of it&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 405:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salama bin Al-Aqwa&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the evening of the day of the conquest of Khaibar, the army made fires (for cooking). The Prophet said, &#8220;For what have you made these fires?&#8221; They said, &#8220;For cooking the meat of domestic donkeys.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Throw away what is in the cooking pots and break the pots.&#8221; A man from the people got up and said, &#8220;Shall we throw the contents of the cooking pots and then wash the pots (instead of breaking them)?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, you can do either&#8217;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 406:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Rafi bin Khadij:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were with the Prophet in Dhul-Hulaifa and there the people were struck with severe hunger. Then we got camels and sheep as war booty (and slaughtered them). The Prophet was behind all the people. The people hurried and fixed the cooking pots (for cooking) but the Prophet came there and ordered that the cooking pots be turned upside down. Then he distributed the animals, regarding ten sheep as equal to one camel. One of the camels ran away and there were a few horses with the people. They chased the camel but they got tired, whereupon a man shot it with an arrow whereby Allah stopped it. The Prophet said, &#8220;Among these animals some are as wild as wild beasts, so if one of them runs away from you, treat it in this way.&#8221; I said. &#8220;We hope, or we are afraid that tomorrow we will meet the enemy and we have no knives, shall we slaughter (our animals) with canes?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;If the killing tool causes blood to gush out and if Allah&#8217;s Name is mentioned, eat (of the slaughterer animal). But do not slaughter with a tooth or a nail. I am telling you why: A tooth is a bone, and the nail is the knife of Ethiopians.&#8221;</p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle presented a dish of meat (that had been offered to him by the pagans) to Zaid bin &#8216;Amr, but Zaid refused to eat of it and then said (to the pagans), &#8220;I do not eat of what you slaughter on your stonealtars (Ansabs) nor do I eat except that on which Allah&#8217;s Name has been mentioned on slaughtering.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jundub bin Sufyan Al-Bajali:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle we offered some animals as sacrifices. Some people slaughtered their sacrifices before the (Id) prayer, so when the Prophet finished his prayer, he saw that they had slaughtered their sacrifices before the prayer. He said, &#8220;Whoever has slaughtered (his sacrifice) before the prayer, should slaughter (another sacrifice) in lieu of it; and whoever has not yet slaughtered it till we have prayed; should slaughter (it) by mentioning Allah&#8217;s Name.&#8221;</p>

Abu Musa was presented with a dish containing chicken. Among the people there was sitting a red-faced man who did not come near the food. Abu Musa said (to him), &#8220;Come on (and eat), for I have seen Allah&#8217;s Apostle eating of it (i.e. chicken).&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have seen it eating something (dirty) and since then I have disliked it, and have taken an oath that I shall not eat it &#8216; Abu Musa said, &#8220;Come on, I will tell you (or narrate to you). Once I went to Allah s Apostle with a group of Al-Ash&#8217;ariyin, and met him while he was angry, distributing some camels of Rakat. We asked for mounts but he took an oath that he would not give us any mounts, and added, &#8216;I have nothing to mount you on&#8217; In the meantime some camels of booty were brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and he asked twice, &#8216;Where are Al-Ash&#8217;ariyin?&#8221; So he gave us five white camels with big humps. We stayed for a short while (after we had covered a little distance), and then I said to my companions, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle has forgotten his oath. By Allah, if we do not remind Allah&#8217;s Apostle of his oath, we will never be successful.&#8221; So we returned to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We asked you for mounts, but you took an oath that you would not give us any mounts; we think that you have forgotten your oath.&#8217; He said, &#8216;It is Allah Who has given you mounts. By Allah, and Allah willing, if I take an oath and later find something else better than that. then I do what is better and expiate my oath.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

If you slaughter the animal with anything that causes its blood to flow out, and if Allah&#8217;s Name is mentioned on slaughtering it, eat of it, provided that the slaughtering instrument is not a tooth or a nail, as the tooth is a bone and the nail is the knife of Ethiopians.&#8221;</p>

<h3 align="center"><font>Beginning of Creation </font></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.054.413">Volume 4, Book 54, Number 413: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Imran bin Husain: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some people of Bani Tamim came to the Prophet and he said  (to them), &#8220;O Bani Tamim! rejoice with glad tidings.&#8221; They said, &#8220;You have  given us glad tidings, now give us something.&#8221; On hearing that the color of his face  changed then the people of Yemen came to him and he said, &#8220;O people of Yemen ! Accept  the good tidings, as Bani Tamim has refused them.&#8221; The Yemenites said, &#8220;We  accept them. Then the Prophet started taking about the beginning of creation and about  Allah&#8217;s Throne. In the mean time a man came saying, &#8220;O &#8216;Imran! Your she-camel has run  away!&#8221; (I got up and went away), but l wish I had not left that place (for I missed what  Allah&#8217;s Apostle had said). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 54, Number 414: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Imran bin Husain: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I went to the Prophet and tied my she-camel at the gate.  The people of Bani Tamim came to the Prophet who said &#8220;O Bani Tamim! Accept the good  tidings.&#8221; They said twice, &#8216;You have given us the good tidings, now give us  something&#8221; Then some Yemenites came to him and he said, &#8220;Accept the good  tidings, O people of Yemem, for Bani Tamim refused them.&#8221; They said, &#8220;We accept  it, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We have come to ask you about this matter (i.e. the start of  creations).&#8221; He said, &#8220;First of all, there was nothing but Allah, and (then He  created His Throne). His throne was over the water, and He wrote everything in the Book  (in the Heaven) and created the Heavens and the Earth.&#8221; Then a man shouted, &#8220;O  Ibn Husain! Your she-camel has gone away!&#8221; So, I went away and could not see the  she-camel because of the mirage. By Allah, I wished I had left that she-camel (but not  that gathering). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Umar: One day the Prophet stood up amongst us for  a long period and informed us about the beginning of creation (and talked about everything  in detail) till he mentioned how the people of Paradise will enter their places and the  people of Hell will enter their places. Some remembered what he had said, and some forgot  it. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah the Most Superior said,  &#8220;The son of Adam slights Me, and he should not slight Me, and he disbelieves in Me,  and he ought not to do so. As for his slighting Me, it is that he says that I have a son;  and his disbelief in Me is his statement that I shall not recreate him as I have created  (him) before.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>from Abu Salama bin &#8216;Abdur-Rahman who had a dispute with  some people on a piece of land, and so he went to &#8216;Aisha and told her about it. She said,  &#8220;O Abu Salama, avoid the land, for Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Any person who takes even a  span of land unjustly, his neck shall be encircled with it down seven earths.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said. &#8220;(The division of time has turned to  its original form which was current when Allah created the Heavens and the Earths. The  year is of twelve months, out of which four months are sacred: Three are in succession  Dhul-Qa&#8217; da, Dhul-Hijja and Muharram, and (the fourth is) Rajab of (the tribe of) Mudar  which comes between Jumadi-ath-Thaniyah and Sha ban.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 54, Number 420: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Said bin Zaid bin Amr bin Nufail: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That Arwa sued him before Marwan for a right, which she  claimed, he had deprived her of. On that Said said, &#8220;How should I deprive her of her  right? I testify that I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;If anyone takes a span of land  unjustly, his neck will be encircled with it down seven earths on the Day of  Resurrection.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Dhar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet asked me at sunset, &#8220;Do you know where the  sun goes (at the time of sunset)?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know  better.&#8221; He said, &#8220;It goes (i.e. travels) till it prostrates Itself underneath  the Throne and takes the permission to rise again, and it is permitted and then (a time  will come when) it will be about to prostrate itself but its prostration will not be  accepted, and it will ask permission to go on its course but it will not be permitted, but  it will be ordered to return whence it has come and so it will rise in the west. And that  is the interpretation of the Statement of Allah: &#8220;And the sun Runs its fixed course  For a term (decreed). that is The Decree of (Allah) The Exalted in Might, The  All-Knowing.&#8221; (36.38) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The sun and the moon do not eclipse  because of someone&#8217;s death or wife (i.e. birth), but they are two signs amongst the Signs  of Allah. So, if you see them (i.e. eclipse) offer the Prayer (of eclipse).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The sun and the moon are two signs  amongst the Signs of Allah. They do not eclipse because of someone&#8217;s death or life. So, if  you see them (i.e. eclipse), celebrate the Praises of Allah (i.e. pray).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 54, Number 425: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On the day of a solar eclipse, Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up (to  offer the eclipse prayer). He recited Takbir, recited a long recitation (of Holy Verses),  bowed a long bowing, and then he raised h is head saying. &#8220;Allah hears him who sends  his praises to Him.&#8221; Then he stayed standing, recited a long recitation again, but  shorter than the former, bowed a long bowing, but shorter than the first, performed a long  prostration and then performed the second Rak&#8217;a in the same way as he had done the first.  By the time he had finished his prayer with Taslim, the solar eclipse had been over. Then  he addressed the people referring to the solar and lunar eclipses saying, &#8220;These are  two signs amongst the Signs of Allah, and they do not eclipse because of anyone&#8217;s death or  life. So, if you see them, hasten for the Prayer.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;the sun and the moon do not eclipse  because of the death or life of someone, but they are two signs amongst the Signs of  Allah. So, if you see them, offer the Prayer (of eclipse).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;I have been made victorious with  the Saba (i.e. easterly wind) and the people of &#8216;Ad were destroyed with the Dabur (i.e.  westerly wind) .&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ata: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Aisha said If the Prophet saw a cloud In the sky, he would  walk to and fro in agitation, go out and come in, and the color of his face would change,  and if it rained, he would feel relaxed.&#8221; So &#8216;Aisha knew that state of his. So the  Prophet said, I don&#8217;t know (am afraid), it may be similar to what happened to some people  referred to in the Holy Quran in the following Verse: &#8212; &#8220;Then when they saw it as a  dense cloud coming towards their valleys, they said, &#8216;This is a cloud bringing us rain!&#8217;  Nay, but, it is that (torment) which you were asking to be hastened a wind wherein is  severe torment.&#8221; (46.24) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 54, Number 429: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Malik bin Sasaa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;While I was at the House in a state  midway between sleep and wakefulness, (an angel recognized me) as the man lying between  two men. A golden tray full of wisdom and belief was brought to me and my body was cut  open from the throat to the lower part of the abdomen and then my abdomen was washed with  Zam-zam water and (my heart was) filled with wisdom and belief. Al-Buraq, a white animal,  smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey was brought to me and I set out with Gabriel.  When I reached the nearest heaven. Gabriel said to the heaven gate-keeper, &#8216;Open the  gate.&#8217; The gatekeeper asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; The gate-keeper,&#8217; Who is  accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel said, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; The gate-keeper said, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217;  Gabriel said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Then it was said, &#8216;He is welcomed. What a wonderful visit his is!&#8217;  Then I met Adam and greeted him and he said, &#8216;You are welcomed O son and a Prophet.&#8217; Then  we ascended to the second heaven. It was asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel said, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It  was said, &#8216;Who is with you?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Muhammad&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been sent for?&#8217; He  said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; It was said, &#8216;He is welcomed. What a wonderful visit his is!&#8221; Then I met  Jesus and Yahya (John) who said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O brother and a Prophet.&#8217; Then we  ascended to the third heaven. It was asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel said, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was  asked, &#8216;Who is with you? Gabriel said, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been sent for?&#8217;  &#8216;Yes,&#8217; said Gabriel. &#8216;He is welcomed. What a wonderful visit his is!&#8217; (The Prophet  added:). There I met Joseph and greeted him, and he replied, &#8216;You are welcomed, O brother  and a Prophet!&#8217; Then we ascended to the 4th heaven and again the same questions and  answers were exchanged as in the previous heavens. There I met Idris and greeted him. He  said, &#8216;You are welcomed O brother and Prophet.&#8217; Then we ascended to the 5th heaven and  again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in previous heavens. there I met  and greeted Aaron who said, &#8216;You are welcomed O brother and a Prophet&#8221;. Then we  ascended to the 6th heaven and again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in  the previous heavens. There I met and greeted Moses who said, &#8216;You are welcomed O brother  and. a Prophet.&#8217; When I proceeded on, he started weeping and on being asked why he was  weeping, he said, &#8216;O Lord! Followers of this youth who was sent after me will enter  Paradise in greater number than my followers.&#8217; Then we ascended to the seventh heaven and  again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in the previous heavens. There I  met and greeted Abraham who said, &#8216;You are welcomed o son and a Prophet.&#8217; Then I was shown  Al-Bait-al-Ma&#8217;mur (i.e. Allah&#8217;s House). I asked Gabriel about it and he said, This is Al  Bait-ul-Ma&#8217;mur where 70,000 angels perform prayers daily and when they leave they never  return to it (but always a fresh batch comes into it daily).&#8217; Then I was shown  Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (i.e. a tree in the seventh heaven) and I saw its Nabk fruits which  resembled the clay jugs of Hajr (i.e. a town in Arabia), and its leaves were like the ears  of elephants, and four rivers originated at its root, two of them were apparent and two  were hidden. I asked Gabriel about those rivers and he said, &#8216;The two hidden rivers are in  Paradise, and the apparent ones are the Nile and the Euphrates.&#8217; Then fifty prayers were  enjoined on me. I descended till I met Moses who asked me, &#8216;What have you done?&#8217; I said,  &#8216;Fifty prayers have been enjoined on me.&#8217; He said, &#8216;I know the people better than you,  because I had the hardest experience to bring Bani Israel to obedience. Your followers  cannot put up with such obligation. So, return to your Lord and request Him (to reduce the  number of prayers.&#8217; I returned and requested Allah (for reduction) and He made it forty. I  returned and (met Moses) and had a similar discussion, and then returned again to Allah  for reduction and He made it thirty, then twenty, then ten, and then I came to Moses who  repeated the same advice. Ultimately Allah reduced it to five. When I came to Moses again,  he said, &#8216;What have you done?&#8217; I said, &#8216;Allah has made it five only.&#8217; He repeated the same  advice but I said that I surrendered (to Allah&#8217;s Final Order)'&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle was  addressed by Allah, &#8220;I have decreed My Obligation and have reduced the burden on My  slaves, and I shall reward a single good deed as if it were ten good deeds.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle, the true and truly inspired said,  &#8220;(The matter of the Creation of) a human being is put together in the womb of the  mother in forty days, and then he becomes a clot of thick blood for a similar period, and  then a piece of flesh for a similar period. Then Allah sends an angel who is ordered to  write four things. He is ordered to write down his (i.e. the new creature&#8217;s) deeds, his  livelihood, his (date of) death, and whether he will be blessed or wretched (in religion).  Then the soul is breathed into him. So, a man amongst you may do (good deeds till there is  only a cubit between him and Paradise and then what has been written for him decides his  behavior and he starts doing (evil) deeds characteristic of the people of the (Hell) Fire.  And similarly a man amongst you may do (evil) deeds till there is only a cubit between him  and the (Hell) Fire, and then what has been written for him decides his behavior, and he  starts doing deeds characteristic of the people of Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 54, Number 528: </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Mulaika: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn Umar used to kill snakes, but afterwards he forbade  their killing and said, &#8220;Once the Prophet pulled down a wall and saw a cast-off skin  of a snake in it. He said, &#8216;Look for the snake. &#8216;They found it and the Prophet said,  &#8220;Kill it.&#8221; For this reason I used to kill snakes. Later on I met Abu Lubaba who  told me the Prophet said, &#8216;Do not kill snakes except the short-tailed or mutilated-tailed  snake with two white lines on its back, for it causes abortion and makes one blind. So  kill it.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Cover your utensils and tie your  water skins, and close your doors and keep your children close to you at night, as the  Jinns spread out at such time and snatch things away. When you go to bed, put out your  lights, for the mischief-doer (i.e. the rat) may drag away the wick of the candle and burn  the dwellers of the house.&#8221; Ata said, &#8220;The devils.&#8221; (instead of the Jinns).  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah created Adam, making him 60  cubits tall. When He created him, He said to him, &#8220;Go and greet that group of angels,  and listen to their reply, for it will be your greeting (salutation) and the greeting  (salutations of your offspring.&#8221; So, Adam said (to the angels), As-Salamu Alaikum  (i.e. Peace be upon you). The angels said, &#8220;As-salamu Alaika wa Rahmatu-l-lahi&#8221;  (i.e. Peace and Allah&#8217;s Mercy be upon you). Thus the angels added to Adam&#8217;s salutation the  expression, &#8216;Wa Rahmatu-l-lahi,&#8217; Any person who will enter Paradise will resemble Adam (in  appearance and figure). People have been decreasing in stature since Adam&#8217;s creation. </font></p>

They will not urinate, relieve  nature, spit, or have any nasal secretions. Their combs will be of gold, and their sweat  will smell like musk. The aloes-wood will be used in their centers. Their wives will be  houris. All of them will look alike and will resemble their father Adam (in statute),  sixty cubits tall.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam heard the arrival of the Prophet  at Medina, he came to him and said, &#8220;I am going to ask you about three things which  nobody knows except a prophet: What is the first portent of the Hour? What will be the  first meal taken by the people of Paradise? Why does a child resemble its father, and why  does it resemble its maternal uncle&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Gabriel has just now  told me of their answers.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;He (i.e. Gabriel), from amongst all  the angels, is the enemy of the Jews.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The first portent  of the Hour will be a fire that will bring together the people from the east to the west;  the first meal of the people of Paradise will be Extra-lobe (caudate lobe) of fish-liver.  As for the resemblance of the child to its parents: If a man has sexual intercourse with  his wife and gets discharge first, the child will resemble the father, and if the woman  gets discharge first, the child will resemble her.&#8221; On that &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam said,  &#8220;I testify that you are the Apostle of Allah.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam further said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The Jews are liars, and if they should come to know about my  conversion to Islam before you ask them (about me), they would tell a lie about me.&#8221;  The Jews came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and &#8216;Abdullah went inside the house. Allah&#8217;s Apostle  asked (the Jews), &#8220;What kind of man is &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam amongst you?&#8221; They  replied, &#8220;He is the most learned person amongst us, and the best amongst us, and the  son of the best amongst us.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;What do you think if he  embraces Islam (will you do as he does)?&#8221; The Jews said, &#8220;May Allah save him  from it.&#8221; Then &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam came out in front of them saying, &#8220;I testify  that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is the Apostle of  Allah.&#8221; Thereupon they said, &#8220;He is the evilest among us, and the son of the  evilest amongst us,&#8221; and continued talking badly of him. </font></p>

Then Allah sends an angel to write four words: He  writes his deeds, time of his death, means of his livelihood, and whether he will be  wretched or blessed (in religion). Then the soul is breathed into his body. So a man may  do deeds characteristic of the people of the (Hell) Fire, so much so that there is only  the distance of a cubit between him and it, and then what has been written (by the angel)  surpasses, and so he starts doing deeds characteristic of the people of Paradise and  enters Paradise. Similarly, a person may do deeds characteristic of the people of  Paradise, so much so that there is only the distance of a cubit between him and it, and  then what has been written (by the angel) surpasses, and he starts doing deeds of the  people of the (Hell) Fire and enters the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; </font></p>

You are the father of all mankind, and Allah created you  with His Own Hands, and ordered the angels to prostrate for you, and made you live in  Paradise. Will you not intercede for us with your Lord? Don&#8217;t you see in what (miserable)  state we are, and to what condition we have reached?&#8217; On that Adam will reply, &#8216;My Lord is  so angry as He has never been before and will never be in the future; (besides), He  forbade me (to eat from) the tree, but I disobeyed (Him), (I am worried about) myself!  Myself! Go to somebody else; go to Noah.&#8217; They will go to Noah and say; &#8216;O Noah!

So the  Quraish and the Ansar became angry and said, &#8220;He (i.e. the Prophet, ) gives the chief  of Najd and does not give us.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I give them) so as to attract  their hearts (to Islam).&#8221; Then a man with sunken eyes, prominent checks, a raised  forehead, a thick beard and a shaven head, came (in front of the Prophet ) and said,  &#8220;Be afraid of Allah, O Muhammad!&#8221; The Prophet &#8216; said &#8220;Who would obey Allah  if I disobeyed Him? (Is it fair that) Allah has trusted all the people of the earth to me  while, you do not trust me?&#8221; Somebody who, I think was Khalid bin Al-Walid, requested  the Prophet to let him chop that man&#8217;s head off, but he prevented him. When the man left,  the Prophet said, &#8220;Among the off-spring of this man will be some who will recite the  Qur&#8217;an but the Qur&#8217;an will not reach beyond their throats (i.e. they will recite like  parrots and will not understand it nor act on it), and they will renegade from the  religion as an arrow goes through the game&#8217;s body. They will kill the Muslims but will not  disturb the idolaters. If I should live up to their time&#8217; I will kill them as the people  of &#8216;Ad were killed (i.e. I will kill all of them).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet entered the Ka&#8217;ba and found in it the pictures  of (Prophet) Abraham and Mary. On that he said&#8217; &#8220;What is the matter with them ( i.e.  Quraish)? They have already heard that angels do not enter a house in which there are  pictures; yet this is the picture of Abraham. And why is he depicted as practicing  divination by arrows?&#8221; </font></p>

By Allah, neither Abraham nor Ishmael practiced divination by arrows.&#8221; </font></p>

Twice  for the Sake of Allah when he said, &#8220;I am sick,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;(I have not  done this but) the big idol has done it.&#8221; The (third was) that while Abraham and  Sarah (his wife) were going (on a journey) they passed by (the territory of) a tyrant.  Someone said to the tyrant, &#8220;This man (i.e. Abraham) is accompanied by a very  charming lady.&#8221; So, he sent for Abraham and asked him about Sarah saying, &#8220;Who  is this lady?&#8221; Abraham said, &#8220;She is my sister.&#8221; Abraham went to Sarah and  said, &#8220;O Sarah! There are no believers on the surface of the earth except you and I.  This man asked me about you and I have told him that you are my sister, so don&#8217;t  contradict my statement.&#8221; The tyrant then called Sarah and when she went to him, he  tried to take hold of her with his hand, but (his hand got stiff and) he was confounded.  He asked Sarah. &#8220;Pray to Allah for me, and I shall not harm you.&#8221; So Sarah asked  Allah to cure him and he got cured. He tried to take hold of her for the second time, but  (his hand got as stiff as or stiffer than before and) was more confounded. He again  requested Sarah, &#8220;Pray to Allah for me, and I will not harm you.&#8221; Sarah asked  Allah again and he became alright. He then called one of his guards (who had brought her)  and said, &#8220;You have not brought me a human being but have brought me a devil.&#8221;  The tyrant then gave Hajar as a girl-servant to Sarah. Sarah came back (to Abraham) while  he was praying. Abraham, gesturing with his hand, asked, &#8220;What has happened?&#8221;  She replied, &#8220;Allah has spoiled the evil plot of the infidel (or immoral person) and  gave me Hajar for service.&#8221; (Abu Huraira then addressed his listeners saying,  &#8220;That (Hajar) was your mother, O Bani Ma-is-Sama (i.e. the Arabs, the descendants of  Ishmael, Hajar&#8217;s son).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;May Allah bestow His Mercy on the  mother of Ishmael! Had she not hastened (to fill her water-skin with water from the  Zam-zam well). Zam-zam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.&#8221;  Ibn &#8216;Abbas further added, &#8220;(The Prophet) Abraham brought Ishmael and his mother (to  Mecca) and she was suckling Ishmael and she had a water-skin with her.&#8217; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 55, Number 583: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The first lady to use a girdle was the mother of Ishmael.  She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah. Abraham brought her and  her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka&#8217;ba under a tree on the  spot of Zam-zam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in  Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a  leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set  out homeward. Ishmael&#8217;s mother followed him saying, &#8220;O Abraham! Where are you going,  leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is  there anything (to enjoy)?&#8221; She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look  back at her Then she asked him, &#8220;Has Allah ordered you to do so?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Then He will not neglect us,&#8221; and returned while  Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he  faced the Ka&#8217;ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a  valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Kaba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord,  that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards  them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks.&#8217; (14.37)  Ishmael&#8217;s mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she  became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e.  Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and  found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on  it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could  not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked  up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed  the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting  to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa  and Marwa) seven times.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;This is the source of the tradition  of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa). When she reached the Marwa  (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened  attentively. She heard the voice again and said, &#8216;O, (whoever you may be)! You have made  me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?&#8221; And behold! She saw an angel  at the place of Zam-zam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed  from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in  this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was  flowing out after she had scooped some of it.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet added, &#8220;May Allah bestow Mercy on  Ishmael&#8217;s mother! Had she let the Zam-zam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she  not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zam-zam would have been a stream  flowing on the surface of the earth.&#8221; The Prophet further added, &#8220;Then she drank  (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, &#8216;Don&#8217;t be afraid of being neglected,  for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah  never neglects His people.&#8217; The House (i.e. Kaba) at that time was on a high place  resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived  in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by  her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada&#8217;.  They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying  around water and not leaving it. They said, &#8216;This bird must be flying around water, though  we know that there is no water in this valley.&#8217; They sent one or two messengers who  discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all  came (towards the water).&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Ishmael&#8217;s mother was sitting near  the water. They asked her, &#8216;Do you allow us to stay with you?&#8221; She replied, &#8216;Yes, but  you will have no right to possess the water.&#8217; They agreed to that.&#8221; The Prophet  further said, &#8220;Ishmael&#8217;s mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to  love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent  for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent  residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his  virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of  puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>After Ishmael&#8217;s mother had died, Abraham came after  Ishmael&#8217;s marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find  Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmael&#8217;s wife about him, she replied, &#8216;He has gone in search  of our livelihood.&#8217; Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and  she replied, &#8216;We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution,&#8217;  complaining to him. He said, &#8216;When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and  tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house).&#8217; When Ishmael came, he seemed  to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, &#8216;Has anyone visited you?&#8217; She  replied, &#8216;Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I  informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living  in a hardship and poverty.&#8217; On that Ishmael said, &#8216;Did he advise you anything?&#8217; She  replied, &#8216;Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the  threshold of your gate.&#8217; Ishmael said, &#8216;It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce  you. Go back to your family.&#8217; So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from  amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as  Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmael&#8217;s  wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, &#8216;He has gone in search of our livelihood.&#8217;  Abraham asked her, &#8216;How are you getting on?&#8217; asking her about their sustenance and living.  She replied, &#8216;We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance).&#8217; Then  she thanked Allah&#8217; Abraham said, &#8216;What kind of food do you eat?&#8217; She said. &#8216;Meat.&#8217; He  said, &#8216;What do you drink?&#8217; She said, &#8216;Water.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Allah! Bless their  meat and water.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;At that time they did not have grain, and  if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.&#8221; The Prophet added,  &#8220;If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition  will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.&#8221; The Prophet added,&#8221; Then  Abraham said Ishmael&#8217;s wife, &#8220;When your husband comes, give my regards to him and  tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate.&#8217; When Ishmael came back, he  asked his wife, &#8216;Did anyone call on you?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;Yes, a good-looking old man came  to me,&#8217; so she praised him and added. &#8216;He asked about you, and I informed him, and he  asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition.&#8217; Ishmael asked  her, &#8216;Did he give you any piece of advice?&#8217; She said, &#8216;Yes, he told me to give his regards  to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate.&#8217; On that Ishmael  said, &#8216;It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to  keep you with me.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as  Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam,  sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted  each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, &#8216;O  Ishmael! Allah has given me an order.&#8217; Ishmael said, &#8216;Do what your Lord has ordered you to  do.&#8217; Abraham asked, &#8216;Will you help me?&#8217; Ishmael said, &#8216;I will help you.&#8217; Abraham said,  Allah has ordered me to build a house here,&#8217; pointing to a hillock higher than the land  surrounding it.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Then they raised the foundations of the  House (i.e. the Ka&#8217;ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the  walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and  carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were  saying, &#8216;O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the  All-Knowing.&#8217; The Prophet added, &#8220;Then both of them went on building and going round  the Ka&#8217;ba saying: O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the  All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.&#8221; (2.127) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 55, Number 584: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Abraham had differences with his wife), (because of  her jealousy of Hajar, Ishmael&#8217;s mother), he took Ishmael and his mother and went away.  They had a water-skin with them containing some water, Ishmael&#8217;s mother used to drink  water from the water-skin so that her milk would increase for her child. When Abraham  reached Mecca, he made her sit under a tree and afterwards returned home. Ishmael&#8217;s mother  followed him, and when they reached Kada&#8217;, she called him from behind, &#8216;O Abraham! To whom  are you leaving us?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;(I am leaving you) to Allah&#8217;s (Care).&#8217; She said, &#8216;I am  satisfied to be with Allah.&#8217; She returned to her place and started drinking water from the  water-skin, and her milk increased for her child. When the water had all been used up, she  said to herself, &#8216;I&#8217;d better go and look so that I may see somebody.&#8217; She ascended the  Safa mountain and looked, hoping to see somebody, but in vain. When she came down to the  valley, she ran till she reached the Marwa mountain. She ran to and fro (between the two  mountains) many times. They she said to herself, &#8216;i&#8217;d better go and see the state of the  child,&#8217; she went and found it in a state of one on the point of dying. She could not  endure to watch it dying and said (to herself), &#8216;If I go and look, I may find somebody.&#8217;  She went and ascended the Safa mountain and looked for a long while but could not find  anybody. Thus she completed seven rounds (of running) between Safa and Marwa. Again she  said (to herself), &#8216;I&#8217;d better go back and see the state of the child.&#8217; But suddenly she  heard a voice, and she said to that strange voice, &#8216;Help us if you can offer any help.&#8217;  Lo! It was Gabriel (who had made the voice). Gabriel hit the earth with his heel like this  (Ibn &#8216;Abbas hit the earth with his heel to Illustrate it), and so the water gushed out.  Ishmael&#8217;s mother was astonished and started digging. (Abu Al-Qasim) (i.e. the Prophet)  said, &#8220;If she had left the water, (flow naturally without her intervention), it would  have been flowing on the surface of the earth.&#8221;) Ishmael&#8217;s mother started drinking  from the water and her milk increased for her child . Afterwards some people of the tribe  of Jurhum, while passing through the bottom of the valley, saw some birds, and that  astonished them, and they said, &#8216;Birds can only be found at a place where there is water.&#8217;  They sent a messenger who searched the place and found the water, and returned to inform  them about it. Then they all went to her and said, &#8216;O ishmael&#8217;s mother! Will you allow us  to be with you (or dwell with you)?&#8217; (And thus they stayed there.) Later on her boy  reached the age of puberty and married a lady from them. Then an idea occurred to Abraham  which he disclosed to his wife (Sarah), &#8216;I want to call on my dependents I left (at  Mecca).&#8217; When he went there, he greeted (Ishmael&#8217;s wife) and said, &#8216;Where is Ishmael?&#8217; She  replied, &#8216;He has gone out hunting.&#8217; Abraham said (to her), &#8216;When he comes, tell him to  change the threshold of his gate.&#8217; When he came, she told him the same whereupon Ishmael  said to her, &#8216;You are the threshold, so go to your family (i.e. you are divorced).&#8217; Again  Abraham thought of visiting his dependents whom he had left (at Mecca), and he told his  wife (Sarah) of his intentions. Abraham came to Ishmael&#8217;s house and asked. &#8220;Where is  Ishmael?&#8221; Ishmael&#8217;s wife replied, &#8220;He has gone out hunting,&#8221; and added,  &#8220;Will you stay (for some time) and have something to eat and drink?&#8217; Abraham asked,  &#8216;What is your food and what is your drink?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;Our food is meat and our drink  is water.&#8217; He said, &#8216;O Allah! Bless their meals and their drink.&#8221; Abu Al-Qa-sim (i.e.  Prophet) said, &#8220;Because of Abraham&#8217;s invocation there are blessings (in Mecca).&#8221;  Once more Abraham thought of visiting his family he had left (at Mecca), so he told his  wife (Sarah) of his decision. He went and found Ishmael behind the Zam-zam well, mending  his arrows. He said, &#8220;O Ishmael, Your Lord has ordered me to build a house for  Him.&#8221; Ishmael said, &#8220;Obey (the order of) your Lord.&#8221; Abraham said,  &#8220;Allah has also ordered me that you should help me therein.&#8221; Ishmael said,  &#8220;Then I will do.&#8221; So, both of them rose and Abraham started building (the Ka&#8217;ba)  while Ishmael went on handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, &#8220;O our  Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the  All-Knowing.&#8221; (2.127). When the building became high and the old man (i.e. Abraham)  could no longer lift the stones (to such a high position), he stood over the stone of  Al-Maqam and Ishmael carried on handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, &#8216;O  our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily You are All-Hearing, All-Knowing.&#8221;  (2.127) </font></p>

Even if I took an oath, you would  not believe me, and if I put forward an excuse, You would not excuse me. My example and  your example is just like that example of Jacob and his sons. Against that which you  assert, it is Allah (Alone) Whose Help can be sought.&#8217; (12.18) The Prophet left and then  Allah revealed the Verses (concerning the matter), and on that &#8216;Aisha said, &#8216;Thanks to  Allah (only) and not to anybody else.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked &#8216;Aisha the wife of the Prophet about the meaning of  the following Verse: &#8212; &#8220;(Respite will be granted) &#8216;Until when the apostles give up  hope (of their people) and thought that they were denied (by their  people)&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;(12.110) &#8216;Aisha replied, &#8220;Really, their nations did not  believe them.&#8221; I said, &#8220;By Allah! They were definite that their nations treated  them as liars and it was not a matter of suspecting.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;O &#8216;Uraiya  (i.e. &#8216;Urwa)! No doubt, they were quite sure about it.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I said, &#8220;May the Verse be read in such a way as to  mean that the apostles thought that Allah did not help them?&#8221; Aisha said, &#8220;Allah  forbid! (Impossible) The Apostles did not suspect their Lord of such a thing. But this  Verse is concerned with the Apostles&#8217; followers who had faith in their Lord and believed  in their apostles and their period of trials was long and Allah&#8217;s Help was delayed till  the apostles gave up hope for the conversion of the disbelievers amongst their nation and  suspected that even their followers were shaken in their belief, Allah&#8217;s Help then came to  them.&#8221; Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: The Prophet said, &#8220;The honorable, the son of the  honorable, the son of the honorable, (was) Joseph, the son of Jacob! the son of Isaac, the  son of Abraham.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That he differed with Al-Hur bin Qais Al-Fazari regarding  the companion of Moses. Ibn &#8216;Abbas said that he was Al-Khadir. Meanwhile Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b  passed by them and Ibn &#8216;Abbas called him saying, &#8220;My friend and I have differed  regarding Moses&#8217; companion whom Moses asked the way to meet. Have you heard Allah&#8217;s  Apostle mentioning something about him?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle  saying, &#8216;While Moses was sitting in the company of some Israelites, a man came and asked  (him), &#8216;Do you know anyone who is more learned than you?&#8217; Moses replied, &#8216;No.&#8217; So, Allah  sent the Divine Inspiration to Moses: &#8216;Yes, Our slave, Khadir (is more learned than you).&#8217;  Moses asked how to meet him (i.e. Khadir). So, the fish, was made, as a sign for him, and  he was told that when the fish was lost, he should return and there he would meet him. So,  Moses went on looking for the sign of the fish in the sea. The servant boy of Moses said  to him, &#8216;Do you know that when we were sitting by the side of the rock, I forgot the fish,  and t was only Satan who made me forget to tell (you) about it.&#8217; Moses said, That was what  we were seeking after,&#8217; and both of them returned, following their footmarks and found  Khadir; and what happened further to them, is mentioned in Allah&#8217;s Book.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Said bin Jubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I said to Ibn Abbas, &#8220;Nauf Al-Bukah claims that Moses,  the companion of Al-Khadir was not Moses (the prophet) of the children of Israel, but some  other Moses.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s enemy (i.e. Nauf) has told a lie. Ubai  bin Ka&#8217;b told us that the Prophet said, &#8216;Once Moses stood up and addressed Bani Israel. He  was asked who was the most learned man amongst the people. He said, &#8216;I.&#8217; Allah admonished  him as he did not attribute absolute knowledge to Him (Allah). So, Allah said to him,  &#8216;Yes, at the junction of the two seas there is a Slave of Mine who is more learned than  you.&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;O my Lord! How can I meet him?&#8217; Allah said, &#8216;Take a fish and put it in  a large basket and you will find him at the place where you will lose the fish.&#8217; Moses  took a fish and put it in a basket and proceeded along with his (servant) boy, Yusha &#8216;bin  Nun, till they reached the rock where they laid their heads (i.e. lay down). Moses slept,  and the fish, moving out of the basket, fell into the sea. It took its way into the sea  (straight) as in a tunnel. Allah stopped the flow of water over the fish and it became  like an arch (the Prophet pointed out this arch with his hands). They travelled the rest  of the night, and the next day Moses said to his boy (servant), &#8216;Give us our food, for  indeed, we have suffered much fatigue in this journey of ours.&#8217; Moses did not feel tired  till he crossed that place which Allah had ordered him to seek after. His boy (servant)  said to him, &#8216;Do you know that when we were sitting near that rock, I forgot the fish, and  none but Satan caused me to forget to tell (you) about it, and it took its course into the  sea in an amazing way?.&#8217; So there was a path for the fish and that astonished them. Moses  said, &#8216;That was what we were seeking after.&#8217; So, both of them retraced their footsteps  till they reached the rock. There they saw a man Lying covered with a garment. Moses  greeted him and he replied saying, &#8216;How do people greet each other in your land?&#8217; Moses  said, &#8216;I am Moses.&#8217; The man asked, &#8216;Moses of Bani Israel?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;Yes, I have come  to you so that you may teach me from those things which Allah has taught you.&#8217; He said, &#8216;O  Moses! I have some of the Knowledge of Allah which Allah has taught me, and which you do  not know, while you have some of the Knowledge of Allah which Allah has taught you and  which I do not know.&#8217; Moses asked, &#8216;May I follow you?&#8217; He said, &#8216;But you will not be able  to remain patient with me for how can you be patient about things which you will not be  able to understand?&#8217; (Moses said, &#8216;You will find me, if Allah so will, truly patient, and  I will not disobey you in aught.&#8217;) So, both of them set out walking along the sea-shore, a  boat passed by them and they asked the crew of the boat to take them on board. The crew  recognized Al-Khadir and so they took them on board without fare. When they were on board  the boat, a sparrow came and stood on the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once or  twice into the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses, &#8216;O Moses! My knowledge and your knowledge  have not decreased Allah&#8217;s Knowledge except as much as this sparrow has decreased the  water of the sea with its beak.&#8217; Then suddenly Al-Khadir took an adze and plucked a plank,  and Moses did not notice it till he had plucked a plank with the adze. Moses said to him,  &#8216;What have you done? They took us on board charging us nothing; yet you I have  intentionally made a hole in their boat so as to drown its passengers. Verily, you have  done a dreadful thing.&#8217; Al-Khadir replied, &#8216;Did I not tell you that you would not be able  to remain patient with me?&#8217; Moses replied, &#8216;Do not blame me for what I have forgotten, and  do not be hard upon me for my fault.&#8217; So the first excuse of Moses was that he had  forgotten. When they had left the sea, they passed by a boy playing with other boys. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Al-Khadir took hold of the boys head and plucked it with  his hand like this. (Sufyan, the sub narrator pointed with his fingertips as if he was  plucking some fruit.) Moses said to him, &#8220;Have you killed an innocent person who has  not killed any person? You have really done a horrible thing.&#8221; Al-Khadir said,  &#8220;Did I not tell you that you could not remain patient with me?&#8217; Moses said &#8220;If I  ask you about anything after this, don&#8217;t accompany me. You have received an excuse from  me.&#8217; Then both of them went on till they came to some people of a village, and they asked  its inhabitant for wood but they refused to entertain them as guests. Then they saw  therein a wall which was just going to collapse (and Al Khadir repaired it just by  touching it with his hands). (Sufyan, the sub-narrator, pointed with his hands,  illustrating how Al-Khadir passed his hands over the wall upwards.) Moses said,  &#8220;These are the people whom we have called on, but they neither gave us food, nor  entertained us as guests, yet you have repaired their wall. If you had wished, you could  have taken wages for it.&#8221; Al-Khadir said, &#8220;This is the parting between you and  me, and I shall tell you the explanation of those things on which you could not remain  patient.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;We wished that Moses could have remained patient  by virtue of which Allah might have told us more about their story. (Sufyan the  sub-narrator said that the Prophet said, &#8220;May Allah bestow His Mercy on Moses! If he  had remained patient, we would have been told further about their case.&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;(The Prophet) Moses was a shy  person and used to cover his body completely because of his extensive shyness. One of the  children of Israel hurt him by saying, &#8216;He covers his body in this way only because of  some defect in his skin, either leprosy or scrotal hernia, or he has some other defect.&#8217;  Allah wished to clear Moses of what they said about him, so one day while Moses was in  seclusion, he took off his clothes and put them on a stone and started taking a bath. When  he had finished the bath, he moved towards his clothes so as to take them, but the stone  took his clothes and fled; Moses picked up his stick and ran after the stone saying, &#8216;O  stone! Give me my garment!&#8217; Till he reached a group of Bani Israel who saw him naked then,  and found him the best of what Allah had created, and Allah cleared him of what they had  accused him of. The stone stopped there and Moses took and put his garment on and started  hitting the stone with his stick. By Allah, the stone still has some traces of the  hitting, three, four or five marks. This was what Allah refers to in His Saying:&#8211; &#8220;O  you who believe! Be you not like those Who annoyed Moses, But Allah proved his innocence  of that which they alleged, And he was honorable In Allah&#8217;s Sight.&#8221; (33.69) </font></p>

So fast (sometimes) and do not fast (sometimes). Pray and  sleep. Fast for three days a month, for the reward of a good deed is multiplied by ten  time, and so the fasting of three days a month equals the fasting of a year.&#8221; I said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I can do (fast) more than this.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Fast on  every third day.

So fast three days a month, for this will be the fasting of a whole year, or equal  to the fasting of a whole year.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I find myself able to fast more.&#8221;  He said, &#8220;Then fast like the fasting of (the Prophet) David who used to fast on  alternate days and would not flee on facing the enemy.&#8221; </font></p>

How excellent (a) slave he was ever  oft-returning in repentance (to us) (38.30) And His Statement:&#8211; He said: My Lord Forgive  me and grant me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me.&#8217; (38.35) And His  Statement:&#8211; &#8216;And they followed what the Devils gave out (falsely), of magic in the  life-time of Solomon.&#8217; (2.102) </font></p>

A wolf came and took away the child of one of them, whereupon the other  said, &#8216;It has taken your child.&#8217; The first said, &#8216;But it has taken your child.&#8217; So they  both carried the case before David who judged that the living child be given to the elder  lady. So both of them went to Solomon bin David and informed him (of the case). He said,  &#8216;Bring me a knife so as to cut the child into two pieces and distribute it between them.&#8217;  The younger lady said, &#8216;May Allah be merciful to you! Don&#8217;t do that, for it is her (i.e.  the other lady&#8217;s) child.&#8217; So he gave the child to the younger lady.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;None spoke in cradle but three:  (The first was) Jesus, (the second was), there a man from Bani Israel called Juraij. While  he was offering his prayers, his mother came and called him. He said (to himself), &#8216;Shall  I answer her or keep on praying?&#8221; (He went on praying) and did not answer her, his  mother said, &#8220;O Allah! Do not let him die till he sees the faces of  prostitutes.&#8221; So while he was in his hermitage, a lady came and sought to seduce him,  but he refused. So she went to a shepherd and presented herself to him to commit illegal  sexual intercourse with her and then later she gave birth to a child and claimed that it  belonged to Juraij. The people, therefore, came to him and dismantled his hermitage and  expelled him out of it and abused him. Juraij performed the ablution and offered prayer,  and then came to the child and said, &#8216;O child! Who is your father?&#8217; The child replied,  &#8216;The shepherd.&#8217; (After hearing this) the people said, &#8216;We shall rebuild your hermitage of  gold,&#8217; but he said, &#8216;No, of nothing but mud.'(The third was the hero of the following  story) A lady from Bani Israel was nursing her child at her breast when a handsome rider  passed by her. She said, &#8216;O Allah ! Make my child like him.&#8217; On that the child left her  breast, and facing the rider said, &#8216;O Allah! Do not make me like him.&#8217; The child then  started to suck her breast again. (Abu Huraira further said, &#8220;As if I were now  looking at the Prophet sucking his finger (in way of demonstration.&#8221;) After a while  the people passed by, with a lady slave and she (i.e. the child&#8217;s mother) said, &#8216;O Allah!  Do not make my child like this (slave girl)!, On that the child left her breast and said,  &#8216;O Allah! Make me like her.&#8217; When she asked why, the child replied, &#8216;The rider is one of  the tyrants while this slave girl is falsely accused of theft and illegal sexual  intercourse.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;ari: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Give food to the hungry, pay a  visit to the sick and release (set free) the one in captivity (by paying his  ransom).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 65, Number 287i: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once while I was in a state of fatigue (because of severe  hunger), I met &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab, so I asked him to recite a verse from Allah&#8217;s Book to  me. He entered his house and interpreted it to me. (Then I went out and) after walking for  a short distance, I fell on my face because of fatigue and severe hunger. Suddenly I saw  Allah&#8217;s Apostle standing by my head. He said, &#8220;O Abu Huraira!&#8221; I replied,  &#8220;Labbaik, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and Sadaik!&#8221; Then he held me by the hand, and made  me get up. Then he came to know what I was suffering from. He took me to his house, and  ordered a big bowl of milk for me. I drank thereof and he said, &#8220;Drink more, O Abu  Hirr!&#8221; So I drank again, whereupon he again said, &#8220;Drink more.&#8221; So I drank  more till my belly became full and looked like a bowl. Afterwards I met &#8216;Umar and  mentioned to him what had happened to me, and said to him, &#8220;Somebody, who had more  right than you, O &#8216;Umar, took over the case. By Allah, I asked you to recite a Verse to me  while I knew it better than you.&#8221; On that Umar said to me, &#8220;By Allah, if I  admitted and entertained you, it would have been dearer to me than having nice red camels.  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Umar bin Abi Salama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I was a boy under the care of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and my hand  used to go around the dish while I was eating. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to me, &#8216;O boy!  Mention the Name of Allah and eat with your right hand, and eat of the dish what is nearer  to you.&#8221; Since then I have applied those instructions when eating. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Who was the son of Um Salama, the wife of the Prophet: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once I ate a meal with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I was eating  from all sides of the dish. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to me, &#8220;Eat of the dish what is  nearer to you.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 65, Number 290: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Wahb bin Kaisan Abi Nu&#8217;aim: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A meal was brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle while his step-son,  &#8216;Umar bin Abi Salama was with him. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to him, &#8220;Mention the Name of  Allah and eat of the dish what is nearer to you.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 65, Number 291: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A tailor invited Allah&#8217;s Apostle to a meal which he had  prepared. I went along with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and saw him seeking to eat the pieces of gourd  from the various sides of the dish. Since that day I have liked to eat gourd. &#8216;Umar bin  Abi Salama said: The Prophet, said to me, &#8220;Eat with your right hand.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 65, Number 292: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet used to love to start doing things from the  right side whenever possible, in performing ablution, putting on his shoes, and combing  his hair. (Al-Ash&#8217;ath said: The Prophet used to do so in all his affairs.) </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.065.293"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 65, Number 293: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Talha said to Um Sulaim, &#8220;I have heard the voice  of Allah&#8217;s Apostle which was feeble, and I think that he is hungry. Have you got something  (to eat)?&#8221; She took out some loaves of barley bread, then took her face-covering  sheet and wrapped the bread in part of it, and pushed it under my garment and turned the  rest of it around my body and sent me to Allah&#8217;s Apostle . I went with that, and found  Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the mosque with some people. I stood up near them, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle  asked me, &#8220;Have you been sent by Abu Talha?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He asked,  &#8220;With some food (for us)?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to  all those who were with him, &#8220;Get up!&#8221; He set out (and all the people  accompanied him) and I proceeded ahead of them till I came to Abu Talha. Abu Talha then  said, &#8220;O Um Sulaim! Allah&#8217;s Apostle has arrived along with the people, and we do not  have food enough to feed them all.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know  better.&#8221; So Abu Talha went out till he met Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Then Abu Talha and  Allah&#8217;s Apostle came and entered the house. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Um Sulaim ! Bring  whatever you have.&#8221; She brought that very bread. The Prophet ordered that it be  crushed into small pieces, and Um Sulaim pressed a skin of butter on it. Then Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said whatever Allah wished him to say (to bless the food) and then added,  &#8220;Admit ten (men).&#8221; So they were admitted, ate their fill and went out. The  Prophet then said, &#8220;Admit ten (more).&#8221; They were admitted, ate their full, and  went out. He then again said, &#8220;Admit ten more!&#8221; They were admitted, ate their  fill, and went out. He admitted ten more, and so all those people ate their fill, and they  were eighty men. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 65, Number 294: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were one hundred and thirty men sitting with the  Prophet. The Prophet said, &#8220;Have anyone of you any food with him?&#8221; It happened  that one man had one Sa of wheat flour (or so) which was turned into dough then. After a  while a tall lanky pagan came, driving some sheep. The Prophet asked, &#8216;Will you sell us (a  sheep), or give (it to) us as a gift?&#8221; The pagan said, &#8220;No, but I will sell it  &#8221; So the Prophet bought from him a sheep which was slaughtered, and then the Prophet  ordered that the liver, the kidneys, lungs and heart, etc., of that sheep be roasted. By  Allah, none of those one hundred and thirty men but had his share of those things. The  Prophet gave to those who were present, and also kept a share for those who were absent He  then served that cooked sheep in two big trays and we all ate together our fill; yet there  remained a part of it in those two trays which I carried on the camel. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha : </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet died when we had satisfied our hunger with the  two black things, i.e. dates and water. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 65, Number 296: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Suwaid bin An-Nu&#8217;man: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We went out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle to Khaibar, and when we  were at As-Sahba&#8217;, (Yahya, a sub-narrator said, &#8220;As-Sahba&#8217; is a place at a distance  of one day&#8217;s journey to Khaibar).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked the people to bring their  food, but there was nothing with the people except Sawiq. So we all chewed and ate of it.  Then the Prophet asked for some water and he rinsed his mouth, and we too, rinsed our  mouths. Then he led us in the Maghrib prayer without performing ablution (again). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>To the best of my knowledge, the Prophet did not take his  meals in a big tray at all, nor did he ever eat well-baked thin bread, nor did he ever eat  at a dining table. </font></p>

I have lost my eyesight and I  lead my people in the prayer (as an Imam). When it rains, the valley which is between me  and my people, flows with water, and then I cannot go to their mosque to lead them in the  prayer. O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I wish that you could come and pray in my house so that I may  take it as a praying place. The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah willing, I will do that.&#8221;  The next morning, soon after the sun had risen, Allah&#8217;s Apostle came with Abu Bakr. The  Prophet asked for the permission to enter and I admitted him. The Prophet had not sat till  he had entered the house and said to me, &#8220;Where do you like me to pray in your  house?&#8221; I pointed at a place in my house whereupon he stood and said, &#8220;Allahu  Akbar.&#8221; We lined behind him and he prayed two Rakat and finished it with Taslim. We  then requested him to stay for a special meal of Khazira which we had prepared. A large  number of men from the adjoining area gathered in the house. One of them said, &#8220;Where  is Malik bin Ad-Dukhshun?&#8221; Another man said, &#8220;He is a hypocrite and does not  love Allah and His Apostle.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Do not say so. Do you not think  that he has said: &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah,&#8221; seeking  Allah&#8217;s pleasure? The man said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better, but we have  always seen him mixing with hypocrites and giving them advice.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Allah has forbidden the (Hell) Fire for those who testify that none has the right to  be worshipped but Allah, seeking Allah&#8217;s pleasure. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked &#8216;Aisha &#8220;Did the Prophet forbid eating the meat  of sacrifices offered on &#8216;Id-ul-Adha for more than three days&#8221; She said, &#8220;The  Prophet did not do this except in the year when the people were hungry, so he wanted the  rich to feed the poor. But later we used to store even a trotter of a sheep to eat it  fifteen days later.&#8221; She was asked, &#8220;What compelled you to do so?&#8221; She  smiled and said, &#8220;The family of Muhammad did not eat to their satisfaction white  bread with meat soup for three successive days till he met Allah.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to Abu Talha, &#8220;Seek one of your  boys to serve me.&#8221; Abu Talha mounted me behind him (on his riding animal) and took me  (to the Prophet ). So I used to serve Allah&#8217;s Apostle whenever he dismounted (to stay  somewhere). I used to hear him saying very often, &#8220;O Allah! I seek refuge with You  from, having worries sadness, helplessness, laziness, miserliness, cowardice, from being  heavily in debt and from being overpowered by other persons unjustly.&#8221; I kept on  serving till we -returned from the battle of Khaibar. The Prophet then brought Safiyya  bint Huyai whom he had won from the war booty. I saw him folding up a gown or a garment  for her to sit on behind him (on his she-camel). When he reached As-Sahba&#8217;, he prepared  Hais and placed it on a dining sheet. Then he sent me to invite men, who (came and) ate;  and that was his and Safiyya&#8217;s wedding banquet. Then the Prophet proceeded, and when he  saw (noticed) the mountain of Uhud, he said, &#8220;This mountain loves us, and we love  it.&#8221; When we approached Medina, he said, &#8220;O Allah! I make the area between its  two mountains a sanctuary as Abraham has made Mecca a sanctuary. O Allah! Bless their Mudd  and Sa (special kinds of measure).&#8221; </font></p>

The Prophet asked for lunch, and he was presented  with bread and some extra food from the home-made Udm (e.g. soup). He asked, &#8220;Don&#8217;t I  see meat (being cooked)?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

That year the land was not promising, so the payment of the debt was delayed one year. The  Jew came to me at the time of plucking, but gathered nothing from my land. I asked him to  give me one year respite, but he refused. This news reached the Prophet whereupon he said  to his companions, &#8220;Let us go and ask the Jew for respite for Jabir.&#8221; All of  them came to me in my garden, and the Prophet started speaking to the Jew, but he Jew  said, &#8220;O Abu Qasim! I will not grant him respite.&#8221; When the Prophet saw the  Jew&#8217;s attitude, he stood up and walked all around the garden and came again and talked to  the Jew, but the Jew refused his request. I got up and brought some ripe fresh dates and  put it in front of the Prophet. He ate and then said to me, &#8220;Where is your hut, O  Jabir?&#8221; I informed him, and he said, &#8220;Spread out a bed for me in it.&#8221; I  spread out a bed, and he entered and slept. When he woke up, I brought some dates to him  again and he ate of it and then got up and talked to the Jew again, but the Jew again  refused his request. Then the Prophet got up for the second time amidst the palm trees  loaded with fresh dates, and said, &#8220;O Jabir! Pluck dates to repay your debt.&#8221;  The Jew remained with me while I was plucking the dates, till I paid him all his right,  yet there remained extra quantity of dates. So I went out and proceeded till I reached the  Prophet and informed him of the good news, whereupon he said, &#8220;I testify that I am  Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; </font></p>

He replied, &#8220;It is not essential,&#8221; and added,  &#8220;We never used to get such kind of food during the lifetime of the Prophet except  rarely; and if at all we got such a dish, we did not have any handkerchiefs to wipe our  hands with except the palms of our hands, our forearms and our feet. We would perform the  prayer thereafter with-out performing new ablution.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever the Prophet finished his meals (or when his dining  sheet was taken away), he used to say. &#8220;Praise be to Allah Who has satisfied our  needs and quenched our thirst.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated .Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;When your servant brings your food  to you, if you do not ask him to join you, then at least ask him to take one or two  handfuls, for he has suffered from its heat (while cooking it) and has taken pains to cook  it nicely.&#8221; </font></p>

A (sixth) man followed them. The Prophet said, &#8220;O Abu Shu&#8217;aib! Another  man has followed us. If you wish, you may invite him; and if you wish, you may refuse  him.&#8221; Abu Shu&#8217;aib said, &#8220;No, I will admit him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I know (about) the Hijab (the order of veiling of women)  more than anybody else. Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b used to ask me about it. Allah&#8217;s Apostle became the  bridegroom of Zainab bint Jahsh whom he married at Medina. After the sun had risen high in  the sky, the Prophet invited the people to a meal. Allah&#8217;s Apostle remained sitting and  some people remained sitting with him after the other guests had left. Then Allah&#8217;s  Apostle got up and went away, and I too, followed him till he reached the door of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s  room. Then he thought that the people must have left the place by then, so he returned and  I also returned with him. Behold, the people were still sitting at their places. So he  went back again for the second time, and I went along with him too. When we reached the  door of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s room, he returned and I also returned with him to see that the people had  left. Thereupon the Prophet hung a curtain between me and him and the Verse regarding the  order for (veiling of women) Hijab was revealed. </font></p>
