										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and said; &#8220;I am hard pressed by hunger.<span class="hadithgreentxt">&#8221;</span> He (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) sent a word to one of his wives who replied: &#8220;By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, I have nothing except water.&#8221; Then he sent the same message to another (wife) and received the same reply. He sent this message to all of them (i.e., his wives) and received the same reply. Then he (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said,<span class="hadithtxt"> &#8220;Who will entertain this (man) as guest?&#8221;</span> One of the Ansar said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, I will<span class="hadithgreentxt">.</span>&#8221; So he took him home and said to his wife: &#8220;Serve the guest of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: The Ansari asked his wife: &#8220;Have you got anything?&#8221; She answered: &#8220;Nothing, except a little food for the children.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Keep them busy with something, and when they ask for food put them to sleep. When the guest enters, extinguish the light and give him the impression that we are also eating.&#8221; So they sat down and the guest ate and they passed the night hungry. When he came to the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) in the morning, he said to him,<span class="hadithtxt"> &#8220;<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Allah admired what you did with your guest last night.</strong></span>&#8221;</span></p>
<p>[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p>Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="qurantxt">&#8220;And give them (Emigrants) preference over themselves, even though they were in need of that.&#8221;</span></strong>(59:9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="qurantxt">&#8220;<strong>And they give food, in spite of their love for it (or for the love of Him), to the poor, the orphan, and the captive</strong>.&#8221;</span> (76:8)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Dream of the Prophet Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sahih Bukhari</strong> Volume 9, Book 87, Number 171: [<small>Interpretation of Dreams ]</small> : <span style="line-height:1.5em;">Narrated Samura bin Jundub</span><strong style="line-height:1.5em;">:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah’s Apostle very often used to ask his companions, “Did anyone of you see a dream?” So dreams would be narrated to him by those whom Allah wished to tell.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One morning the Prophet said,</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>“Last night two persons came to me (in a dream) and woke me up and said to me, ‘Proceed!’</p>
<p>I set out with them and we came across a man Lying down, and behold, another man was standing over his head, holding a big rock. Behold, he was throwing the rock at the man’s head, injuring it. The rock rolled away and the thrower followed it and took it back. By the time he reached the man, his head returned to the normal state. The thrower then did the same as he had done before. I said to my two companions, ‘Subhan Allah! Who are these two persons?’ They said, ‘Proceed!’</p>
<p>So we proceeded and came to a man Lying flat on his back and another man standing over his head with an iron hook, and behold, he would put the hook in one side of the man’s mouth and tear off that side of his face to the back (of the neck) and similarly tear his nose from front to back and his eye from front to back. Then he turned to the other side of the man’s face and did just as he had done with the other side. He hardly completed this side when the other side returned to its normal state. Then he returned to it to repeat what he had done before. I said to my two companions, ‘Subhan Allah! Who are these two persons?’ They said to me, ‘Proceed!’</p>
<p>So we proceeded and came across something like a Tannur (a kind of baking oven, a pit usually clay-lined for baking bread).” I think the Prophet said, “In that oven there was much noise and voices.” The Prophet added, “We looked into it and found naked men and women, and behold, a flame of fire was reaching to them from underneath, and when it reached them, they cried loudly. I asked them, ‘Who are these?’ They said to me, ‘Proceed!’</p>
<p>And so we proceeded and came across a river.” I think he said, “…. red like blood.” The Prophet added, “And behold, in the river there was a man swimming, and on the bank there was a man who had collected many stones. Behold. while the other man was swimming, he went near him. The former opened his mouth and the latter (on the bank) threw a stone into his mouth whereupon he went swimming again. He returned and every time the performance was repeated, I asked my two companions, ‘Who are these (two) persons?’ They replied, ‘Proceed! Proceed!’</p>
<p>And we proceeded till we came to a man with a repulsive appearance, the most repulsive appearance, you ever saw a man having! Beside him there was a fire and he was kindling it and running around it. I asked my companions, ‘Who is this (man)?’ They said to me, ‘Proceed! Proceed!’</p>
<p>So we proceeded till we reached a garden of deep green dense vegetation, having all sorts of spring colors. In the midst of the garden there was a very tall man and I could hardly see his head because of his great height, and around him there were children in such a large number as I have never seen. I said to my companions, ‘Who is this?’ They replied, ‘Proceed! Proceed!’</p>
<p>So we proceeded till we came to a majestic huge garden, greater and better than I have ever seen! My two companions said to me, ‘Go up and I went up’ The Prophet added, “So we ascended till we reached a city built of gold and silver bricks and we went to its gate and asked (the gatekeeper) to open the gate, and it was opened and we entered the city and found in it, men with one side of their bodies as handsome as the handsomest person you have ever seen, and the other side as ugly as the ugliest person you have ever seen. My two companions ordered those men to throw themselves into the river. Behold, there was a river flowing across (the city), and its water was like milk in whiteness. Those men went and threw themselves in it and then returned to us after the ugliness (of their bodies) had disappeared and they became in the best shape.” The Prophet further added, “My two companions (angels) said to me, ‘This place is the Eden Paradise, and that is your place.’ I raised up my sight, and behold, there I saw a palace like a white cloud! My two companions said to me, ‘That (palace) is your place.’ I said to them, ‘May Allah bless you both! Let me enter it.’ They replied, ‘As for now, you will not enter it, but you shall enter it (one day)</p>
<p>I said to them, ‘I have seen many wonders tonight. What does all that mean which I have seen?’<br />
They replied, ‘We will inform you:</p>
<p>As for the first man you came upon whose head was being injured with the rock, he is the symbol of the one who studies the Quran and then neither recites it nor acts on its orders, and sleeps, neglecting the enjoined prayers.</p>
<p>As for the man you came upon whose sides of mouth, nostrils and eyes were torn off from front to back, he is the symbol of the man who goes out of his house in the morning and tells so many lies that it spreads all over the world. And</p>
<p>those naked men and women whom you saw in a construction resembling an oven, they are the adulterers and the adulteresses;,</p>
<p>and the man whom you saw swimming in the river and given a stone to swallow, is the eater of usury (Riba) and</p>
<p>the bad looking man whom you saw near the fire kindling it and going round it, is Malik, the gatekeeper of Hell and</p>
<p>the tall man whom you saw in the garden, is Abraham and the children around him are those children who die with Al-Fitra (the Islamic Faith).”</p>
<p>The narrator added: Some Muslims asked the Prophet, “O Allah’s Apostle! What about the children of pagans?” The Prophet replied, “And also the children of pagans.”</p>
<p>The Prophet added, “My two companions added,</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<div>
<p>‘The men you saw half handsome and half ugly were those persons who had mixed an act that was good with another that was bad, but Allah forgave them.’”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;line-height:1.5em;">Source : </span>Sahih Bukhari</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A number of miracles were bestowed upon and performed by Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) to establish the proof of his prophethood. The greatest miracle bestowed upon him was the revelation of the Qur&#8217;an. The Qur&#8217;an is miraculous in a number of aspects: Its linguistic perfection and inimitability, its validation by recent historical, archaeological, and scientific discoveries, its prophecies and so on. Unlike the miracles of other prophets before him, the miracle of the Qur&#8217;an is eternal. Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) also provided us with a number of true prophecies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Below are accounts of the some of the other miracles of Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) . Before reading these, it helps to know something about the Science of Traditions (Arabic: <i>Ahadith</i>), an exacting and comprehensive system developed by early Muslim scholars to verify the chain of transmission of these accounts, as well as investigating the trustworthiness and capability of every narrator at every level of the chain. This thorough authentication process ensures that these accounts are real, validated narrations of the sayings, actions, and tacit approvals of the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Traditions mentioned below are all from Sahih al-Bukhari, the most authentic collection of ahadith.</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Splitting of the Moon</li>
<li>Food Multiplication</li>
<li>Water Multiplication</li>
<li>Supplication for Rain</li>
<li>Lights to guide Companions</li>
<li>Crying of the stem of the Date-palm Tree</li>
<li>Glorification of Allah by the Prophet&#8217;s meals</li>
<li>The explusion of a liar&#8217;s corpse by the Earth</li>
<li>The Speech of the Wolf</li>
<li>The Prophet&#8217;s Night Journey to Jerusalem and Ascent to the Heavens</li>
</ol>
<h4 style="text-align:justify;"><a><strong>Splitting</strong></a><strong> of the Moon </strong></h4>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder&#8221; </i>[Qur&#8217;an 54:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Volume 6, Book 60, Number 388:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The moon was cleft asunder while we were in the company of the Prophet, and it became two parts. The Prophet said, Witness, witness (this miracle).&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><a><strong>Food</strong></a><strong> Multiplication</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 780:</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My father had died in debt. So I came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;My father (died) leaving unpaid debts, and I have nothing except the yield of his date palms; and their yield for many years will not cover his debts. So please come with me, so that the creditors may not misbehave with me.&#8221; The Prophet went round one of the heaps of dates and invoked (Allah), and then did the same with another heap and sat on it and said, &#8220;Measure (for them).&#8221; He paid them their rights and what remained was as much as had been paid to them.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><a><strong>Water</strong></a><strong> Multiplication</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 779:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We used to consider miracles as Allah&#8217;s Blessings, but you people consider them to be a warning. Once we were with Allah&#8217;s Apostle on a journey, and we ran short of water. He said, &#8220;Bring the water remaining with you.&#8221; The people brought a utensil containing a little water. He placed his hand in it and said, &#8220;Come to the blessed water, and the Blessing is from Allah.&#8221; I saw the water flowing from among the fingers of Allah&#8217;s Apostle , and no doubt, we heard the meal glorifying Allah, when it was being eaten (by him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 777:</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were one-thousand-and-four-hundred persons on the day of Al-Hudaibiya (Treaty), and (at) Al-Hudaibiya (there) was a well. We drew out its water not leaving even a single drop. The Prophet sat at the edge of the well and asked for some water with which he rinsed his mouth and then he threw it out into the well. We stayed for a short while and then drew water from the well and quenched our thirst, and even our riding animals drank water to their satisfaction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Volume 1, Book 7, Number 340:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Imran:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once we were traveling with the Prophet and we carried on traveling till the last part of the night and then we (halted at a place) and slept (deeply). There is nothing sweeter than sleep for a traveler in the last part of the night. So it was only the heat of the sun that made us to wake up and the first to wake up was so and so, then so and so and then so and so (the narrator &#8216;Auf said that Abu Raja&#8217; had told him their names but he had forgotten them) and the fourth person to wake up was &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab. And whenever the Prophet used to sleep, nobody would wake him up till he himself used to get up as we did not know what was happening (being revealed) to him in his sleep. So, &#8216;Umar got up and saw the condition of the people, and he was a strict man, so he said, &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221; and raised his voice with <i>Takbir</i>, and kept on saying it loudly till the Prophet got up because of it. When he got up, the people informed him about what had happened to them. He said, &#8220;There is no harm (or it will not be harmful). Depart!&#8221; So they departed from that place, and after covering some distance the Prophet stopped and asked for some water to perform the ablution. So he performed the ablution and the call for the prayer was pronounced and he led the people in prayer. After he finished from the prayer, he saw a man sitting aloof who had not prayed with the people. He asked, &#8220;O so and so! What has prevented you from praying with us?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I am <i>junub</i> and there is no water. &#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Perform <i>tayammum</i> with (clean) earth and that is sufficient for you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Prophet proceeded on and the people complained to him of thirst. Thereupon he got down and called a person (the narrator &#8216;Auf added that Abu Raja&#8217; had named him but he had forgotten) and &#8216;Ali, and ordered them to go and bring water. So they went in search of water and met a woman who was sitting on her camel between two bags of water. They asked, &#8220;Where can we find water?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;I was there (at the place of water) this hour yesterday and my people are behind me.&#8221; They requested her to accompany them. She asked, &#8220;Where?&#8221; They said, &#8220;To Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; She said, &#8220;Do you mean the man who is called the <i>Sabi&#8217;</i>, (with a new religion)?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes, the same person. So come along.&#8221; They brought her to the Prophet and narrated the whole story. He said, &#8220;Help her to dismount.&#8221; The Prophet asked for a pot, then he opened the mouths of the bags and poured some water into the pot. Then he closed the big openings of the bags and opened the small ones and the people were called upon to drink and water their animals. So they all watered their animals and they (too) all quenched their thirst and also gave water to others and last of all the Prophet gave a pot full of water to the person who was <i>junub</i> and told him to pour it over his body. The woman was standing and watching all that which they were doing with her water. By Allah, when her water bags were returned the looked like as if they were more full (of water) than they had been before (Miracle of Allah&#8217;s Apostle) Then the Prophet ordered us to collect something for her; so dates, flour and <i>sawiq</i> were collected which amounted to a good meal that was put in a piece of cloth. She was helped to ride on her camel and that cloth full of food-stuff was also placed in front of her and then the Prophet said to her, &#8220;We have not taken your water but Allah has given water to us.&#8221; She returned home late. Her relatives asked her: &#8220;O so and so what has delayed you?&#8221; She said, &#8220;A strange thing! Two men met me and took me to the man who is called the <i>Sabi</i>&#8216; and he did such and such a thing. By Allah, he is either the greatest magician between this and this (gesturing with her index and middle fingers raising them towards the sky indicating the heaven and the earth) or he is Allah&#8217;s true Apostle.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Afterwards the Muslims used to attack the pagans around her abode but never touched her village. One day she said to her people, &#8220;I think that these people leave you purposely. Have you got any inclination to Islam?&#8221; They obeyed her and all of them embraced Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu &#8216;Abdultah said: The word <i>saba&#8217;a </i>means &#8220;The one who has deserted his old religion and embraced a new religion.&#8221; Abul &#8216;Ailya said, &#8220;The <i>Sabis</i> are a sect of people of the Scripture who recite the Book of Psalms.&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Supplication for <a>Rain</a></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Volume 8, Book 73, Number 115:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to the Prophet on a Friday while he (the Prophet) was delivering a sermon at Medina, and said, &#8220;There is lack of rain, so please invoke your Lord to bless us with the rain.&#8221; The Prophet looked at the sky when no cloud could be detected. Then he invoked Allah for rain. Clouds started gathering together and it rained till the Medina valleys started flowing with water. It continued raining till the next Friday. Then that man (or some other man) stood up while the Prophet was delivering the Friday sermon, and said, &#8220;We are drowned; Please invoke your Lord to withhold it (rain) from us&#8221; The Prophet smiled and said twice or thrice, &#8220;O Allah! Please let it rain round about us and not upon us.&#8221; The clouds started dispersing over Medina to the right and to the left, and it rained round about Medina and not upon Medina. Allah showed them (the people) the miracle of His Prophet and His response to his invocation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><a><strong>Lights</strong></a><strong> to guide Companions</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Volume 1, Book 8, Number 454:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Two of the companions of the Prophet departed from him on a dark night and were led by two lights like lamps (going in front of them from Allah as a miracle) lighting the way in front of them, and when they parted, each of them was accompanied by one of these lights till he reached their (respective) houses.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><a><strong>Crying</strong></a><strong> of the stem of the Date-palm Tree</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 783:</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to deliver his sermons while standing beside a trunk of a datepalm. When he had the pulpit made, he used it instead. The trunk started crying and the Prophet went to it, rubbing his hand over it (to stop its crying).</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><a><strong>Glorification</strong></a><strong> of Allah by the Prophet&#8217;s meals</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 779:</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We used to consider miracles as Allah&#8217;s Blessings, but you people consider them to be a warning. Once we were with Allah&#8217;s Apostle on a journey, and we ran short of water. He said, &#8220;Bring the water remaining with you.&#8221; The people brought a utensil containing a little water. He placed his hand in it and said, &#8220;Come to the blessed water, and the Blessing is from Allah.&#8221; I saw the water flowing from among the fingers of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and no doubt, we heard the meal glorifying Allah, when it was being eaten (by him).</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The <a>expulsion</a> of a liar&#8217;s corpse by the Earth</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 814:</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a Christian who embraced Islam and read <i>Surat-al-Baqara</i> and <i>Al-Imran,</i> and he used to write (the revelations) for the Prophet. Later on he returned to Christianity again and he used to say: &#8220;Muhammad knows nothing but what I have written for him.&#8221; Then Allah caused him to die, and the people buried him, but in the morning they saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, &#8220;This is the act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and took his body out of it because he had run away from them.&#8221; They again dug the grave deeply for him, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, &#8220;This is an act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and threw his body outside it, for he had run away from them.&#8221; They dug the grave for him as deep as they could, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. So they believed that what had befallen him was not done by human beings and had to leave him thrown (on the ground).</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">The Speech of the <a>Wolf</a></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 517:</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;While a man was riding a cow, it turned towards him and said, &#8216;I have not been created for this purpose (i.e. carrying), I have been created for sloughing.l&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;I, Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar believe in the story.&#8221; The Prophet went on, &#8220;A wolf caught a sheep, and when the shepherd chased it, the wolf said, &#8216;Who will be its guard on the day of wild beasts, when there will be no shepherd for it except me?&#8217; &#8220;After narrating it, the Prophet said, &#8220;I, Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar too believe it.&#8221; Abu Salama (a sub-narrator) said, &#8220;Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar were not present then.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been written that a wolf also spoke to one of the companions of the Prophet near Medina as narrated in <i>Fath-al-Bari</i>:Narrated Unais bin &#8216;Amr: Ahban bin Aus said, &#8220;I was amongst my sheep. Suddenly a wolf caught a sheep and I shouted at it. The wolf sat on its tail and addressed me, saying, &#8216;Who will look after it (i.e. the sheep) when you will be busy and not able to look after it? Do you forbid me the provision which Allah has provided me?&#8217; &#8221; Ahban added, &#8220;I clapped my hands and said, &#8216;By Allah, I have never seen anything more curious and wonderful than this!&#8217; On that the wolf said, &#8216;There is something (more curious) and wonderful than this; that is, Allah&#8217;s Apostle in those palm trees, inviting people to Allah (i.e. Islam).&#8217; &#8220;Unais bin &#8216;Amr further said, &#8220;Then Ahban went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and informed him what happened and embraced Islam.)&#8221; palm trees or other trees and share the fruits with me.&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Prophet&#8217;s <a>Night</a> Journey to Jerusalem</strong> (Arabic: <i>Israa</i>) <strong>and Ascent to the Heavens</strong> (Arabic: <i>Miraj</i>)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 228: </i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the Statement of Allah&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;And We granted the vision (Ascension to the heavens) which We made you see (as an actual eye witness) was only made as a trial for the people.&#8221;</i> (17.60)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abbas added: The sights which Allah&#8217;s Apostle was shown on the Night Journey when he was taken to Bait-ul Maqdis (i.e. Jerusalem) were actual sights, (not dreams). And the Cursed Tree (mentioned) in the Quran is the tree of <i>Zaqqum</i> (itself) .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Volume 4, Book 54, Number 462:</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;On the night of my Ascent to the Heaven, I saw Moses who was a tall brown curly-haired man as if he was one of the men of Shan&#8217;awa tribe, and I saw Jesus, a man of medium height and moderate complexion inclined to the red and white colors and of lank hair. I also saw Malik, the gate-keeper of the (Hell) Fire and Ad-Dajjal amongst the signs which Allah showed me.&#8221; (The Prophet then recited the Holy Verse): &#8220;So be not you in doubt of meeting him&#8217; when you met Moses during the night of Mi&#8217;raj over the heavens&#8221; (32.23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas and Abu Bakra: &#8220;The Prophet said, &#8220;The angels will guard Medina from Ad-Dajjal (who will not be able to enter the city of Medina).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 227:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abbas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Malik bin Sasaa said that Allah&#8217;s Apostle described to them his Night Journey saying, &#8220;While I was lying in Al-Hatim or Al-Hijr, suddenly someone came to me and cut my body open from here to here.&#8221; I asked Al-Jarud who was by my side, &#8220;What does he mean?&#8221; He said, &#8220;It means from his throat to his pubic area,&#8221; or said, &#8220;From the top of the chest.&#8221; The Prophet further said, &#8220;He then took out my heart. Then a gold tray of Belief was brought to me and my heart was washed and was filled (with Belief) and then returned to its original place. Then a white animal which was smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey was brought to me.&#8221; (On this Al-Jarud asked, &#8220;Was it the Buraq, O Abu Hamza?&#8221; I (i.e. Anas) replied in the affirmative). The Prophet said, &#8220;The animal&#8217;s step (was so wide that it) reached the farthest point within the reach of the animal&#8217;s sight. I was carried on it, and Gabriel set out with me till we reached the nearest heaven.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he asked for the gate to be opened, it was asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel answered, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Who is accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has Muhammad been called?&#8217; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, &#8216;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!&#8217; The gate was opened, and when I went over the first heaven, I saw Adam there. Gabriel said (to me). &#8216;This is your father, Adam; pay him your greetings.&#8217; So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious son and pious Prophet.&#8217; Then Gabriel ascended with me till we reached the second heaven. Gabriel asked for the gate to be opened. It was asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel answered, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Who is accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217; Gabriel answered in the affirmative. Then it was said, &#8216;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!&#8217; The gate was opened.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I went over the second heaven, there I saw Yahya (i.e. John) and &#8216;Isa (i.e. Jesus) who were cousins of each other. Gabriel said (to me), &#8216;These are John and Jesus; pay them your greetings.&#8217; So I greeted them and both of them returned my greetings to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&#8217; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the third heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Who is accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, &#8216;He is welcomed, what an excellent visit his is!&#8217; The gate was opened, and when I went over the third heaven there I saw Joseph. Gabriel said (to me), &#8216;This is Joseph; pay him your greetings.&#8217; So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&#8217; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the fourth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Gabriel&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Who is accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, &#8216;He is welcomed, what an excel lent visit his is!&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The gate was opened, and when I went over the fourth heaven, there I saw Idris. Gabriel said (to me), &#8216;This is Idris; pay him your greetings.&#8217; So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&#8217; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the fifth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was asked. &#8216;Who is accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said He is welcomed, what an excellent visit his is! So when I went over the fifth heaven, there I saw Harun (i.e. Aaron), Gabriel said, (to me). This is Aaron; pay him your greetings.&#8217; I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&#8217; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the sixth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked. &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Who is accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. It was said, &#8216;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I went (over the sixth heaven), there I saw Moses. Gabriel said (to me),&#8217; This is Moses; pay him your greeting. So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&#8217; When I left him (i.e. Moses) he wept. Someone asked him, &#8216;What makes you weep?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;I weep because after me there has been sent (as Prophet) a young man whose followers will enter Paradise in greater numbers than my followers.&#8217; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the seventh heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was asked,&#8217; Who is accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, &#8216;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when I went (over the seventh heaven), there I saw Abraham. Gabriel said (to me), &#8216;This is your father; pay your greetings to him.&#8217; So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious son and pious Prophet.&#8217; Then I was made to ascend to <i>Sidrat-ul-Muntaha</i> (i.e. the Lote Tree of the utmost boundary) Behold! Its fruits were like the jars of Hajr (i.e. a place near Medina) and its leaves were as big as the ears of elephants. Gabriel said, &#8216;This is the Lote Tree of the utmost boundary) . Behold ! There ran four rivers, two were hidden and two were visible, I asked, &#8216;What are these two kinds of rivers, O Gabriel?&#8217; He replied,&#8217; As for the hidden rivers, they are two rivers in Paradise and the visible rivers are the Nile and the Euphrates.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then <i>Al-Bait-ul-Ma&#8217;mur</i> (i.e. the Sacred House) was shown to me and a container full of wine and another full of milk and a third full of honey were brought to me. I took the milk. Gabriel remarked, &#8216;This is the Islamic religion which you and your followers are following.&#8217; Then the prayers were enjoined on me: They were fifty prayers a day. When I returned, I passed by Moses who asked (me), &#8216;What have you been ordered to do?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;I have been ordered to offer fifty prayers a day.&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;Your followers cannot bear fifty prayers a day, and by Allah, I have tested people before you, and I have tried my level best with Bani Israel (in vain). Go back to your Lord and ask for reduction to lessen your followers&#8217; burden.&#8217; So I went back, and Allah reduced ten prayers for me. Then again I came to Moses, but he repeated the same as he had said before. Then again I went back to Allah and He reduced ten more prayers. When I came back to Moses he said the same, I went back to Allah and He ordered me to observe ten prayers a day. When I came back to Moses, he repeated the same advice, so I went back to Allah and was ordered to observe five prayers a day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I came back to Moses, he said, &#8216;What have you been ordered?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;I have been ordered to observe five prayers a day.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Your followers cannot bear five prayers a day, and no doubt, I have got an experience of the people before you, and I have tried my level best with Bani Israel, so go back to your Lord and ask for reduction to lessen your follower&#8217;s burden.&#8217; I said, &#8216;I have requested so much of my Lord that I feel ashamed, but I am satisfied now and surrender to Allah&#8217;s Order.&#8217; When I left, I heard a voice saying, &#8216;I have passed My Order and have lessened the burden of My Worshippers.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Aisha (may Allaah be pleased with her) used to recommend Talbina for the sick and for one who is grieving over a dead person. She (may Allaah be pleased with her) used to say, &#8220;I heard the Messenger (Sallallaahu ءlayhi Wasallam) saying, &#8216;The Talbina gives rest to the heart of the patient and makes it active and relieves some of his sorrow and grief.&#8217; &#8221; [Saheeh al-Bukhaaree (5689)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aisha (may Allaah be pleased with her) said that whenever one of her relatives died, the women assembled and then dispersed (returned to their homes) except her relatives and close friends. She (may Allaah be pleased with her) would order that a pot of Talbina be cooked. Then Tharid (a dish prepared from meat and bread) would be prepared and the Talbina would be poured on it. Aisha (may Allaah be pleased with her) would say (to the women), &#8220;Eat of it, for I heard the Messenger (Sallallaahu ءlayhi Wasallam) saying, &#8216;The Talbina soothes the heart of the patient and relieves him from some of his sadness.&#8217; &#8221; [Saheeh al-Bukhaaree (5690)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hisham&#8217;s father (may Allaah be pleased with them) said, &#8220;Aisha (may Allaah be pleased with her) used to recommend Talbina and used to say, &#8216;It is disliked (by the patient) although it is beneficial.&#8217; &#8216; [Saheeh al-Bukhaaree (5690)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (Sallallaahu ءlayhi Wasallam) said, &#8220;I encourage you to use that which is disliked but beneficial (Talbina) for by the One whose hand Muhammad&#8217;s soul is in, it cleans the stomach of one of you just as dirt is cleaned from the face with water.&#8221; [Mustadrak of Haakim (7455), Saheeh as Dhahabi mentioned in &#8216;Talkhees&#8217; taken from Maktaba Shaamilah, See also Mustadrak (8245) whose chain is upon the condition of Bukhaaree as Dhahabi mentioned].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aisha (may Allaah be pleased with her) narrated, &#8220;If any of the Messenger&#8217;s (Sallallaahu ءlayhi Wasallam) family became ill, the Messenger (Sallallaahu ءlayhi Wasallam) would say, &#8216;It soothes the grieving heart and cleanses the ailing heart just as one of you cleans dirt off his face with water.&#8217; &#8221; [Saheeh Sunan ibn Maajah (3445), hadeeth hasan].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) narrated that the Messenger (Sallallaahu ءlayhi Wasallam) said, &#8220;You should eat the beneficial thing that is unpleasant to eat (Talbina), meaning broth. If any member of the Messenger of Allaah&#8217;s family was sick, the cooking pot would remain on the fire until one of two things happened, either the person recovered or died.&#8221; [Saheeh Sunan ibn Maajah (3446) hadeeth hasan].</p>

<div style="text-align:justify;" align="center">I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say:</div>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;" align="center">Whilst I was sleeping, two men came to me and took hold of my upper arm, and brought me to a rugged mountain. They said: Climb up.’ I said: I cannot do it.’ They said: We will make it easy for you.’ So I climbed up until I was at the top of the mountain. There I heard loud voices. I said: What are these voices?’ They said: This is the screaming of the people of Hell.’ Then I was taken and I saw people suspended by their ankles, with the corners of their mouths torn and pouring with blood. I said: Who are these?’ They said: <strong>These are the people who broke their fast before it was time to do so</strong>.’</div>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[Classed as <em>Saheeh</em> by <strong>al-Albaanee</strong> in <em>Saheeh Mawaarid adh-Dham-aan</em>, 1509].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Albaanee (may Allaah have mercy on him) commented: I say: This is the punishment of the one who fasted then <strong>deliberately</strong> broke his fast before the time for <em>iftaar</em> had come.<strong> So how about one who does not fast at all?</strong> We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound in this world and in the Hereafter.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Jabir reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Iblis places his throne upon water; he then sends detachments (for creating dissension) ; the nearer to him in rank are those who are most notorious in creating dissension. One of them comes and says: I did so and so. And he says: You have done nothing. Then one amongst them comes and says: <strong>I did not spare so and so until I sowed the seed of discord between a husband and a wife.</strong> The Satan goes near him and says: <strong>&#8216;You have done well.</strong> A&#8217;mash said: <strong>He then embraces him.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">34. Narrated Abu  Huraira (radhi Allaahu anhu) : Allah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“When one of you wakes up from his sleep, he must clean his nose (with water, by sniffling it in and then blowing it out) three times, for Satan spends the night inside one’s nostrils.” </span></strong><span style="color:#000000;">[1]</span></span> [Agreed upon].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]<strong> Satan’s spending the night inside the nostrils of a man is plausible. However, its actual state is better known to Allah</strong>. It may be that this is a figurative expression, because bad excretions gather in the nose and cause laziness, indolence, slackness and negligence. And all these states are satanic dispositions. Blowing water out of the nose upon awakening from sleep might be performed as an individual act, or along with ablution. It is  considered obligatory by Ahmad, while the majority of scholars consider it Sunnah.</p>
