										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِن تَتَّقُوا اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّكُمْ فُرْقَانًا وَيُكَفِّرْ عَنكُمْ سَيِّئَاتِكُمْ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ ذُو الْفَضْلِ الْعَظِيمِ</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who believe! If you obey and fear Allaah, He will grant you <em>Furqan</em>, and will expiate for you your sins, and forgive you; and Allah is the Owner of the great bounty.</strong></span> (Al-Anfal 8:29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Abbas, As-Suddi, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, Muqatil bin Hayyan and several others said that,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<em>Furqan</em>), means, <strong>`a way out&#8217;</strong>;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujahid added, <strong>&#8220;In this life and the Hereafter.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration, Ibn `Abbas is reported to have said, `<em>Furqan</em>&#8216; means `<strong>salvation</strong>&#8216; or &#8212; according to another narration &#8212; <strong>`aid&#8217;.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad bin Ishaq said that `<em>Furqan</em>&#8216; means `<strong>criterion between truth and falsehood</strong>&#8216;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This last explanation from Ibn Ishaq is more general than the rest that we mentioned, and it also includes the other meanings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Certainly, those who have <em>Taqwa</em> of Allah by obeying what He ordained and abstaining from what he forbade, will be guided to differentiate between the truth and the falsehood. This will be a triumph, safety and a way out for them from the affairs of this life, all the while acquiring happiness in the Hereafter. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will also gain forgiveness, thus having their sins erased, and pardon, thus having their sins covered from other people, as well as, being directed to a way to gain Allah&#8217;s tremendous rewards,</p>
<p><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَآمِنُوا بِرَسُولِهِ يُؤْتِكُمْ كِفْلَيْنِ مِن رَّحْمَتِهِ وَيَجْعَل لَّكُمْ نُورًا تَمْشُونَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ۚ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Have <em>Taqwa</em> of Allah, and believe in His Messenger, He will give you a double portion of His mercy, and He will give you a light by which you shall walk </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(straight)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">. And He will forgive you. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful</span> </strong>(57:28)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And recite to them the story of him to whom We gave Our Ayat, but he threw them away; so Shaytan followed him up, and he became of those who went astray.And had We willed, We would surely have elevated him therewith, but he clung to the earth and followed his own vain desires. So his parable is the parable of a dog: if you drive him away, he pants, or if you leave him alone, he </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(still) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">pants. Such is the parable of the people who reject Our Ayat. So relate the stories, perhaps they may reflect.Evil is the parable of the people who rejected Our Ayat, and used to wrong themselves.</span></strong> (Qur&#8217;an Al-A&#8217;raf 07, Verses 175-177)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdur-Razzaq recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said that Allah&#8217;s statement,<strong>(And recite to them the story of him to whom We gave Our Ayat, but he threw them away</strong>) <span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;Is about Bal`am bin Ba`ura&#8217; a man from the Children of Israel.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shu`bah and several other narrators narrated this statement from Mansur who got it from Ibn Mas`ud. Sa`id bin Abi `Arubah narrated that Qatadah said that Ibn `Abbas said,<span style="color:#993300;"> &#8220;He is Sayfi, son of Ar-Rahib.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qatadah commented that Ka`b said, <span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;He was a man from Al-Balqla&#8217; (a province of Jordan) who knew Allah&#8217;s Greatest Name. He used to live in Bayt Al-Maqdis with the tyrants.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said, <span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;He is Bal`am bin Ba`ura&#8217;, a man from Yemen whom Allah had given the knowledge of His Ayat, but he abandoned them.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Malik bin Dinar said, <span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;He was one of the scholars of the Children of Israel whose supplication was acceptable. They used to seek his lead in suplication in times of difficulty. Allah&#8217;s Prophet Musa sent him to the King of Madyan to call him to Allah. That king appeased him and gave him land and gifts, and he reverted from the religion of Musa and followed the king&#8217;s religion.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Imran bin `Uyaynah narrated that `Husayn said that `Imran bin Al-Harith said that Ibn `Abbas said, <span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;He is Bal`am son of Ba`ura&#8217;.&#8221;</span> Similar was said by Mujahid and `Ikrimah. Therefore, it is well-known that this honorable Ayah was revealed about a man from the Children of Israel in ancient times, according to Ibn Mas`ud and several others among the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;He is a man from the city of the tyrants (Jerusalem) whose name was Bal`am and who knew Allah&#8217;s Greatest Name.&#8221; `Ali bin Abi Talhah also reported that Ibn `Abbas that he said, &#8220;When Musa and those with him went to the city of the tyrants (Jerusalem), the cousins of Bal`am and his people came to him and said, `Musa is a strong man, and he has many soldiers. If he gains the upper hand over us, we will be destroyed. Therefore, supplicate to Allah that He prevents Musa and those with him from prevailing over us.&#8217; Bal`am said, `If I supplicate to Allah that He turns back Musa and those with him, I will lose in this life and the Hereafter.&#8217; They kept luring him until he supplicated against Musa and his people, and Allah took away what he bestowed on him (of knowledge). Hence Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(but he threw them away; so Shaytan followed him up).&#8221;</strong>&#8216; Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And had We willed, We would surely have elevated him therewith but he clung to the earth and followed his own vain desires.)</strong> Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And had We willed, We would surely have elevated him therewith)</strong> from the filth of this earthly life through the Ayat that We gave him knowledge of,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(but he clung to the earth)</strong>, he became interested in the adornment of this life and its delights. He indulged in the lusts of life and its joys and was deceived by it, just as life deceived others like him, without sound comprehension or a good mind. Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar narrated from Salim, from Abu An-Nadr that when Musa entered the land of Bani Canaan in the area of Ash-Sham (Greater Syria), the people of Bal`am came to him, saying, &#8220;This is Musa, son of `Imran with the Children of Israel. He wants to drive us out from our land, kill us and replace us with the Children of Israel. We are your people and have no other dwelling area. You are a person whose supplication is acceptable (to Allah), so go out and supplicate to Allah against them.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Woe to you! Here is Allah&#8217;s Prophet (Musa) with whom the angels and believers are! How can I supplicate against them when I know from Allah what I know&#8221; They said, &#8220;We have no other dwelling area.&#8221; So they kept luring and begging him until he was tempted by the trial and went on his donkey towards Mount Husban, which was behind the Israelite military barracks. When he proceeded on the Mount for a while, the donkey sat down and refused to proceed. He got off the donkey and struck it until it stood up again and he rode it. The donkey did the same after a little while, and he struck it again until it stood up&#8230; So he proceeded and tried to supplicate against Musa and his people. However, Allah made his tongue mention his people with evil and the Children of Israel with good instead of his people, who protested, &#8220;O Bal`am! What are you doing You are supplicating for them and against us!&#8221; He said, &#8220;It is against my will. This is a matter that Allah has decided.&#8221; He then said to them, as his tongue was made to loll out of his mouth, &#8220;Now I have lost this life and the Hereafter.&#8221; This Ayah was revealed about the story of Bal`am son of Ba`ura&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And recite to them the story of him to whom We gave Our Ayat, but he threw them away.)</strong>, until,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(perhaps they may reflect.)</strong> Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(So his parable is the parable of a dog: if you drive him away, he pants, or if you leave him alone, he (still) pants.)</strong> Scholars of Tafsir have conflicting opinions regarding the meaning of this Ayah. Some scholars said that it refers to the end of Bal`am&#8217;s tongue which flickered out of his mouth, as in the story narrated from Ibn Ishaq, from Salim, from Abu An-Nadr. Therefore, his example is the example of the dog, its tongue pants regardless of whether it is driven away or not. It was also said that the meaning here is a parable of this man &#8212; and his like &#8212; concerning their misguidance, persisting the wrong path and not being able to benefit from faith or comprehend what they are being called to. So his example is that of a dog which pants whether it was driven away or left alone. The person described here does not benefit from the advice or the call to faith, just as if the advice and call never occurred. Allah said in another Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(It is the same to them (disbelievers) whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe.)</strong></span>(2:6) and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Whether you ask forgiveness for them (hypocrites) or ask not forgiveness for them &#8212; (and even) if you ask seventy times for their forgiveness &#8212; Allah will not forgive them.)</span> </strong>(9:80) and similar Ayat. It was also said that the meaning here, is that the heart of the disbeliever, the hypocrite and the wicked is weak and devoid of guidance. Therefore, it keeps faltering. Similar was narrated from Al-Hasan Al-Basri.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(So relate the stories, perhaps they may reflect)</strong> Allah said next to His Prophet Muhammad ﷺ ,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(So relate the stories, perhaps they may)</strong> the Children of Israel, who have knowledge ot the story of Bal`am and what happened to him when Allah allowed him to stray and expelled him from His mercy. Allah favored him by teaching him His Greatest Name, by which, if He is asked, He will grant, and if He is called upon, He answers. But Bal`am used it in disobedience to Allah and invoked Him against His own party of the people of faith, followers of His servant and Messenger during that time, Musa, the son of `Imran, peace be upon him, whom Allah spoke to directly,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(perhaps they may reflect.)</strong> and avoid Bal`am&#8217;s behavior, for Allah has given the Jews knowledge and made them superior to the bedouins surrounding them. He gave them the description of Muhammad ﷺ which would allow them to recognize him, as they recognize their own children. They, among people, have the most right to follow, aid and support Muhammad ﷺ , in obedience to their Prophets who informed them of him and commanded them to follow him. Therefore, whoever among them defies the knowledge in their Books or hides it from the servants, Allah will place disgrace on him in this life, followed by humiliation in the Hereafter. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Evil is the parable of the people who rejected Our Ayat.)</strong> Allah says, evil is the example of the people who deny Our Ayat in that they are equated with dogs that have no interest but to collect food and satisfy lusts.&#8217; Therefore, whoever goes out of the area of knowledge and guidance, and seeks satisfaction for his lusts and vain desires, is just like a dog; what an evil example. The Sahih recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(The evil example is not suitable for us: he who goes back on his gift is just like the dog that eats its vomit.)</strong> Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(and they used to wrong themselves.)</strong> means, Allah did not wrong them, but they wronged themselves by rejecting guidance, not obeying the Lord, being content with this life that will soon end, all the while seeking to fulfill desires and obey lusts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(178. Whomsoever Allah guides, he is the guided one, and whomsoever He sends astray, &#8212; then those! They are the losers.) </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says, whomever He leads aright, then none can lead him to misguidance, and whomever He leads astray, will have acquired failure, loss and sure misguidance. Verily, whatever Allah wills occurs; and whatever He does not will, does not occur. A Hadith narrated from `Abdullah bin Mas`ud reads,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">(All praise is due to Allah, Whom we praise and seek help, guidance and forgiveness from. We seek refuge with Allah from the evils within ourselves and from the burden of our evil deeds. He whom Allah guides, will never be misled; and he whom He misguides, will never have one who will guide him. I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah without partners and that Muhammad ﷺ is His servant and Messenger.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The complete Hadith was collected by Imam Ahmad and the collectors of Sunan and others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Come not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is Fahishah (immoral sin) and an evil way.&#8221;</strong></span> &#8211;  Surah No.17 Al-Isra , Aaayat 32</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says, forbidding His servants to commit Zina or to approach it or to do anything that may lead to it:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And come not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is a Fahishah (immoral sin)) meaning a major sin,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(and an evil way.)</strong> meaning, a terrible way to behave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded Abu Umamah saying that a young man came to the Prophet ﷺ and said, <strong>&#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Give me permission to commit Zina (unlawful sex).&#8221;</strong> The people surrounded him and rebuked him, saying, &#8220;Stop! Stop!&#8221; But the Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Come close)</strong> The young man came to him, and he ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Sit down)</strong> so he sat down. The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Would you like it (unlawful sex) for your mother)</strong> He said, &#8220;No, by Allah, may I be ransomed for you.&#8221; The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Neither do the people like it for their mothers.)</strong> The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Would you like it for your daughter)</strong> He said, &#8220;No, by Allah, may I be ransomed for you.&#8221; The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Neither do the people like it for their daughters. )</strong> The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Would you like it for your sister)</strong> He said, &#8220;No, by Allah, may I be ransomed for you.&#8221; The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Neither do the people like it for their sisters.)</strong> The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Would you like it for your paternal aunt)</strong> He said, &#8220;No, by Allah, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! may I be ransomed for you.&#8221; The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Neither do the people like it for their paternal aunts.)</strong> The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Would you like it for your maternal aunt)</strong> He said, &#8220;No, by Allah, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! may I be ransomed for you.&#8221; The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Neither do the people like it for their maternal aunts.)</strong> Then the Prophet ﷺ put his hand on him and said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(O Allah, forgive his sin, purify his heart and guard his chastity.)</strong> After that the young man never paid attention to anything of that nature.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Or like the one who passed by a town in ruin up to its roofs. He said: &#8220;How will Allah ever bring it to life after its death&#8221; So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up (again). He said: &#8220;How long did you remain (dead)&#8221; He (the man) said: &#8220;(Perhaps) I remained (dead) a day or part of a day.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Nay, you have remained (dead) for a hundred years, look at your food and your drink, they show no change; and look at your donkey! And thus We have made of you a sign for the people. Look at the bones, how We bring them together and clothe them with flesh.&#8221; When this was clearly shown to him, he said, &#8220;I know (now) that Allah is able to do all things.&#8221;</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 2.259)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(Have you not looked at him who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord)</span> means, &#8220;Have you seen anyone like the person who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord&#8221; Then, Allah connected the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(Or like the one who passed by a town in ruin up to its roofs)</span> to the Ayah above by using `or&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Ali bin Abi Talib said that the Ayah (2:259) meant `Uzayr. Ibn Jarir also reported it, and this explanation was also reported by Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim from Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Sulayman bin Buraydah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujahid bin Jabr said that the Ayah refers to a man from the Children of Israel, and the village was Jerusalem, after Nebuchadnezzar destroyed it and killed its people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(in ruin)</span> means, it became empty of people. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(up to its roofs)</span> indicates that the roofs and walls (of the village) fell to the ground. `Uzayr stood contemplating about what had happened to that city, after a great civilization used to inhabit it. He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(Oh! How will Allah ever bring it to life after its death)</span> because of the utter destruction he saw and the implausibility of its returning to what it used to be. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up (again).)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The city was rebuilt seventy years after the man (`Uzayr) died, and its inhabitants increased and the Children of Israel moved back to it. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>When Allah resurrected `Uzayr after he died, the first organ that He resurrected were his eyes, so that he could witness what Allah does with him, how He brings life back to his body.</strong></span> When his resurrection was complete, Allah said to him, meaning through the angel,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(&#8220;How long did you remain (dead)&#8221; He (the man) said: &#8220;(Perhaps) I remained (dead) a day or part of a day.&#8221;)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars said that since the man died in the early part of the day and Allah resurrected him in the latter part of the day, when he saw that the sun was still apparent, he thought that it was the sun of that very day. He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(&#8220;Or part of a day. &#8221; He said: &#8220;Nay, you have remained (dead) for a hundred years, look at your food and your drink, they show no change.&#8221;)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He had grapes, figs and juice, and he found them as he left them; neither did the juice spoil nor the figs become bitter nor the grapes rot.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(And look at your donkey!),</span> &#8220;How Allah brings it back to life while you are watching.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(And thus We have made of you a sign for the people)</span> that Resurrection occurs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(Look at the bones, how We Nunshizuha)</span> meaning, collect them and put them back together. In his Mustadrak, Al-Hakim, recorded that Kharijah bin Zayd bin Thabit said that his father said that the Messenger of Allah read this Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(how We Nunshizuha.)</span> Al-Hakim said; &#8220;Its chain is Sahih and they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not record it.&#8221; The Ayah was also read,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(نُنْشِرُهَا)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Nunshiruha&#8221; meaning, bring them back to life, as Mujahid stated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(And clothe them with flesh. )</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Suddi said, &#8221; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>`Uzayr observed the bones of his donkey, which were scattered all around him to his right and left, and Allah sent a wind that collected the bones from all over the area. Allah then brought every bone to its place, until they formed a full donkey made of fleshless bones. Allah then covered these bones with flesh, nerves, veins and skin. Allah sent an angel who blew life in the donkeys&#8217; nostrils, and the donkey started to bray by Allah&#8217;s leave.&#8221; All this occurred while `Uzayr was watching</strong></span>, and this is when he proclaimed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(He said, &#8220;I know (now) that Allah is able to do all things,&#8221;)</span> meaning, &#8220;I know that, and I did witness it with my own eyes. Therefore, I am the most knowledgeable in this matter among the people of my time.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(36. Verily, the number of months with Allah is twelve months (in a year), so was it ordained by Allah on the Day when He created the heavens and the earth; <strong>of them four are sacred</strong>. That is the right religion, so <strong>wrong not yourselves therein</strong>, and fight against the Mushrikin idolaters collectively as they fight against you collectively. But know that Allah is with those who have Taqwa.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Soorat at-Tawbah 9:36</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Year consists of Twelve Months</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Bakrah said that the Prophet said in a speech during his Hajj,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The division of time has turned to its original form which was current when Allah created the heavens and the earth. The year is of twelve months, out of which four months are sacred: Three are in succession Dhul-Qa`dah, Dhul-Hijjah and Muharram, and (the fourth is) Rajab of (the tribe of) Mudar which comes between Jumada (Ath-Thaniyah) and Sha`ban.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet then asked, (What is the day today&#8217;) We said, &#8220;Allah and His Messenger know better. He kept quiet until we thought that he might give that day another name. He said (Isn&#8217;t it the day of Nahr) We replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He further asked, (Which month is this) We again said, &#8220;Allah and His Messenger know better,&#8221; and he kept quiet and made us think that he might give it another name. Then he said,(Isn&#8217;t it the month of Dhul-Hijjah) We replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He asked, (What town is this) We said, &#8220;Allah and His Messenger know better,&#8221; and he kept quiet until we thought that he might change its name. He asked, (Isn&#8217;t this the (Sacred) Town) We said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Verily! Your blood, property and honor are sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of yours, in this month of yours and in this city of yours. Verily, you will meet your Lord and He will question you about your actions. Behold! Do not revert to misguidance after me by striking the necks of one another. Have I conveyed It is incumbent upon those who are present to inform those who are absent, because those who are absent might comprehend (what I have said) better than some who are present.)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari and Muslim collected this Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a small book collected by Shaykh `Alam ad-Din As-Sakhawi, entitled, Al-Mashhur fi Asma&#8217; Al-Ayam wash-Shuhur, he mentioned that <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Muharram is so named because it is a sacred month. To me, it was so named to emphasize its sacredness.</strong></span> This is because the Arabs would switch it around. One year they would say it was a sacred month, the following year they would say that it was not. The author said, &#8220;&#8230;and <strong>Safar</strong> is so named because they used to leave their homes during that month for fighting and traveling. When saying `Safir&#8217; a place, it means to leave it&#8230; <strong>Rabi` Al-Awwal</strong> is called that because they used to do Irtiba` in it, that is to maintain one&#8217;s property&#8230; and <strong>Rabi` Al-Akhir</strong>, was so named for the same reasons. <strong>Jumada</strong> is called that because the water would dry up (Jamud) then&#8230;.They say <strong>Jumada Al-Uwla</strong> and <strong>Al-Awwal</strong>, or Jumada Al-Akhar or Al-Akhirah. <strong>Rajab</strong> comes from Tarjib, meaning to honor. <strong>Sha`ban</strong> because the tribes would separate and return to their homes. <strong>Ramadan</strong> was so named because of the severity of the Ramda&#8217; &#8211; that is &#8211; the heat, and they say that the branch Ramadat when it is thirsty&#8230;And the saying that it is a Name of Allah is a mistake, for there is no proof or support for that&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">The Sacred Months</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(of them four are sacred).</strong></span> The Arabs used to consider these months sacred during the time of Jahiliyyah, except for a group of them called Al-Basl, who held eight months of the year to be sacred as way of exaggeration in religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(Three are in succession; Dhul-Qa`dah, Dhul-Hijjah and Muharram, and (the fourth is) Rajab of (the tribe of) Mudar which comes between Jumada (Ath-Thani) and Sha`ban).</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said &#8220;Rajab of Mudar&#8221; to attest to the custom of Mudar, in saying that Rajab is the month that is between Jumada and Sha`ban, not as the tribe of Rabi`ah thought, that it is between Sha`ban and Shawwal, which is Ramadan in the present calendar. The four Sacred Months were made four, three in succession and one alone, so that the Hajj and `Umrah are performed with ease. Dhul-Qa`dah, the month before the Hajj month, was made sacred because they refrained from fighting during that month. Dhul-Hijjah, the next month, was made sacred because it is the month of Hajj, during which they performed Hajj rituals. <strong>Muharram, which comes next, was made sacred so that they are able to go back to their areas in safety after performing Hajj</strong>. Rajab, in the middle of the lunar year, was made sacred so that those coming from the farthest areas of Arabia are able to perform `Umrah and visit the House and then go back to their areas safely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(That is the right religion),</span> that is the Straight Law, requiring implementing Allah&#8217;s order concerning the months that He made sacred and their true count as it was originally written by Allah. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(so wrong not yourselves therein)</span> during these Sacred Months, for sin in them is worse than sin in other months. Likewise, sins in the Sacred City are written multiplied,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;and whoever inclines to evil actions therein (in Makkah) or to do wrong, him We shall cause to taste from a painful torment) 22:25. <strong>Similarly, sin in general is worse during the Sacred Months</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali bin Abi Talhah narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Verily, the number of months with Allah&#8230;),</span> is connected to</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(so wrong not yourselves therein),</span> &#8220;In all (twelve) months. Allah then chose four out of these months and made them sacred, emphasizing their sanctity, making sinning in them greater, in addition to, multiplying rewards of righteous deeds during them.&#8221; Qatadah said about Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(so wrong not yourselves therein)</span>, <strong>&#8220;Injustice during the Sacred Months is worse and graver than injustice in other months. Verily, injustice is always wrong, but Allah makes things graver than others as He will.&#8221;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Allah has chosen some of His creation above others. He chose Messengers from angels and from men. He also chose His Speech above all speech, the Masajid above other areas of the earth, Ramadan and the Sacred Months above all months, Friday above the other days and Laylatul-Qadr (The Night of Decree) above all nights. Therefore, sanctify what Allah has sanctified, for doing so is the practice of people of understanding and comprehension.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Fighting in the Sacred Months</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(and fight against the idolators collectively),</span> all of you,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(as they fight against you collectively.)</span>, all of them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(But know that Allah is with those who have Taqwa)</span>, and know that initiating battle during the Sacred Months is forbidden. Allah said in other Ayat,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(O you who believe! Violate not the sanctity of the symbols of Allah, nor of the sacred month.)</span> 5:2,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(The Sacred Month is for the Sacred Month, and for the prohibited things, there is the law of equality (Qisas). Then whoever transgresses the prohibition against you, you transgress likewise against him)</span> 2:194, and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Then when the Sacred Months have passed, kill the idolators&#8230;)</span> 9:5. As for Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(And fight against the idolators collectively as they fight against you collectively)</span>, it includes permission for the believers to fight the idolators in the Sacred Month, if the idolators initiate hostilities therein. Allah said in other Ayat,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(The Sacred Month is for the Sacred Month, and for the prohibited things, there is the law of equality (Qisas))</span> 2:194, and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(And fight not with them at Al-Masjid Al-Haram, unless they (first) fight you there. But if they attack you, then kill them.)</span> 2:191.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Messenger of Allah laying siege to At-Ta&#8217;if until the Sacred Month started, it was a continuation of the battle against Hawazin and their allies from Thaqif. They started the fighting and gathered their men for the purpose of conducting war. The Messenger of Allah marched to meet them and when they took refuge in At-Ta&#8217;if, the Prophet laid siege to them so that they descend from their forts, but they inflicted casualties on Muslims. The siege continued for about forty days, during which a Sacred Month began, and the siege continued for several days in that month. The Messenger broke the siege and went back (to Makkah). So fighting that carries over into it the Sacred Month is not the same as initiating warfare during it, Allah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q. 393. There are some people who call for the uniting of moon sightings everywhere with that of Makkah, in order to unite the Muslim community over the start of the blessed month of Ramadan and other months. What is Your Eminence’s opinion on this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. From the point of view of astronomy, this is impossible, because the appearance of the new crescent, as Shaikhul-Islam Ibn Tairniyyah, may Allah have mercy on him, said, differs (from place to place) according to the consensus of those who are knowledge- able in this field. Since it differs, then what is necessitated by the evidence from the Qur’an and the Sunnah, and scientific evidence, is that every country must have its own ruling.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the evidence from the Qur’an and the Sunnah, Allah, the Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadan, i.e. is present at his home), he must observe Scrum (fasts) that month&#8221;</strong> </span>[Al-Baqarah 2:185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if it happened that a people in the farthest part of the earth did not witness the month, i.e. the new crescent, while the people of Makkah had seen the new crescent, how could the address in this Verse be applied to those who had not witnessed the new crescent?! The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Fast when you see it and break the fast when you see it&#8221;</strong></span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the people of Makkah see it, how can we oblige the people of Pakistan and those Asians who live beyond it to fast, when we know that the new crescent has not appeared in their region, and the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم: made fasting conditional upon the sighting of the new crescent?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scientific evidence is the correct analogy, which it is not possible to refute, for we know that the dawn appears in the eastern corner of the earth before the western side. So if the dawn appears on the eastern side, is it incumbent upon us to fast while we are still in the night? The answer is no. If the sun sets in the east, while were still in daylight, is it permissible for us to break our fast? The answer is no. Therefore, the new crescent is exactly like the sun, except that the timing of the new crescent is monthly and the timing of the sun is daily, and He Who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;It is made lawful for you to have sexual relations with your wives on the night of As-Saum (the fasts). They are Lihas [i.e. body- cover, or screen, or Sakan (i.e. you enjoy the pleasure of living with them) for you and you are the same for them. Allah knows that you used to deceive yourselves, so He turned to you (accepted your repentance) and forgave you. So now have sexual relations with them and seek that which Allah has ordained for you (offspring), and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete your Saum (fast) till the nightfall. And do not have sexual relations with them (your wives) while you are in I ’tikaf (i.e. confining oneself in a mosque for prayers and invocations leaving the worldly activities) in the mosques. These are the limits (set) by Allah, so approach them not. Thus does Allah make clear His Ayat (proofs, evidences, lessons, signs, revelations, verses, laws, legal and illegal things, Allah’s set limits, orders, etc.) to mankind that they may become Al-Muttaqun.”</span></strong> [Al-Baqarah 2:187]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">is the One Who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadan, i.e. is present at his home), he must observe Saum (fasts) that month&#8221;</strong></span> [Al-Baqarah 2:185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, What is necessitated by the evidence from the Qur’an and the Sunnah, as well as scientific evidence, is to make a special judgement for each place regarding fasting and breaking the fast, and to link them on the base of the perceptible sign which Allah has declared in His Book, and His Prophet, Muhammad fig has declared in his Sunnah, and that is the sighting of the moon and the sighting of the sun or the dawn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808080;">[1] Reported by Al-Bukhari in the Book of Fasting, in the Chapter: The Words of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم: When you see the new crescent (1909); and by Muslim in the Book of Fasting, in the Chapter: The Obligation to Fast the Month of Ramadan Upon Sighting the New crescent (1081).</span></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Second Ayah: His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Had We sent down this Qur&#8217;an upon a mountain, you would surely have seen it humbling itself and rending asunder by the fear of Allah&#8221;</strong></span> (Al-Hashr 59:21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A mountain is among the hardest of what there is, the rocks by which the mountain becomes firm are exemplary in hardness. Allah, Exalted is He, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;When, after that, your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness&#8221;</strong></span> (Al- Baqara 2:74)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this Qur&#8217;an were to be sent down upon the mountain, you would surely see this mountain humbling itself and cleaving out of the fear of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Humbling&#8221; &#8211; that is, submissively.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from its severe fright of of Allah, &#8220;Rending asunder&#8221; it cleaves and tears apart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is sent down upon our hearts, and our hearts &#8211; except as Allah wills &#8211; contract and become hard, neither opening nor accepting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who believe, when the Ayat (of the Qur&#8217;an) are sent down to them, it increases their faith; but as for those who have a disease in their hearts; it adds filth to their filth; and it is Allah whose refuge is sought!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of that is that their hearts become more inflexible and hardened and it adds filth to their filth. We seek refuge in Allah from that</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this Qur&#8217;an were to be sent down to the mountain, it would cleave and humble itself due to the greatness of Allah&#8217;s Words sent down upon it</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this, there is evidence that the mountains have senses, because it humbles itself and cleaves. The matter is like that. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said concerning Uhud: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>This is Uhud, a mountain that loves us, and which we love</strong></span>.&#8221; [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With this Hadith, we also recognize the refutation against those who affirm that there are metaphors in the Qur&#8217;an. Those who always raise their flag, using this Ayah as proof:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Then they found therein a wall wanting to collapse&#8221;</strong></span> (Al-Kahf 18:77)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saying: &#8220;How can the wall want?&#8221; We say: Subhan Allah! The Knowing, and The Aware says : &#8220;Wanting to collapse&#8221; and you are saying that it does not want! Is this sensible?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not your right, after this, that you sav: &#8220;How could it want?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This makes us ask ourselves: Are we given the knowledge of everything?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer is that we are not given knowledge, except a little.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not possible for us to object to the statement of the One Who knows the hidden and the witnessed: &#8220;Wanting to collapse&#8221; by saying: &#8220;The wall does not have an Iradah (a want)! And It does not want to collapse!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is one of the evils of metaphors, because it implies a negation of what the Qur&#8217;an affirms.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it not Allah, Exalted is He, Who says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#000000;">The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify Him and there is not a thing but glorifies His Praise. But you understand not their glorification</span></strong>&#8221; {Al-Israa&#8217; 17: 44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do they glorify Him, without wanting to?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He says: &#8220;<strong>Tusabbih Lahu (they glorify Him)</strong>&#8220;: the Lam is to specify. Thus, it means sincerely. Is it imaginable to have sincerity without an Iradah (volition, objective, will)? Therefore, they will, and everything wills, for Allah says: &#8220;<strong>And there is not a thing but glorifies His Praise</strong>.&#8221; I think it is clear to all of us that this is one of the ways of expressing generality, because In (here) means Ma (not), which negates. Also, &#8220;<strong>A thing</strong>&#8221; is an indefinite pronoun used in the context of negation. &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>But glorifies His Praise</strong></span>&#8221; by that, it includes everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O my Muslim brother, if you see that your heart is not moved by the Qur&#8217;an, accuse yourself, because Allah has informed that if this Qur&#8217;an were to be sent down upon a mountain, it would cleave, and the Qur&#8217;an is recited to your heart, yet and it is not moved. We ask Allah to aid us, and you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q. 504. After completing his &#8216;Umrah, a man found some filth in his Ihram garments; what is the ruling on this?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. If a person performed Tawaf and Say for &#8216;Umrah, and after that, he found some filth in his Ihram garments, then his Tawaf is valid, his Say is valid and his &#8216;Umrah is valid. This is because if a person has some filth on his garment, and he does not know about it, or he knew about it but he forgot to wash it, and then he prayed in that garment, then his prayer is valid. Similarly, if he made Tawaf in this garment, then his Tawaf is valid. The evidence for that is the Saying of Allah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error&#8221;</strong> [Al-Baqarah 2:286]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This evidence is general, and it is considered a great rule from among the rules of Islamic Law. There is a specific evidence in the matter, and that is that one day, the Messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه و سلم) led his Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, in prayer and it was his practice to pray in his shoes, but he removed his shoes and the people removed their shoes too. After he had finished praying, he said to them: What was wrong with you?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: &#8220;We saw you removing your shoes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8220;Jibril came to me and informed me that there was something harmful or some dirt on them&#8221;  [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is, some impurity. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not repeat the prayer, even though at the beginning of his prayer, he had worn shoes on which there was some impurity. This proves that if a person prayed in a garment in which there was impurity due to forgetfulness or ignorance, his prayer is valid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a question here: If a person eats camel meat and he stands up and prays without performing ablution, believing that he had eaten mutton, should he repeat his prayer if he found out? We say: He should repeat the prayer after performing ablution. If someone asked: Why do you say that a person who prayed in a polluted garment due to ignorance should not repeat the prayer, while one who eats camel meat due to ignorance, should repeat it? We say: Because we have a useful and important rule, which is, commands are not cancelled due to ignorance or forgetfulness, whereas prohibitions are cancelled due to ignorance and forgetfulness. The evidence for this rule is the saying of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Whoever slept through a prayer or forgot it, he must offer it as soon as he remembers it.&#8221;</strong> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when he made the Taslim after performing two Rak&#8217;at in one of his afternoon prayers and he forgot the remainder of the prayer, he completed it when he remembered it. This is an evidence that those things which are commanded are not cancelled due to forgetfulness, because the Prophet ordered the one who forgot his prayer to offer it as soon as he remembers it, and the obligation to pray it was not removed due to forgetfulness. Also, he completed the prayer and he did not cancel the remainder of it due to forgetfulness. The proof that commands are not cancelled due to ignorance, is that a man came and offered a prayer in which he was not at rest, then he came to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and greeted him and he said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Go back and offer prayer for you have not prayed.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He repeated it three times and the man kept praying and coming to him, but he would say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Go back and offer prayer, for you have not prayed.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">until the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) taught him to pray correctly. So,this man abandoned an obligatory act due to ignorance, because he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;By Him Who sent you with the truth, I cannot pray better than this, so teach me.&#8221; If an obligation was cancelled due to ignorance, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) would have excused him; and this rule is important and beneficial for the seeker of knowledge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise and thanks are to Allah, the Lord of the worlds, and I send prayers and blessings on our Prophet, Muhammad and upon all his family and Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>How Should a Person Pray in an Airplane?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 . He should offer the voluntary prayers in an airplane while he is sitting in his seat in whatever direction the airplane was facing, indicating the bowing and prostrating (by inclining his head), making the prostration lower than the bowing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. He should not offer the obligatory prayers in an airplane, unless he is able to face towards the Qiblah throughout the whole of the prayer and he is also able to bow, prostrate, stand and sit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. If he is unable to do that, he should delay the prayer until he lands at the airport and then pray on the ground. If he fears that the time for the prayer will expire before the airplane lands, he should delay it until the time of the next prayer. This is the case if it is one of those prayers that may be combined with another, such as Zuhr with &#8216;Asr or Maghrib with &#8216;Isha&#8217;. If he fears that the time for the next prayer will expire, he should pray them both in the airplane before the time ends and perform whatever conditions, pillars and obligations of the prayer he is able to. For example: If the airplane took off just before sunset and the sun set while he was in the air, then he should not offer the Maghrib prayer until the airplane lands at the airport, he disembarks, and then prays on the ground. But if he fears that the time for offering the Maghrib prayer will expire, he should delay it until the time of &#8216;Isha&#8217; and offer them both together, combining them and delaying the Maghrib prayer until the time of the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer after he descends. But if he fears that the time for the isha prayer will expire &#8211; and it expires at midnight &#8211; he should offer them before the time expires in the airplane.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The manner of performing the obligatory prayer in the airplane is to stand facing the Qiblah and make the Takbir. Then he recites Sural Al-Fatihah and the words which it is prescribed to recite before it, such as the opening supplication (Du&#8217;a Al- Istiftah) and some Qur&#8217;anic Verses after it. Then he should bow, then straighten up from bowing, and relax in a standing position, then prostrate, then straighten up from prostration, and relax in a sitting position, then prostrate again, then do likewise in the remainder of the prayer. If he is unable to prostrate, he should sit and indicate the prostration while sitting, and if he does not know the Qiblah, and no one reliable can inform him of it, he should use his judgement and try to ascertain it, then pray according to his judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. The prayer of the traveller in an airplane is shortened, so he performs the four Rak&#8217;ah prayer as two Rak&#8217;ahs like other travellers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#993300;">How Should a Person Who is Travelling by Airplane Assume Ihram for Hajj and &#8216;Umrah?</span></p>
<p>1 . He should perform Ghusl in his house and remain in his normal clothing, or if he wishes, he may don the garments of Ihram.</p>
<p>2. Once the airplane is close to passing over the starting point, he should don the garments of Ihram, if he has not done so already.</p>
<p>3. When the airplane passes over the starting point, he should make the intention for commencing the rites and say the Talbiyyah according to his intention either Hajj or &#8216;Umrah.</p>
<p>4. If he assumes Ihram before passing over the starting point as a precaution, being fearful of remissness or forgetfulness, then there is no objection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a very regrettable thing with regard to this matter which is the carelessness of some women concerning travelling by airplane without a Mahram.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are very negligent in this matter: One finds women travelling by airplane alone, and their <strong>justification</strong> for doing this is that they say that her Mahram escorted her in the airport from which the airplane took off and the other Mahram will meet her in the airport at which the airplane lands, and that in the airplane she is safe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This justification is weak in reality, because the Mahram who accompanies her does not admit her onto the airplane, he only admits her to the departure lounge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It may also be that the airplane is delayed in taking off and so this woman remains lost, or the airplane might take off and then be unable to land at the intended airport due to some reason or another, and so it lands at some other place, else and so this woman will be lost. Or, the airplane might land at the intended airport, but the Mahram who is supposed to meet her does not arrive due to one reason or another, such as illness, sleep or a car accident which prevents him from getting there, or something else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even if all of these things did not happen, and the airplane landed at the correct time of arrival and the Mahram who was supposed to meet her was present, there might be some man sitting next to her on the airplane who does not fear Allah, the Most High and does not respect the worshippers of Allah, and he might be attracted to her and she to him, which might lead to Fitnah (temptation, trial) and unlawful deeds, as is well known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is incumbent upon a woman to fear Allah, the Almighty, the All-Powerful and not to travel except with a Mahram. It is also incumbent upon women&#8217;s male guardians whom Allah has made protectors and maintainers of women to fear Allah, the Almighty, the Ail-Powerful, and to avoid being negligent to those they are Mahrim for, and losing their zeal and their religion, for a person is responsible for his family. Because Allah, the Most High has made them a trust for him; He, the Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O you believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey not, (from executing) the Commands they receive from Allah, but do that which they are commanded.&#8221;</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>If a person travels from one country to another where the new crescent of Shawwal has been sighted, should he follow them and break his fast?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Q. 394. If a fasting person travels from one Islamic country to another and it was announced in the first country that the new crescent of Shawwal has been sighted, should he follow them and break his fast, bearing in mind that the new crescent of Shawwal has not yet been sighted in the second country?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. If a person travels from one Islamic country to another, and the breaking of the fast in the country to which he has travelled was delayed, then he should remain (fasting) with them until they break their fast, because fasting is when the people fast and breaking the fast is when the people break their fast and ( &#8216;Eid) Al-Adha ( Sacrifice) is on the day when the people sacrifice their animals, even if it means that he increases a day or more. It is the same as if he travelled to a country where the sunset is late for his usual day might be lengthened by two or three hours, or more if he travelled to another country. The new crescent has not been seen there, and the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ordered us to not fast unless we see the new crescent, and he also said: <strong>&#8220;Break your fast when you see it.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the opposite, such as when he travels from a country in which confirmation of the start of the month is delayed to a country in which the start of the month has been confirmed, then he should break his fast with them and make up for what he has missed of Ramadan later. If he missed a day, he must make up for a day and if he missed two days, he must make up for two days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We say that he makes it up in the second case, because it is not possible for the month to be less than twenty-nine days, nor for it to be more than thirty days. And we say to him: Break your fast, even if you have not completed twenty-nine days, because the new crescent has been seen, and once it has been seen, you must break your fast. And since you have fasted less than twenty-nine, because it is not possible for the month to be less than twenty-nine, so you must complete twenty-nine days, as opposed to the first situation, for you should not break your fast until the new crescent has been seen, and if it has not been seen, then you are still in Ramadan. So, how can you break your fast, for you must fast, even if the month was increased for you, it is only like the increase in the hours of the day .</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p>Is it permissible to offer two Witr prayers in one night?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p>No one should offer two Witr prayers in one night because the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There cannot be two Witr prayers in one night.[1]</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>And he (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) also said:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Make the end of your prayer at night Witr. [2] </strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>And he (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Whoever feared that he will not get up at the end of the night should perform Witr at the beginning of it. And whoever desired to stand at the end of it should pray Witr at the end of the night.</strong></span> [3]</p></blockquote>
<p>If it is easy for the Muslim to perform the night prayer at the end of the night, he should seal his prayer with one Rakah of Witr. Whoever found difficulty in this should perform his Witr at the start of the night.</p>
<p>And if Allaah makes it easy for him (after that) to stand in prayer, he should offer what he can in units of two Rakahs, and he need not repeat the Witr, for the first Witr is sufficient for him, according to the aforementioned Hadith which is:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There cannot be two Witr prayers in one night. [4]</strong></span></p></blockquote>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q. 400. If a person breaks his fast due to some excuse, and then the excuse is removed during the day, should he fast for the remainder of the day?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. He is not obliged to fast. This is because it has been made lawful for this man to break his fast on this day based upon an evidence from the Islamic Law. The Islamic Law allows one who is compelled to take medication for example, to take it, but if he takes, he breaks his fast. Therefore the prohibition of the day does not apply to him, because it has been permitted for him to break his fast, but he is required to compensate for it<span style="color:#808080;"><a style="color:#808080;" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2015/06/25/whoever-breaks-his-fast-with-an-excuse-then-that-person-is-not-obliged-to-fast-for-the-rest-of-the-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">,</a></span> and for us to require him to fast without any benefit is legally incorrect. So as long as this man does not benefit from fasting, it is not incumbent upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of this would be a man who sees someone drowning in the water and he says: If I drank, it would be possible for me to save him, and if I did not drink, it would not be possible for me to save him, so he drinks and then saves him and he eats and drinks for the remainder of the day. This man is not prohibited from eating and drinking on this day, since it has been made lawful for him not to fast in accordance with the Islamic Law. Therefore, he is not required to fast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For this reason, if there was a sick person, would we say to him: Do not eat unless you are hungry and do not drink unless you are thirsty? Meaning: Do not eat or drink except due to necessity. We would not say this to him, because it is permissible for the sick person to break his fast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, every person who breaks his fast in Ramadan in accordance with some legal evidence is not obliged to fast, and vice versa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever breaks his fast without an excuse, then he must fast, because it is not lawful for him to break his fast and he has transgressed the prohibition of that day without permission from the Islamic Law. So, we must compel him to fast the remainder of the day and to make up for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah knows better.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q. 398. What are the permissible excuses for breaking the fast?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. The permissible excuses for breaking the fast are: <strong>Illness</strong> and <strong>travel</strong>, as mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among other excuses is that a woman is <strong>pregnant</strong> and she fears for herself or her child. Another excuse is that a woman is <strong>breast-feeding</strong> and she fears for herself or her breast-fed child if she fasts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another excuse is that a person needs to break his fast in order to save the life of someone. For example, he finds a drowning person in the sea, or someone who is surrounded on all sides by fire, and he needs to break his fast in order to save him &#8211; in that case, he may break his fast and save him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another such case would be if a person needed to break his fast in order to strengthen himself for Jihad in Allah&#8217;s Cause, that would also be a permissible cause for him to break his fast, because the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said to his Companions, may Allah be pleased with them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>You will meet the enemy tomorrow morning, so breaking the fast stronger for you, so break your fast</strong>.&#8221; [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if there is a permissible excuse for breaking the fast, and a person breaks his fast due to it, it is not necessary for him to fast for the remainder of that day. Therefore, if it transpired that a person had broken his fast in order to save a person&#8217;s life, he should continue to eat and drink, even after saving him. This is because he broke his fast for a reason which permits him to break his fast, so it is not necessary for him to fast in that case, because the prohibition of breaking fast on that day has been removed due to the permissible cause for breaking the fast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For this reason, we support the most authoritative opinion in this matter, which is that if a sick person became well during the day and he was not fasting, it is not necessary for him to fast, and if a traveller arrived during the day at his hometown and he was not fasting, it is not necessary for him to fast, and if a menstruating woman became clean during the day, it is not necessary for her to fast. This is because all of these people broke their fasts for legitimate reasons, and so on that day, there was no obligation upon them to fast, due to the lawful permission for breaking it at that time, so it is not necessary for them to fast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is as opposed to the case where it is confirmed that the month of Ramadan has begun during the day in that case, it is necessary to fast. The difference between the two cases is clear, because if the evidence appears (that Ramadan has begun) during the day, it has been confirmed that fasting on that day is obligatory for them, but they are excused for the time before the evidence became clear to them due to their ignorance of it. This is why, if they knew that this day was a day of Ramadan, it is obligatory for them to fast. But as for those other people whom we have described, it is permissible for them to break their fast, even though they are aware (that it is Ramadan) and the difference between them is clear.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Q. 405. If a traveller arrives in Makkah and he is fasting, should he break his fast in order to gain strength to perform &#8216;Umrah?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. We say that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) entered Makkah on the twentieth of Ramadan in the year of the conquest of Makkah and he was not fasting, and he led the people of Makkah in a two Rak&#8217;ah prayer and he said to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Oh, people of Makkah! Complete the prayer (i.e. pray four Rak&#8217;ahs), for we are travellers</strong></span>.&#8221; [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been confirmed in Sahih Al-Bukhari that the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) did not fast for the remainder of the month, because he was a traveller, so the journey of a person performing &#8216;Umrah does not end with his arrival in Makkah, and he is not obliged to fast if he arrives while not fasting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Some people might continue to fast even while they are travelling, thinking that to fast while travelling in the present day is not difficult for people. So, they will continue fasting even while travelling, then they arrive in Makkah and feel tired, and so they say to themselves: Should I continue my fast and delay the &#8216;Umrah until after I have broken my fast, or should I break my fast in order to perform the &#8216;Umrah immediately upon arrival in Makkah. We would say to them in these circumstances: It is better for you to break your fast in order to perform &#8216;Umrah immediately upon arrival in Makkah, in order to perform this rite. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Because when the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) entered Makkah and he was performing his religious rites, he would go straight to the Masjid, even making his camel kneel outside the Masjid, entering it in order to perform the rites, for he was so preoccupied with it. Therefore, for those who perform &#8216;Umrah, breaking your fast in order to perform &#8216;Umrah briskly is better than remaining in a state of fasting, then performing your &#8216;Umrah after you have broken your fast at night.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is confirmed from the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) that he was fasting on his journey to the battle for the conquest of Makkah, and the people came to him and said: &#8220;Oh, Messenger of Allah! Fasting has become difficult for the people and they are waiting to see what you will do.&#8221; And this was after &#8216;Asr, but the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) called for water and drank it while the people were watching. [2] So, the Prophet broke his fast during his journey, indeed, he broke his fast at the end of the day, and all of this was in order to make it clear to his people that this was permissible. Fasting while travelling, as some do, in spite of difficulty, contradicts the Sunnah; of this there is no doubt. To this applies the statement of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>It is not righteousness to fast while on a journey.</strong></span> &#8221; [3]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Q. 359. <strong>Is it correct for a person who is in debt to give charity? And what legal obligations are lifted from the debtor? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. Charity is a form of spending which is commanded by the Islamic Law, and it is a form of Ihsan towards Allah&#8217;s worshippers, if it is given where it is needed. A person will be rewarded for his charity, and every man will be in the shade of his charity on the Day of Resurrection and it is accepted whether a person is in debt or not, as long as the conditions for its acceptance are met.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These conditions are that it is given <strong>purely and sincerely for Allah</strong>, the Almighty, the All-Powerful&#8217;s sake, that it is from <strong>honest earnings</strong>, and it is given <strong>where it is needed</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If these conditions are fulfilled, then the charity is accepted, according to the legal evidences; and it is not a condition that a person be free of debt. <strong>But if the debt covers all that he has, then it is not wise, nor is it logical that he should give charity while charity is recommended, not obligatory and that he should leave the debt which is an obligation on him. He should begin first with the obligation, then give charity</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars have disagreed regarding the situation if a person gives charity when he has a debt covering all of his wealth: Some of them say that it is not permissible because it harms his creditor, and it causes this obligatory debt to remain unpaid. Some of them say that it is permissible, but that it contradicts what is more worthy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In any case, it is not fitting for a person whose debt covers all that he has, to give charity until he has settled his debt, because an obligation takes precedence over a voluntary act of worship.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the legal obligations that are lifted from one who is indebted until such time as he pays it, they include Hajj, because Hajj is not incumbent upon a person who is in debt until he has paid it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As for Zakah</strong>, scholars have differed regarding whether its obligation is lifted from the debtor until such lime as he pays the debt or not.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Among the scholars are those who say that the obligation of Zakah is lifted on the amount which is equivalent to the debt, whether the wealth is evident or not.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Among them are those who say that the obligation to pay Zakah is not lifted on the amount which is equivalent to the debt; rather he must pay Zakah on the whole amount which he possesses. If there is a debt incumbent on him, the Nisab is decreased.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There are those among them who discriminate, saying that if the wealth is concealed, wealth which is not seen and is not perceptible, such as money and trading merchandise, then the obligation to pay Zakah is lifted on the amount which is equivalent to the debt, while if the wealth is in the form of perceptible things, such livestock and the produce of the earth, then the obligation to pay Zakah is not lifted.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">The correct view in my opinion is that the obligation to pay it is not lifted, regardless of whether the wealth is perceptible or not, and that every person who has wealth in his hand upon which Zakah is payable must pay his Zakah, even if he is in debt. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because Zakah is incumbent upon wealth, according to the Words of Allah, the Most High:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Take Sadaqah (alms) from their wealth in order to purify them and sanctify them with it, and invoke Allah for them. Verily your invocations are a source of security for them; and Allah is All- Hearer, All-Knower&#8221;</strong></span> [At-Tawbah 9:103]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the words of the Prophet to Mu&#8217;ath bin Jabal, may Allah be pleased with him, when he sent him to Yemen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Inform them that Allah has made incumbent upon them the payment of Zakah on their wealth; it is taken from the wealthy among them and distributed among their poor.&#8221;</strong> </span>[2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadith is in Sahih Al-Bukhari with this wording. By this evidence from the Book (of Allah) and the Sunnah, the two things are separate, and there is no conflict between Zakah and a debt, because a debt remains an obligation and Zakah is incumbent upon wealth. So, each of them is incumbent in a place wherein the other is not incumbent, so there is no conflict between them, and no contradiction, and thus a <strong>debt remains the responsibility of its owner and Zakah remains incumbent on wealth</strong>, and he must pay it from the wealth in all circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[2] Reported by Al-Bukhari in the Book of Zakah, in the Chapter: The Obligation of Zakah ( 1 395 ); and by Muslim in the Book of Faith, in the Chapter: Calling to the Shahadatan and the Laws of Islam (19).</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q. 381. Is every person who extends his hand for Zakah deserving of it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. Not every person who extends his hand for Zakah is deserving of it, because there are those among mankind who extend their hands for money while they are wealthy. This type of person will come on the Day of Resurrection while his face will not have a bit of flesh on it, [1] may Allah protect us from that. He will come on the Day of Resurrection, on the Day when the witnesses will stand and the bones of his face will be visible, may Allah protect us from that, and the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;He who begs the riches of others to increase his own wealth is asking only for burning coals (in the Hereafter), so let him ask a little or much.&#8221;</strong></span> [2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I would like to take this opportunity to warn those people who ask people in an importune manner when they are in possession of wealth. Indeed, I warn everyone who accepts Zakah when he is not entitled to receive it. I say to him: If you took Zakah to which you are not entitled, you are only consuming ill-gotten gains, may Allah protect us from that, and a person should fear Allah, for the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Whoever tries to make himself self-sufficient, Allah will make him self-sufficient; and whoever abstains from asking others, Allah will make him content&#8221;</strong></span> [3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if a man extends his hand to you, and you believe it is most likely that he is entitled to it, and you gave him, then the Zakah will be counted, and you will have discharged your obligation, even if it became apparent after that that he was not entitled to it. There is no need to think that you have to pay the Zakah again (to someone else).</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The evidence for this is the story of the man who gave money in charity, and he gave charity first to a <strong>prostitute</strong> and the people began to talk, saying: &#8220;Have you given money tonight to a prostitute?&#8221; He said: &#8220;All praise and thanks are to Allah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he gave charity on the second night and it fell into the hands of a <strong>thief</strong> and the people began to talk, saying: &#8220;Have you given money tonight to a thief?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he gave charity on the third night to a <strong>rich man</strong> and the people began to talk, saying: &#8220;Have you given money tonight to a rich man?&#8221; He said: &#8220;All praise and thanks are to Allah for the prostitute, the thief and the rich man.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then it was said to him (by an angel): &#8220;Your charity has been accepted; as for the prostitute, haply (i.e perhaps) she may content herself with what you have given her and it may prevent her from committing illegal sexual intercourse, while as for the thief, haply he may content himself with what you have given him and he may refrain from stealing, while as for the rich man, haply, he may reflect and give charity&#8221; [4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, my brother, look at the honest intention, what is its effect: Therefore, if you gave the person who asked you, and then it became apparent that he was wealthy and you had given him something, believing that he was poor, it is not necessary for you to repay the Zakah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(37. It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah, but it is <em><strong>Taqwa</strong> </em>from you that reaches Him. Thus have We made them subject to you that you may proclaim Allah&#8217;s greatness for His guidance to you. And give glad tidings to the doers of good.) </span>&#8211; Suratul Baqarah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says: this sacrifice is prescribed for you so that you will remember Him at the time of slaughter, for He is the Creator and Provider. Nothing of its flesh or blood reaches Him, for He has no need of anything other than Himself. During the time of Jahiliyyah, when they offered sacrifices to their gods, they would put some of the meat of their sacrifices on their idols, and sprinkle the blood over them. But Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah,)</strong> Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn Jurayj said, &#8220;The people of the Jahiliyyah used to put the meat of their sacrifices and sprinkle the blood on the House, and the Companions of the Messenger of Allah said, &#8220;<strong>We have more right to do that</strong>.&#8221; Then Allah revealed the words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah, but it is Taqwa from you that reaches Him.)</strong> That is what He will accept and reward for, as mentioned in the Sahih,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Allah does not look to your appearance or your colors, but He looks to your hearts and deeds.)</strong> And in the Hadith; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(Indeed charity falls in the Hand of Ar-Rahman before it falls in the hand of the one asking.)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Thus have We made them subject to you)</strong> meaning, `for this purpose We have subjugated the Budn for you,&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(that you may proclaim Allah&#8217;s greatness for His guidance to you.)</strong> means, that you may glorify Him for guiding you to His religion and His way which He loves and is pleased with, and has forbidden you to do all that He hates and rejects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And give glad tidings to the doers of good.)</strong> means, `give good news, O Muhammad, to those who do good,&#8217; i.e., whose deeds are good and who remain within the limits prescribed by Allah, who follow that which has been prescribed for them, who believe in the Messenger and follow that which he has conveyed from his Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Note) The Udhiyyah is Sunnah Mustahabbah One animal is sufficient on behalf of all the members of one household. Ibn `Umar said, &#8220;<strong>The Messenger of Allah continued to offer sacrifice for ten years</strong>.&#8221; This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi. Abu Ayyub said: &#8220;At the time of the Messenger of Allah , a man would sacrifice a sheep on behalf of himself and all the members of his household, and they would eat from it and feed others, until the people started boasting ﴿by sacrificing more than one﴾ and things reached the stage that you see now.&#8221; This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, who graded it Sahih, and by Ibn Majah. `Abdullah bin Hisham used to sacrifice one sheep on behalf of his entire family; this was recorded by Al-Bukhari. Concerning how old the sacrificial animal should be, Muslim recorded from Jabir that the Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Do not sacrifice any but mature animals, and if that is not possible, then sacrifice a young sheep.)</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The Sick person is required to purify himself with water, performing ablution from minor impurity and <i>Ghusl</i> from major impurity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. If he is unable to purify himself using water, due to weakness or fear of increasing his illness, or delaying his recovery, then he may perform <i>Tayammum</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The way to perform <i>Tayammum</i> is to strike the clean earth with his hands once, then wipe his whole face with them, then wipe his hands, one with the other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. If he is unable to purify himself, the another person should assist him in making the ablution, or performing the <i>Tayammum</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. If a certain part of the body which is to be purified is afflicted by a wound, he should wash it with water; but if washing it with water will cause harm to him, then he may wet his hand with water and then wipe over it. If wiping over it may also cause harm he may perform <i>Tayammum</i> for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. If he has a severe fracture in any of his limbs, which is covered with a dressing or cast, he may wipe over it with water, instead of washing it, and it does not require <i>Tayammum</i>, because the wiping takes the place of washing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. It is permisable to make <i>Tayammum</i> using a wall, or anything else which is clean and contains dust. If the wall is covered with anything which is not from th earth such as paint, then one should not make <i>Tayammum</i> with it, unless there is dust over it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. If the <i>Tayammum</i> is not made on the earth or a wall or anything else containing dust, there is no objection to the collecting of dust in container or a hankerchief, in order to make <i>Tayammum</i> with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. If a person performs <i>Tayammum</i> for prayer, and remains in a purified state until the time of the next prayer, then he may pray with the <i>Tayammum</i> he made before and he does not need to repeat it for the second prayer, since he remains purified and nothing has invalidated it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. The sick person is obliged to cleanse his body from all manner of impurity, but if he is unable to do so, he may pray as he is, and his prayer will be correct and he does not need to repeat it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11 The sick person is required to pray in clean clothes, and if they became soiled, they must be cleaned or replaced with clean ones. If this is not possible, he may pray as he is, and his prayer will be correct and he does not need to repeat it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. The sick person is obliged to pray upon something clean and if it becomes soiled, he must wash it, change for something clean or cover it with something clean. If he is unable to do so, he may pray there, and his prayer will be correct and he does not need to repeat it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. It is not permissible for the invalid to delay the prayer due to his inability to achieve purification; rather, he should purify himself as much as he is able, then perform the prayer on time, even if there is some impurity on his body, his clothes or his place of prayer, which he is unable to remove.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allaah, the Lords of the Worlds, and may peace and blessings of Allaah be upon the noblest of the Prophets and Messengers, our Prophet, Muhammad and upon all his family and Companions. As for what follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily, Allaah, the Most Glorified, Most High has legislated purification for every prayer, because the elimination of impurity and the removal of pollution &#8211; whether on the body, the clothes or the place of prayer &#8211; are two of the conditions of prayer. So when the Muslim wishes to pray, he must perform the well known ablution <i>(Wudhu)</i> to purify himself from minor impurity, or make Ghusl if the impurity is of the major kind. And before making ablution, <i>Istinja&#8217;</i> must be performed with water, or <i>Istijmar</i> by the one who has urinated or defecated in order that the purification and cleansing be complete. What follows is an explanation of some of the rulings related to this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Istinja&#8217;</i> with water is obligatory every time something is discharged from the bowel and bladder, such as urine or faeces. But it is not necessary for the sleeper or one who passes wind to perform <i>Istinja&#8217;</i>. He is only required to perform ablution, because <i>Istinja&#8217;</i>is only prescribed for the removal of impurity, and there is no impurity in this situation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Istijmar</i> is performed using stones, or another material in its place (such as wood, paper etc.) It must consist of three clean stones, as proved by the Hadith of the Prophet<i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i> which states that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;Whoever performs Istijmar, let him make it </i><i>Witr</i> (i.e. use an odd number of stones).&#8221;</span> [Abu Dawud no.35 and Ibn Majah no. 337]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i> also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;If any of you goes to defecate, he should take with him three stones, for they will be sufficient for him.&#8221;</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim narrated that he <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i> forbade <i>Istijmar</i> with less than three stones. It is not permissible to make <i>Istijmar</i> with animal droppings, bones or food or anything which contains some forbidden material. It is preferred for a person to perform <i>istijmar</i> with stones, or the like such as tissues etc. After which, he should use water, because the stones remove the essence of the pollution, but the water purifies the area and is therefore more thorough. A person has a choice of <i>Istinja&#8217;</i> with water, or<i>Istijmar</i> with stones or the like. It is reported on the authority of Anas, may Allaah be pleased with him, that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;The Prophet </i><i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i> entered the toilet and I and a young boy like me carried materials, including water and <i>&#8216;anaza</i> (a short spear) and he would perform <i>Istinja&#8217;</i> with the water.&#8221;</span> [al-Bukhari no.152 &amp; Muslim no.271.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported on the authority of &#8216;Aishah, may Allaah be pleased with her, that she said to a group of women:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Order your husbands to clean themselves following defecation with water, for I am too embarrassed to do so, and the Prophet (Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) used to do so.&#8221;</span></em> At-Tirmidhee said that it was authentic [At-Tirmidhee no.19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a person wants to use only one of them (i.e. stones or water), it is preferred to choose water, because it cleans the area removing the essence and the traces and it is more thorough in cleansing. If he chooses to only use stones, he should content himself with three, if it cleanses the area, but if it is not enough, he may use four or five (or more) until he has cleaned the area, but it is better to finish with an odd number, based upon the saying of the Prophet <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Whoever performs Istijmar, let him make it Witr.&#8221;</span></em> [Abu Dawud no.35 and Ibn Majah no. 337]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissable to make the <i>Istijmar</i> with the right hand, according to the <i>Hadith</i> of Salman, may Allaah be pleased with him, in which he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Messenger of Allaah forbade us from performing <i>Istinja&#8217;</i> with the right hand.&#8221; And he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;None of you should hold his penis in his right hand while he is urinating. nor should he wipe himself with the right hand after answering the call of nature.&#8221;</span> </i>[Al-Bukhari no.153 &amp; Muslim no.267]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if his left hand has been cut off, or is broken or there is some disease in it, he may use his right hand, and there is no objection to that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because the Islamic law is based upon facility and ease, Allaah, the Most Glorified, Most High has lightened the burden of worship on those who have some excuse, according to the excuse. He, the Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And (He) has not laid upon you in religion any hardship</b>.&#8221; [Surah al-Hajj 22:78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allaah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you.&#8221;</b>[Surah al-Baqarah 2:185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can.&#8221;</b> [Surah at-Taghabun 64:16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;If I order you to do something, do it as much as you can.&#8221;</i></span> [Al-Bukharino.7288 &amp; Muslim no.1337]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;Verily the Religion is ease.&#8221;</i> </span>[Narrated by al-Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a sick person is unable to cleanse himself of minor impurity with the water by making ablution, or he is unable to purify himself of major impurity by making <i>Ghusl</i>, due to weakness, or fear of making his illness worse, or delaying his recovery, he may perform<i>Tayammum</i> [Dry ablution using sand or dust.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is done by striking his hands in clean dust once, then wiping his face with the palms of his hands and his fingers slowly, based upon the Words of Him, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And if you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you comes after answering the call of nature, or you have been in contact with women (by sexual relations) and you find no water, perform <i>Tayammum</i> with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands (Tayammum). Truly, Allaah is Ever Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.&#8221;</b> [Surah An-Nisa 4:43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ruling on those who are unable to use water is the same that of those who are unable to find water, according to the words of the Prophet <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;The reward of deeds depends upon the intentions and every person will get the reward according to what he has intended.&#8221;</i></span> [Al-Bukhari no. 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A sick person may fall into one of a number of categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. If his illness is a simple one and he does not fear to use the water, such as an ailment from which there is no fear that using the water will delay his recovery, or increase his pain, or cause any infection, such as a headache, toothache and the like, or he is able to use warm water without harm, then it is not allowed for him to make <i>Tayammum</i>. Because the permission to perform it is in order to prevent harm, and there is no fear of harm to him, and because he can find water, therefore he must use it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. If he fears from an illness which he fears may &#8211; should he use water &#8211; cause his death or harm one of his organs, or may lead to some illness which might cause his death or harm one of his organs, or cause the loss of some faculty, then it is permissible for him to perform <i>Tayammum</i>, based upon the words of the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And do not kill yourselves (nor kill one another). Surely, Allaah is Most Merciful to you.&#8221;</b>[Surah an-Nisa&#8217; 4:29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. If he is suffering from some illness which makes him unable to move, and he finds no one to bring him water, it is permissible for him to perform <i>Tayammum</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Anyone suffering from a wound, an ulcer or fracture, or any illness which will be exacerbated by using water, and who becomes <i>Junub</i> [in a state of sexual impurity] is allowed to perform <i>Tayammum</i>, based upon the above evidences. If he is able to wash the healthy areas of his body, he must do so and make <i>Tayammum</i> for the rest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A sick person who is in a place in which he finds neither water nor dust, or anyone who can bring him either one of them, may pray whatever condition he is in, and he is not allowed to delay the prayer, as Allaah, the Most High say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can.&#8221;</b> [Surah at-Taghabun 64:16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. An invalid afflicted with incontinence of urine, who is not cured by his treatment, must make ablution for every prayer after the start of its prescribed time, wash off any urine that has affected his body, and wear a clean garment for his prayer, if this is not a burden on him. But if it is, he is excused from it, based upon the Allaah Words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And (He) has not laid upon you in religion any hardship</b>.&#8221; [Surah al-Hajj 22:78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His Words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allaah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you.&#8221;</b>[Surah al-Baqarah 2:185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the words of the Prophet <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;If I order you to do something, do it as much as you cable.&#8221;</i></span> [Al-Bukhari no.7288 &amp; Muslim no.1337]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He must try to the best of his ability to prevent the spread of the urine to his clothes, or his body, or the place in which he will pray. And everything that invalidates ablution also invalidates <i>Tayammum</i>, and in addition, the ability to use water or its presence. And Allaah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Through what avenues does the Shaytaan find a way to make suggestions to man?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">There are many avenues;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He might try to incite someone to <strong>fornicate</strong>, for example. He first incites his victim to be alone with women, then to look at them, then to talk to them, then perhaps to listen to them sing, and so on until he achieves his end: when his victim fornicates.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Shaytaan may attack a person through his </span>stomach<span style="color:#000000;">, by tempting him into eating what is unlawful, into drinking <strong>alcohol</strong>, or even into taking <strong>drugs</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Shaytaan may find that a person has an inordinate love for owning things, so he biguiles him into gaining wealth through unlawful means:<strong> stealing, swindling, practicing usury, usurping, cheating.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He may find that a person has a great deal of <strong>pride</strong>, so he will encourage him to belittle others, to be haughty with those inferior to him in society,</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">and the list of Shaytaan&#8217;s tricks is endless.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">May Allaah send peace and blessings on Muhammad, his family, and his Companions.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Dr. Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali</strong> (Translator of the Noble Qur&#8217;an) writes:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‎It is a pity that many nations are only satisfied in the translated meaning of the Qur&#8217;an and Prophet&#8217;s Sunnah instead of studying the (true) Arabic text of the Qur&#8217;an and Prophet&#8217;‎s Sunnah. For this reason they are divided into various sects (due to the lack of knowledge about the religion of Islam) e.g. as regards to the ways of religious education, etc. so they are plunged in differences, which was prohibited by Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the translation of the meaning of the Qur&#8217;an is meant for the above said purpose then it is a real mischief-doing, and an evil action and is against what was brought by Allaah‎s Messenger (Peace be upon him) and also against the opinions of the early and present day religious scholars. <strong>All the religious scholars unanimously agree that the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah should be taught in the language of the Qur&#8217;an (i.e. Arabic Language)</strong>. So did the early religious scholars of the Muslim nation when they conquered different countries.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translations are mainly meant for informing the people who have not yet embraced Islam to make clear to them the principles of Islam and the teachings of Muhammad (Peace be upon him) and to know its exact facts. When they reach this state and Allaah has blessed them with Islam, they must take the Qur&#8217;anic and the Messenger‎s Language (i.e. Arabic) as the only language to understand Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah&#8217;s mercy be on Shaykh &#8216;Umar Uzbak, a great Turkish man, who strove for Islam in Uzbakistan under the Russian government, after his long fight against the enemies of Islam with fire (iron) and tongue (speech), he took refuge in Afghanistan at Kabul, where the government honoured him. I met him there in 1352 A.H. (approx. 1932 CE) i.e. nearly 40 years ago, and he had vowed to Allaah that he will never speak to a relative or anybody else except in the Qur&#8217;anic and Messenger&#8217;s (Arabic) language. His wife sent a man for me to intercede for her to him that he should speak with her and her children in the Turkish language even for an hour everyday. So when I spoke to him about it, he said: &#8216;Russians had compelled us to learn perfectly the Russian language (by force), so we learnt it. And unless they knew that the learning of the Russian language will make the person who learns it, follow their ways of thinking, characters, and their traditions, they would not have forced anybody to learn it.&#8217; He further said to me, &#8216;I have vowed to Allaah long ago not to speak except in the language of the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah (i.e. Arabic) and I do that only for Allaah&#8217;s sake. If my wife and children desire to enjoy speaking with me, they should learn the language of the Qur&#8217;an and of the Prophet (Peace be upon him) (i.e. Arabic) and I am ready to teach them the Qur&#8217;anic language whenever they desire that‎</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Which was revealed in Makkah</b></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ أُقْسِمُ بِيَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ &#8211; وَلاَ أُقْسِمُ بِالنَّفْسِ اللَّوَّامَةِ &#8211; أَيَحْسَبُ الإِنسَـنُ أَلَّن نَّجْمَعَ عِظَامَهُ &#8211; بَلَى قَـدِرِينَ عَلَى أَن نُّسَوِّىَ بَنَانَهُ &#8211; بَلْ يُرِيدُ الإِنسَـنُ لِيَفْجُرَ أَمَامَهُ &#8211; يَسْـَلُ أَيَّانَ يَوْمُ الْقِيَـمَةِ &#8211; فَإِذَا بَرِقَ الْبَصَرُ &#8211; وَخَسَفَ الْقَمَرُ &#8211; وَجُمِعَ الشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ &#8211; يَقُولُ الإِنسَـنُ يَوْمَئِذٍ أَيْنَ الْمَفَرُّ &#8211; كَلاَّ لاَ وَزَرَ &#8211; إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمُسْتَقَرُّ &#8211; يُنَبَّأُ الإِنسَـنُ يَوْمَئِذِ بِمَا قَدَّمَ وَأَخَّرَ &#8211; بَلِ الإِنسَـنُ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ بَصِيرَةٌ &#8211; وَلَوْ أَلْقَى مَعَاذِيرَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1. Nay! I swear by the Day of Resurrection.) (2. And nay! I swear by An-Nafs Al-Lawwamah.) (3. Does man think that We shall not assemble his bones) (4. Yes, We are able to put together in perfect order the tips of his fingers.) (5. Nay! Man desires to break out ahead of himself.) (6. He asks: &#8220;When will be this Day of Resurrection&#8221;) (7. So, when Bariqa the sight.) (8. And the moon will be eclipsed.) (9. And the sun and moon will be joined together.) (10. On that Day man will say: &#8220;Where (is the refuge) to flee&#8221;) (11. No! There is no refuge!) (12. Unto your Lord will be the place of rest that Day.) (13. On that Day man will be informed of what he sent forward, and what he left behind.) (14. Nay! Man will be well informed about himself,) (15. Though he may put forth his excuses.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Oath about the Final Return on the Day of Resurrection and the Refutation against the Plots of the Thinkers</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been mentioned previously on more than one occasion that if the thing that is being sworn about is something that is being negated, then it is permissible to use the word &#8220;La&#8221; (Nay) before the oath to emphasize the negation. Here, what is being sworn about is the affirmation of the final abode and the refutation against the claim of the ignorant that the resurrection of bodies will not occur. This is why Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ أُقْسِمُ بِيَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ &#8211; وَلاَ أُقْسِمُ بِالنَّفْسِ اللَّوَّامَةِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay! I swear by the Day of Resurrection. And nay! I swear by An-Nafs Al-Lawwamah.) Qatadah said, &#8220;This means, I swear by both of these things.&#8221; This has also been reported from Ibn `Abbas and Sa`id bin Jubayr. Concerning the Day of Judgement, it is well known what it is. In reference to An-Nafs Al-Lawwamah, Qurrah bin Khalid reported from Al-Hasan Al-Basri that he said about this Ayah, &#8220;Verily, by Allah, we think that every believer blames himself. He says (questioning himself), `What did I intend by my statement What did I intend by my eating What did I intend in what I said to myself&#8217; However, the sinner proceeds ahead and he does not blame himself.&#8221; Ibn Jarir recorded from Sa`id bin Jubayr that he said concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلاَ أُقْسِمُ بِالنَّفْسِ اللَّوَّامَةِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And nay! I swear by An-Nafs Al-Lawwamah) &#8220;He criticizes himself in good and bad.&#8221; Similar has been reported from `Ikrimah. Ibn Abi Najih reported from Mujahid: &#8220;He is sorry for what he missed (of good deeds) and he blames himself for it.&#8221; Allah said;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَيَحْسَبُ الإِنسَـنُ أَلَّن نَّجْمَعَ عِظَامَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Does man think that We shall not assemble his bones) meaning, `on the Day of Judgement does he think that We are not able to return his bones and gather them from their various places&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[بَلَى قَـدِرِينَ عَلَى أَن نُّسَوِّىَ بَنَانَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Yes, We are able to put together in perfect order the tips of his fingers.) meaning, `does man think that We will not gather his bones Surely, We will gather them and We are quite able to put together his fingertips. This means Our power is suitable to gather (and recreate) them, and if We wished We could surely resurrect him with more than what he originally had. We could make his Banan, which are the tips of his fingers, all equal (in length).&#8217; Concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[بَلْ يُرِيدُ الإِنسَـنُ لِيَفْجُرَ أَمَامَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay! Man desires to break out ahead of himself.) Sa`id reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, &#8220;This means to proceed forward.&#8221; Mujahid said about,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لِيَفْجُرَ أَمَامَهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(to break out ahead of himself.) &#8220;This means that he wants to proceed ahead following his own whims.&#8221; `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, &#8220;This refers to the disbeliever who denies the Day of Reckoning.&#8221; Ibn Zayd said the same thing. Thus, Allah says after this,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[يَسْـَلُ أَيَّانَ يَوْمُ الْقِيَـمَةِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He asks: &#8220;When will be this Day of Resurrection&#8221;) meaning, he says when will the Day of Judgement be His question is only a question of denying its occurrence, and rejecting its existence. This is as Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَى هَـذَا الْوَعْدُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ قُل لَّكُم مِّيعَادُ يَوْمٍ لاَّ تَسْتَـَخِرُونَ عَنْهُ سَاعَةً وَلاَ تَسْتَقْدِمُونَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And they say: &#8220;When is this promise if you are truthful&#8221; Say: &#8220;The appointment to you is for a Day, which you cannot put back for an hour nor put forward.&#8221;) (34:29-30) Here Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَإِذَا بَرِقَ الْبَصَرُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So, when Bariqa the sight.) Abu `Amr bin Al-`Ala&#8217; recited this Ayah as Bariqa with a Kasrah under the letter Ra, which means to be diminished. That which he (Abu `Amr) has said resembles the statement of Allah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ يَرْتَدُّ إِلَيْهِمْ طَرْفُهُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Their gaze returning not towards them.) (14:43) meaning, they will be looking this way and that way in horror. Their gaze will not be able to rest upon anything due to the severity of the terror on that Day. Others recited it as Baraqa with a Fathah over the letter Ra, and its meaning is close to the first recitation (Bariqa). The intent here is that the eyes will be dazzled, humbled, diminished, and humiliated on the Day of Judgement due to the severity of the horrors and the greatness of the matters that they will witness on that Day. Concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَخَسَفَ الْقَمَرُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And the moon will be eclipsed.) meaning, its light will go away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَجُمِعَ الشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And the sun and moon will be joined together.) Mujahid said, &#8220;They will be rolled up.&#8221; In explaining this Ayah, Ibn Zayd recited the following Ayat,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِذَا الشَّمْسُ كُوِّرَتْ &#8211; وَإِذَا النُّجُومُ انكَدَرَتْ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When the sun is wound round and its light is lost and is overthrown, and when the stars fall.) (81:1,2) It has been reported from Ibn Mas`ud that he recited the Ayah as, (وَجُمِعَ بَيْنَ الشَّمْسِ وَالْقَمَرِ) (and the sun and the moon will be joined between each other.) Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[يَقُولُ الإِنسَـنُ يَوْمَئِذٍ أَيْنَ الْمَفَرُّ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(On that Day man will say:&#8221;Where (is the refuge) to flee&#8221;) meaning, the human will see these horrors on the Day of Judgement and he will want to flee. He will say, &#8220;Where (is the place) to flee to&#8221; This means, where is the escape or refuge Allah then says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[كَلاَّ لاَ وَزَرَ &#8211; إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمُسْتَقَرُّ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(No! There is no refuge! Unto your Lord will be the place of rest that Day.) Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Sa`id bin Jubayr and several others of the Salaf said, &#8220;There will be no salvation.&#8221; This Ayah is similar to Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[مَا لَكُمْ مِّن مَّلْجَأٍ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّكِيرٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(You will have no refuge on that Day nor there will be for you any denying.) (42:47) meaning, `there will be no place for you to hide.&#8217; This is like what Allah says here,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ وَزَرَ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(There is no refuge.) meaning, `there will be no place for you to seek shelter.&#8217; Thus, Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمُسْتَقَرُّ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Unto your Lord will be the place of rest that Day.) meaning, the place of return and the final destination. The Deeds of Man will be placed before Him on the Day of Judgement Then Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[يُنَبَّأُ الإِنسَـنُ يَوْمَئِذِ بِمَا قَدَّمَ وَأَخَّرَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(On that Day man will be informed of what he sent forward, and what he left behind.) meaning, he will be informed of all of his deeds, the old of them and the recent of them, the first of them and the last of them, the small of them and the large of them. This is as Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَوَجَدُواْ مَا عَمِلُواْ حَاضِرًا وَلاَ يَظْلِمُ رَبُّكَ أَحَدًا]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And they will find all that they did, placed before them, and your Lord treats no one with injustice.) (18:49) Likewise, Allah says here,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[بَلِ الإِنسَـنُ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ بَصِيرَةٌ &#8211; وَلَوْ أَلْقَى مَعَاذِيرَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay! Man will be well informed about himself, though he may put forth his excuses.) meaning, he will be a witness against himself, knowing full well what he did, even though he will try to make excuses and deny it. This is as Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[اقْرَأْ كَتَـبَكَ كَفَى بِنَفْسِكَ الْيَوْمَ عَلَيْكَ حَسِيبًا ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((It will be said to him): &#8220;Read your book. You are sufficient as a reckoner against yourself this Day.&#8221;) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[بَلِ الإِنسَـنُ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ بَصِيرَةٌ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay! Man will be well informed about himself.) &#8220;His hearing, his sight, his two hands, his two legs and his limbs.&#8221; Qatadah said, &#8220;This means he is a witness against himself.&#8221; In another narration from Qatadah he said, &#8220;By Allah! If you wish to see him, you would see him as someone who sees the shortcomings of the people and their sins, yet he is heedless of his own sins.&#8221; It used to be said, &#8220;Verily, it is written in the Injil: `O Son of Adam, do you see the small splinters in the eye of your brother and disregard the tree stump that is in your eye, so you do not see it&#8221;&#8217; Mujahid said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلَوْ أَلْقَى مَعَاذِيرَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Though he may put forth his excuses.) &#8220;This means, even though he argues in defense of it, he is a witness against it.&#8221; Qatadah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلَوْ أَلْقَى مَعَاذِيرَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Though he may put forth his excuses.) &#8220;Even though he will try to make false excuses on that Day, they will not be accepted from him.&#8221; As-Suddi said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلَوْ أَلْقَى مَعَاذِيرَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Though he may put forth his excuses.) &#8220;This means his argument.&#8221; This is as Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ثُمَّ لَمْ تَكُنْ فِتْنَتُهُمْ إِلاَّ أَن قَالُواْ وَاللَّهِ رَبِّنَا مَا كُنَّا مُشْرِكِينَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(There will then be no Fitnah for them but to say: &#8220;By Allah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allah.&#8221;) (6:23) Allah also says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[يَوْمَ يَبْعَثُهُمُ اللَّهِ جَمِيعاً فَيَحْلِفُونَ لَهُ كَمَا يَحْلِفُونَ لَكُمْ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُمْ عَلَى شَىْءٍ أَلاَ إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ الْكَـذِبُونَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(On the Day when Allah will resurrect them all together; then they will swear to Him as they swear to you (O Muslims). And they think that they have something. Verily, they are liars!) (58:18) Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلَوْ أَلْقَى مَعَاذِيرَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Though he may put forth his excuses.) &#8220;This is apologizing. Haven&#8217;t you heard that Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ يَنفَعُ الظَّـلِمِينَ مَعْذِرَتُهُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Day when their excuses will be of no profit to wrongdoers.) (40:52) and He says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأَلْقَوْاْ إِلَى اللَّهِ يَوْمَئِذٍ السَّلَمَ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And they will offer submision to Allah on that Day.) (16:87) and He says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَأَلْقَوُاْ السَّلَمَ مَا كُنَّا نَعْمَلُ مِن سُوءٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then they will (falsely) submit: &#8220;We used not to do any evil.&#8221;) (16:28) and their statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَاللَّهِ رَبِّنَا مَا كُنَّا مُشْرِكِينَ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(By Allah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allah.) (6:23)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ تُحَرِّكْ بِهِ لِسَانَكَ لِتَعْجَلَ بِهِ &#8211; إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا جَمْعَهُ وَقُرْءَانَهُ &#8211; فَإِذَا قَرَأْنَـهُ فَاتَّبِعْ قُرْءَانَهُ &#8211; ثُمَّ إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا بَيَانَهُ &#8211; كَلاَّ بَلْ تُحِبُّونَ الْعَاجِلَةَ &#8211; وَتَذَرُونَ الاٌّخِرَةَ &#8211; وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ نَّاضِرَةٌ &#8211; إِلَى رَبِّهَا نَاظِرَةٌ &#8211; وَوُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ بَاسِرَةٌ &#8211; تَظُنُّ أَن يُفْعَلَ بِهَا فَاقِرَةٌ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(16. Move not your tongue concerning to make haste therewith.) (17. It is for Us to collect it and that it be recited.) (18. And when We have recited it to you, then follow its recitation.) (19. Then it is for Us to make it clear.) (20. But no! Rather you love the present life of this world,) (21. And neglect the Hereafter.) (22. Some faces that Day shall be Nadirah.) (23. Looking at their Lord.) (24. And some faces that Day will be Basirah,) (25. Thinking that some calamity is about to fall on them.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>How the Prophet received the Revelation</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is Allah teaching His Messenger how to receive the revelation from the angel. For verily, he (the Prophet ) was rushing in his attempts to grasp the revelation and he would be reciting the revelation with the angel while he was reciting it. Therefore, Allah commanded him that when the angel brings some revelation to him he should just listen. Allah would make sure to collect it in his chest, and He would make it easy for him to recite it in the same way that it was revealed to him. Allah would explain it, interpret it and clarify it for him. So the first phase was gathering it in his chest, the second phase was recitation and the third phase was its explanation and clarification of its meaning. Thus, Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ تُحَرِّكْ بِهِ لِسَانَكَ لِتَعْجَلَ بِهِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Move not your tongue concerning to make haste therewith.) meaning, with the Qur&#8217;an. This is as Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلاَ تَعْجَلْ بِالْقُرْءانِ مِن قَبْلِ إَن يُقْضَى إِلَيْكَ وَحْيُهُ وَقُل رَّبِّ زِدْنِى عِلْماً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And be not in haste with the Qur&#8217;an before its revelation is completed to you, and say: &#8220;My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.&#8221;) (20:114) Then Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا جَمْعَهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(It is for Us to collect it) meaning, `in your chest.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَقُرْءَانَهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and that it be recited.) meaning, `that you recite it.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَإِذَا قَرَأْنَـهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And when We have recited it to you,) meaning, `when the angel has recited it to you from Allah,&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَاتَّبِعْ قُرْءَانَهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(then follow its recitation.) meaning, `listen to it then recite it as he taught you to recite it.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ثُمَّ إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا بَيَانَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then it is for Us to make it clear.) meaning, `after memorizing it and reciting it, We will explain it to you, clarify it and inspire you with its meaning according to what We intended and legislated.&#8217; Imam Ahmad recorded from Ibn `Abbas that he said that the Messenger of Allah used to struggle very hard to grasp the revelation and he used to move his lips (rapidly with the recitation). The narrator, Sa`id, then said, &#8220;Ibn `Abbas said to me, `I will move my lips like the Messenger of Allah used to move his lips (in order to show you).&#8221;&#8217; Then, the subnarrator said, &#8220;And Sa`id said to me, `I will move my lips like I saw Ibn `Abbas moving his lips (in order to show you).&#8221;&#8217; Then Allah revealed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ تُحَرِّكْ بِهِ لِسَانَكَ لِتَعْجَلَ بِهِ &#8211; إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا جَمْعَهُ وَقُرْءَانَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Move not your tongue concerning to make haste therewith. It is for Us to collect it and that it be recited.) Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;This means He will collect it in his chest to recite it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَإِذَا قَرَأْنَـهُ فَاتَّبِعْ قُرْءَانَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And when We have recited it to you, then follow its recitation.) meaning, listen to it and pay attention.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ثُمَّ إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا بَيَانَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then it is for Us to make it clear (to you).) So after this, when Jibril would leave, he would recite it as Jibril had taught him to recite it.&#8221; This has also been recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. Al-Bukhari&#8217;s wording says, &#8220;So whenever Jibril would come to him he would be silent, and when Jibril had left he would recite it just as Allah, the Mighty and Sublime had promised him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Cause of rejecting the Day of Judgement is Love of the World and Heedlessness of the Hereafter</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[كَلاَّ بَلْ تُحِبُّونَ الْعَاجِلَةَ &#8211; وَتَذَرُونَ الاٌّخِرَةَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(But no! Rather you love the present life of this world. And neglect the Hereafter.) meaning, the only thing that has caused them to reject the Day of Judgement and oppose the true revelation and the Mighty Qur&#8217;an Allah revealed to His Messenger is that their only concern is the present worldly life. They are preoccupied and distracted from the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Seeing Allah in the Hereafter</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ نَّاضِرَةٌ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Some faces that Day shall be Nadirah.) which comes from the word Nadarah, which means splendid, radiant, glowing, delighted with goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِلَى رَبِّهَا نَاظِرَةٌ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Looking at their Lord.) meaning, they will see Him with their very eyes. This is just as was recorded by Al-Bukhari in his Sahih,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«إِنَّكُمْ سَتَرَوْنَ رَبَّكُمْ عِيَانًا»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, you all will see your Lord with your own eyes.) The believers seeing Allah in the abode of the Hereafter has been confirmed in the authentic Hadiths from numerous routes of transmission with the scholars of Hadith. It is not possible to deny this or refuse it. Examples would be the Hadiths of Abu Sa`id and Abu Hurayrah, and they are both recorded in the Two Sahihs. They both mentioned that some people said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Will we see our Lord on the Day of Judgement&#8221; The Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«هَلْ تُضَارُّونَ فِي رُؤْيَةِ الشَّمْسِ وَالْقَمَرِ لَيْسَ دُونَهُمَا سَحَابٌ؟»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Are you harmed by seeing the sun and the moon when there are no clouds beneath them) They replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«فَإِنَّكُمْ تَرَوْنَ رَبَّكُمْ كَذَلِك»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then you will surely see your Lord like that.) In the Two Sahihs it is recorded from Jabir that he said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah looked at the moon on a night when it was full, and he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«إِنَّكُمْ تَرَوْنَ رَبَّكُمْ كَمَا تَرَوْنَ هَذَا الْقَمَرَ، فَإِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ أَنْ لَا تُغْلَبُوا عَلَى صَلَاةٍ قَبْلَ طُلُوعِ الشَّمْسِ وَلَا قَبْلَ غُرُوبِهَا، فَافْعَلُوا»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, you will see your Lord just as you see this moon! So if you are able to avoid missing a prayer before the rising of the sun (Fajr prayer) or before its setting (`Asr prayer) then do so.)&#8221; Among the Hadiths, which Muslim was alone in recording, is a narration from Suhayb that the Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«إِذَا دَخَلَ أَهْلُ الْجَنَّةِ الْجَنَّةَ قَالَ يَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالى: تُرِيدُونَ شَيْئًا أَزِيدُكُمْ؟ فَيَقُولُونَ: أَلَمْ تُبَيِّضْ وُجُوهَنَا؟ أَلَمْ تُدْخِلْنَا الْجَنَّةَ وَتُنَجِّنَا مِنَ النَّارِ؟ قَالَ: فَيَكْشِفُ الْحِجَابَ، فَمَا أُعْطُوا شَيْئًا أَحَبَّ إِلَيْهِمْ مِنَ النَّظَرِ إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ، وَهِيَ الزِّيَادَة»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When the people of Paradise enter the Paradise, Allah will say, `Do you want me to give you anything extra&#8217; They will say, `Haven&#8217;t you whitened our faces Haven&#8217;t you entered us into Paradise and saved us from the Fire&#8217; Then He will remove the veil and they will not be given anything more beloved to them than looking at their Lord, and that will be the extra (Ziyadah).) Then he recited this Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ الْحُسْنَى وَزِيَادَةٌ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(For those who have done good is the best and extra (Ziyadah).) (10:26) Also among the Hadiths, which Muslim was alone in recording, is the Hadith of Jabir in which the Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«إِنَّ اللهَ يَتَجَلَّى لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ يَضْحَك»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, Allah will appear before the believers while He is laughing.) This will take place on the open plains of the Resurrection place. In some of these Hadiths, it mentions that the believers will be looking at their Lord on the open plains and some mention that this will occur in the Gardens of Paradise. If it were not due to fear of taking up a lot of space, we would present all of these Hadiths with their routes of transmission and wordings from those that are in the Sahih collections, the collections of good narrations, the Musnad collections and the Sunan collections. However, we have mentioned this in separate places in this Tafsir, and Allah is the Giver of success. This issue is something that the Companions, the Successors and the Salaf of this nation have agreed upon, and all praise is due to Allah. It is something that is agreed upon between the Imams of Islam and the guides of all mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Blackening of the Faces of the Disobedient People on the Day of Judgement</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَوُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ بَاسِرَةٌ &#8211; تَظُنُّ أَن يُفْعَلَ بِهَا فَاقِرَةٌ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And some faces that Day will be Basirah. Thinking that some calamity is about to fall on them.) These are the faces of the sinners that will be Basirah on the Day of Judgement. Qatadah said, &#8220;This means gloomy.&#8221; As-Suddi said, &#8220;Their (the faces) color will change.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[تَظُنُّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Thinking) meaning, they will be certain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَن يُفْعَلَ بِهَا فَاقِرَةٌ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(that some calamity is about to fall on them.) Mujahid said, &#8220;A disaster.&#8221; Qatadah said, &#8220;An evil.&#8221; As-Suddi said, &#8220;They will be certain that they are going to be destroyed.&#8221; Ibn Zayd said, &#8220;They will think that they are going to enter into the Hellfire.&#8221; This situation is similar to Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[يَوْمَ تَبْيَضُّ وُجُوهٌ وَتَسْوَدُّ وُجُوهٌ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(On the Day when some faces will become white and some faces will become black.) (3:106) Similarly Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ مُّسْفِرَةٌ &#8211; ضَـحِكَةٌ مُّسْتَبْشِرَةٌ &#8211; وَوُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ عَلَيْهَا غَبَرَةٌ &#8211; تَرْهَقُهَا قَتَرَةٌ &#8211; أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْكَفَرَةُ الْفَجَرَةُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Some faces that Day will be bright. Laughing, rejoicing at the good news. And other faces, that Day will be dust-stained; darkness will cover them, such will be the disbelieving, wicked.) (80:38-42) Allah also says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ خَـشِعَةٌ &#8211; عَامِلَةٌ نَّاصِبَةٌ &#8211; تَصْلَى نَاراً حَامِيَةً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Some faces, that Day will be humiliated. Laboring, weary. They will enter in the hot blazing Fire.) (88:2-4) until Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ نَّاعِمَةٌ &#8211; لِّسَعْيِهَا رَاضِيَةٌ فِى جَنَّةٍ عَالِيَةٍ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((Other) faces that Day will be joyful. Happy with their endeavor. In a lofty Paradise.) (88:8-10) And there are other similar Ayat and discussions (in the Qur&#8217;an).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[كَلاَّ إِذَا بَلَغَتِ التَّرَاقِىَ &#8211; وَقِيلَ مَنْ رَاقٍ &#8211; وَظَنَّ أَنَّهُ الْفِرَاقُ &#8211; وَالْتَفَّتِ السَّاقُ بِالسَّاقِ &#8211; إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمَسَاقُ &#8211; فَلاَ صَدَّقَ وَلاَ صَلَّى &#8211; وَلَـكِن كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّى &#8211; ثُمَّ ذَهَبَ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ يَتَمَطَّى &#8211; أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى &#8211; ثُمَّ أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى &#8211; أَيَحْسَبُ الإِنسَـنُ أَن يُتْرَكَ سُدًى &#8211; أَلَمْ يَكُ نُطْفَةً مِّن مَّنِىٍّ يُمْنَى &#8211; ثُمَّ كَانَ عَلَقَةً فَخَلَقَ فَسَوَّى &#8211; فَجَعَلَ مِنْهُ الزَّوْجَيْنِ الذَّكَرَ وَالاٍّنثَى &#8211; أَلَيْسَ ذَلِكَ بِقَـدِرٍ عَلَى أَن يُحْيِىَ الْمَوْتَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(26. Nay, when it reaches to the collarbones.) (27. And it will be said: &#8220;Who can cure him&#8221;) (28. And he will think that it was the parting;) (29. And one shank will be joined with another shank.) (30. The drive will be on that Day to your Lord!) (31. So, he neither believed nor prayed!) (32. But on the contrary, he denied and turned away!) (33. Then he walked in conceit to his family admiring himself!) (34. Woe to you! And then woe to you!) (35. Again, woe to you! And then woe to you!) (36. Does man think that he will be left neglected) (37. Was he not a Nutfah of semen emitted) (38. Then he became an `Alaqah; then shaped and fashioned in due proportion.) (39. And made of him two sexes, male and female.) (40. Is it not so then, that He would be able to give life to the dead)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Certainty will occur at the Time of Death Allah informs of the condition at the time of death and what terrors it contains.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah make us firm at that time with the Firm Statement. Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[كَلاَّ إِذَا بَلَغَتِ التَّرَاقِىَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay, when it reaches to the collarbones.) If we make the word &#8220;Kalla&#8221; negative, then this Ayah means, `O son of Adam! You are not able to deny that which I informed you of at that time (death). This will become something witnessed by you with your own eyes.&#8217; If we consider the word &#8220;Kalla&#8221; to be a word of affirmation, then this would be the most obvious meaning. In this case it would mean that it is certainly true when the soul reaches the collarbones &#8211; meaning, `your soul will be pulled out of your body and it will reach your collarbones.&#8217; This is similar to Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَلَوْلاَ إِذَا بَلَغَتِ الْحُلْقُومَ &#8211; وَأَنتُمْ حِينَئِذٍ تَنظُرُونَ &#8211; وَنَحْنُ أَقْرَبُ إِلَيْهِ مِنكُمْ وَلَـكِن لاَّ تُبْصِرُونَ &#8211; فَلَوْلاَ إِن كُنتُمْ غَيْرَ مَدِينِينَ &#8211; تَرْجِعُونَهَآ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then why do you not (intervene) when (the soul of the dying person) reaches the throat And you at the moment are looking on, but We are nearer to him than you, but you see not, then why do you not if you are exempt from the reckoning and recompense, bring back the soul, if your are truthful) (56:83-87) Thus, Allah similarly says here,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[كَلاَّ إِذَا بَلَغَتِ التَّرَاقِىَ &#8211; وَقِيلَ مَنْ رَاقٍ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay, when it reaches to the collarbones. And it will be said: &#8220;Who can cure him) `Ikrimah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, &#8220;Meaning, who is the person who recites divine prayers of healing so that he may come and cure him&#8221; Abu Qilabah made a similar statement when he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَقِيلَ مَنْ رَاقٍ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And it will be said: &#8220;Who can cure him) &#8220;This means who is the doctor that can cure him&#8221; Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and Ibn Zayd all have similar statements. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said concerning the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَالْتَفَّتِ السَّاقُ بِالسَّاقِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And one shank will be joined with another shank.) &#8220;This is the last day of the days of this world and the first day of the days of the Hereafter. So there will be hardships that will meet (more) hardships, except for he whom Allah has mercy upon.&#8221; `Ikrimah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَالْتَفَّتِ السَّاقُ بِالسَّاقِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And one shank will be joined with another shank.) &#8220;The great matter (will be joined) with the great matter.&#8221; Mujahid said, &#8220;A test (will be joined) with a test.&#8221; Al-Hasan Al-Basri said concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَالْتَفَّتِ السَّاقُ بِالسَّاقِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And one shank will be joined with another shank. ) &#8220;These are your two shins when they are bound together.&#8221; In another narration from him (Al-Hasan) he said, &#8220;His two legs have died and they will not carry him while he used to walk around on them.&#8221; Concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمَسَاقُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The drive will be on that Day to your Lord!) meaning, the place of return and the destination. This is that the soul ascends into the heavens and Allah says, &#8220;Return my servant to the earth, for verily, I have created them from it, I return them into it, and from it I will bring them out at another time.&#8221; This has been reported in the lengthy Hadith of Al-Bara&#8217;. Verily, Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَهُوَ الْقَاهِرُ فَوْقَ عِبَادِهِ وَيُرْسِلُ عَلَيْكُم حَفَظَةً حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَ أَحَدَكُمُ الْمَوْتُ تَوَفَّتْهُ رُسُلُنَا وَهُمْ لاَ يُفَرِّطُونَ &#8211; ثُمَّ رُدُّواْ إِلَى اللَّهِ مَوْلَـهُمُ الْحَقِّ أَلاَ لَهُ الْحُكْمُ وَهُوَ أَسْرَعُ الْحَـسِبِينَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He is the Irresistible (Supreme), over His servants, and He sends guardians over you, until when death approaches one of you, Our messengers take his soul, and they never neglect their duty. Then they are returned to Allah, their True Master. Surely, for Him is the judgement and He is the swiftest in taking account.) (6:61,62)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Mentioning the Case of the Denier</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَلاَ صَدَّقَ وَلاَ صَلَّى &#8211; وَلَـكِن كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So, he neither believed nor prayed! But on the contrary, he denied and turned away!) This is to inform about the disbeliever who used to deny the truth in his heart in the abode of this worldly life, and he used to turn away from acting according to its way. Thus, there is no good in him, internally or externally. Therefore, Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَلاَ صَدَّقَ وَلاَ صَلَّى &#8211; وَلَـكِن كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّى &#8211; ثُمَّ ذَهَبَ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ يَتَمَطَّى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So he neither believed nor prayed! But on the contrary, he denied and turned away! Then he walked in conceit (full pride) to his family admiring himself!)(75:31-33) meaning, stubborn, cruel, obstinate, wanton, lazy, having no concern and doing no deeds. This is similar to Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَإِذَا انقَلَبُواْ إِلَى أَهْلِهِمْ انقَلَبُواْ فَكِهِينَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And when they returned to their own people, they would return jesting.) (83:31) Allah also says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِنَّهُ كَانَ فِى أَهْلِهِ مَسْرُوراً &#8211; إِنَّهُ ظَنَّ أَن لَّن يَحُورَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, he was among his people in joy! Verily, he thought that he would never come back (to Us)!) (84:13,14) meaning, return.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[بَلَى إِنَّ رَبَّهُ كَانَ بِهِ بَصِيراً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Yes! Verily, his Lord has been ever beholding him!) (84:15) Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ثُمَّ ذَهَبَ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ يَتَمَطَّى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then he walked in conceit to his family admiring himself!) &#8220;This means arrogantly.&#8221; Qatadah and Zayd bin Aslam both said, &#8220;Strutting.&#8221; Allah then says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى &#8211; ثُمَّ أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Woe to you! And then woe to you! Again, woe to you! And then woe to you!) This is a definite warning and threat from Allah to those who disbelieve in Him and strut about when walking. This means, `you deserve to strut like this while you have disbelieved in your Creator and Maker.&#8217; This is what is commonly said in this type of situation in order to mock and intimidate (someone). This is as Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ذُقْ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْعَزِيزُ الْكَرِيمُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Taste you (this)! Verily you were (pretending to be) the mighty, the generous!) (44:49) Similarly, Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[كُلُواْ وَتَمَتَّعُواْ قَلِيلاً إِنَّكُمْ مُّجْرِمُونَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Eat and enjoy yourselves for a little. Verily, you are criminals.) (77:46) Allah also says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَاعْبُدُواْ مَا شِئْتُمْ مِّن دُونِهِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So worship what you like besides Him.) (39:15) And like Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[اعْمَلُواْ مَا شِئْتُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Do what you will.) (41:40) There are other examples of this as well. Abu `Abdur-Rahman An-Nasa&#8217;i recorded from Sa`id bin Jubayr that he said, &#8220;I mentioned to Ibn `Abbas,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى &#8211; ثُمَّ أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Woe to you! And then woe to you! Again, woe to you! And then woe to you!) He (Ibn `Abbas) replied, `The Messenger of Allah said this to Abu Jahl, then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed this Ayah.&#8221;&#8217; Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from Qatadah that he said concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى &#8211; ثُمَّ أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Woe to you! And then woe to you! Again, woe to you! And then woe to you!) &#8220;It is a threat followed by a threat, just as you hear it. They claim that the Prophet of Allah grabbed the clothes of the enemy of Allah, Abu Jahl. The Prophet then said to him, `Woe to you! And then (again) woe to you! Again woe to you! And then (again) woe to you!&#8217; At this the enemy of Allah, Abu Jahl, said, `Are you threatening me, O Muhammad By Allah! Neither you nor your Lord are able to do anything, and verily, I am the mightiest person walking between its (Makkah&#8217;s) two mountains.&#8221;&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Man will not be left neglected</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَيَحْسَبُ الإِنسَـنُ أَن يُتْرَكَ سُدًى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Does man think that he will be left neglected) As-Suddi said, &#8220;Meaning not resurrected.&#8221; Mujahid, Ash-Shafi`i and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, all said, &#8220;Meaning, he will not be commanded and prohibited.&#8221; Apparently the Ayah includes both meanings. This means that he will not be left neglected in this worldly life, without being commanded and prohibited. He also will not be left neglected in his grave unattended to without being resurrected. Rather he will be commanded and prohibited in this life, and gathered back to Allah in the abode of the Hereafter. The intent here is to affirm the existence of the abode of the final return and to refute whoever rejects it from the people of deviance, ignorance and stubbornness. Thus, Allah uses the beginning of creation as a proof for the repetition of the creation in His saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَلَمْ يَكُ نُطْفَةً مِّن مَّنِىٍّ يُمْنَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Was he not a Nutfah of semen emitted) meaning, was not man a weak drop of sperm from a despised fluid known as semen, that is emitted from the loins into the wombs</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ثُمَّ كَانَ عَلَقَةً فَخَلَقَ فَسَوَّى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then he became an `Alaqah; then shaped and fashioned in due proportion.) meaning, he became a clot, then a lump of flesh, then he was formed and the soul was blown into him. Then he became a perfect creation with healthy limbs, as either a male or a female by the permission and decree of Allah. Thus, Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَجَعَلَ مِنْهُ الزَّوْجَيْنِ الذَّكَرَ وَالاٍّنثَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And made of him two sexes, male and female.) Then Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَلَيْسَ ذَلِكَ بِقَـدِرٍ عَلَى أَن يُحْيِىَ الْمَوْتَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Is it not so then, that He would be able to give life to the dead) meaning, is not He Who made this perfect creation from this weak drop of sperm able to repeat that as He did originally And &#8220;the ability to repeat that&#8221; either refers to the origination only, or to both that and the process of perfecting it, according to two different views, as in Allah&#8217;s saying;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَهُوَ الَّذِى يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ وَهُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it; this is easier for Him.) (30:27) The first view is more popular, and Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Supplication upon completing this Surah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dawud recorded from Musa bin Abi `A&#8217;ishah that he said, &#8220;A man used to pray on top of his house and whenever he recited,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَلَيْسَ ذَلِكَ بِقَـدِرٍ عَلَى أَن يُحْيِىَ الْمَوْتَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Is it not so then, that He would be able to give life to the dead) he would say, `Glory to You, of course.&#8217; So the people asked him about that and he said, `I heard it from the Messenger of Allah .&#8221;&#8217; Abu Dawud was alone in transmitting this Hadith and he did not mention who this Companion was, but there is no harm in that. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Qiyamah, all praise and thanks are due to Allah.</p>

<td>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Last two Ayah of Surat ul Baqarah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (Muhammad ) believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allâh, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. They say, &#8220;We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers&#8221; &#8211; and they say, &#8220;We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your Forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all).&#8221; (Al-Baqarah 2:285)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has earned. &#8220;Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error, our Lord! Lay not on us a burden like that which You did lay on those before us (Jews and Christians); our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear. Pardon us and grant us Forgiveness. Have mercy on us. You are our Maulâ (Patron, Suppor-ter and Protector, etc.) and give us victory over the disbelieving people.&#8221; (Al-Baqarah 2:286)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Virtue of These Ayah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn &#8216;Abbas &#8221; who said:<br />
&#8220;While Jibra&#8217;eel (Gibrael) &#8221; `May Peace be upon him&#8217; was sitting with the Prophet !, he heard the opening of a gate above him. So he raised his head and said: `This is a gate from the shies that has opened today, which has never opened before this day.&#8217; So an angel descended from it (the gate). So he Jibra&#8217;eel &#8221; said: &#8220;This is an angel that has descended to the earth, which has never descended except today. He gave Salam and said: &#8216;Receive glad tidings [Oh Muhammad ! with two lights which have been given to you, that have never been given to a Prophet before you: The Opening of the Book (i.e. Surat Al- Fatihah) and the end of Surat Al-Baqarah. Never do you read a letter from either of the two (Surahs) except that you are given it.( Which means that you are given its reward (i.e. the reward of recitation)) (Reported by Muslim) (Taken from Mukhtasar Sahih Muslim with Shaykh AI-Albani&#8217;s editing, p.553, Hadith no. 2094.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tafsir Ibn Kathir</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Each one believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. (They say,) &#8220;We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, each of the believers believes that Allah is the One and Only and the Sustainer, there is no deity worthy of worship except Him and there is no Lord except Him. The believers also believe in all Allah&#8217;s Prophets and Messengers, in the Books that were revealed from heaven to the Messengers and Prophets, who are indeed the servants of Allah. Further, the believers do not differentiate between any of the Prophets, such as, believing in some of them and rejecting others. Rather, all of Allah&#8217;s Prophets and Messengers are, to the believers, truthful, righteous, and they were each guided to the path of righteousness, even when some of them bring what abrogates the Law of some others by Allah&#8217;s leave. Later on, the Law of Muhammad, the Final Prophet and Messenger from Allah, abrogated all the laws of the Prophets before him. So the Last Hour will commence while Muhammad&#8217;s Law remains the only valid Law, and all the while a group of his Ummah will always be on the path of truth, apparent and dominant. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And they say, &#8220;We hear, and we obey&#8221;) means, we heard Your statement, O our Lord, comprehended and implemented it, and adhered to its implications.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((We seek) Your forgiveness, our Lord) contains a plea and supplication for Allah&#8217;s forgiveness, mercy and kindness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope) means, Allah does not ask a soul what is beyond its ability. This only demonstrates Allah&#8217;s kindness, compassion and generosity towards His creation. This Ayah is the Ayah that abrogated the Ayah that worried the Companions, that is, Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whether you disclose what is in yourselves or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that although Allah will question His servants and judge them, He will only punish for what one is able to protect himself from. As for what one cannot protect himself from, such as what one says to himself &#8211; or passing thoughts &#8211; they will not be punished for that. We should state here that to dislike the evil thoughts that cross one&#8217;s mind is a part of faith. Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He gets reward for that which he has earned) of good,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And he is punished for that which he has earned) of evil, that is, concerning the acts that one is responsible for.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then said, [mentioning what the believers said] while directing His servants to supplicate to Him, all the while promising them that He will answer their supplication:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;Our Lord! Push us not if we forget or fall into error,&#8221;) meaning, &#8220;If we forgot an obligation or fell into a prohibition, or made an error while ignorant of its ruling.&#8221; We mentioned the Hadith by Abu Hurayrah, that Muslim collected, wherein Allah said, &#8220;I shall (accept your supplication).&#8221; There is also the Hadith by Ibn `Abbas that Allah said, &#8220;I did (accept your supplication).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Our Lord! Lay not on us a burden like that which You did lay on those before us (Jews and Christians),) means, &#8220;Even if we were able to perform them, do not require us to perform the difficult deeds as You required the previous nations before us, such as the burdens that were placed on them. You sent Your Prophet Muhammad , the Prophet of mercy, to abrogate these burdens through the Law that You revealed to him, the Hanifi (Islamic Monotheism), easy religion.&#8221; Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said that Allah said, &#8220;I shall (accept your supplication).&#8221; Ibn `Abbas narrated that the Messenger of Allah said that Allah said, &#8220;I did (accept your supplication).&#8221; There is the Hadith recorded through various chains of narration that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I was sent with the easy Hanifiyyah way.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear) </strong>of obligations, hardships and afflictions, do not make us bear what we cannot bear of this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We mentioned that Allah said, &#8220;I shall (accept your supplication)&#8221; in one narration, and, &#8220;I did (accept your supplication),&#8221; in another narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Pardon us) meaning, between us and You regarding what You know of our shortcomings and errors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And grant us forgiveness) concerning what is between us and Your servants. So do not expose our errors and evil deeds to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Have mercy on us) in what will come thereafter. Therefore, do not allow us to fall into another error. They say that those who commit error need three things: Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for what is between Him and them, that He conceals these errors from His other servants, and thus does not expose them before the servants, and that He grants them immunity from further error.&#8221; We mentioned before that Allah answered these pleas, &#8220;I shall,&#8221; in one narration and, &#8220;I did,&#8221; in another narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(You are our Mawla) meaning, You are our supporter and helper, our trust is in You, You are sought for each and every type of help and our total reliance is on You. There is no power or strength except from You.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And give us victory over the disbelieving people) those who rejected Your religion, denied Your Oneness, refused the Message of Your Prophet , worshipped other than You and associated others in Your worship. Give us victory and make us prevail above them in this and the Hereafter. Allah said, &#8220;I shall,&#8221; in one narration, and, &#8220;I did,&#8221; in the Hadith that Muslim collected from Ibn `Abbas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further, Ibn Jarir recorded that Abu Ishaq said that whenever Mu`adh would finish reciting this Surah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And give us victory over the disbelieving people), he would say &#8220;Amin.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ar-Raheeq al-Makhtoom</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Start of the Disease</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On Monday the twenty-ninth of Safar in the eleventh year of al-Hijra, he participated in funeral rites in al-Baqee&#8217;. On the way back he had a headache, his temperature rose so high that the heat effect could be felt over his headband. He led the Muslims in prayer for eleven days though he was sick. The total number of his sick days were either thirteen of fourteen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Last Week</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When his sickness grew severe he asked his wives: &#8220;Where shall I stay tomorrow?&#8221; &#8220;Where shall I stay?&#8221; They understood what he wanted. So they allowed him to stay wherever he wished. He moved to &#8216;Aishah&#8217;s room leaning &#8211; while he was walking &#8211; on al-Fadl bin al-&#8216;Abbas and &#8216;Alî bin Abî Tâlib. Head banded as he was, he dragged his feet till he came into her abode. It was there that he spent the last week of his life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During that period, &#8216;Aishah used to recite al-Mu&#8217;awwidhat (Chapters 113 and 114 of the Qur&#8217;ân) and other supplications which he has already taught her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Five days before death</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On Wednesday, five days before he died the Prophet&#8217;s temperature rose so high signalling the severness of his disease. He fainted and suffered from pain. &#8220;Pour out on me seven Qirab (water skin pots) of various water wells so that I may go out to meet people and talk to them.&#8221; So they seated him in a container (usually used for washing) and poured out water on him till he said: &#8220;That is enough. That is enough.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he felt well enough to enter the Mosque. He entered it band-headed, sat on the pulpit and made a speech to the people who were gathering together around him. He said: <em> &#8220;The curse of Allâh falls upon the Jews and Christians for they have made their Prophets’ tombs places of worship.&#8221;</em> [Sahîh al-Bukhârî, 1/62; Muatta&#8217; Imâm Malik, p.360] Then he said: &#8220;Do not make my tomb a worshipped idol.&#8221; [Muatta&#8217; Imâm Malik, p.65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he offered himself and invited the people to repay any injuries he might have inflicted on them, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;He whom I have ever lashed his back, I offer him my back so that he may avenge himself on me. He whom I have ever blasphemed his honour, here I am offering my honour so that he may avenge himself.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he descended, and performed the noon prayer. Again he returned to the pulpit and sat on it. He resumed his first speech about enmity and some other things. A man then said: &#8220;You owe me three Dirhams.&#8221; The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said: &#8220;Fadl, pay him the money.&#8221; He went on saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em> &#8220;I admonish you to be good to Al-Ansar (the Helpers). They are my family and with them I found shelter. They have acquitted themselves credibly of the responsibility that fell upon them and now there remains what you have to do. You should fully acknowledge and appreciate the favour that they have shown, and should overlook their faults.&#8221; </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another version: <em> &#8220;The number of believers would increase, but the number of Helpers would decrease to the extent that they would be among men as salt in the food. So he who from among you occupies a position of responsibility and is powerful enough to do harm or good to the people, he should frilly acknowledge and appreciate the favour that these benefactors have shown and overlook their faults.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And said: &#8220;Allâh, the Great, has given a slave of His the opportunity to make a choice between whatever he desires of Allâh’s provisions in this world, and what He keeps for him in the world, but he has opted for the latter.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abû Sa’id Al-Khudri said: &#8220;Upon hearing that, Abû Bakr cried and said: ‘We sacrifice our fathers and mothers for your sake.’ We wondered why Abû Bakr said such a thing. People said: ‘Look at that old man! The Messenger of Allâh says about a slave of Allâh who was granted the right between the best fortunes of this world and the bounty of Allâh in the Hereafter, but he says: We sacrifice our fathers and mothers for your sake!’ It was later on that we realized what he had aimed at. The Messenger of Allâh was the slave informed to choose. We also acknowledged that Abû Bakr was the most learned among us.&#8221; [Mishkat Al-Masabih, 2/546]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Messenger of Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em> &#8220;The fellow I feel most secure in his company is Abû Bakr. If I were to make friendship with any other one than Allah, I would have Abû Bakr a bosom friend of mine. For him I feel affection and brotherhood of Islam. No gate shall be kept open in the Mosque except that of Abû Bakr’s.&#8221;</em> [Sahîh al-Bukhârî, 1/22,429,449, 2/638; Misbkat Al-Masabih, 2/548]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Four days before his death</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On Thursday, four days before the death of the Messenger of Allâh he said to people — though he was suffering from a severe pain:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Come here. I will cause you to write something so that you will never fall into error.&#8221; Upon this ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab said: &#8220;The Prophet of Allâh is suffering from acute pain and you have the Qur’an with you; the Book of Allâh is sufficient unto you.&#8221; Others however wanted the writing to be made. When Muhammad heard them debating over it, he ordered them to go away and leave him alone. [Sahîh al-Bukhârî, 2/637]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That day he recommended three things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Jews, Christians and polytheists should be expelled out of Arabia .<br />
2. He recommended that delegations should be honoured and entertained, in a way similar to the one he used to do.<br />
3. As for the third — the narrator said that he had forgotten it. It could have been adherence to the Holy Book and the Sunnah. It was likely to be the accomplishment and the mobilization of Osamah’s army, or it could have been performance of prayers and being attentive to slaves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In spite of the strain of disease and suffering from pain, the Prophet used to lead all the prayers till that Thursday — four days before he died. On that day he led the sunset prayer and recited:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;By the winds (or angels or the Messengers of Allah) sent forth one after another.&#8221;</strong> [77:1] [Misbkat Al-Masabih, 1/102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the evening he grew so sick that he could not overcome the strain of disease or go out to enter the Mosque. ‘Aishah said: The Prophet asked: &#8220;Have the people performed the prayer?&#8221; &#8220;No. They haven’t. They are waiting for you.&#8221; &#8220;Put some water in the washing pot.&#8221; Said he. We did what he ordered. So he washed and wanted to stand up, but he fainted. When he came round he asked again &#8220;Have the people prayed?&#8221; Then the sequence of events took place again and again for the second and the third times from the time he washed to the time he fainted after his attempts to stand up. Therefore he sent to Abû Bakr to lead the prayer himself. Abû Bakr then led the prayer during those days [Sahîh al-Bukhârî, 1/99]. They were seventeen prayers in the lifetime of Muhammad sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Three or four times ‘Aishah talked to the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam to exempt Abû Bakr from leadership in prayer lest people should despair of him, but he refused and said: <em> &#8220;You (women) are like the women who tried to entice Joseph (Yusuf) into immorality. Convey my request to Abû Bakr to lead the prayer.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> A Day or Two prior to Death</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On Saturday or on Sunday, the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam felt that he was well enough to perform the prayer; so he went out leaning on two men in order to perform the noon prayer. Abû Bakr, who was then about to lead the prayer withdrew when he saw him coming; but the Prophet made him a gesture to stay where he was and said: &#8220;Seat me next to him.&#8221; They seated him on the left hand side of Abû Bakr. The Prophet led the prayer, and Abû Bakr followed him and raised his voice at every &#8216;Allâhu Akbar&#8217; (i.e. Allâh is the Greatest) the Prophet said, so that the people may hear clearly. [Sahîh al-Bukhârî 1/98,99]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> A Day before his Death</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On Sunday, a day before he died, the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam set his slaves free, paid as a charity the seven Dinars he owned and gave his weapons as a present to the Muslims. So when night fell ‘Aishah had to borrow some oil from her neighbour to light her oil-lantern. Even his armour was mortgaged as a security with a Jew for thirty Sa’ (a cubic measure) of barley.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Last Day Alive</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a narration by Anas bin Malik, he said: &#8220;While the Muslims were performing the dawn prayer on Monday — led by Abû Bakr, they were surprised to see the Messenger of Allâh raising the curtain of ‘Aishah’s room. He looked at them while they were praying aligned properly and smiled cheerfully. Seeing him, Abû Bakr withdrew to join the lines and give way to him to lead the prayer. For he thought that the Prophet wanted to go out and pray.&#8221; Anas said: &#8220;The Muslims, who were praying, were so delighted that they were almost too enraptured at their prayers. The Messenger of Allâh made them a gesture to continue their prayer, went into the room and drew down the curtain.&#8221; [ibid. 21640]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allâh sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam did not live for the next prayer time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When it was daytime, the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam called Fatimah and told her something in a secret voice that made her cry. Then he whispered to her something else which made her laugh. ‘Aishah enquired from her after the Prophet’s death, as to this weeping and laughing to which Fatimah replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The first time he disclosed to me that he would not recover from his illness and I wept. Then he told me that I would be the first of his family to join him, so I laughed.&#8221; [Sahîh al-Bukhârî, 2/638]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He gave Fatimah glad tidings that she would become the lady of all women of the world [Rahmat-ul-lil’alameen, 1/282]. Fatimah witnessed the great pain that afflicted her father. So she said: &#8220;What great pain my father is in!&#8221;. To these words, the Prophet remarked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em> &#8220;He will not suffer any more when today is over.&#8221;</em> [Sahîh al-Bukhârî, 2/641]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He asked that Al-Hasan and Al-Husain be brought to him. He kissed them and recommended that they be looked after. He asked to see his wives. They were brought to him. He preached them and told them to remember Allah. Pain grew so much severe that the trace of poison he had at Khaibar came to light. It was so sore that he said to ‘Aishah: <em> &#8220;I still feel the painful effect of that food I tasted at Khaibar. I feel as if death is approaching.&#8221;</em> [ibid, 2/637] He ordered the people to perform the prayers and be attentive to slaves. He repeated it several times. [ibid. 2/637]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam breathes his last</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the pangs of death started, ‘Aishah leant him against her. She used to say: One of Allah’s bounties upon me is that the Messenger of Allâh died in my house, while I am still alive. He died between my chest and neck while he was leaning against me. Allâh has mixed his saliva with mine at his death. For ‘Abdur Rahman &#8211; the son of Abû Bakr &#8211; came in with a Siwak (i.e. the root of a desert plant used for brushing teeth) in his hand, while I was leaning the Messenger of Allâh against me. I noticed that he was looking at the Siwak, so I asked him &#8211; for I knew that he wanted it — &#8220;Would you like me to take it for you?&#8221; He nodded in agreement. I took it and gave it to him. As it was too hard for him, I asked him &#8220;Shall I soften it for you?&#8221; He nodded in agreement. So I softened it with my saliva and he passed it (on his teeth).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another version it is said: &#8220;So he brushed (Istanna) his teeth as nice as he could.&#8221; There was a water container (Rakwa) available at his hand with some water in. He put his hand in it and wiped his face with it and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em> &#8220;There is no god but Allah. Death is full of agonies.&#8221;</em> [Sahîh al-Bukhârî, 2/640]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As soon as he had finished his Siwak, brushing, he raised his hand or finger up, looked upwards to the ceiling and moved his lips. So ‘Aishah listened to him. She heard him say: &#8220;With those on whom You have bestowed Your Grace with the Prophets and the Truthful ones (As-Siddeeqeen), the martyrs and the good doers. O Allâh, forgive me and have mercy upon me and join me to the Companionship on high.&#8221; [ibid, 2/638-641] Then at intervals he uttered these words: &#8220;The most exalted Companionship on high. To Allâh we turn and to Him we turn back for help and last abode.&#8221; This event took place at high morning time on Monday, the twelfth of Rabi’ al-Awwal, in the eleventh year of Al-Hijrah. He was sixty-three years and four days old when he died.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Companions’ concern over the Prophet’s Death</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great (loss) news was soon known by everybody in Madinah. Dark grief spread on all areas and hoirizons of Madinah. Anas said: &#8220;I have never witnessed a day better or brighter than that day on which the Messenger of Allâh sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam came to us; and I have never witnessed a more awful or darker day than that one on which the Messenger of Allâh died on.&#8221; [Mishkat-ul-Masabih, 2/547]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he died, Fatimah said: &#8220;O Father, whom his Lord responded to his supplication! O Father, whose abode is Paradise . O Father, whom I announce his death to Gabriel.&#8221; [Sahîh al-Bukhârî, 2/641]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em> ‘Umar’s Attitude</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Umar, who was so stunned that he almost lost consciousness and stood before people addressing them: &#8220;Some of the hypocrites claim that the Messenger of Allâh sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam died. The Messenger of Allâh did not die, but went to his Lord in the same way as Moses bin ‘Imran did. He stayed away for forty nights, but finally came back though they said he had been dead. By Allah, the Messenger of Allâh will come back and he will cut of the hands and legs of those who claim his death.&#8221; [Ibn Hisham, 2/655]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em> Abû Bakr’s Attitude</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abû Bakr left his house at As-Sunh and came forth to the Mosque on a mare-back. At the Mosque, he dismounted and entered. He talked to nobody but went on till he entered ‘Aishah’s abode, and went directly to where the Messenger of Allâh sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam was. The Prophet was covered with a Yemeni mantle. He uncovered his face and tended down, kissed him and cried. Then he said: &#8220;I sacrifice my father and mother for your sake. Allah, verily, will not cause you to die twice. You have just experienced the death that Allâh had ordained.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he went out and found ‘Umar talking to people. He said: &#8220;‘Umar, be seated.&#8221; ‘Umar refused to do so. People parted ‘Umar and came towards Abû Bakr, who started a speech saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And now, he who worships Muhammad sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, Muhammad is dead now. But he who worships Allah, He is Ever Living and He never dies. Allâh says: <em><strong> ‘Muhammad sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam is no more than a Messenger, and indeed (many) Messengers have passed away before him. If he dies or is killed, will you then turn back on your heels (as disbelievers)? And he who turns back on his heels, not the least harm will he do to Allâh, and Allâh will give reward to those who are grateful.’</strong> &#8221; [3:144] </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Abbas said: &#8220;By Allâh it sounded as if people had never heard such a Qur’aanic verse till Abû Bakr recited it as a reminder. So people started reciting it till there was no man who did not recite it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Al-Musaiyab said that ‘Umar had said: &#8220;By Allâh as soon as I heard Abû Bakr say it, I fell down to the ground. I felt as if my legs had been unable to carry me so I collapsed when I heard him say it. Only then did I realize that Muhammad sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam had really died.&#8221; [Sahîh al-Bukhârî, 2/640,641]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Burial and Farewell Preparations to his Honourable Body</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dispute about who would succeed him broke out even before having the Messenger of Allah’s body prepared for burial. Lots of arguments, discussions, dialogues took place between the Helpers and Emigrants in the roofed passage (portico) of Barn Sa’ida. Finally they acknowledged Abû Bakr (RA) as a caliph. They spent the whole Monday there till it was night. People were so busy with their arguments that it was late night — just about dawn of Tuesday — yet his blessed body was still lying on his bed covered with an inked-garment. He was locked in the room.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On Tuesday, his body was washed with his clothes on. He was washed by Al-’Abbas, &#8216;Alî, Al-Fadl and Qathm — the two sons of Al-’Abbas, as well as Shaqran — the Messenger’s freed slave, Osamah bin Zaid and Aws bin Khauli. Al-’Abbas, Al-Fadi and Qathm turned his body round, whereas Osamah and Shaqran poured out water. &#8216;Alî washed him and Aws leant him against his chest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They shrouded him in three white Sahooli cotton cloth which had neither a headcloth [Sahîh al-Bukhârî, 1/169, Sahîh Muslim, 1/306] nor a casing and inserted him in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A sort of disagreement arose with regard to a burial place. Abû Bakr said: &#8220;I heard the Messenger of Allâh say:<em> ‘A dead Prophet is buried where he dies.’</em>&#8221; So Abû Talhah lifted the bed on which he died, dug underneath and cut the ground to make the tomb.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People entered the room ten by ten. They prayed for the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam. The first to pray for him were people of his clan. Then the Emigrants, then the Helpers. Women prayed for him after men. The young were the last to pray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This process took Tuesday long and Wednesday night (i.e. the night which precedes Wednesday morning). ‘Aishah said: &#8220;We did not know that the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam was being buried till we heard the sound of tools digging the ground at the depth of Wednesday night.&#8221; [Mukhtasar Seerat Ar-Rasool, p.471; Ibn Hisham, 2/649-665; Talqeeh Fuhoom Ahl M-Athar, p. 38, 39; Rahmat-ul-lil&#8217;alameen 1/277-286]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation of the Meanings of the Names of the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) &#8211; Taken from &#8216;Zaad al-Ma`aad&#8217; (1/88-97) of ibn al-Qayyim, rahimahullaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillaahir-Rahmaanir-Raheem</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) has been called by many names and titles in the Qur`aan and Sunnah, each one of them describing a special quality of this exalted personality. And in understanding them and reflecting upon them, we can, by the permission of Allaah, increase in our love and following of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam). This discussion is taken from &#8216;Zaad al-Ma`aad&#8217; (1/88-97) of ibn al-Qayyim, rahimahullaah, summarised.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The names of the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) are of two types:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Those names that are specific to him and none of the Messengers before him had these names, like Muhammad, Ahmad, al-Aaqib, al-Haashir, al-Muqaffee, Nabi al-Malhama.</li>
<li>Those names and qualities that are not specific to him, and were shared by the Messengers before him, but are found in him in the most complete and perfect forms. Like: Messenger of Allaah, His Prophet, His Servant, Prophet of Mercy etc.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What follows is an explanation of some of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Muhammad</strong>: is a passive participle, whosoever is praised, possessing many praiseworthy qualities then he is muhammad. And Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) is praised more than any other person, and this is why &#8211; and Allaah knows best &#8211; he was called by this name in the Torah, due to the many praiseworthy qualities which he, his religion, and his nation possess such that even Moses wished that he would be from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ahmad</strong>: Derived, as is Muhammad, from the noun hamd (praise). A group of scholars said that it is a passive participle, meaning: his praising of Allaah is more than any other person&#8217;s praise of him, and therefore he is the most deserving of being praised and the first. So in meaning Ahmad is similar to Muhammad except that the distinction is that he is Muhammad due to his possessing many praiseworthy qualities, and he is Ahmad due to his being praised in a more excellent way than the praise of any other. And this is the most complete meaning of this word, and the most extensive in commending him (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also these two names stem from his character, and the praiseworthy qualities specific to him, and it is because of these that he is called Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and Ahmad. And he is the one who is praised by the People of the Heaven, the People of the earth, the People of the world and the People of the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Mutawakkil</strong>: (The One who puts his trust in Allaah). In the Saheeh of Bukhaaree from the hadeeth of Abdullaah bin Umru who said, &#8220;I read the description of the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) in the Torah: Muhammad is Messenger of Allaah, My servant and Messenger, I have called him al-Mutawakkil. He is neither rude nor harsh and he does not shout in the markets, and he does not return an evil for an evil, rather he overlooks and forgives. And I will not make him to die until I make firm the nation through him, causing them to say: there is none worthy of worship except Allaah.&#8221; {1}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) is the most deserving of this name, because the trust he put in Allaah to establish the religion was a trust unequalled by any other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Maahee</strong>: (the destroyer/effacer). This has been explained in the hadeeth of Jubair bin Mut`am: &#8220;al-Maahee: the one through whom Allaah destroys and effaces unbelief.&#8221; {2}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Disbelief was not destroyed and removed by any single person as completely as was done by the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam). For indeed he was sent, and all of the inhabitants of the earth were in disbelief, except for some remnants of the People of the Book. Consisting of the worshippers of idols, the Jews who had the Anger of Allaah on them, the Christians who had been misguided, the atheist Saabi`een, the worshippers of the stars and the fire, and the philosophers who did not acknowledge the laws of the Prophets. And Allaah effaced them all through His Messenger until He established His religion and made it supreme over all others, and made it spread to the extent that the night and day spreads, and made his call as the rays of the sun in the various lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Haashir</strong>: (the Gatherer). He is the one who gathered and united the people at his feet, and therefore it was as if he had been sent for this purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Aaqib</strong>: (The Last). He is the one who came at the end of the line of Prophets, and there is no prophet after him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Muqaffee</strong>: (). He is the one who was sent with the characteristics of the Messengers that had preceded him, and was their seal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Nabi at-Tawba</strong>: (the Prophet of Repentance). It was by him that Allaah opened the door of repentance for the inhabitants of the earth [by them accepting his message], and Allaah forgave them with a forgiveness that was not given to the people before him. {3}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) was the one who sought forgiveness from Allaah the most, to the extent that he would say, &#8220;My Lord forgive me and turn toward me, You are The Oft-Forgiving, The Oft-Returning&#8221; {4}, 100 times in a single sitting. And he used to say, &#8220;O people repent to Allaah, your Lord, for indeed I repent to Allaah 100 times in a day&#8221;. {5}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise the repentance of his (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) nation is more complete than the repentance of all the other nations, the most quickest in being answered, and the easiest to be obtained. For the repentance of the previous nations was of the most difficult matters, to the extent that the repentance for the worshippers of the cow amongst the People of Israa`eel was to kill those worshippers. {6} But as for this nation, then from the Kindness of Allaah to it is that he has made repentance dependant upon sorrow and abstaining (from the sin in question).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Nabi al-Malhama</strong>: (The Prophet of Slaughter). He was the one who was sent with Jihaad to the enemies of Allaah, and no prophet before him did Jihaad to the extent that the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and his nation fought Jihaad. And the like of the large wars that took place between him and the disbelievers were not seen before him. For his nation fought the disbelievers in lands to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Nabi ar-Rahma</strong>: (The Prophet of Mercy). He was the one whom Allaah sent as a Mercy for the universe. And Allaah was Merciful to all the people of the earth through him, both the believers and the disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Faatih</strong>: (the opener/conqueror). It was through him that Allaah opened the door of guidance after it had been closed, and opened closed eyes and deaf ears and sealed hearts. And through him Allaah conquered the lands of the disbelievers, and opened the doors of Paradise, and opened through him the ways of acquiring beneficial knowledge and righteous actions. And He opened through him both the doors of this world and the hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Ameen</strong>: (the Trustworthy). He is the most deserving out of all creation for this name. For he is the trustee of Allaah of His revelation and religion. And he is the trusted one in the Heaven and in the earth. And this is why he was called al-Ameen before his Prophethood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Basheer</strong>: (the Bearer of glad tidings). He is the bearer of glad tidings for the one who obeys him of reward, and he is the Warner (an-Nadheer) of the one who disobeys him of punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah called him his <strong>servant (Abd)</strong> in many places in His Book for example, &#8216;Blessed be He who revealed the Furqaan to His servant&#8217;. {7}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is established that he (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;I am the <strong>Master (sayyid) of the children of Aadam</strong> [on the Day of Judgement] and I am not being arrogant.&#8221; {8}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah called him an <strong>Illuminating Lamp (Siraaj Muneer)</strong>. And all praise is due to Allaah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ar-Raheeq al-Makhtoom</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On their way back to Madinah, at a large sand hill, the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam divided the spoils equally among the fighters after he had taken Al-Khums (one-fifth). When they reached As-Safra&#8217;, he ordered that two of the prisoners should be killed. They were An-Nadr bin Al-Harith and &#8216;Uqbah bin Abi Muait, because they had persecuted the Muslims in Makkah, and harboured deep hatred towards Allaah and His Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam . In a nutshell, they were criminals of war in modern terminology, and their execution was an awesome lesson to oppressors. &#8216;Uqbah forgot his pride and cried out, &#8220;Who will look after my children O Messenger of Allaah?&#8221; The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam answered, &#8220;The Fire (of Hell).&#8221; Did &#8216;Uqbah not remember the day when he had thrown the entrails of a sheep onto the head of the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam while he was prostrating himself in prayer, and Fatimah had come and washed it off him? He had also strangled the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam with his cloak if it had not been for Abu Bakr to intervene and release the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam . The heads of both criminals were struck off by Alee bin Abi TAleeb.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam exhorted the Muslims to treat the prisoners so well to such an extent that the captors used to give the captives their bread (the more valued part of the meal) and keep the dates for themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prisoners of war constituted a problem awaiting resolution because it was a new phenomenon in the history of Islaam. The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam consulted Abu Bakr and Umar bin Al-Khattab as to what he should do with the prisoners. Abu Bakr suggested that he should ransom them, explaining this by saying: &#8220;They are after all our relatives, and this money would give us strength against the disbelievers, moreover, Allaah could guide them to Islaam.&#8221; Umar advised killing them, saying, &#8220;They are the leaders of Kufr (disbelief).&#8221; The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam preferred Abu Bakr&#8217;s suggestion to that of Umar&#8217;s. The following day, Umar called on the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam and Abu Bakr to see them weeping. He showed extreme astonishment and inquired about the situation so that he might weep if it was worth weeping for, or else he would feign weeping.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war (and free them with ransom) until he had made a great slaughter (among his enemies) in the land. You desire the good of this world (i.e. the money of ransom for freeing the captives), but Allaah desires (for you) the Hereafter. And Allaah is All-Mighty, All-Wise. Were it not a previous ordainment from Allaah, a severe torment would have touched you for what you took.&#8221;</strong> [Qur&#8217;aan 8:67-68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The previous Divine ordainment went as follows,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;Thereafter (is the time) either for generosity (i.e. free them without ransom) or ransom.&#8221; </strong> [Qur&#8217;aan 47:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which included an area providing permission to take ransom, that is why no penalty was imposed. They were rebuked only for taking prisoners before subduing all the land of disbelief. Apart from this, the polytheists taken to Madinah were not only prisoners of war but rather archcriminals of war whom modern war penal law brings to justice to receive their due sentence of death or prison for life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ransom for the prisoners ranged between 4000 and 1000 Dirhams in accordance with the captive&#8217;s financial situation. Another form of ransom assumed an educational dimension; most of the Makkans, unlike the Madinese, were literate and so each prisoner who could not afford the ransom was entrusted with ten children to teach them the art of writing and reading. Once the child had been proficient enough, the instructor would be set free. Another clan of prisoners were released unransomed on grounds of being hard up. Zainab, the daughter of the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam , paid the ransom of her husband Abul-&#8216;As with a necklace. The Muslims released her prisoner and returned the necklace in deference to the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam but on condition that Abul-&#8216;As allow Zainab to migrate to Madinah, which he actually did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In captivity, there was also an eloquent orator called Suhail bin &#8216;Amr. Umar suggested that they pull out his front teeth to disable him from speaking, but the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam turned down his suggestion for fear Quraish should retAleeate in the same manner on one hand, and on the other for fear of Allaah&#8217;s wrath on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa&#8217;d bin An-Nu&#8217;man, a lesser pilgrim detained in Makkah, was released in return for setting Abu Sufyan&#8217;s son, a captive, free.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Story of the 600-700 Jews Beheaded by the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam at Bani Quraiza in 5 AH</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Bani Quraiza was a tribe of Jews in a district of Madinah that betrayed the Muslims and sided with the enemy during the Battle of Ahzaab (also known as the Battle of the Confederates and the Battle of the Trench). The Sealed Nectar describes what happened to them immediately after the Battle of Ahzaab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Archangel Gabriel, on the very day the Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam came back to Madinah after the previous battle, and while he was washing in Umm Salama&#8217;s house, visited him asking that he should unsheathe his sword and head for the habitation of the seditious Banu Quraiza and fight them. Gabriel noted that he with a procession of angels would go ahead to shake their forts and cast fear in their hearts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam , immediately summoned the prayer caller and ordered him to announce fresh hostilities against Banu Quraiza, institued Ibn Umm Maktum as a ruler of Madinah, and entrusted the banner of war to Alee bin Abi TAleeb who marched towards the appointed target and came close enough to hear the Jews abusing the Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam , who on his part set out at the head of three thousand infantry men and thirty horsemen of Ansar (Helpers) and Muhajireen (Emigrants). On their way to encounter the enemy, the afternoon prayer was due. Some Muslims refused to observe it until they had defeated the enemy, while others offered it in its proper time, as usual. The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam objected to neither. When they reached the habitations of Banu Quraiza, they laid tight siege to their forts. Seeing this terrible situation they were in, the chief of the Jews Ka&#8217;b bin Asad offered them three alternatives: to embrace Islaam, and consequently their life, wealth, women and children would be in full security, and reminded them that such behaviour would not be incongruous with what they had read in their books about the veracity of Muhammad&#8217;s Prophethood; to kill their children and women and then challenge the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam and his followers to the sword to either exterminate the Muslims or be exterminated, or as a third possibility to take Muhammad sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam and his people by surprise on Saturday &#8211; a day mutually understood to witness no fighting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">None of those alternatives appealed them, so their chief, angrily and indignantly, turned to them saying: &#8220;You have never been decisive in decision-making since you were born.&#8221; The gloomy future already visible, they made contacts with some Muslims, who had maintained good relation with them, in order to learn about their fate in the light of the current circumstances. They requested that Abu Lubaba be despatched to them for advice. On his arrival, the men began to implore, women and children to cry desperately. In answer to their demand for advice he pointed to his throat saying it was homicide awaiting them. He then immediately reAleezed that he had betrayed the Prophet&#8217;s trust, so he headed directly for the mosque in Madinah and tied himself to a wooden tall pole swearing that no one would untie him save the Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam , and added that he would never enter the habitation of Banu Quraiza in recompense for the deadly mistake he made. When the Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam was informed of this incident, he said, &#8221; I would have begged Allaah to forgive him if he had asked me, but since he had tied himself out of his own free will, then it was Allaah Who would turn to him in forgiveness.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews of Banu Quraiza could have endured the siege much longer because food and water were plentifully available and their strongholds were greatly fortified, whereas the Muslims were in the wild bare land suffering a lot from cold and hunger, let alone too much fatigue consequent on endless warfare operations that had started even before the battle of Confederates. Nevertheless, this was a battle of nerves, for Allaah had cast fear in the the Jews&#8217; hearts, and their morale had almost collapsed especially when two Muslim heroes, Alee bin Abi TAleeb and Az-Zubair bin &#8216;Awwam proceeded with Alee swearing that he would never stop until he had either stormed their garrisons or been martyred like Hamza (a former Muslim martyr).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the light of this reluctance, they had nothing except to comply with the Messenger&#8217;s judgement. The Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam ordered that the men should be handcuffed, and this was done under the supervision of Muhammad bin Salamah Al-Ansari while the women and children were isolated in confinement. Thereupon Al-Aws tribe interceded begging the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam to be lenient toward them. He suggested that Sa&#8217;d bin Mu&#8217;adh, a former ally, be deputed to give verdict about them, and they agreed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa&#8217;d meanwhile stayed behind in Madinah due to a serious wound he sustained in the Confederates Battle. He was summoned and brought on a donkey. On his way to the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam , the Jews used to exhort him to be lenient in his judgement on account of former friendship. Sa&#8217;d remained silent but when they persisted he uttered: &#8220;It is time for Sa&#8217;d not to be afraid of the blame of the blamers.&#8221; On hearing this decisive attitude, some of them returned to Madinah waiting for a desperate doom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On arrival, he Aleeghted with the help of some men. He was informed that the Jews had agreed to accept his verdict about them. He immediately wondered if his judgement would pass on all the people present, the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam included, turning his face away in honour of him. The reply was positive.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He decided that all the able-bodied male persons belonging to the tribe should be killed, women and children taken prisoners and their wealth divided among the Muslim fighters. The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam accepted his judgement saying that Sa&#8217;d had adjudged by the Command of Allaah. In fact, the Jews deserved that severe punitive action for the ugly treachery they had harboured against Islaam, and the large arsenal they have amassed and which consisted of one thousand and five hundred swords, two thousand spears, three hundred armours and five hundred shields, all of which went into the hands of the Muslims. Trenches were dug in the bazaar of Madinah and a number of Jews between six and seven hundred were beheaded therein. Hot beds of intrigue and treachery were thus exterminated once and for all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Huyai, a chief criminal of war, a devil of Bani Nadir and Safiyah&#8217;s father, had joined the ranks of Banu Quraiza when Quraish and Ghatfan defected, was admitted into the audience of the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam with his hands tied to his neck with a rope. In audacious defiance, he declared obstinate enmity to the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam but admitted that Allaah&#8217;s Will was to be fulfilled and added that he was resigned to his fate. He was ordered to sit down, and was beheaded on the spot.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Only one woman of the Jews was killed because she had killed a Muslim warrior by flinging a grinding stone upon him. A few elements of the enemy embraced Islaam and their lives, wealth and children were spared. As for the spoils of the war, the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam divided them, after putting a fifth aside, in accordance with Allaah&#8217;s injunctions. Three shares went to the horseman and one to the infantry fighter. Women captives were sent to Najd to be bartered with horses and weaponry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the war with Banu Quraiza had been settled and they had been defeated, Sa&#8217;d bin Mu&#8217;adh&#8217;s wish was gratified and he gave his last breath. In response to his supplication &#8216;Aishah narrated, Sa&#8217;d&#8217;s wounds began to bleed from the front part of his neck while he was in his tent which the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam had pitched for him in the mosque so that he would be in close proximity in order to inquire about and watch his well-being closely. The people were not scared except when the blood flowed towards them, and in the Mosque along with Sa&#8217;d&#8217;s tent, there was the tent of Banu Ghifar. They said: O people of the tent, what is it that is coming to us from you? Lo! it was Sa&#8217;d&#8217;s wound that was bleeding and he died thereon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jabir narrated that the Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam had said: <em> &#8220;The Throne of the Compassionate shook for the death of Sa&#8217;d bin Mu&#8217;adh.&#8221;</em> When his bier was carried, At-Tirmidhi said: The hypocrites alleged it was too light. The Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam retorted: <em> &#8220;The angels are carrying him.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the process of the sieze laid to Banu Quraiza, one man of the Muslims, Khallad bin Suwaid was killed when a women of the Jews dropped the grinding stone on him, and another, Abu Sinan bin Mihsan, the brother of &#8216;Ukasha, died.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Lubaba stayed tied for six nights. His wife used to untie him at prayer times and then he tied himself again to the pole. One early morning, Allaah the All-Forgiving revealed a verse to the Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam to the effect that Allaah had turned to Abu Lubaba with forgiveness. The Muslims rushed to release him but he insisted that the Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam himself do it. And this was done shortly before the morning prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Military Expedition took place in the month of Dhul Qa&#8217;dah in the year five Hijri (5AH), and the siege of Banu Quraiza&#8217;s forts lasted for 25 days. The Chapter of Confederates (Qur&#8217;aan, Surah 33)was revealed containing Allaah&#8217;s Words concerning the basic issues relating to the believers and hypocrites during the battle of the Confederates, and the consequences of the treachery and breaching of covenants by the Jews.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From &#8220;Zâd al-Ma&#8217;âd fî Hadyi Khayri-l &#8216;Ibâd&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of the Prophet&#8217;s <i>Ghazwat</i>, <i> Bu&#8217;uth</i> and <i>Saraya</i> [1] occurred after the <i>Hijrah</i>, within a span of ten years. There were either twenty-seven <i>Ghazwat</i>, or twenty-five, or twenty-nine. The Prophet <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> had to fight in nine battles, <i>Badr</i>, <i>&#8216;Uhud</i>, <i>al-Khandaqh</i>, <i>Quraidhah</i>, <i>al-Mustaliqh</i>, <i> Khaybar</i>,<i> al-Fath&#8217;</i> (Conquering of Makkah), <i>&#8216;Hunayn</i> and <i>Tâ&#8217;if</i>. It was said that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> also fought against <i>Banî an-Nadhîr</i> (a Jewish tribe) and at <i>al-Ghabah</i> and <i>Wadi al-Qura</i>, which was a suburb of Khaybar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <i>Saraya</i> of the Prophet <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and the armies he sent, they numbered close to sixty. There were seven major battles: <i>Badr</i>, <i>&#8216;Uhud</i>, <i>al-</i><i>Khandaqh</i>, <i>Khaybar</i>, <i>al-Fath&#8217;</i>, <i>&#8216;Hunayn</i> and <i>Tabuk</i>. [2] Several parts of the Qur&#8217;ân mentioned these major <i>Ghazwat</i>. For instance, Sûrah al-Anfâl (chapter 8) was revealed about <i>Ghazwat Badr</i>, while the last part of Sûrah ali-&#8216;Imrân (chapter 3) was about <i>Ghazwat &#8216;Uhud</i>, from Allâh&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And (remember) when you [Muhammad <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i></b><b>] left your household in the morning to post the believers at their stations for the battle&#8221;</b> [3:121],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">until just before the end of the Sûrah. The beginning of Sûrah al-Ahzâb (chapter 33) was revealed about the battles of <i>al-Khandaqh</i>, <i>Quraydhah</i> and <i>Khaybar</i>. Sûrah al-&#8216;Hashr (59) was revealed about <i>Banî an-Nadhîr</i>, <i>al-Fath&#8217;</i> (48) about <i>al-&#8216;Hudaibiyyah</i> and the battle of <i>Khaybar</i>. The conquering of Makkah was mentioned indirectly in Sûrah al-Fath&#8217; and directly in Sûrah an-Nasr (110). He <i> sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was wounded during the battle of <i>&#8216;Uhud</i>. [3] The angels fought alongside the Prophet <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> during the battles of <i>Badr</i> [4] and <i>&#8216;Hunayn</i>. They also descended during the battle of <i>al-Khandaqh</i> [5], where they shook the <i>Mushriks</i> [surrounding <i>Madînah</i>] and defeated them. During that battle, the Prophet <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> threw a handful of sand at the faces of the <i>Mushriks</i> (Polytheists) and they fled [without a fight]. [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <i> sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> won decisively in two battles, <i>Badr</i> and <i>&#8216;Hunain</i>. He used <i>al-Manjaniq</i> (mongonel, or catapult) during on battle, <i>at-Tâ&#8217;if</i>, and took cover behind a trench during <i>Ghazwat al-Khandaqh</i>, also known as <i>Ghazwat al-Ahzâb</i>. Salmân al-Farsî <i>radiallâhu &#8216;anhu</i> suggested that the trench be dug in that battle.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] &#8216;<i>Ghazwat</i>&#8216;, pl. for &#8216;<i>Ghazwah</i>&#8216;, means battles. The battles that the Prophet <i> sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> led himself were called, &#8216;<i>Ghazwat</i>&#8216;, whereas the armies and expeditions he sent while remaining behind are called, &#8216;<i>Bu&#8217;uth</i>&#8216;, pl. for, &#8216;<i>Ba&#8217;th</i>&#8216;, and &#8216;<i>Saraya</i>&#8216;, pl. for, &#8216;<i>Sariyyah</i>&#8216;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] All of which are mentioned in detail later on in, <i>Zâd al-Ma&#8217;âd</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Al-Bukhârî (3767) narrated that Sahl bin as-Sa&#8217;idi was asked about how the wound of the Prophet <i> sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was treated, and he replied, &#8220;&#8216;Alî used to bring water in his shield and Fâtimah (the Prophet&#8217;s daughter and &#8216;Alî&#8217;s wife) used to wash the blood off his face. Then straw mat was burnt and the wound was filled with it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Al-Bukhârî (3694) narrated that &#8216;Abdullâh ibn &#8216;Abbâs <i>radiallâhu &#8216;anhu</i> said that the Prophet <i> sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said on the day of <i>Badr</i>, &#8220;Here is Jibrîl, holding the head of his horse and wearing war armours.&#8221; Allâh sent the angels to strengthen their hearts of the believers and to aid them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Shaykh &#8216;Irfân said, &#8220;Allâh said in Sûrah al-Ahzâb (33:9), <b> &#8216;O you who believe! Remember Allâh&#8217;s Favour to you, when there came against you hosts, and We sent against them a wind and forces that you saw not [angels during the battle of Al-Ahzâb (the Confederates, <i>Ghazwat al-Khandaq</i> (in 5 AH)]. And Allâh is Ever All-Seer of what you do.&#8217; </b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Al-Bukhârî (2716) and Muslim (3277) narrated that Allâh&#8217;s Apostle <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> asked for Allâh&#8217;s wrath upon the <i> Ahzâb</i>, saying: <i>&#8220;O, Allâh, Revealer of the Holy Book, and the One swift at reckoning! O, Allâh, Defeat the confederates. O, Allâh, Defeat them and shake them.&#8221;</i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from the “The Sealed Nectar” book</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 1. Khadijah Bint Khuwailid:</strong> In Makkah — prior to Hijra — the Prophet’s household comprised him (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and his wife Khadijah bint Khuwailid. He was twenty-five and she was forty when they got married. She was the first woman he married. She was the only wife he had till she died. He had sons and daughters with her. None of their sons lived long. They all died. Their daughters were Zainab, Ruqaiya, Umm Kulthum and Fatimah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zainab was married to her maternal cousin Abu Al-‘As bin Al-Rabi‘ and that was before Al-Hijra. Ruqaiya and Umm Kulthum were both married to ‘Uthman bin ‘Affan &#8211; may Allah be pleased with him &#8211; successively (i.e. he married one after the death of her sister). Fatimah was married to ‘Ali bin Abi Talib; and that was in the period between Badr and Uhud battles. The sons and daughters that Fatimah and ‘Ali had were Al-Hasan, Al-Husain, Zainab and Umm Kulthum.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is well-known that the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) was exceptionally authorized to have more than four wives for various reasons. The wives he married were thirteen. Nine of them outlived him. Two died in his lifetime: Khadijah and the Mother of the poor (<em>Umm Al-Masakeen</em>) — Zainab bint Khuzaima, besides two others with whom he did not consummate his marriage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2. Sawdah bint Zam‘a:</strong> He married her in Shawwal, in the tenth year of Prophethood, a few days after the death of Khadijah. Prior to that, she was married to a paternal cousin of hers called As-Sakran bin ‘Amr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 3. ‘Aishah bint Abu Bakr:</strong> He married her in the eleventh year of Prophethood, a year after his marriage to Sawdah, and two years and five months before Al-Hijra. She was six years old when he married her. However, he did not consummate the marriage with her till Shawwal seven months after Al-Hijra, and that was in Madinah. She was nine then. She was the only virgin he married, and the most beloved creature to him. As a woman she was the most learnèd woman in jurisprudence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 4. Hafsah bint ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab:</strong> She was <em>Aiyim</em> (i.e. husbandless). Her ex-husband was Khunais bin Hudhafa As-Sahmi in the period between Badr and Uhud battles. The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) married her in the third year of Al-Hijra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 5. Zainab bint Khuzaimah:</strong> She was from Bani Hilal bin ‘Amir bin Sa‘sa‘a. Was nicknamed <em>Umm Al-Masakeen</em>, because of her kindness and care towards them. She used to be the wife of ‘Abdullah bin Jahsh, who was martyred at Uhud, was married to the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) in the fourth year of Al-Hijra, but she died two or three months after her marriage to the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 6. Umm Salamah Hind bint Abi Omaiyah:</strong> She used to be the wife of Abu Salamah, who died in Jumada Al-Akhir, in the fourth year of Al-Hijra. The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) married her in Shawwal of the same year.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 7. Zainab bint Jahsh bin Riyab:</strong> She was from Bani Asad bin Khuzaimah and was the Messenger’s paternal cousin. She was married to Zaid bin Haritha — who was then considered son of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) . However, Zaid divorced her. Allâh sent down some Qur’ânic verses with this respect:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;So when Zaid had accomplished his desire from her (i.e., divorced her), We gave her to you in marriage.&#8221; [33:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">About her, Allâh has sent down some verses of <em>Al-Ahzab</em> Chapter that discussed the adoption of children in detail — anyway we will discuss this later. The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) married her in Dhul-Qa‘dah, the fifth year of Al-Hijra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>8. Juwairiyah bint Al-Harith: </strong> Al-Harith was the head of Bani Al-Mustaliq of Khuza‘ah. Juwairiyah was among the booty that fell to the Muslims from Bani Al-Mustaliq. She was a portion of Thabit bin Qais bin Shammas’ share. He made her a covenant to set her free at a certain time. The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) accomplished the covenant and married her in Sha‘ban in the sixth year of Al-Hijra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 9. Umm Habibah:</strong> Ramlah, the daughter of Abu Sufyan. She was married to ‘Ubaidullah bin Jahsh. She migrated with him to Abyssinia ( Ethiopia). When ‘Ubaidullah apostatized and became a Christian, she stoodfast to her religion and refused to convert. However ‘Ubaidullah died there in Abyssinia ( Ethiopia). The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) dispatched ‘Amr bin Omaiyah Ad-Damri with a letter to Negus, the king, asking him for Umm Habibah’s hand — that was in Muharram, in the seventh year of Al-Hijra. Negus agreed and sent her to the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) in the company of Sharhabeel bin Hasnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 10. Safiyah bint Huyai bin Akhtab:</strong> From the Children of Israel, she was among the booty taken at Khaibar battle. The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) took her for himself. He set her free and married her after that conquest in the seventh year of Al-Hijra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 11. Maimunah bint Al-Harith:</strong> The daughter of Al-Harith, and the sister of Umm Al-Fadl Lubabah bint Al-Harith. The Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) married her after the Compensatory <em>‘Umrah</em> (Lesser Pilgrimage). That was in Dhul-Qa‘dah in the seventh year of Al-Hijra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those were the eleven women that the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) had married and consummated marriage with them. He outlived two of them — Khadijah and Zainab, the <em>Umm Al-Masakeen.</em> Whereas the other nine wives outlived him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The two wives that he did not consummate marriage with were, one from Bani Kilab and the other from Kindah and this was the one called Al-Jauniyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Besides these, he had two concubines. The first was Mariyah, the Coptic (an Egyptian Christian), a present gift from Al-Muqauqis, vicegerent of Egypt — she gave birth to his son Ibrâhim, who died in Madinah while still a little child, on the28 th or29 th of Shawwal in the year 10A.H., i.e.27 th January, 632 A.D. The second one was Raihanah bint Zaid An-Nadriyah or Quraziyah, a captive from Bani Quraiza. Some people say she was one of his wives. However, Ibn Al-Qaiyim gives more weight to the first version. Abu ‘Ubaidah spoke of two more concubines, Jameelah, a captive, and another one, a bondwoman granted to him by Zainab bint Jahsh.[]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whosoever meditates on the life of the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) , will conceive that his marriage to this great number of women in the late years of his lifetime, after he had almost spent thirty years of his best days of youth sufficing himself to one old wife — Khadijah and later on to Sawdah, was in no way an overwhelming lustful desire to be satisfied through such a number of wives. These marriages were in fact motivated by aims and purposes much more glorious and greater than what normal marriages usually aim at.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tendency of the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) towards establishing a relationship by marriage with both Abu Bakr and ‘Umar and his marriage to ‘Aishah and Hafsah — and getting his daughter Fatimah married to ‘Ali bin Abi Talib, and the marriage of his two daughters, Ruqaiyah and Umm Kulthum to ‘Uthman — indicate clearly that he aimed at confirming the relationship among the four men — whose sacrifices and great achievements in the cause of Islam are well-known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Besides this, there was that tradition of the Arabs to honour the in-law relations. For them a son or a daughter-in-law was a means by which they sought the consolidation of relationship and affection with various phratries. Hostility and fights against alliances and affinities would bring an unforgettable shame, disgrace and degradation to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By marrying the Mothers of believers, the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) wanted to demolish or break down the Arab tribes’ enmity to Islam and extinguish their intense hatred. Umm Salamah was from Bani Makhzum — the clan of Abu Jahl and Khalid bin Al-Waleed. Her marriage to the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) produced good results. Khalid’s deliberately undecisive attitude at Uhud — for instance — was due to the Messenger’s marriage to Umm Salamah. Khalid went even further than that, in a short time he willingly became a keen obedient Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the Messenger of Allâh’s marriage to Umm Habibah, Abu Sufyan, her father, did not encounter him with any sort of hostility. Similarly his marriage to Juwairiyah and Safiyah made the two tribes stop all sorts of provocation, aggression or hostility against Islam. Better still, Juwairiyah, herself, was one of the greatest sources of blessing to her own people. On the occasion of her marriage to the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) , his Companions set a hundred families of her people free. They said: &#8220;It is for their affinity with the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) .&#8221; No need to say what great good impression this gratitude had on everybody’s soul. One of the greatest motives of all is Allâh’s bidding his Prophet to educate and purify the souls of people who had known nothing whatsoever about courtesy, education and culture. He had to teach them to comply with the necessities of civilization and to contribute to the solidification and the establishment of a new Islamic society.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An essential fundamental rule of the Muslim society is to prohibit mixing of men and women. Providing direct education for women, though highly compelling, is impossible in the light of this Islamic norm. Therefore, the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) had to select some women of different ages and talents, and indoctrinate them systematically in order to educate she-bedouins and townswomen, old and young, and thus furnish them with the instruments of propagating the true faith. The Mothers of believers (i.e. wives of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) ) were in such a convenient position that they could convey the state of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and his affairs to people (men and women). Being educated and taught the teachings and rules of Islam, his wives, especially those who outlived him, played a very important role in conveying Prophetic traditions <em>Ahadith</em> to the Muslims. ‘Aishah, for instance, related a large number of the Prophet’s deeds and statements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His marriage to his paternal cousin Zainab bint Jahsh was a peculiar case which aimed at eradicating a deeply rooted pre-Islamic tradition — i.e. the adoption of children. In <em>Al-Jahiliyah</em> the Arabs used to consider an adopted person exactly like a real son or daughter as far as rights and sanctities are concerned. That <em>Jahiliyah</em> tradition had been so deeply rooted in their hearts that it was not easy to remove or uproot it. This tradition in fact affronts the basic principles of Islam; especially those concerned with marriage, divorce and inheritance and some other cases, and brought about lots of corruptions and indecencies. Naturally Islam stands against such deeds, and attempts to remove them from the Islamic society.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For the eradication of this tradition, Allâh, the Exalted, bid His Messenger (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) to marry his cousin Zainab bint Jahsh, who was an ex-wife to Zaid. She was at variance with Zaid to an extent that he intended to divorce her — that was at the time when the Confederates (<em>Al-Ahzab</em>) were making an evil alliance against the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and against the Muslims. The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) feared that the hypocrites, the idolaters, and the Jews would make a propaganda out of it and try to influence some Muslims of weak hearts. That was why he urged Zaid not to divorce her, in order not to get involved into that trial.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Undoubtedly this hesitation and partiality were alien to the character of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) . They did not apply to the power of determination and will with which he had been sent. Allâh, the Exalted, blamed him for that by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &#8220;And (remember) when you said to him (Zaid bin Haritha may Allah be pleased with him &#8211; — the freed slave of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) on whom Allâh has bestowed grace (by guiding him to Islam) and you (O Muhammad (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) too) have done favour (by manumitting him), ‘Keep your wife to yourself, and fear Allâh.’ But you did hide in yourself (i.e. what Allâh has already made known to you that He will give her to you in marriage) that which Allâh will make manifest, you did fear the people (i.e. Muhammad (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) married the divorced wife of his manumitted slave) whereas Allâh had a better right that you should fear him.&#8221; [33:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally Zaid divorced Zainab and the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) married her at the time he laid siege to Bani Quraiza. That was after she had finished her <em>Iddat</em> (i.e. period during which a widow or a divorcee may not remarry). Allâh Himself had already ordained it, and so gave him no other alternative. Allâh had even started the marriage Himself by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &#8220;So when Zaid had accomplished his desire from her (i.e. divorced her), We gave her to you in marriage, so that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the believers in respect of (the marriage of) the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have no desire to keep them (i.e. they have divorced them).&#8221; [33:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that was in order to break down the tradition of child adoption in practice after He had done it in words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &#8220;Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that is more just near Allâh.&#8221; [33:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Muhammad ( saw) is not the father of any man among you, but he is the Messenger of Allâh, and the last (end) of the Prophets.&#8221; [33:40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Lots of deeply-rooted traditions cannot be uprooted or demolished or even adjusted by mere words. They must be matched and associated with the action of the advocate of the Message himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This could be perceived through the deeds practised by the Muslims at Al-Hudaibiyah <em>‘Umrah</em> (Lesser Pilgrimage) during which ‘Urwah bin Mas‘ud Al-Thaqafi saw certain Muslims tend to pick up any expectoration that fell down from the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) . He also saw them race to the water of his ablution and they almost quarrelled for it. There were others who competed to pledge allegiance to death and some others pledged not to flee from (the battlefield). Among those people, were eminent Companions like ‘Umar and Abu Bakr, who although dedicated all their lives to the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and to the cause of Islam, but refused to carry out the Messenger’s ordres with respect to slaughtering sacrificial animals after the ratification of Al-Hudaibiyah Peace Treaty, the thing that perturbed and caused the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) to feel anxious. However, when Umm Salamah &#8211; may Allah be pleased with her &#8211; advised that he take the initiative and sacrifice his animals, his followers raced to follow his example; a clear evidence in support of the saying: Actions speak louder than words, in the process of exterminating a deeply-established tradition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hypocrites aroused a lot of suspicions and made a broad false propaganda against that marriage. Their acts and talks about that marriage had ill-effects on those Muslims whose Faith was still weak, particularly that Zainab was the fifth wife — and the Noble Qur’ân limited the number up to four only; Zaid was traditionally his son, and so a father marrying his son’s divorcee was a heinous sin in the eyes of the Arabians.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em> Al-AhzabSurah</em> was revealed to shed full light on the two issues, i.e. Islam does not recognize adoption of children, and the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) is given (by Allâh) more freedom as regards the number of wives he can hold than other Muslims in order to achieve noble and honourable purposes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the treatment of the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) to his wives was of honourable, noble, and superb nature. His wives were on tops in respect of honour, satisfaction, patience, modesty, and service (that is to say the performance of housework and marriage duties). Although the Messenger’s house-life was hard and unbearable, none of his wives complained. Anas said about the Prophet’s life: &#8220;According to my knowledge, the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) has never tasted a thin flattened loaf in all his lifetime, nor has he ever seen with his own eyes roasted mutton.&#8221;[]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Aishah said: &#8220;Over two months have elapsed — during which we have seen three crescents — and yet no fire has been kindled in the houses of the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) (i.e. they did not cook food).&#8221; &#8220;What did you eat to sustain yourselves?&#8221; ‘Urwah asked. She said &#8220;The two blacks: dates and water&#8221;[]. Lots of information about the hard life of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) were told.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In spite of these hardships, straits and adversity of life in the house of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam), none of his wives uttered a word of complaint worthy of reproach — but once. This exception was required by human instinctive inclinations. However, it was not so important and consequently it did not require the decree of a legislative rule. Allâh has given them an opportunity to choose between two things, as clearly stated in the following verses:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &#8220;O Prophet (Muhammad (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam)! Say to your wives: ‘If you desire the life of this world, and its glitter, — then come! I will make a provision for you and set you free in a handsome manner (divorce). But if you desire Allâh and His Messenger, and the Home of the Hereafter, then verily, Allâh has prepared for <em>Al-Muhsinat</em> (good doers) amongst you an enormous reward.’&#8221; [33:28,29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were so noble and honest that none of them preferred ‘the life of this world and its glitter’ to the abode in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Although they were many in number, nothing of the dispute occurrences that normally happen among co-wives, took place in their houses. Very few cases could be the only exception; but they were quite normal. Allâh reproached them for that, so they ceased to do such a thing. This incident is mentioned in <em>At-Tahreem</em> Chapter:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &#8220;O Prophet! Why do you ban (for yourself) that which Allâh has made lawful to you …&#8221; [66:1] (to the end of the fifth verse).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Discussing polygamy — in my opinion — is not a necessity; since a person who is familiar with the Europeans, and indecent practices, sufferings, wickedness, their sorrows and distresses, the horrible crimes they commit in this respect as well as the trials, the disasters that they are involved in, and which emanate directly from their disregard of the principle of polygamy form a good reason (to justify the soundness of polygamy). The distorted picture of life in Europe with the ill-practices featuring it, could truthfully justify the existence and practice of polygamy. In this, there are Divine signs for all people possessed of lucid mind.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded from Suhayb that the Messenger of Allah said:Among the people who came before you, there was a king who had a sorcerer, and when that sorcerer became old, he said to the king, &#8220;I have become old and my time is nearly over, so please send me a boy whom I can teach magic.&#8221; So, he sent him a boy and the sorcerer taught him magic. Whenever the boy went to the sorcerer, he sat with a monk who was on the way and listened to his speech and admired them. So, when he went to the sorcerer, he passed by the monk and sat there with him; and on visiting the sorcerer the latter would thrash him. So, the boy complained about this to the monk. The monk said to him, &#8220;Whenever you are afraid of the sorcerer, say to him: `My people kept me busy.&#8217; And whenever you are afraid of your people, say to them: `The sorcerer kept me busy.&#8221;&#8217; So the boy carried on like that (for some time). Then a huge terrible creature appeared on the road and the people were unable to pass by. The boy said, &#8220;Today I shall know whether the sorcerer is better or the monk is better.&#8221; So, he took a stone and said, &#8220;O Allah! If the deeds and actions of the monk are liked by You better than those of the sorcerer, then kill this creature so that the people can cross (the road).&#8221; Then he struck it with a stone killing it and the people passed by on the road.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The boy came to the monk and informed him about it. The monk said to him, &#8220;O my son! Today you are better than I, and you have achieved what I see! You will be put to trial. And in case you are put to trial, do not inform (them) about me.&#8221;The boy used to treat the people suffering from congenital blindness, leprosy, and other diseases. There was a courtier of the king who had become blind and he heard about the boy. He came and brought a number of gifts for the boy and said, &#8220;All these gifts are for you on the condition that you cure me.&#8221; The boy said, &#8220;I do not cure anybody; it is only Allah who cures people. So, if you believe in Allah and supplicate to Him, He will cure you.&#8221; So, he believed in and supplicated to Allah, and Allah cured him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Later, the courtier came to the king and sat at the place where he used to sit before. The king said, &#8220;Who gave you back your sight&#8221;The courtier replied, &#8220;My Lord.&#8221; The king then said, &#8220;I did&#8221; The courtier said, &#8220;No, my Lord and your Lord &#8211; Allah&#8221; The king said, &#8220;Do you have another Lord beside me&#8221; The courtier said, &#8220;Yes, your Lord and my Lord is Allah.&#8221; The king tortured him and did not stop until he told him about the boy. So, the boy was brought to the king and he said to him, &#8220;O boy! Has your magic reached to the extent that you cure congenital blindness, leprosy and other diseases&#8221;He said, &#8221; I do not cure anyone. Only Allah can cure.&#8221; The king said, &#8220;Me&#8221; The boy replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; The king asked, &#8220;Do you have another Lord besides me&#8221;The boy answered, &#8221; My Lord and your Lord is Allah.&#8221; So, he tortured him also until he told about the monk. Then the monk was brought to him and the king said to him, &#8220;Abandon your religion.&#8221; The monk refused and so the king ordered a saw to be brought which was placed in the middle of his head and he fell, sawn in two. Then it was said to the man who used to be blind, &#8220;Abandon your religion.&#8221; He refused to do so, and so a saw was brought and placed in the middle of his head and he fell, sawn in two. Then the boy was brought and it was said to him, &#8220;Abandon your religion.&#8221; He refused and so the king sent him to the top of such and such mountain with some people. He told the people, &#8220;Ascend up the mountain with him till you reach its peak, then see if he abandons his religion; otherwise throw him from the top.&#8221; They took him and when they ascended to the top, he said, &#8221; O Allah! Save me from them by any means that You wish.&#8221; So, the mountain shook and they all fell down and the boy came back walking to the king. The king said, &#8221; What did your companions (the people I sent with you) do&#8221; The boy said, &#8220;Allah saved me from them.&#8221; So, the king ordered some people to take the boy on a boat to the middle of the sea, saying, &#8220;If he renounces his religion (well and good), but if he refuses, drown him.&#8221; So, they took him out to sea and he said, &#8220;O Allah! Save me from them by any means that you wish.&#8221; So they were all drowned in the sea.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the boy returned to the king and the king said, &#8220;What did your companions do&#8221; The boy replied, &#8220;Allah, saved me from them.&#8221; Then he said to the king, &#8220;You will not be able to kill me until you do as I order you. And if you do as I order you, you will be able to kill me.&#8221; The king asked, &#8220;And what is that&#8221; The boy said, &#8220;Gather the people in one elevated place and tie me to the trunk of a tree; then take an arrow from my quiver and say: `In the Name of Allah, the Lord of the boy.&#8217; If you do this, you will be able to kill me.&#8221; So he did this, and placing an arrow in the bow, he shot it, saying, &#8220;In the Name of Allah, the Lord of the boy.&#8221; The arrow hit the boy in the temple, and the boy placed his hand over the arrow wound and died. The people proclaimed, &#8220;We believe in the Lord of the boy!&#8217;’ Then it was said to the king, &#8220;Do you see what has happened That which you feared has taken place. By Allah, all the people have believed (in the Lord of the boy).&#8221;So he ordered that ditches be dug at the entrances to the roads and it was done, and fires were kindled in them. Then the king said, &#8220;Whoever abandons his religion, let him go, and whoever does not, throw him into the fire.&#8221; They were struggling and scuffling in the fire, until a woman and her baby whom she was breast feeding came and it was as if she was being somewhat hesitant of falling into the fire, so her baby said to her,&#8221;Be patient mother! For verily, you are following the truth!&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim also recorded this Hadith at the end of the Sahih. Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar related this story in his book of Sirah in another way that has some differences from that which has just been related. Then, after Ibn Ishaq explained that the people of Najran began following the religion of the boy after his murder, which was the religion of Christianity, he said, &#8220;Then (the king) Dhu Nuwas came to them with his army and called them to Judaism. He gave them a choice to either accept Judaism or be killed, so they chose death. Thus, he had a ditch dug and burned (some of them) in the fire (in the ditch), while others he killed with the sword. He made an example of them (by slaughtering them) until he had killed almost twenty thousand of them. It was about Dhu Nuwas and his army that Allah revealed to His Messenger :</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>(Cursed were the People of the Ditch. Of fire fed with fuel. When they sat by it. And they witnessed what they were doing against the believers. And they had no fault except that they believed in Allah, the Almighty, Worthy of all praise! To Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth! And Allah is Witness over everything.) (85:4-9)</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what Muhammad bin Ishaq said in his book of Sirah &#8212; that the one who killed the People of the Ditch was Dhu Nuwas, and his name was Zur`ah. In the time of his kingdom he was called Yusuf. He was the son of Tuban As`ad Abi Karib, who was the Tubba` who invaded Al-Madinah and put the covering over the Ka`bah. He kept two rabbis with him from the Jews of Al-Madinah. After this some of the people of Yemen accepted Judaism at the hands of these two rabbis, as Ibn Ishaq mentions at length. So Dhu Nuwas killed twenty thousand people in one morning in the Ditch. Only one man among them escaped. He was known as Daws Dhu Tha`laban. He escaped on a horse and they set out after him, but they were unable to catch him. He went to Caesar, the emperor of Ash-Sham. So, Caesar wrote to An-Najashi, the King of Abyssinia. So, he sent with him an army of Abyssinian Christians, who were lead by Aryat and Abrahah. They rescued Yemen from the hands of the Jews. Dhu Nuwas tried to flee but eventually fell into the sea and drowned. After this, the kingdom of Abyssinia remained under Christian power for seventy years. Then the power was divested from the Christians by Sayf bin Dhi Yazin Al-Himyari when Kisra, the king of Persia sent an army there (to Yemen). He (the king) sent with him (Sayf Al-Himyari) those people who were in the prisons, and they were close to seven hundred in number. So, he (Sayf Al-Himyari) conquered Yemen with them and returned the kingdom back to the people of Himyar (Yemenis).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Al Hamdulillah<br />
</strong><strong>(All Praise and Thanks be to Allah)</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Meaning of Al-Hamd</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Ja`far bin Jarir said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>The meaning of (Al-Hamdu Lillah) (all praise and thanks be to Allah)</strong> is: all thanks are due purely to Allah, alone, not any of the objects that are being worshipped instead of Him, nor any of His creation. These thanks are due to Allah&#8217;s innumerable favors and bounties, that only He knows the amount of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s bounties include creating the tools that help the creation worship Him, the physical bodies with which they are able to implement His commands, the sustenance that He provides them in this life, and the comfortable life He has granted them, without anything or anyone compelling Him to do so. Allah also warned His creation and alerted them about the means and methods with which they can earn eternal dwelling in the residence of everlasting happiness. All thanks and praise are due to Allah for these favors from beginning to end.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further, Ibn Jarir commented on the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Al-Hamdu Lillah)</strong>, that it means, &#8220;A praise that Allah praised Himself with, indicating to His servants that they too should praise Him, as if Allah had said, `Say: All thanks and praise is due to Allah.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was said that the statement, <strong>(All praise and thanks be to Allah)</strong>, entails praising Allah by mentioning His most beautiful Names and most honorable Attributes. When one proclaims, `All thanks are due to Allah,&#8217; he will be thanking Him for His favors and bounties.&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Difference between Praise and Thanks</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hamd is more general, in that it is a statement of praise for one&#8217;s characteristics, or for what he has done. Thanks are given for what was done, not merely for characteristics.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Statements of the Salaf about Al-Hamd</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hafs mentioned that `Umar said to `Ali, &#8220;We know La ilaha illallah, Subhan Allah and Allahu Akbar. What about Al-Hamdu Lillah&#8221; `Ali said, &#8220;<strong>A statement that Allah liked for Himself, was pleased with for Himself and He likes that it be repeated</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Ibn `Abbas said, <strong>&#8220;Al-Hamdu Lillah is the statement of appreciation. When the servant says Al-Hamdu Lillah, Allah says, `My servant has praised Me.&#8221;</strong> Ibn Abi Hatim recorded this Hadith.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Virtues of Al-Hamd</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal recorded that Al-Aswad bin Sari` said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I said, `O Messenger of Allah! Should I recite to you words of praise for My Lord, the Exalted, that I have collected&#8217; He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Verily, your Lord likes Al-Hamd.)</strong>&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nasa&#8217;i also recorded this Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, Abu `Isa At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa&#8217;i and Ibn Majah recorded that Musa bin Ibrahim bin Kathir related that Talhah bin Khirash said that Jabir bin `Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(The best Dhikr (remembering Allah) is La ilaha illallah and the best supplication is Al-Hamdu Lillah.)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At-Tirmidhi said that this Hadith is Hasan Gharib.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Ibn Majah recorded that Anas bin Malik said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(No servant is blessed by Allah and says,`Al-Hamdu Lillah&#8217;, except that what he was given is better than that which he has himself acquired.)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further, in his Sunan, Ibn Majah recorded that Ibn `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(A servant of Allah once said, `O Allah! Yours is the Hamd that is suitable for the grace of Your Face and the greatness of Your Supreme Authority.&#8217; The two angels were confused as to how to write these words. They ascended to Allah and said, `O our Lord! A servant has just uttered a statement and we are unsure how to record it for him.&#8217; Allah said while having more knowledge in what His servant has said, &#8216;What did My servant say&#8217; They said, `He said, `<strong>O Allah! Yours is the Hamd that is suitable for the grace of Your Face and the greatness of Your Supreme Authority</strong>.&#8217; Allah said to them, <strong>`Write it as My servant has said it, until he meets Me and then I shall reward him for it</strong>.)</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Al before Hamd encompasses all Types of Thanks and Appreciation for Allah</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The letters Alif and Lam before the word Hamd serve to encompass all types of thanks and appreciation for Allah, the Exalted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Hadith stated,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(O Allah! All of Al-Hamd is due to You, You own all the ownership, all types of good are in Your Hand and all affairs belong to You.)</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808080;">[Below is a portion from the book &#8220;Miracles of the Messenger (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam)&#8221; regarding the remembrance of Allah. This miracle occurred when Rasulallah moved from the tree trunk to the newly made pulpit to give the Khutbah. Rasulallah used to lean against the tree trunk but when he left for the pulpit it cried out loud like a child for it would no longer be in the company of the Prophet and hear the remembrance of Allah (azzawajal). You can read the detailed story and hadith in chapter 6 page 105 in the book &#8220;Miracles of the Messenger (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam)&#8221;]</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was also another reason for the weeping of the tree trunk and this was made clear by the Prophet when he said to his Companions: &#8220;It wept because of the remembrance of Allah (Dhikr) which it used to hear.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the tree trunk also used to hear remembrance of Allah from the mouth of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam) and Allah, the Most Blessed, the Most High says regarding remembrance of Him: <i>&#8220;Those who believed (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism), and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of Allah verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest. &#8220;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is not surprising that the tree trunk cried for that which brought tranquility to it. Haply, we may learn from this lifeless thing to love the remembrance of Allah and to accustom ourselves to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word Dhikr means to remember something through constant verbal repetition of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a person were to constantly repeat the Names of Allah for example he would be remembering Allah; and due to the great need of man for remembrance of Allah, He has encouraged us to do it, in His Words: <i>&#8220;He said: &#8216;O my Lord! Make a sign for me.&#8217; (Allah) said: &#8216;Your sign is that you shall not speak to mankind for three days except with signals. And remember your Lord much (by praising Him again and again), and glorify (Him) in the afternoon and in the morning.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: <i>&#8220;O you who believe! Remember Allah with much remembrance.&#8221; </i>In remembrance of Allah there is great virtue, including:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Reminding Others to Remember Allah:</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Most Glorified, the Most High says: &#8220;Therefore remember Me (by praying, glorifying). I will remember you, and be grateful to Me (for My countless Favors on you) and never be ungrateful to Me. &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He inspired the Prophet (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam) to say: <i>&#8220;Shall I not inform you about the best of your deeds with Allah and the purest of them with your King and the highest of them in status for you, which are better for you than spending gold and silver in charity and better than meeting your enemy and cutting off their heads, while they also cut off yours?&#8221; They said &#8220;Certainly, oh, Messenger of Allah!&#8221; He said: &#8220;It is remembrance of Allah, the All-Mighty, the All Powerful.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam) also said: <i>&#8220;The likeness of one who remembers Allah and one who does not remember Allah is as the likeness of the living and the dead.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It repels Satan and pleases the Most Gracious, according to the Words of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam): <i>&#8220;Whenever a people sit in a meeting-place and remember Allah, they are surrounded by angels and enveloped in mercy, and tranquility descends upon them as they remember Allah; and Allah makes mention of them to those with Him.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It removes Anxiety and Sadness and enlightens the Heart and brings Peace and Tranquility to it, according to the Words of Allah, the Most High: <i>&#8220;Those who believed (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism), and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of Allah verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It strengthens the Heart and the Body, according to the Words of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam) to His Daughter, Fatimah and &#8216;Ali (R). He told them to glorify Allah (i.e., say Subhan Allah) thirty-three times, to praise and thank Allah (i.e., to say Al-Hamdu Lilldh) thirty-three times and to extol Allah (i.e., to say Allahu Akbar) thirty-four times. This was when she (i.e., Fatimah ) asked him for a servant which would help her in her work.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Remembrance of Allah also attracts Sustenance, according to the Words of Allah, the Most High: <i>&#8220;Ask forgiveness from your Lord, verily, He is Oft Forgiving; He will send rain to you in abundance, and give you increase in wealth and children, and bestow on you gardens and bestow on you rivers. &#8220;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Through remembrance of Allah, the hearts live, according to the Saying of Ibn Taimiyyah: Remembrance of Allah for the heart is like water to the fish; and what would the situation of the fish be if it left the water?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Remembrance of Allah causes the One Who remembers Him to be with Him, according to the Hadith Qudsi: <i>&#8220;I am with My slave whenever he remembers me and moves his lips to pronounce My Names.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he spoke the truth who said: &#8220;The heart becomes diseased due to two things: negligence and sin; and it becomes clear due to two things: seeking forgiveness from Allah and remembrance of Allah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Remembrance of Allah, the Slave earns Allah&#8217;s Love, according to the Words of Ibn &#8216;Abbas (R): &#8220;When Moses t went to Mount Sinai, he said: &#8216;Oh, my Lord! Which of Your slaves is most beloved to You?&#8217; He said: &#8220;The one who remembers me and does not forget me.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Remembrance of Allah also opens up the door to knowledge for the slave and protects the tongue from backbiting and tale-bearing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has also been said that it causes the slave to be conscious of Allah&#8217;s Observation of him, which admits him to the door of <i>Ihsan,</i> so that he worships Allah as if he could see Him. It also gives rise to<i> Inabah</i>, which is to return to Allah, the All-Mighty, the All-Powerful. So when a person returns frequently to Allah by remembrance of Him, it will cause him to return to Allah in all circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Remembrance of Allah is the Easiest Act of Worship:</b> It is easy for a person in every place, in every situation and at all times to remember Allah and in spite of this, it is one of the best acts of worship for the movement of the tongue is lighter and easier than the movement of any other part of the body. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the Muslim to take care to accustom his tongue to remembrance of Allah and keep it moist thereby and he should do so in all circumstances, according to the Hadith of &#8216;Aishah : &#8220;The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam), used to remember Allah, the Most High in all circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, we must observe his Sunnah, for there is a supplication and a remembrance of Allah (Dhikr) legislated for every time and every action.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">In the Shade of this Miracle</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It might appear that the weeping of an inanimate object is something strange, but it was a subjugation from Allah in order that the tree trunk should deliver a Message not only for the Companions (R) rather, it was for all mankind, in every time and place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was a message delivered by the tree trunk through Allah&#8217;s Ability to do all things and it announced it in a resounding manner, which echoed: &#8220;La ilaha illallah (none is worthy of worship except Allah).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tree trunk addressed mankind, with a message of complete faith, in that language which purifies the hearts and washes the senses and when humanity understands it, its soul which is wandering in the wilderness will return to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Its message will remain to soften hard hearts, to remind forgetful hearts and to awaken sleeping feelings and to give life to sensations which have died and it will remain to shout out to mankind: The dry, lifeless object cried out for the intimacy and delight which it lost, when the Prophet (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam) passed by it in favor of the new pulpit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The dry, lifeless object was distressed at being far from the Prophet (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam) and alarmed at being parted from him and wished that it should continue. It was as if this dry, lifeless object was declaring to us that we should seek that delight which comes from following the guidance of Al-Mustafa e; and adhering to his Sunnah. And (that it was declaring also) that we should feel distress at being far from it, that we beware of transgress in it, that we should hold fast to it and cling to it by our molar teeth, in order that we might attain closeness to the Prophet and companionship with him, and that the Miracle should remove from us all traces of doubt which might remain present in the hearts of some, regarding the Messenger (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam)</p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 1: Water</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira[1] (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) Said regarding the sea, &#8220;Its water is purifying and its dead (animals) are lawful (to eat)&#8221;.<br />
[Al-Arba&#8217;a[2] and Ibn Abu Shaiba reported it, version is of the latter. Ibn Khuzaima and At-Tirmidhi graded it Sahih (sound). Malik, Ash-Shafi’i and Ahmad reported it].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri[3] (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Water is purer[4] and nothing can make it impure.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Ath-Thalatha[5], and Ahmad graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Umama Al-Bahili[6] (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Water cannot be rendered impure by anything except something which changes its smell, taste and color[7]&#8221;.<br />
[Ibn Majah reported it and Abu Hatim described it as Da&#8217;if (weak)]. And Al-Baihaqi reported: &#8220;Water is pure unless any impure thing is added which changes its smell, taste and color.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar[8] (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;If there is enough water to fill two pots (Qulla)[9], it carries no impurity.&#8221; Another version has: &#8220;it does not become unclean&#8221;.<br />
[AI-Arba&#8217;a reported it. Ibn Khuzaima, Ibn Hibban and Al-Hakim graded it Sahih (sound)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), said, &#8220;None of you should take bath in stagnant water when he is sexually impure.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim reported it].<br />
Another version of Al-Bukhari has: &#8220;None of you should urinate in stagnant water that is not flowing, then take bath in it.[10] &#8220;A version of Muslim has the words: &#8220;from it (i.e. the water)&#8221;.<br />
A version of Abu Da’ud has: &#8220;One should not take bath in it from sexual impurity.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man[11] who accompanied the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) narrated: Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) forbade a woman to bathe with the water left over by a man, and that a man should not bathe with the water left over by a woman, (and instead) they should both take scoopfuls of the water together.<br />
[Reported by Abu Da’ud and An-Nasa’i and its chain of narrators is Sahih (authentic)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas (رضي الله عنه)[12]: The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to bath with the water left over by Maimuna (رضي الله عنه) [Muslim reported it]. And Ashab As-Sunan (compilers of the Prophet&#8217;s sayings) reported that one of the wives of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) took bath from a vessel, then came the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and when he wanted to take bath from that (vessel), she[13] said, &#8220;I was sexually impure.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Water does not become sexually impure.&#8221;<br />
[At- Tirmidhi and Ibn Khuzaima graded it Sahih (sound)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said &#8220;The cleansing of the utensil belonging to one of you, after it has been licked by dog, is to wash it seven[14] times, using soil for cleaning at the first time.<br />
[Muslim reported it· Another version has: &#8220;he should spill the contents]&#8221;<br />
Al-Tirmidhi&#8217;s version has: &#8220;using soil at the first or last time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Qadata[15] (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) Said about the cat that, &#8220;It is not unclean, but is one of those who intermingle with you<br />
[Reported by Al-Arba’a[16]. At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Khuzaima graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik[17] رضي الله عنه): A Bedouin came and urinated in one corner of the mosque, and the people shouted at him, but Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) stopped them, and when he finished urinating, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ordered for a bucket of water which was split[18] over it.<br />
[Agreed upon][19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn ‘&#8217;Umar (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) &#8216;said, &#8220;Two types of dead animals and two types of bloods have been made lawful for us, the two types of dead animals are locusts and fish (seafood), while the two types of bloods are the liver and the spleen.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Ahmad and Ibn Majah, and this Hadith has some weakness.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;When a fly falls in the drink of one of you, he should fully dip it and then throw it away because there is disease in one of its wings and cure in the other[20].<br />
[Reported by Al-Bukhari and Abu Da’ud who added: &#8220;It (the fly) protects itself with the diseased wing (by dipping it first in a drink)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Waqid Al-Laithi[21] (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Whatever (portion) is cut off from an animal when it is alive is dead (meat).<br />
[Reported by Abu Da’ud and At-Tirmidhi who graded it Hasan (fair), and this version is of Tirmidhi].</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]           His real name is &#8216;Abdullah or &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Sakhr Ad-Dausi, and was one of the greatest Sahaba (Companions of the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم) and reported the largest number of Ahadith. More than 800 men narrated from him. He became a Muslim in the year of Khaibar (7 H.) and stayed in the company of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) until he (the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم) died. He was appointed a Mufti (scholar of Islamic verdicts) during the caliphate of&#8217; Umar and later became the governor of Al-Madina during the reign of Mawan bin Al-Hakam. He died in 59 H. and was buried at Al-Baqi&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]           The collectors of Hadith: Abu Da’ud, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa&#8217;i and Ibn Majah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]           His name is Sa&#8217;d bin Malik bin Sinan Al-Khazraji Al-Ansari. He was one of the learned Sahaba, reported many Ahadith and gave religious opinions for some time. He died at the beginning of 74H at the age of 86 years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]           It is reported in Ahmad, At-Tirmidhi and Abu Da’ud that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said these words answering a question about the well of Bud&#8217;a, which is located in the vicinity of Al-Madina, and was always filled with filth. This well was situated in a low-lying area and the rainwater would carry all the dirt and garbage into it. These words are certainly about this well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]           The collectors of Hadith: Abu Da&#8217;ud, At-Tirmidhi, and An-Nasa&#8217;i.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]           His name is Suday bin &#8216;Ajlan, one of the Sahaba who reported many Ahadith. He lived in Egypt then moved to Hims (now in Syria) and died there at the age of 81 or 86 years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]           Some of the people remark that water may be less or more in quantity, if filth alters its one quality out of three (its colors, odor and taste), it would become impure. But the proper view in this connection is that if water is less than 227 kilograms (two Qulla) then mere filth makes it impure, whether there is a change in any one of its quality or not, but when water is more than the said quantity, it does not get impure, until there is a change at least in one quality.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]           He was among the most ascetic and most knowledgeable Sahaba. He became a Muslim at Makka while a small boy, and mi grated to Al-Medina. He first participated in the battle of Al-Khandaq, died in 73AH, and was buried at Dhi Tuwa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]           <i>Qulla</i> is a large earthen pot, which may contain water up to two and a half water-skins, viz., and one hundred and thirteen kilograms.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]         It means less quantity of water; if water is in abundance, it will be regarded as flowing water, which is not an impure one and is good for bathing. It has been prohibited to urinate in the stagnant water on the ground that one may not make it a habit and pollute the water. Condition of the stagnant water is only because flowing water is always clean and never becomes impure, even dirt and filth do not make it impure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]         This man is one of the Sahaba, and failure to mention his name does not harm because the Sahaba are all trust worthy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12]         He is ‘Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas bin &#8216;Abdul-Muttalib, the Prophet&#8217;s cousin and the scholar of the Muslim Ummah. He was born 3 years before Al-Hijra and died at Ta&#8217;if in 67 AH.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13]         This Hadith apparently seems to be in contradiction with the first, but actually it is not, because the order is not of absolute prohibition, but is only of suggestive prohibition to avoid any trace of impurity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14]         It must be clear that just to clean a thing from impurity, it is not necessary to wash a for seven times. The philosophy of cleaning a thing for seven times is different from that of simple purification. Physicians of today say that mostly in the intestines of dogs there are germs and small worms approximately 4 mm. in length, and these move out from intestines with the excrement and stick to the hair around the anus· When dogs clean this place with tongue, it gets soiled with these organisms If a dog licks a pot or someone kisses the dog, as the European and American ladies do, these ate transferred from dog to the pot or to the mouth of the woman and then to the stomach These organisms keep on moving, and penetrate into blood cells causing many fatal diseases· As the detection of these germs is not possible without microscopic tests, the Shari&#8217;a (Islamic law) declared the dog&#8217;s saliva an inherently impure thing by a general command, and whatever a thing is polluted with dog&#8217;s saliva, must be cleaned seven times (which in one time should be with the soil) to be sure of its purity. For more details please see the footnotes of the book Ahkam-ul-Ahsan, Sharh Umdat-ul-Ahkam].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15]         He is Al-Harith bin Rib&#8217;i Al-Ansari, the prophet&#8217;s horseman. He fought the battle of Uhud and those, which followed. It is said he died at Al-Madina or Kufa in 54H</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16]         Abu Da’ud, Tirmidhi, Nasa’i and Ibn Majah·</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17]         He was the Prophet’s servant from the time he came to Al-Madina till his death. He is known as Abu Hamza and was Khazraji· He lived in Basra during Umar&#8217;s Caliphate and died in it at the age of 99 or 103 years in 91 or 92 or 93 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18]         This Hadith proves that earth gets pure when dried up, as Ibn Abi Shaiba has narrated, specially when you let the water flow over the spot.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19]         Al-Bukhari and Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20]         It is evident from this Hadith that if a fly drops into water or syrup, it will not become impure, and the creatures of this family who&#8217;s blood does not flow, like mosquito, wasp and spider, etc, do not make the water impure if fallen or died into it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[21]         His name is Al-Harith bin &#8216;Auf and is a descendant of Banu &#8216;Aamir bin Laith. He became a Muslim very early and is counted among the people of Al-Madina. It is said that he fought at Badr, lived in Makka and died in it in 65H or 68H at the age· of 57 and was buried at Funj.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 2: Utensils</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman[1] (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Do not drink in silver or gold utensils, and do not eat in plates of such metals,[2] for such things are for them (the disbelievers) in this worldly life and for you in the Hereafter.&#8221;<br />
[Agreed upon][3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Umm Salama[4] (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم)· Said, &#8220;He who drinks in a silver utensil is only swallowing Hell-fire in his stomach.&#8221;<br />
[Agreed upon].</p>

[Reported by Muslim]<br />
AI-Arba &#8216;a have the words: &#8220;Any skiI1 that is tanned…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salama bin Al-Muhabbiq[6] (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;The tanning of a dead animal&#8217;s skin purifies it.&#8221;<br />
[Ibn Hibban graded it Sahih (sound)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Maimuna (رضي الله عنه): Some people dragging a (dead) goat passed by the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). He told them, &#8220;Had you better taken its skin.” They said, &#8220;It is dead&#8221;. He said, &#8220;Water and the leaves of the Acacia tree will purify it.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Abu Da’ud and An-Nasa’i].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Tha’laba Al-Khushni[7] (رضي الله عنه): I said, &#8220;O Allah’s Messenger! We are living in a land inhabited by the people of the Scriptures, can we take our meals in their utensils?&#8221; He said, &#8220;If you can get utensils other than theirs, do not eat in theirs[8] but if you cannot get other than theirs, wash them and eat in them.&#8221;<br />
[Agreed upon].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Imran bin Husain[9] (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and his Companions performed Wudu (ablution) from a skin water container[10] belonging to a polytheist woman.<br />
[Agreed upon]. (It is an extract of a long Hadith)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik (رضي الله عنه): When the cup of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) got broken, he fixed it with a silver wire[11] at the crack.<br />
[Reported by Al-Bukhari]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]           He is nicknamed Abu Abdullah, both him and his father were Sahaba and he became famous for being the confidant of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) He died at Midian (Madain) forty nights after the killing of &#8216;Uthman in the year 35H or 36 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]           This Hadith is mentioned here with a purpose to clarify that if it is prohibited to eat and drink in gold and silver utensils, then performing ablution is also prohibited with using gold and silver utensils, otherwise this Hadith would have been placed in the chapter of eating and drinking Eating, drinking and performing ablution in utensils studded with rubies and diamonds is permissible</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]           Al-Bukhari and Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]           She is Hind bint Abu &#8216;Umaiya. She was married to Abu Salama, she immigrated with him to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and came with him to Al-Madina When Abu Salama died from an injury, he had sustained during the battle of Uhud the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) married her in Shawwal 4 H· It is said that she died in 59H or 62 H at the age of 84 years and was buried at Al-Baqi&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]           This Hadith approves that a hide, after tanning becomes pure and clean, may be the hide is of an animal which is (haram) prohibited to eat or (halal) lawful to eat and whether the animal is slaughtered or died. But the skins of human beings and some of the animals are unlawful and not permitted for use. The skin of man is unlawful due to his sacredness and reverence and the skins of animals like dog and pig are unlawful and not permitted for use because they are inherently impure and unclean. It should also be remembered that hair, teeth and horns of permitted animals are also lawful for use and trade.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]           He is nicknamed Abu Sinan of Hudhali tribe. He is considered as a resident of Basra and Al-Hasan Al-Basri took the Hadith from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]           He is a Sahabi (Companion of the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم.) descending from Khushain bin An-Nimir of Quda&#8217;a tribe. He was one of the Ashab Ash-Shajara who entered a covenant with the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) on the day of Al-Hudaibiya. He was sent to his people and they accepted Islam. He settled in Sham and died there in 75H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]           This Hadith makes it clear that if the utensils from a Muslim are available then the utensils of a non-Muslim should not be used for eating, drinking or cooking. If it is certain about a non-Muslim that he does not eat something unlawful or prohibited, then his utensils may be used, but even then one should be careful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]           He is nicknamed Abu Nujeid and is from the Khuza&#8217;a tribe. He accepted Islam in the year of Khaibar. He settled in Basra and died there in 52H or 53H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]         This Hadith clarifies that such utensils of the polytheists may be used without any hesitations, about which there is no probability of being impure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]         This Hadith proves that if this much amount of gold or silver is present m any utensil, then making ablution with it or eating and drinking in it is not prohibited.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 3: The Nature and Cleansing of An-Najasah</h2>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">(The Impurities)</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was asked about making vinegar out of wine. He said, &#8220;No (it is prohibited)&#8221;.[1]<br />
[Reported by Muslim, and At-Tirmidhi and the latter graded it Hasan-Sahih (fair and sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated (Anas bin Malik) (رضي الله عنه): On the day of Khaibar, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) commanded Abu Talha[2] to announce: &#8220;Allah and His Messenger have prohibited for you (eating of) the flesh of the donkeys, for it is unclean.&#8221;[3]<br />
[Agreed upon.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amr bin Kharija[4] (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) delivered a Khutba (religious talk) to us at Mina while mounted on his camel and its saliva was pouring on my[5] shoulders.<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha[6] (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to wash the semen[7] and then go out for prayer in that (very) garment, and I could still see the trace of the washing on it.<br />
[Agreed upon].<br />
In the version of Muslim: &#8220;I used to scrape it (the semen) off the garment of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and then he offered prayer with it.&#8221;<br />
In yet another version of Muslim: &#8220;Verily! I (&#8216;Aisha) used to scrape it (the semen) off his garment with my nails while it was dry&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu As-Samh[8] (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;The urine of a baby girl should be washed off and the urine of a baby boy should be sprinkled[9] with water).&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud and An-Nasa’i and Al-Hakim graded it Sahih (sound)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr[10] (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said regarding menstruation blood that smears a garment, &#8220;She should scrape it, rub it with water, then wash it and then she may pray in it&#8221;.<br />
[Agreed upon].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Khaula[11] said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, suppose the (trace of) the blood does not go?&#8221; He said, &#8220;(Washing it with) water will suffice you and its trace won&#8217;t harm you.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by At- Tirmidhi, and its <i>Sanad</i> (chain of narrators) is weak].</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]           Making of vinegar from wine by adding something in it is prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]           He is Zaid bin Sahl bin Al-Aswad bin Haram Al-Ansari An-Najari who was one of the senior Sahaba. He attended the &#8216;Aqaba Covenant and all the battles. He fought bravely during the battle of Uhud and defended the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) till his hand got paralyzed. He also killed 20 men in the battle of Hunain. He died in the year 34 H. or 51 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]           Leftover water of a donkey is pure and usable</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]           He is &#8216;Amr bin Kharija bin Al-Muntafiq Al-Asadi. He was an ally of Abu Sufyan. He is regarded as being from the clan of Al-Ash&#8217;ar. He is among the Sahaba who settled in Sham and this Hadith was reported by the people of Basra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]           From this Hadith we come to know that the saliva of a Halal [lawful to eat] animal is also pure. This Hadith was approved by the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]           She is the daughter of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq and the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) married her 2 years before the Hijra in the month of Shawwal, but wedded her in 1 H. at the age of9 years. She was very learned and reported many Ahadith. She died on 17 Ramadan 57 H or 58 H. Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه) offered her Funeral prayer and she was buried at Al-Baqi&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]           There is a difference of opinion concerning the human semen, whether it is impure or not. Some religious elites consider it like saliva or nasal secretion, and according to others it is necessary to wash it. Former group gives its reason from the Hadith of scraping it when dried, and the latter group argues from the Hadith of washing the semen. In fact, semen is impure and it must be cleaned by washing, scraping, rubbing or wiping. (See the book Nail-ul-Autar by Imam Shaukani)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]           His name is Iyya’d. He was a manumitted slave and servant of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). Ibn Abdul-Bar said that he was reported to be lost and nobody knew where he died.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]           It means that there is difference in the urine of a boy and a girl. In the suckling period, girl&#8217;s urine is more impure than the boy&#8217;s urine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]         She is the mother of&#8217; Abdullah bin Az-Zubair and the elder sister of&#8217; Aisha. She became a Muslim very early in Makka and migrated to Al-Madina. She died less than a month after the killing of her son Ibn Az-Zubair in 73H at the age of about 100 years, yet she neither lost a tooth nor had any mental problem.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]         Khaula bint Yasar was a Sahabiya and Abu Salama bin &#8216;Abdur-Rahman narrated the Hadith from her.</p>

Thereafter he washed his right hand up to his elbow three times[4] then the left one likewise, then he passed wet hands on his head. Then he washed his right foot up to the ankle three times, then the left one likewise.

[Agreed upon. This is Muslim&#8217;s version]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">36.  Narrated Laqit bin Sabra (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Perform a perfect Wudu (ablution), run (your fingers) through the fingers of the hands and the toes[13], and if not fasting, sniff water up well inside the nose.&#8221;<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">52.  Narrated Umar[33] (رضي الله عنه): &#8216;Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;If one after performing ablution completely recites the following supplication: (<i>Ash-hadu an la ilaha ill-Allau wahdahu 1a sharika lahu, wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan &#8216;abduhu wa Rasuluhu</i>) &#8216;I testify that there is no one worthy of worship but Allah, He is Alone and has no partner and Muhammad is His slave and Messenger,&#8217; all the eight gates of Paradise will be opened for him and he may enter through any gate he wishes.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Muslim and At-Tirmidhi who added the following words to the supplication: (<i>Allahumma aj &#8216;alni minAl-tawwabina waj&#8217;alni minAl-mutatahhirina</i>) &#8220;Oh Allah! Include me among those who repent and those who keep themselves pure&#8221;]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]           It means that the use of <i>Siwak</i> (tooth cleaning stick from the tree or the toothbrush) with every ablution is Sunna [the way of the noble Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم] and the Hadith reported by Muslim tells us that Siwak should be used before every prayer. It means that if anybody is going to offer prayers with ablution performed previously, even then he should use Siwak. These Ahadith prove extreme emphasis on the constant use of Siwak for the cleaning of teeth. It is Sunna (supererogatory) and not <i>Wajib</i> (compulsory).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]           Humran bin Aban was caught by Khalid bin Al-Walid in a war during Abu Bakr&#8217;s caliphate, and he sent him to serve &#8216;Uthman who freed him. He is trustworthy of the 2nd grade in the reporting of Ahadith. He died in 75 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]           The third Guided Caliph. He accepted Islam early and married Ruqaiya and then Umm Kulthum, daughters of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and was therefore nicknamed Dhun-Nuirain (the possessor of the two lights, i.e. the daughters of the Prophet h صلى الله عليه و سلم). He was killed as a martyr on Friday, 18th Dhul Hijja, 35H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]           In this Hadith washing of face, hands and feet is stated to be done three times each, whereas in others, two times and one time washing is regarded as enough. Imam Nawawi has written the consensus of opinions that washing once is Fard (obligatory).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]           The fourth Guided Caliph. He fought all the battles except Tabuk, for the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) had left him as in charge in Al-Madina. An evildoer called &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Muljam killed him as a martyr on Friday morning 17th Ramadan 40 H. at Kufa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]           It means that wiping of head (doing Mash) only once is obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]           He was an Ansari belonging to Bani Mazin from An-Najar clan. He fought at Uhud and killed Musailima Al-Kadhdhab together with Wahshi on Al-Yamama Day. He was killed on the day of Al-Harrah in 63 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]           This Hadith tells us that <i>Mash</i> (wiping) of head should be started from the front.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]           He is the son of&#8217; Amr bin Al&#8217;-Aas Al-Qurashi. He became a Muslim before his father who was older than him by 13 years. He was an Aalim (learned), memorized Ahadith and was very pious. He died in the 63 H. or 70 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]         It means that ears are to be wiped internally and externally. The side close to the head is external and near the face is internal. Tirmidhi after narrating the Hadith concerning wiping of ears internally and externally, says that religious scholars follow the same practice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]         Spending the night of Satan inside the nostrils of a man is plausible, but its actual state is better known to Allah and His Messenger. May be this is a figurative expression, because bad excretions gather in the nose and cause laziness, indolence, slackness and negligence. All these states are satanic dispositions</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12]         It means that hands should not be dipped in the ablution water container, as the word &#8216;ablution&#8217; is present in some of the Ahadith narrated by Bukhari. Allamah Ibn Hajar, in his book Fath Al-Bari, says: Though this Hadith apparently seems to be related with the utensils of ablution but it includes all other utensils and bathing water containers. But if there is a big pool or tank of water then it is permissible to put hands in it</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13]         It means that the fingers of hands and feet should be washed completely and carefully.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14]         Abu Da’ud, Tirmidhi, Nasa’i and Ibn Majah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15]         During the performance of ablution, combing of beard with fingers is Sunnah (supererogatory) and not Wajib (compulsory).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16]         In some Ahadith, a full Mudd has been mentioned. One Mudd is a little more than six hundred grams. This is the least quantity of water mentioned for ablution; otherwise it will be very difficult to perform ablution with small amount of water. Maximum limit of water has not been ordained, any amount of water may be used for ablution and bath, but water should not be wasted</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17]         It may have more than one meaning. It may mean washing of limbs more than the minimum limits, for example, washing of hands up to shoulders and washing of feet up to knees; Abu Huraira رضي الله عنه assumes this meaning. It may also mean that every limb should be washed three times, instead of washing it for one time &#8212; the minimum limit for washing. It may also mean to perform ablution again and again or to remain with ablution all the time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18]         This mode of action of the noble Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم was for noble actions, for other actions like coming out of mosque and entering a toilet etc., one should put his left feet first.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19]         Abu Da’ud, Tirmidhi, Nasa’i and Ibn Majah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20]         Abu Abdullah or Abu Iesa, Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba bin Mas&#8217;ud Ath-Thaqafi was a prominent Sahabi. He became a Muslim in the year of the Khandaq (trench) and migrated. He first participated in Al-Hudaibiya. He died in 50 H. in Kufa</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[21]         This Hadith makes it clear that wiping over turban (cap) is also correct. There are two forms of it. First, to wipe partly on the turban and partly on the head. There is no difference of opinion on this form of action. Secondly, to wipe only on turban. There is a difference of opinion on this, but this is also proved by Sahih Hadith narrated by Tirmidhi</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[22]         Jabir was an Ansari from Sulami clan and he was nicknamed Abu &#8216;Abdullah. He was among the eminent Sahaba. He fought at Badr though some said that he did not witness neither Badr nor Uhud, but took part in those battles that followed them. He was also at Siffin. He was among the memorizers of many Ahadith. He became blind towards the end of his life, and died in 74 H at the age of 94 years. It is reported that he was the last Sahabi to die at Al-Madina.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[23]         Noble Quran has mentioned As-Safa in the first place between As-Safa and Al-Marwa. The</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) Started Sa&#8217;i (running between the Safa and Marwa during Hajj and &#8216;Umrah) from the Safa side, so start ablution in the same manner, starting from washing of the face, then hands up to elbows; then wipe the head and wash the feet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[24]         In this Hadith the word (bada) has been used in Arabic text, in the sense of giving information instead of order</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[25]         In this regard, there exist contradictory Ahadith, which indicate opposing views about saying (Bismillah) before performing ablution. Correct answer of this issue is to say <i>Bismillah</i> is Sunna.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[26]         He is Sa&#8217;id bin Zaid bin &#8216;Amr Al-Qurashi, nicknamed Abu Al-A&#8217;war and is one of the ten who were promised Paradise. He accepted Islam very early and was married to Fatima, the sister of &#8216;Umar, and they were both instrumental to &#8216;Umar becoming a Muslim. He fought all the battles except Badr, because he was away looking for the caravan. He died in 51 H. and was buried at Al-Baqi&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[27]         He is Abu Muhammad or Abu &#8216;Abdullah Talha bin Musarrif. He was a reliable Tabi&#8217;i (see glossary) of the 5th grade. He was a righteous reciter of the Quran, and died in 112 H. His father Musarrif is unknown and that has made this Hadith Da&#8217;if</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[28]         He is called Ka&#8217;b bin &#8216;Amr or Amr bin Ka&#8217;b bin Juhdub Al-Yami &#8212; descending from a Yamani tribe called Yam of Hamadan. Ibn &#8216;Abdul-Bar said he (Ka&#8217;b) settled in Kufa and is a Sahabi.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[29]         It means that the noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), used to take water separately for cleaning the nose and rinsing the mouth. According to the author, this Hadith is Da&#8217;if (weak). According to Al-Bukhari and Muslim, the noble Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم used a single handful of water for cleaning the nose and rinsing the mouth. Imam Nawawi has stated its five forms and regarded sound the one, Al-Bukhari and Muslim has stated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[30]         This Hadith makes it clear that washing of the whole foot is obligatory. In a Hadith recorded by Muslim, it is stated that it is Fire for that part of the foot, which is dry. In this Hadith, there is repudiation for those who consider the Mash (wiping) of foot as proper and acceptable; or those who consider the Mash (wiping) and Ghusl (washing) both compulsory; or those who consider Mash and Ghusl both permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[31]         One Mudd is equal to six hundred grams approx., and one Sa&#8217; is equal to a little more than two and a half kilograms, and this is the least quantity to be used. It means that one should be very careful in the use of water.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[32]         One Sa &#8216; is equivalent to 4 Mudd or 2660 grams</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[33]         The second Guided Caliph who was unique throughout history. He filled the world with wisdom, justice and conquests. He was Qurash&#8217;s ambassador during the <i>Jahiliya</i> (ignorance) period. He accepted Islam in Dhul Hijja, the 6th year of the Prophet-hood and fought all the battles. He made conquests in Iraq, Persia, Sham, Egypt and other places. He was killed by Abu Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;a, a slave of Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba and died as a martyr on 1st Muharram 24H.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 5: Mash (Wiping) Over Khuffain<br />
(Two Leather Socks)</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba (رضي الله عنه): Once I was in the company of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), he then performed ablution and I dashed to take off his socks (Khuffain). He said, &#8220;Leave them for I had put them on after performing ablution[1].&#8221; So he wiped over them.<br />
[Agreed upon].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Al-Arba’a except An-Nasa’i: The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) wiped over the upper part of the leather socks and the under part of it.<br />
[In its chain of narrators there is weakness]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali (رضي الله عنه): If the religion were based on opinion,[2] it would be more important to wipe over the under parts of the leather socks than the upper, but I have seen Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) wiping over the upper parts of his leather socks.<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud with good Isnad (chain of narrators)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Safwan bin &#8216;Assal[3] (رضي الله عنه): When we were on a journey,[4] the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to command us to wear our leather socks for three days and three nights,[5] whether we had to answer the call of nature or slept. However, in case of ejaculation or sexual impurity, he commanded us to remove the leather socks.<br />
[Reported by An-Nasa&#8217;i and At-Tirmidhi, version is of the latter. With them Ibn Khuzaima graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) fixed the period of Mash (wiping) over the leather socks (Khuffain &#8212; plural of Khuff) for three days and nights for a traveler and one day and a night for the resident person in a town<br />
[Reported by Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Thawban[6] (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) sent out a military expedition and commanded them to wipe over the turbans[7] and leather socks.<br />
[Reported by Ahmad and Abu Da’ud. Al-Hakim graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Umar (رضي الله عنه) in a Mawquf (untraceable) and Anas in a Marfu &#8216; (traceable) Hadith: &#8220;If one of you performs ablution and puts on his two leather socks, let him perform Mash (wipe) over them (with water) and pray in them, and he may not take them off if he so wishes[8] except after ejaculation or sexual impurity.<br />
[Reported by Ad-Daraqutni and Al-Hakim and graded Sahih (sound) by him]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra[9] (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) gave permission for the traveler to perform Mash (wiping) over his leather socks for three days and nights and for a non-traveler for a day and a night, if he had put them on in a state of purity.<br />
[Reported by Ad-Daraqutni, and graded Sahih (sound) by Ibn Khuzaima]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ubai bin &#8216;Imara[10] (رضي الله عنه): I asked, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, may I wipe over the Khuffain (leather socks)?&#8221; The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) replied, &#8220;Yes&#8221;. I asked, &#8220;For one day?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;For one day&#8221;. I again asked, &#8220;And for two days?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;For two days too&#8221;. I again asked, &#8220;And for three days?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes, as long as you wish&#8221;.[11]<br />
[Reported by Abu Da’ud, who said, &#8220;It is not strong.&#8221;[12]]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]           Mash (wiping) over the socks is conditioned. One should have put on the socks after performing ablution, if socks have been worn without performing an ablution then wiping over the socks is not permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]           It means that the religious commands and prohibitions are based on Revelation and not on prudence. One cannot accept or reject the orders on their comprehension or incomprehension. It does not mean that the commands and prohibitions of religion are against the intellect and wisdom. It also proves that in the presence of a Sahih (authentic and sound) Hadith, giving a verdict against it is not allowed, that is why it has been clarified in Islamic Jurisprudence and its principles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]           Safwan bin ‘Assal Al-Muradi Al-Jumali was a well-known Sahabi who had accompanied the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in twelve Ghazwat (expeditions). He settled at Kufa and it is said that among the Sahaba, only &#8216;Abdullah bin Mas’ud reported a Hadith from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]           Mash (wiping) over the socks is right, and permitted by Ahadith. There are more than eighty (80) Companions of the noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) who have narrated and spoke about this topic. &#8216;Ashra-e-Mubashshara (ten most pious companions of the noble Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم, who were given the glad tiding of Paradise in this world) are also included in the list of reporters. Ibn &#8216;Abdul-Barr has related the consensus of opinion concerning this issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]           It means that Mash (wiping) is allowed for a traveler up to three days and for a resident up to thirty-four hours. The time period for Mash starts from the nullification of ablution and not from the time of wearing the socks. The way of carrying out Mash (wiping) is to soak the hands with water and starting from the fingers, drawing it up to the calf of the leg. After the completion of permitted time and by passing of the wind, urine, etc., Mash nullifies, and is also cancelled by all those things, which cancel or nullify the ablution.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]           He is Thawban bin Bujdud bin Jahdar, who was nicknamed Abu &#8216;Abdullah. He was an inhabitant of As-Surat, which is a place between Makka and Al-Madina. It was also said that he was from Himyar. He stayed with the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) throughout his life, then settled in Sham and later on moved to Hims, in which he died in 54 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]           In Arabic text the word Asa&#8217;ib stands for a bandage, which is used for dressing of wounds; or in case of broken leg or arm, over the wooden strips around the broken bone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]           ‘If he so wishes&#8217; means within the permitted time for Mash (wiping). After the completion of Mash time, it is a must to take off the socks and perform ablution afresh and wash the feet too and put on the socks again then the time for Mash will start anew.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]           His name is Nufai&#8217; bin Al-Harith or bin Al-Masuh. He descended from Ta&#8217;if Fort together with a group of slaves and became a Muslim, whereupon the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) freed him. He was among the virtuous Sahaba and died at Basra in 51 H or 52 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]         Ubai bin &#8216;Imara was a Sahabi from the Ansar of Al-Madina. He settled in Egypt. Ibn Hibban said, &#8220;He prayed to the two Qiblah, but I do not take his report as a complete chain of narrators.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]         Sanad (transmitted chain) of this Hadith is not sound. That Hadith in which the period of one day (twenty-four hours) for a resident and three days for a traveler is granted is sound.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12]         This Hadith was not taken as evidence for its weakness and for contradicting the sound and good Hadith that fixed the durations. An-Nawawi has mentioned in Sharh Al- Muhadhdhab that the Imam have agreed on the weakness of this Hadith and Ahmad said, &#8221; Its narrators are unknown.&#8221;</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 6: The Nullification[1] of Wudu (Ablution)</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas (رضي الله عنه): The Companions of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in his lifetime used to wait for the &#8216;<i>Isha</i> (night) prayer, so much so that their heads were lowered down (by dozing)[2]. They would then pray without performing ablution.[3]<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud and Ad- Daraqutni graded it Sahih (sound). Its origin is in Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Fatima bint Abu Hubaish[4] came to the Prophet r (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, I am a woman whose blood keeps flowing (even after the menstruation period).[5] I am never purified; should I, therefore, stop praying?&#8221; He (the Prophet) said, &#8220;No, for that is only a vein, and is not menstruation. So when the menstruation comes, abstain from prayers, and when it ends, wash the blood from your self and then pray.&#8221;<br />
[Agreed upon].<br />
Al-Bukhari’s version adds: &#8220;Then perform ablution for every prayer,&#8221;[6] and Muslim admitted that he dropped this addition deliberately.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib (رضي الله عنه): I was one whose <i>Madhi</i> (urethral discharge)[7] flowed readily and asked Miqdad[8] to ask the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) about it. He (the Prophet) said: &#8220;One should perform Wudu (ablution) in this case.&#8221;<br />
[Agreed upon and this is Al-Bukhari&#8217;s version]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) kissed[9] one of his wives and went to pray without performing (fresh) ablution.<br />
[Reported by Ahmad, and Al-Bukhari graded it Da’if (weak)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;If one of you feels disturbance in his stomach and doubts whether he has released some air or not, then he should not leave the mosque unless he hears its sound or smells (its) odor.[10]&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Talq bin &#8216;Ali[11] (رضي الله عنه): A man said: &#8220;I touched my penis&#8221; or he said, &#8220;Does a man who touch his penis during the prayer should perform <i>Wudu</i> (ablution)?&#8221; The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), replied, &#8220;No, it is only a part of your body.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Al-Khamsa[12]. Ibn Hibban graded it Sahih (sound) and Ibn Al-Madini said, &#8220;It is better than the Hadith of Busra&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Busra bint Safwan[13] (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;He who touches his penis should perform ablution.&#8221;[14]<br />
[Reported by Al-Khamsa, and At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Hibban graded it Sahih (sound), and Al-Bukhari said, &#8220;It is the most authentic (Hadith) in this chapter&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Whoever vomits, bleeds through the nose[15], or releases <i>Madhi</i>(urethral discharge) should go, perform ablution and then complete his <i>Salat</i> (prayer)[16] (by continuing from where he had stopped at) on condition that he does not speak in the process.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Ibn Majah, and Ahmad and others graded it Da&#8217;if].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin Samura[17] (رضي الله عنه): A man asked the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), &#8220;Should I perform ablution after eating mutton?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;If you wish so&#8221;, he then asked, &#8220;Should I perform ablution after eating camel meat?[18] He(صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &#8220;Whoever washes a dead person[19] should take a bath (thereafter); and whoever carries it should perform ablution.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Ahmad, An-Nasa’i and At-Tirmidhi who graded it Hasan (fair). And Ahmad said that there is no authentic <i>Hadith</i> in this chapter]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah bin Abu &#8216;Bakr[20] (رضي الله عنه): The book written by Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) for &#8216;Amr bin Hazm[21] also contained: &#8220;None except a pure person should touch the Quran[22].<br />
[Reported by Malik as a <i>Mursal</i> and by An-Nasa’i and Ibn Hibban as <i>Mawsul</i>. And it is graded as <i>Ma&#8217;lul</i> (defective)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to mention A11ah&#8217;s Name (praise Him) at all times.[23]<br />
[Reported by Muslim and Al-Bukhari recorded it as Mu&#8217;allaq (suspended)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) had blood extracted from his body[24] and offered the prayer and did not perform (a new) ablution.<br />
[Reported by Ad-Daraqutni who graded it Da’if (weak)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Mu’awiya[25] (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;The eye (when awake) is the string of anus (to stop air escaping), and if the two eyes sleep the string is untied.&#8221;[26]<br />
[Reported by Ahmad and At-Tabardni who added, &#8220;Whoever sleeps should perform ablution.]&#8221; Also reported by Abu Da’ud mentioning the above addition without the words &#8220;the string is untied&#8221;, but both versions are weak]. And Ibn &#8216;Abbas (رضي الله عنه), narrated in a <i>Marfu&#8217;</i> (traceable) Hadith that: &#8220;Ablution is necessary for one who sleeps while he is lying flat[27].&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud and there is weakness in its chain of narrators]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Satan comes to one of you in Salat (prayer) and blows air in his bottom, so he imagines that he has released air yet he did not. So if he gets that feeling he should not leave his prayer unless he hears the sound (of the air) or smells its odor.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Al-Bazzar] . It is originally from the <i>Sahihain</i> of Bukhari and Muslim as the Hadith narrated by &#8216;Abdullah bin Zaid. And Muslim reported by Abu Huraira likewise. And Abu Sa&#8217;id narrated in a Marfu&#8217; Hadith: &#8220;If Satan comes to one of you and says: &#8216;You have nullified your ablution (by releasing air)&#8217;, let him say: &#8216;You have lied.'&#8221; [Reported by Al-Hakim]. Ibn Hibban also reported the above Hadith with the version: &#8220;Let him say in his heart&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]           All those causes which invalidate the Wudu (ablution) also invalidate the <i>Tayammum </i>(purification with clean soil in case the water is not available).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]           It proves that ablution is not cancelled by dozing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]           Sleep invalidates the ablution or not, is a controversial issue. In this matter final decision is that with a sound sleep ablution is nullified, otherwise not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]           Fatima bint Abu Hubaish is a <i>Sahabiya</i> from <i>Quraish</i> and then <i>Asad</i>. Her father is Qais bin &#8216;Abdul-Muttalib bin Asad bin &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Uzza bin Qusai. She was a renowned <i>Muhajira</i> and was married to &#8216;Abdullah bin Jahsh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]           Vaginal bleeding is of three types: 1) <i>Haid</i> &#8211; Blood of regular monthly menstrual course which starts at the age of puberty. This type of blood ceases during the period of pregnancy. 2) <i>Nifas</i> &#8211; Puerperal blood coming after the childbirth, it lasts maximum for forty days. 3) <i>Istihada</i> &#8211; The blood which may happen to come differently from the above two types. Here it means the last mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]           It means that the <i>Istihada</i> blood invalidates the ablution, that is why the noble Prophet (PUH), ordered to perform a fresh ablution for every prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]           Madhi is a white water like lubricant, which oozes out involuntarily at the time of sexual desire. This urethral discharge invalidates the ablution, but is not a cause for obligatory bath</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]           Miqdad bin &#8216;Amr bin Tha&#8217;laba Al-Bahrani was nicknamed Abul-Aswad or Abu &#8216;Amr and is known as Al-Miqdad bin Al-Aswad. Al-Aswad bin Yaghuth Az-Zuhri had fostered and entered into a defense agreement with Miqdad in the Jahiliya days. He was among the virtuous, wise and eminent Sahaba. He was the sixth Muslim, made the two migrations and attended all the major battles. He was a horseman during Badr and participated in the conquest of Egypt. He died at the age of 70 in 33 H. at Al-Jauf, three miles from Al- Madina so he was carried to Al-Madina, &#8216;Uthman offered his Funeral prayer, and was buried at Al-Baqi&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]           This Hadith confirms that ablution is not cancelled by touching a woman with or without lust. This is supported by a reporting of Imam Bukhari narrated by &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was praying in the darkness and I was laying at rest while my feet were at the place where the Prophet prostrated (on his prayer mat). At the time of prostration he would touch my feet and I would remove them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]         This Hadith points out an important principle that everything remains at its command until there is something certain against it. Suspicion carries no weight, whether one is in prayer or not</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]         He is Abi Ali Talq bin Ali bin Talq bin &#8216;Amr Al-Hanafi As-Siheimi Al-Yamami. He visited the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) as soon as he arrived at Al-Madina and worked with him in building the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12]         Ahmad, Abu Da’ud, Tirmidhi, Nasa’i and Ibn Majah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13]         Busra bint Safwan bin Naufal bin Asad bin &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Uzza Al-Qurashiya Al-Asadiya was a Sahabiya, among the first Muslims, migrated early and lived till the caliphate of <i>Mu&#8217;awiya</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14]         Foregoing Hadith of Talq bin Ali seems to be contradictory to this, but infect it is not. If the organ is touched uncovered or with lustful intention, then the ablution is nullified, otherwise not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15]         This Hadith is Da’if (weak), and there is no Sahih (sound) Hadith concerning this issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16]         It means that if a man prayed two <i>Rak&#8217;a</i> with the <i>Imam</i> (leader of prayer) and it happens that his ablution is cancelled. He leaves the prayer and after making a fresh ablution joins again with the <i>Imam</i> in the same part of prayer where he left, then he should finish the prayer with <i>Imam</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17]         He is a famous Sahabi and the son of Sa&#8217;d bin Abi Waqqas&#8217; sister. He settled at Kufa and built a house there. He died in 74 H. or 66 H. His father Samura bin Junada As-Sawai Al. &#8216;Aamiri is also a Sahabi.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18]         Some people mean by this the complete ablution and others mean only the rinsing of mouth. Latter view is correct because the noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) pointed out fat as its cause and fat always sticks in the mouth only.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19]     Concerning this issue there is no authentic Hadith. Some say that bath is compulsory on one who bathes the dead body, some others are of the opinion that it is just desirable; while to others ablution is compulsory, and there are still others who consider it also not necessary.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20]         &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Bakr bin Muhammad bin &#8216;Amr bin Hazm Al-Ansari Al-Madani Al- Qadi was a Tabi&#8217;i of the 5th grade. He died in 135 H. at the age of 70 years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[21]         He is a Khazraji, a Najari and is nicknamed Abu Ad-Dahhak. He first took part in Al-Khandaq and the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) sent him to Najran to teach the people about the religion and collect their <i>Sadaqat</i>. He wrote for them a book containing the obligatory and voluntary acts, the <i>Sadaqat</i> and the blood wit, and this is the book mentioned in the Hadith. He died in Al-Madina after the fifties</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[22]         <i>Hadath</i> <i>Akbar</i> (sexual discharge) and <i>Hadath</i> <i>Asghar</i> (passing wind, urine or defecation) both make the purification due, if Hadath (impurity) is the result of coition then it is unanimously agreed not to touch the noble Quran, but there is a difference of opinion in doing that without ablution.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[23]         The times of answering the call of nature, urination and coition are not included. In the state of being impure by coition, remembrance and pronouncing the Name of Allah is permissible, but touching and reciting the noble Quran is prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[24]         This Hadith clarifies that bleeding except from two (vagina and anus) does not invalidate the ablution. Ahadith of same class have also been narrated by Ibn &#8216;Umar, Ibn &#8216;Abbas and Abi Aufa (رضي الله عنه)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[25]         Both him and his father Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb became Muslims at the conquest of Makka. &#8216;Umar appointed him as the governor of Sham after the death of his brother Yazid bin Abu Sufyan and he remained so until &#8216;Ali came out in order to dispose him by force and he was sworn as the caliph when Al-Hasan stepped down in his favor in the year 40 H. He died in <i>Rajab</i> 60 H. at the age of 78 years</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[26]         It means sleep is a cause of Hadath (impurity) and not Hadath itself</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[27]         It means that sleeping in the flat position results in the invalidation of ablution, whereas in the foregoing Hadith mere sleep is described as the factor of invalidation. Sleeping in the flat position is an indication of sound sleep, when all the organs of body are at rest, it enhances the possibility of uncontrolled passing of wind; while in a light sleep or napping one is not completely unconscious.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 7: The Manners of Answering<br />
the Call of Nature</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to remove his ring[1] when entering the lavatory.<br />
[Reported by Al-Arba&#8217;a[2], and it is defective]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated (Anas) (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) on entering the lavatory used to say[3]: [<i>Alla’humma inni a&#8217;udhu bika minal khubthi wal khaba&#8217;ithi</i>] &#8220;O Allah, I seek refuge with you from devils &#8211; males and females (or all offensive and wicked things, evil deeds and evil spirits, etc.).&#8221;<br />
[Reported by As-Sab&#8217;a].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated (Anas) (رضي الله عنه): Whenever Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) went to the privy, a servant and I used to carry a skin water container and a spear, and he would cleanse himself with the water[4]<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told me, &#8220;Take the skin water container&#8221;, he then went forward till he disappeared[5] from me and relieved himself.<br />
[Agreed upon].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Safeguard your selves from the two matters which cause ac cursing that befalls the one who relieves himself on people&#8217;s path-ways[6] and under the shades.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Muslim]<br />
Narrated Mu’adh[7] (رضي الله عنه): He (the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &#8220;Guard against the three things which cause curse (i.e.) defecating at the watering places, on the roadbeds and in the shades.&#8221;[8]<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud]. Ahmad reported from Ibn Abbas (رضي الله عنه) that defecation is prohibited also at the place where water collects.<br />
[And both the two (i.e. the previous and this Hadith) have weakness.<br />
And Ibn &#8216;Umar (رضي الله عنه) the prohibition of relieving oneself under fruity trees and on the bank of a flowing river.<br />
[Reported by At-Tabardni with a weak chain of narrators]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;When two people go together to relieve themselves they should disappear from each other and do not talk, for Allah detests that.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Ahmad; Ibn As-Sakan and Ibn Al-Qattan graded it Sahih (sound) but &#8216;it is defective[9]].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Qatada (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Nobody should touch his penis with his right hand[10] when urinating, and should not clean himself (from defecation or urine) using his right hand and should not breathe in the utensil (he is drinking from).&#8221;<br />
[Agreed upon. This version is of Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salman[11] (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) forbade us to face the <i>Qiblah</i> when defecating or urinating, or to clean ourselves using the right hand, or to clean ourselves with less than three stones, or to clean ourselves with dung or a bone.<br />
[Reported by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Ayub[12] (رضي الله عنه): (Allah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم said,) &#8220;Neither face nor turn your back to the Qiblah[13] while defecating or urinating, but turn towards the east or the west.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by the As-Sab&#8217;a]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;If anyone goes to relieve himself, he should conceal himself.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated (&#8216;Aisha رضي الله عنه): When the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) came out of the privy, he used to say, &#8220;<i>Ghufra’naka</i> (O Allah! Grant me Your forgiveness).&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Al-Khamsa[14]. Abu Hatim and Al-Hakim graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Mas’ud (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) went out to answer the call of nature and asked me to bring three stones. I found two stones and searched for the third but could not find it. So I took a dried piece of dung and brought it to him. He took the two stones and threw away the dung[15] and said, &#8220;This is a filthy thing&#8221;.<br />
[Reported by Al-Bukhari. And in the version of Ahmad and Ad-Daraqutni it is added: &#8220;Bring me more[16] (something other than dung)&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) forbade us to use a bone or dung for cleaning and said, &#8220;These two things do not purify.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Ad-Daraqutni who graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): A11ah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Beware of (smearing yourselves with) urine, because it is the main cause of punishment in the grave.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Ad-Daraqutni]<br />
and Al-Hakim reported that: &#8220;Urination is the main cause of punishment in the grave&#8221;.<br />
[Its chain of narrators is authentic]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sura’qa bin Malik[17] (رضي الله عنه): A11ah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) educated us about lavatory (manners) that we should sit on our left foot[18] and keep erect our right foot.<br />
[Reported by Al-Baihaqi through a chain of weak narrators][19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Iesa bin Yazdad[20] from his father (رضي الله عنه,): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;When one of you passes urine, he should empty his penis three times.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Ibn Majah through a weak chain of narrators]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) asked the residents of Quba’ that what had earned them the Praise of Allah and they replied, &#8220;We use water after (cleaning ourselves with) stones.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Al-Bazzar with <i>Da&#8217;if</i> chain of narrators and its <i>Asl</i> (original source) is in Abu Da’ud and At-Tirmidhi, and Ibn Khuzaima graded it Sahih (sound) through Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه) without mentioning the &#8220;stones.&#8221;]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]           On that ring “Allah’s Messenger Muhammad” (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was carved in three lines. It means that Names of Allah and the verses of noble Quran in the written form should not be carried to the lavatory or while going out to answer the call of nature.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]           Abu Da’ud, Tirmidhi, Nasa’i and Ibn Majah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]           Usually <i>jinns</i> live in such filthy places, for that reason the noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) sought the refuge of Allah. Before entering the lavatory one should recite this prayer in an audible voice. According to the narration of Anas (رضي الله عنه), in wilds or in jungle, one should recite this prayer before sitting for the call of nature. During the call of nature one should also be careful about one&#8217;s body and clothes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]           Most of the people [religious scholars] prefer to purify with clod of mud and water both.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]           This action of the noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) guides that while going out for the call of nature, it is necessary to arrange some kind of privacy and be hidden from others. In another Hadith, it is stated that in an open space, a mound of soil or a heap of sand should be made for the purpose of screening. If someone eases himself in an open, Satan will laugh at his buttocks and will make him a laughing stock of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]           It is prohibited to answer the call of nature near pathways or near the ways in the vicinity of populated areas. Sites of abandoned road or deserted place can be used for the purpose</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]           Mu’adh is an <i>Ansari</i> of Al-Khazraj tribe and was one of the virtuous, noble and most learned Sahaba. He attended Al-&#8216;Aqaba, Badr and other major battles. The Prophet ·(صلى الله عليه و سلم) appointed him as his representative in Yemen. Then &#8216;Umar appointed him as the governor of Sham after Abu &#8216;Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah. He died in the plague of <i>Amwa’s</i> in 17H or 18 H at the age of 38.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]           Altogether these are six places. It is forbidden in a <i>Hadith</i> to answer the call of nature or to urinate near the gates of the mosques.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]           This is confirmed by other authentic <i>Ahadith</i>, so it is correct.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]         Handling the male organ with right hand during urination or washing, and breathing in the utensils during drinking is prohibited according to some, while according to others it is undesirable. Breathing in the utensil is harmful because this is the cause of transmission of germs from one to another, and the Hadith which informs about three pauses while drinking means drink should be taken slowly and not at a gulp.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]         He was known as &#8220;Salman the benevolent&#8221; and was nicknamed Abu &#8216;Abdullah. His origin is from Persia. He traveled in search of a religion and became a Christian. Then he moved to Al-Madina and believed in the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) as soon as he arrived at Al-Madina He was a leader in Islam and died in Al-Madina in 50 H or 32 H. It is reported that he lived long for either 250 or 350 years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12]         His name is Khalid bin Zaid bin Kulaib. He hosted the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) when he first arrived in Al-Madina. He was one of the senior and most great <i>Sahaba</i>. He attended Badr and was martyred while taking part in an expedition against the Byzantinians in 50 H. His grave, situated at the walls of Istanbul, is well known and visited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13]         In this issue &#8216;Forbiddance&#8217; is for open places, it is not forbidden in inside the building where there are walls around. As there is a Hadith narrated by &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar (رضي الله عنه). He narrates: &#8220;In the house of my sister Hafsa, I went upstairs on the roof, I saw the noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) answering the call of nature, he was facing towards Sham.&#8221; This Hadith is of Sahih Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14]         The Collectors of Hadith: Ahmad, Abu Da’ud, An-Nasa’i, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15]         It is known from this Hadith that one should not clean the private parts with dung or excrement of animals, and so it is forbidden to clean with bones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16]         The mentioned addition proves that for cleanliness three clods of mud are needed, even though two may suffice, but the condition of three is a must. More than three may be used if needed, but the number should be odd. This Hadith also proves that dung cannot be used for cleaning private parts, likewise cleaning by bones is also prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17]         Sura’qa bin Malik bin Ju&#8217;shum Al-Mudlaji Al-Kinani, nicknamed Abu Sufyan was a prominent Sahabi. He was the one who traced Allah’s Messenger (رضي الله عنه) on his way to migration whereupon the forelegs of his horse sunk into the ground up to the knees. He died in 24 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18]         There is always advisability in every command of Islam, whether we comprehend it or not The noble Prophet b (صلى الله عليه و سلم) instructed us to sit on the left foot (to put weight of the body on left foot) while sitting for answering the call of nature; as the stomach is on the left side, it makes the action easy; and the constipation, the mother of diseases, is also eradicated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19]         This Hadith is weak because there are unknown narrators in its chain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20]         &#8216;Iesa and his father Yazdad are both unknown. Ibn Ma&#8217;in said, &#8221; &#8216;Iesa and his father are unknown.”</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 8: Taking Ghusl (Bath) and the Precepts Regarding Sexual Impurity.</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &#8220;The water (of the Ghusl is due to the water (of sexual emission)”[1].<br />
[Reported by Muslim and its <i>Asl</i> (origin) is in Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): AllahÐh&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said that, &#8220;If one of you sits between her legs (of a woman) and penetrates her[2], Ghusl (bath) is obligatory.&#8221;<br />
[Agreed upon]<br />
And Muslim added: &#8220;Even if he does not ejaculate.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Umm Salama (رضي الله عنه): Umm Sulaim[3], the wife of Abu Talha said, &#8220;O Allah’s Messenger! (صلى الله عليه و سلم) A11ah is not ashamed of the truth. Is a Ghusl (bath) compulsory for a woman when she has a sexual dream.&#8221;[4] He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) replied, &#8220;Yes! When she sees signs of liquid.&#8221;<br />
[Agreed upon.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) Said about the precept of a woman having ejaculation during sleep like a man, &#8220;She should take a Ghusl (bath)&#8221;.<br />
[Agreed upon]<br />
Added Muslim: Umm Salama said, &#8220;Does this happen (to a woman)?&#8221; He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Yes, otherwise where does the resemblance (of a child to its mother) come from)[5]?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to take a bath from four things; after sexual intercourse, on Fridays, after extracting blood from his body and after washing a dead body.[6].<br />
[Reported by Abu Da’ud and Ibn Khuzaima graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه), regarding the story of Thumama bin Utha’l[7] when he embraced Islam: The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ordered him to take a bath.[8]<br />
[Narrated by Abdur- Razzaq and its origin is in Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">100. Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Taking a bath on Friday is a must for every adult&#8221;.<br />
[Reported by As-Sab&#8217;a[9]].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">101. Narrated Samura[10] [2] (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Whoever performs ablution on Friday has done a good thing and he who takes bath, taking bath is better (for him).&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Al-Khamsa[11] and At-Tirmidhi graded it Hasan (fair)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">102. Narrated &#8216;Ali (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to teach us the Quran except when he was in a state of sexual impurity[12].<br />
[Reported by Ahmad and Al-Arba’a·. This is the version of At-Tirmidhi who graded it Hasan (fair). And Ibn Hibban graded it Sahih (sound)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">103. Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;If one of you has sexual intercourse with his wife, and wishes to repeat he should perform ablution [1] [13]between them.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Muslim.]<br />
Al-Hakim added: &#8220;Ablution makes one active for repeating (the sexual act).&#8221;<br />
Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to sleep in the state of sexual impurity without touching water[14].<br />
[Reported by Al-Arba &#8216;a. This Hadith is defective.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">104. Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Whenever Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) took Ghusl (bath) after sexual intercourse, he would begin by washing his hands, then pour water with his right hand on his left hand and wash his sexual organ. He would then perform ablution, then take some water and run his fingers through the roots of his hair. Then he would pour three handfuls on his head, then pour water over the rest of his body and subsequently wash his feet.<br />
[Agreed upon and this version is of Muslim]. Narrated Maimuna (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) poured water over his private parts and washed them with his left hand. He then struck his hand against the earth. In another version: &#8216;He rubbed it on the earth.&#8217; And in the last of this version: “Then I brought him a towel[15] but he returned it and kept wiping off the water with his hand.”<br />
[Agreed upon].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">105. Narrated Umm Salama (رضي الله عنه): I said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, I am a woman with tightly plaited hair on my head; should I undo it for taking a bath from sexual intercourse?<br />
&#8220;In another version is: &#8220;from menstruation?&#8221; He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;No, it is enough for you to throw three handfuls of water[16] on your head&#8221;.<br />
[Reported by Muslim.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">106. Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;I do not permit a woman in menstrual condition[17][3] or anyone in a state of sexual impurity to (enter) the mosque&#8221;.[18]<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud and Ibn Khuzaima graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">107.     Narrated (&#8216;Aisha رضي الله عنه): I and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) took a Ghusl (bath) due to sexual impurity from the same vessel and our hands alternated into it.<br />
[Agreed upon.] Ibn Hibban added &#8220;and (our hands) met.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">108. Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;There is sexual impurity under every hair[19], so wash the hair and cleanse the skin.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud and At-Tirmidhi who both graded it Da&#8217;if (weak); and in the version of Ahmad, a similar Hadith is narrated by &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه), and in the chain is one narrator who is <i>Majhul</i> (unknown)].</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]           It means after seminal discharge, taking of bath is essential and obligatory. This Hadith is linked only with &#8216;night discharge&#8217; and not with coition. Most of the religious scholars believe in it. Ubai bin K&#8217;ab said that in the early period of Islam, in case of coition, taking of bath was not obligatory until the seminal discharge happened, but afterwards this order was abrogated. Some of the research scholars have reported the consensus of Muslims on this issue that as soon as coition is started, taking of Ghusl (bath) becomes obligatory, whether seminal discharge occurs or not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]           It means that with the start of coitus, taking of Ghusl (bath) becomes obligatory. This Hadith cancels the previous one, if linked with coition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]           Her name is Ar-Rumaisa&#8217; or Al-Ghumaisa&#8217; bint Milha’n, Anas bin Malik&#8217;s mother. She was among the virtuous Sahabiyat. She was married to Malik bin An-Nasr, then she became a Muslim and invited him to Islam, but he became angry and went to Sham where he died. She was then proposed to by Abu Talha while still a Mushrik, but she made a condition that he should become a Muslim, so he became one and married her. She died during the caliphate of&#8217; Uthman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]           As Men, women also have “wet dreams”, so taking bath is obligatory for them too.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]           It means that women also have seminal discharge otherwise how a child can take after the mother? Resemblance of children to their parents is on account of potency of semen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Among all these four, taking bath after coition is <i>Fard</i> (obligatory), on Friday is <i>Sunna </i>(the way of noble Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم) and the rest of the two are <i>Mustahab </i>(desirable). Ahadith regarding obligation of Friday bath are more authentic, therefore, those are to be followed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]           Thumama bin Utha’l was from Banu Hanifa and the chief of Al-Yamama people. He went to perform &#8216;Umrah while still a Mushrik and was captured by some horsemen of the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم). They brought him to Al-Madina and tied him to one of the mosque&#8217;s pillars. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) released him after three days. He then became a devoted Muslim and stood firm, during the <i>Ridda</i> (apostasy) days, against his people who were cheated by Musailima Al-Kadhdhab.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]           When a non-Muslim embraces Islam, it is obligatory for him to take a bath. Abu Da’ud reported that the noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ordered Thumama to take a bath, when he embraced Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]           Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Da’ud, Tirmidhi, Nasa’i, Ibn Majah and Musnad Ahmad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Samura bin Jundub is a well-known Sahabi nicknamed Abu .Abdullah. He was a Fazari and an ally of the <i>Ansar</i>. He was also one of the memorizers who narrated many Ahadith. He settled at Basra and was very harsh against Al-Haruriya. He died rewards the end of the year 59 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] Abu Da’ud, Tirmidhi, Nasa’i, Ibn Majah and Musnad Ahmad</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] From this Hadith and from others it is proved that reading of noble Quran for a person, needing post-coition Ghusl (bath) is not right.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] This ablution is desirable and not essential, it also brings about a pleasure and freshness in mood. It is reported that if the noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to his different wives in one night, he used to take a Ghusl (bath) after going to each of them. It is also reported that he performed ablution in between and sometimes he did not. So, in this matter one can choose any mode.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] It means that before going to sleep, ablution is not essential for a <i>Junubi</i> (a man in the post-discharge state). There is a Hadith from Bukhari regarding this issue that the noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to perform ablution before eating, drinking or sleeping. Therefore, it is better to follow the way of the noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) though it is merely preferable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] The issue of drying the limbs after performing ablution is discretionary, therefore, it depends on the choice whether to dry or not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16] This Hadith makes it clear that for a menstruating woman and Junubi (a man in the post-discharge state) it is not essential to unravel the hair. There is another Hadith from &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه), in which untying of hair is reported. Both the Ahadith are for different occasions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17] A menstruating woman is not allowed to enter a mosque and circumambulate the Sacred Ka&#8217;ba. She should not pray or fast in this period. Prayers of this period are pardoned but she must fast later on. Reading and touching the noble Quran is also prohibited. She should also not recite a complete verse .f Quran at a time. Remembrance of Allah is allowed to her. She can participate in invocation upon Allah with other Muslims. She is allowed to go to the place of Eid prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18] It means that a menstruating woman and a man in post-discharge state is not allowed to stay in a mosque but passing through is allowed. If somebody gets discharged as a result of wet dream during a sleep in a mosque, it is essential for him to go out. This is unanimously agreed upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19] We come to know by this Hadith that it is obligatory to wash the whole body after having a sexual intercourse except rinsing of mouth and putting water in the nose because these two are controversial.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 9: Tayammum (Purification with Soil)</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">109.    Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;I have been given five things which were not given to anyone else before me. Allah made me victorious by awe (of frightening my enemies) for a distance of one month&#8217;s journey. The earth has been made for me (and my followers) a place for praying and purification (performing <i>Tayammum</i>). Therefore, anyone (of my followers) should pray wherever the time of Salat (prayer)[1] becomes due.&#8221;[2]<br />
In the version of Muslim narrated by Hudhaifa: &#8220;The soil[3] of the earth has been made for us as a means of purification when we do not find water.&#8221;<br />
In the version of Ahmad narrated by &#8216;Ali (رضي الله عنه): &#8220;The soil has been made for us a means of cleansing.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ammar bin Yasir[4] (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) sent me on an errand, then I had ejaculation (in my sleep) and I did not find water. (For performing Tayammum) I rolled on the soil like an animal. Then I returned to the Prophet and mentioned that to him. He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;It was sufficient for you to do with your hands this way&#8221;. He then struck his hands once on the soil and then rubbed the left hand on the right and the exterior part of his palms and his face.<br />
[Agreed upon. The version is that of Muslim].<br />
And in the version of Al-Bukhari: &#8216;He (Allah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم) struck the earth with his palms of both hands[5] and then blew the dust and rubbed his palms of both hands over his face and hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Tayammum (purifying with the soil) consists of two strikings[6], of the soil, one for the face and one for the hands up to the elbows.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Ad-Daraqutni, and the <i>Imam</i> graded it <i>Sahih</i> as Mawquf</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;The soil is a means of ablution for a believing Muslim, even if he does not find water for ten years[7]; but when he finds water he should guard against disobeying Allah and let it touch his skin.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by AI-Bazzar, and Al-Qattan graded it <i>Sahih</i>  (sound).  But Ad-Daraqutni approved it as <i>Mursal</i>, At-Tirmidhi also reported a similar version on the authority of Abu Dhar,[8] which he authenticated and so did Al-Hakim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri (رضي الله عنه): Two men set out on a journey and when the time of Salat (prayer) came they had no water. They performed Tayammum with clean earth and prayed. Later on they found water within the time of the prayer.  One of them repeated the prayer and ablution but the other did not repeat. Then they came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), and related the matter to him. Addressing himself to the one who did not repeat, he said, &#8220;You followed the Sunna and your (first) prayer was enough for you.&#8221;[9] He said to the one who performed ablution and repeated: &#8220;For you there is a double reward&#8221;.[10]<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud and An-Nasa&#8217;i]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas (رضي الله عنه) regarding the explanation of the Words of Allah “And if you are ill[11] or on a journey&#8230;” If a man sustains a wound in the cause of Allah and an injury, then becomes sexually impure and fears death if he takes Ghusl (bath), he should perform Tayammum.<br />
[Reported by Ad- Daraqutni in a <i>Mawqu</i>f (untraceable) <i>Hadith</i> and Al-Bazzar in a <i>Marfu&#8217;</i> (traceable) one. Ibn Khuzaima and Al-Hakim graded it <i>Sahih</i> (sound)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali (رضي الله عنه): One of my forearms was broken. Then I asked Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and he ordered me to wipe over the bandages.[12]<br />
[Reported by Ibn Majah with a very weak chain of narrators].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir (رضي الله عنه) concerning the man who had sustained a cut on his head and took a bath and died: (Allah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم said) &#8220;It was enough for him to perform Tayammum then bind a bandage over the wound and wipe water on it and then wash the rest of his body.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud, its chain is <i>Da&#8217;if</i> and there is disagreement concerning its narrator].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas (رضي الله عنه): It is the Sunna that a person should not pray more than once [13]with a (one) Tayammum and he should perform Tayammum for the next Salat (prayer).<br />
[Reported by Ad-Daraqutni with a very weak chain of narrators][14]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]           It means that if water is not available, one should not miss the first part of prayer time in search of water.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]           Other three things are: a) Booty has been made lawful; b) Intercession on the Day of Judgment; c) Messengership for the whole universe</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]           Soil and all other things from the kind of soil are regarded as same and <i>Tayammum</i> is permissible with them, but things like lime, antimony and arsenic, etc. do not fall in the kind of soil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]           &#8216;Ammar was nicknamed Abul-Yaqzan, and was among the most senior and early Muslims, and was tortured in Makka for his Faith. He made the two migrations and took part in Badr and all the other important battles. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told him, &#8220;O &#8216;Ammar, the transgressive party will kill you.&#8221; This happened in Siffin in 36 H. when he was with &#8216;Ali and he was killed by some soldiers of Mu’awiya at the age of 73 years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]           This Hadith argues about Tayammum (purification with soil). Religious elites are of the opinion that one stroke on earth is enough for face and both hands. Some others say that two strokes are essential, one for face and the other for hands as is mentioned in the next Hadith. But all Ahadith, which mention ‘two strokes’, are Da’if (weak).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]           The scholars of Ahadith have regarded this Hadith as <i>Da’if</i> (weak), and all its chains are also weak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]           It means that at the time of necessity soil is a complete substitute of water and fulfills all purposes of purification whether it concerns ablution, or <i>Ghusl</i> (bath). With one <i>Tayammum</i> many obligatory acts can be performed, if there is no factor, which nullifies it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]           Abu Dhar&#8217;s name was Jundub bin Junada, and he was among the most prominent Sahaba and an ascetic. He became a Muslim very early at Makka. Then went back to his people. He came to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), at Al-Madina and later settled and died at Rabdha in 32 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]           It means that if somebody has already prayed a certain prayer by performing Tayammum, then there is no need to repeat the prayer, even afterwards water is found and still there is time for the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]         It was not necessary to pray again, if the prayer had been offered by performing Tayammum. The second person got double reward not for the reason that he prayed again but for the exercise of judgment regarding the problem, which was although wrong but there is one reward for a wrong judgment. Second reason for earning double reward may be that he prayed twice, once with <i>Tayammum</i> and once with ablution</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]         It means that when you intend for prayer and there is some hindrance in performing ablution or having <i>Ghusl</i> (bath), the <i>Tayammum</i> is essential. Here illness means some serious disease and not the ordinary boils and eruptions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12]     Ðp;    The word in Arabic is <i>Jaba&#8217;ir</i> used for those wooden strips, which are placed around the broken arm or leg for support and to keep it straight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13]         Since Tayammum (purification with soil) is a substitute for ablution, it works the same. Many prayers can be offered with one ablution, in the same way many prayers can be offered with one Tayammum. Some people after performing Tayammum for coition or wet dream hesitate to enter the mosque or to recite the Quran. This is only an evil apprehension and a satanic distraction and should not be cared for. In this Hadith Hasan bin &#8216;Ammar is weak in the chain of narrators. There are two other Ahadith on the same issue and both of them are <i>Da’if (</i>weak).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14]         This Hadith is weak because it was narrated by Hasan bin &#8216;Ammar who was weak, and due to this fact the Hadith scholars did not rely on it, but said that, &#8220;Allah has permitted for us the use of soil in the absence of water and since ablution becomes obligatory after passing urine, excreting or releasing air, so is the case of Tayammum.&#8221;</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 10: Menstruation</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">118. Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Fatima bint Abu Hubaish had a prolonged flow of blood[1] and Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم)· told her, &#8220;The menstruation blood is a dark recognizable blood, so if that comes then avoid prayer. And if it is the other  (light colored blood), then perform <i>Wudu</i> (ablution) and offer <i>Salat</i>  (prayer) (for that is blood of a vein).&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud and An-Nasa’i. Ibn Hibban and Al-Hakim graded it Sahih (sound). Abu Hatim termed it <i>Munkar</i> (unusual)]<br />
And in the Hadith of Asma bint ‘Umais[2] (رضي الله عنه) reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud, (the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم said:) &#8220;She should sit in a tub, and when she sees yellowish color on the top of the water, she should take a bath once for the <i>Zuhr</i> and <i>Asr</i> prayers, and take another bath for the <i>Maghrib</i> and <i>Isha</i> prayers, and take a bath once for the <i>Fajr</i> prayer, and in between these times she should perform ablution.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">119. Narrated Hamna bint Jahsh[3](رضي الله عنه): MY menstruation was too much and severe. So I came to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to ask for his (religious) opinion. He said, &#8220;This is a stroke of the devil, so observe your menses for six or seven days, then take a bath and when you see that you are purified and quite clean, pray for twenty-three or twenty-four days, and fast and pray for that will suffice you. And do so every month just as the other women menstruate  (and are purified).  But if you are strong enough[4] to delay the Zuhr prayer and advance the Asr prayer then take a bath and combine the Zuhr and the Asr prayer; then delay the Maghrib prayer and advance the Isha prayer then take a bath and combine the two prayers, do so; and take a bath at Fajr.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم said of the two types of actions: &#8220;This one appeals more to my liking (i.e. taking a bath for every prayer)&#8221;.<br />
[Reported by Al-Khamsa except An- Nasa’i, At-Tirmidhi graded it Sahih (sound) and Al-Bukhari graded it Hasan (fair)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">120. Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Umm Habiba bint Jahsh[5] complained to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) about the blood (which flows beyond the menstruation period). He said, &#8220;Keep away (from prayer) the length of time that your menses prevented you, then take a bath (and offer prayers)&#8221;. And she used to take a bath for every prayer[6].<br />
[Reported by Muslim.]<br />
In a version of Al-Bukhari is: &#8220;Perform ablution for every Salat (prayer)&#8221;. It has been reported by Abu Da’ud and others in another version</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">121. Narrated Umm Atiya[7] (رضي الله عنه): We considered it nothing (as impure) the muddiness and yellowness (of the fluids) after purification[8] (from menstruation).<br />
[Reported by Al-Bukhari and Abu Da&#8217;ud and version is of the latter].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">122. Narrated Anas (رضي الله عنه): The Jews used not to eat with a woman during her menstruation period, so the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Do every thing else apart from sexual intercourse (with your wives)&#8221;.<br />
[Reported by Muslim.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">123. Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), used to order me to put on an <i>Izar[9]</i> and then caress[10] me while menstruating.<br />
[Agreed upon]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">124. Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said regarding a husband who has sexual intercourse with his wife during her menstruation period, &#8220;He should give out (as atonement) one Dinar or ½ Dinar as alms”<br />
[Reported by Al-Khamsa. Al-Hakim and Ibn Al-Qattan graded it Sahih (sound). And others considered it to be Mawquf (untraceable)][11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">125. Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id AI-Khudri (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Is it not the case that a woman in her menstruation period neither prays nor fasts?&#8221;[12]<br />
[Agreed upon. It is part of a long Hadith]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">126. Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): When we came to a place called Sarif, I menstruated and the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told me, &#8220;Do what a pilgrim does except that you don&#8217;t circumambulate round the Ka&#8217;ba until you are purified&#8221;.<br />
[Agreed upon and it is part of a long Hadith.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">127. Narrated Mu&#8217;adh (رضي الله عنه): He asked the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), “What is lawful for a man regarding his wife when she is menstruating?&#8221; and he replied, &#8220;What is above the waist wrapper (Izar).”[13]<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud and graded it Da&#8217;if.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">128. Narrated Umm Salama (رضي الله عنه): During the time of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) the women having bleeding after delivery (postnatal or puerperal blood) would refrain (from prayer) for forty days.[14]<br />
[Reported  by Al-Khamsa except An-Nasa’i, and the version is that of Abu Da’ud].<br />
And in another version of Abu Da’ud: &#8220;The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not command her to repeat the prayers (abandoned during the period of bleeding).&#8221; And Al-Hakim graded it Sahih (sound).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]           <i>Istihada</i> may be either prolonged puerperium or prolonged menstruation period (and is regarded as bleeding between the periods). Period of menstruation, according to some scholars is from one to fifteen days; and according to others, its duration is from three to ten days. Experience confirms the later assertion. Every woman knows her period if bleeding exceeds the normal time then it would be <i>Istihada</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]           She was the wife of Jafar bin Abu Talib. She had migrated with him to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and bore him there children, among them was &#8216;Abdullah. Then Abu Bakr As-Siddiq married her after the martyrdom of Jafar at the battle of Mu&#8217;ta, and she bore him Muhammad. Ali bin Abu Talib also married her after the death of Abu Bakr and she bore him Yahya &#8216;Umar used to ask her the interpretation of dreams. She died after the death of &#8216;Ali.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]           Hamna bint Jahsh is the sister of the &#8216;Mother of the Believers&#8217; Zainab bint Jahsh. She was married to Mus&#8217;ab bin &#8216;Umair, who was martyred during the battle of Uhud after which she was married by Talha bin &#8216;Ubaidullah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]           In this Hadith, Hamna was ordered to take a bath three times a day. One bath for Zuhr and Asr prayers; second for Maghrib and Isha; and third for Fajr. In the preceding Hadith Fatima bint Abu Hubaish was ordered merely to perform ablution before every prayer. It means in case of Istihada taking a bath is not compulsory but performing ablution is obligatory for every prayer. Taking a bath is preferable if weather conditions and health allows, otherwise there is no need to take bath.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]           Habiba bint Jahsh was another sister of Zainab bint Jahsh,&#8217;the Mother of the Believers&#8217; and she was married to &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf Muslim narrated that she had a prolonged flow of blood for seven years. She died in 44H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]           It was only a precautionary or voluntary act of Umm Habiba to take a bath for every prayer. Authentic decision regarding this issue is to take a post-menstruation Ghusl (bath) and purify oneself. Concerning prolonged bleeding, there is an order to wash the blood and perform ablution for every prayer</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]           Her name was Nusaiba bint Ka&#8217;b or bint Al-Harith Al-Ansariya. She was among the prominent Sahabiya women, and she used to accompany Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to battles, nursing the sick and treating the injured. She fought during the battle of Uhud like heroes. She witnessed the washing of the body of the daughter of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), which she perfected and narrated, and a number of Sahaba and Tabi’i Ulama at Basra recorded that from her. Her Hadith is considered to be the basis of washing the dead. She was counted to be among the Sahabiya who settled at Basra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]           In the narration of&#8217; Aisha (رضي الله عنه), yellow and dusty colored water is considered as menses, but this Hadith states: &#8220;We considered it nothing.&#8221; Apparently both Ahadith appear to be opposing each other, but actually both are correct in their context. If the yellow or dusty color water oozes out in the menstruation period, it will be considered as &#8216;menses&#8217;; and if it percolates after the period, it is &#8216;nothing&#8217; as the word <i>B &#8216;ad At-Tuhr</i> gives the clue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]           A cloth worn from the waistline downwards like a skirt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Those who do not believe in the Ahadith (i.e. deniers of Sunna), create ambiguity and doubt at this point, and make the people suspicious about the Ahadith. They assert that sexual intercourse in menstruation periods is prohibited by the noble Quran but according to this Hadith the Prophet would do it during that period, therefore, Hadith is not true. Literal meaning of <i>Mubasharat</i> is to touch and rub the body with the body, and speaking metaphorically it means coition.  In other Ahadith it has been clarified that sexual intercourse is strictly forbidden during menstruation, thus, it is quite a dishonesty to translate the word Mubasharat as sexual intercourse instead of &#8216;fondling&#8217; and create the suspicion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] This is a Da&#8217;if (weak) Hadith, therefore, most of the religious scholars do not deem it necessary to expiate, although some of the scholars are in favor of this opinion; but first opinion is correct because order is only for encouraging charity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] This is a small portion of a long Hadith. The noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), while delivering a Khutba (religious talk) to the women, told them that their religion was imperfect. They asked, &#8220;How?&#8221; In the answer to their question, he spoke these words, which mean that a menstruating women should not pray or fast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] &#8220;Everything above the Izar (dress worn below the waist)&#8221; may have two meanings: First, the Izar may be a figurative speech for &#8216;sexual intercourse&#8217;, in other words, except sexual intercourse everything is permitted. Secondly, it may metaphorically mean the portion of body related to Izar. But this meaning will contradict the other Hadith stating: &#8220;Do everything except intercourse·” Therefore, first meaning is preferable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] It means the maximum period of puerperal blood is forty days and minimum time for it is not fixed. If it continues more than forty days, it will be regarded as <i>Istihada</i> (bleeding between periods), which is not a hindrance for prayer, fasting and having sexual intercourse. Every command of the puerperium is identical to that of menstruation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Az-Zakah is Obligatory on the Wealth of the orphan and the Insane.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question: Is Az-Zakah obligatory on the wealth of the orphan and the insane?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Az-Zakah is obligatory on the wealth of each of them, if the person is a free Muslim who has complete ownership of his wealth. This is due to what Ad-Daraqutni narrated that was reported as a statement of the Prophet (Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam): &#8220;Whoever is made the guardian over the wealth of an orphan, let him do business with it and he should not leave it to be devoured by chrity i.e, Az-Zakah).&#8221; [Ad-Daraqutni 2:109 no. 1951.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is due to what Malik narrated in Al-Muwatta&#8217; from &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Qasim from his father, that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;A&#8217;ishah used to keep me and my brother as two orphans in her appartment, and she used to pay Az-Zakah from our wealth.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The view that Az-Zakah is obligatory upon the wealth of each of them (the orphan and the insane person)was held by &#8216;Ali, Ibn &#8216;Umar, Jabir, A&#8217;shah and Al-Hasan bin &#8216;Ali. Ibn Al-Mundhir related this from them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Az-Zakah on Wealth that is kept for Marriage 1.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man saved some money for his son over a number of years so that the son can get married. Is he obliged to pay any Zakah on this wealth of his? This is in consideration of the fact that he does not intend anything with this money other than getting his son married.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He must pay Az-Zakah on all of the money that he saved if it was in his possesion for a year, even if he intended to use this money to get his son married. This is because as long as the money was with him and it was considered his possession, and he must pay its Zakah every year until it is used for the marriage. This is due to the generality of the evidences from the Book and the Sunnah that prove this.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Az-Zakah on Wealth that is kept for Marriage 2.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I am currently an employee in one of the governmental departments and I receive approximately four thousand riyals per month. In approximately one year, I collected seventeen thousand riyals. This money is currently in the bank and it does not increase (i.e., from interest or investment). I am ready to spend in the month of Shawwal – if Allaah wills – as I am getting married. I am going to take a loan that is many times more than this amount to cover the expenses of the wedding. My question is: Am I obliged to pay any Zakah on this seventeen thousand? This is while considering that it has been in my possession for about a year. If there is Az-Zakah due on it, how much is it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Az-Zakah is due on the mentioned sum of money if it was possessed for a year, even if it was kept for marriage. The amount of Zakah that is due is one fortieth, i.e., 2.5%. And Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh `Abdul-`Azeez Bin Baz<br />
Fatawa Islamiyah, DARUSSALAM, Vol.3, Page Nos. 159/160</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Az-Zakah is due on whatever wealth is owned a year and reaches the minimum amount.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A person saved a sum of money from his own earnings. Most of it he possessed for a year, but he spent it on some things that would bring benefit to himself. Therefore, he asks whether it is obligatory for him to pay Az-Zakah on it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whatever wealth he saved or owned for a year while it had reached the minimum required amount, then Az-Zakah is due on it. This is the case even if he spent some of it after that on marriage or anything similar. If he did not pay the Zakah of his wealth which was due upon, then it is still due from him and he is responsible for it. It is incumbent upon him to pay it. However, what he did not possess for a year of his wealth due to his spending from it before a year’s time, then there is no Zakah due upon it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Permanent Committee for Research and Verdicts</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatawa Islamiyah, DARUSSALAM, Vol.3, Page Nos. 160/161</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Paying Az-Zakah in advance is permissible.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I am an employee who receives a salary, and every month I save a portion of it. There is not a specific percentage for the savings, so how do I pay the Zakah of this wealth?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is obligatory upon you is to pay the Zakah of every amount that you save if you have possessed it for a year. If you pay the Zakah of all of the money when a year has passed on the first amount that was saved, then that is sufficient. In this way, the Zakah of the latter sums is considered as being paid in advance before the completion of their year. And paying Az-Zakah in advance before it is possessed for a complete year is permissible, especially if there is a need for it or a religious benefit in that.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Land that is kept for building does not require paying of Az-Zakah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have a piece of land that I bought with the intent of building on it. Then after a period of time, I needed to sell it, so I sold it. Is there any Zakah due on me for the period of time that I was not trying to sell it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the matter is as you mentioned in the question, there is no Zakah due on you for whatever time passed before the sale. This is because the reason that necessitates the the payment of Az-Zakah is not present, which is the intent to sell, and you were not intending to sell it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The ruling of Az-Zakah on Jewellery, Diamonds and precious Stones</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I am a married woman and I am almost 30 years old. For approximately 24 years I have had pieces of gold that are not kept for business. They are only for beautification and some times I sell them. Then I add some money to their price and buy better jewelry. Now I have some jewellery and I have herd that it is obligatory to pay Az-Zakah on gold that is kept for beautification. Thus, I would like a clarification of this matter for myself. If Az-Zakah was obligatory on me what is the ruling of the past period of time during which I did not pay Az-Zakah on the jewellery? This is while keeping in mind that I am not able to estimate the amount of gold that I had during all of these long years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Az-Zakah is obligatory on you from the time you knew it was obligatory on you to pay Az-Zakah on jewellery. Whatever occurred before that in the previous years before your knowledge of this, then you do not have to pay Az-Zakah for it. This is because the Islamic laws only become obligatory after they are known. The amount that must be paid is 2.5% if the jewellery reaches the minimum amount required for Az-Zakah, which is 20 Mithqal (gold). This is equivalent to 11.5 Saudi Junayhs. If gold jewellery reaches this amount or more, then Az-Zakah must be paid on it. For every 1000 Junayhs, 25 Junayhs is due. In reference to silver, its minimum amount before Az-Zakah is due is 140 Mithqal, which is equivalent to it of monetary currency. The amount that must be paid is 2.5% just like with gold.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In reference to diamond and other stones, no Zakah is due on them if they are for wearing. However, if they are for sale, then Az-Zakah is obligatory on them according to their value in gold and silver if they reach the minimum amount required for Az-Zakah. And Allaah is the Giver of success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh `Abdul-`Azeez Bin Baz<br />
Fatawa Islamiyah, DARUSSALAM, Vol.3, Page Nos. 178/179</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Az-Zakah on Jewellery is obligatory on its Owner</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My wife has gold that she wears that reaches the minimum amount required for Az-Zakah. Is there any Zakah due on it? Is paying its Zakah obligatory on me or on my wife? Is Az-Zakah given from the jewellery itself or is its value determined and then Az-Zakah paid according to the value?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Az-Zakah is obligatory on jewellery that is made of gold and silver if its weight reaches the minimum amount required for Az-Zakah, which is 20 Mithqal of gold and 140 Mithqal of silver. The minimum amount of gold in the current currency is equal to 11 (and three sevenths) Saudi Junayhs. If the gold jewellery reaches this amount or more, Az-Zakah must be paid on it, even if it is only for wearing according to the most correct view of the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The minimum amount of silver required for Az-Zakah is 56 Saudi Riyals (of silver). If the silver jewellery reaches this amount or more, Az-Zakah must be paid on it. The amount of Az-Zakah to be paid is 2.5% of gold, silver and sale merchandise. This is 2½ out of 100 or 25 out of 1000. Any amount more than this is calculated in this way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Az-Zakah is due upon the woman who owns the jewellery. If her husband or other than him pays it on her behalf with her permission, there is nothing wrong with that. It is not obligatory to give the Zakah from the jewellery itself. Rather, it suffices to pay its value every time a year passes on it. This is according to the value of gold and silver in the market at the completion of the year’s time. And Allaah is the Giver of success.</p>

Fatawa Islamiyah, DARUSSALAM, Vol.3, Page Nos. 180/181</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Is it Lawful to Give Charity on their Behalf</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A number of years ago, I took a sum of one hundred Saudi Riyals from a number of my colleagues, after which, I travelled to another area and forgot those colleagues and they also forgot me. Now I do not know where they are, so what should I do with the sum of money which is my responsibility? Inform me and may Allah reward you with goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the matter is as you have mentioned in your question, which is that you forgot the owners of the hundred (Riyals) then it is lawful for you to give charity on their behalf. Then if you remembered any of them you must give him his right, unless he approves of your having given it in charity on his behalf. In that case, you will be absolved from blame and you and them will be rewarded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh `Abdul-`Azeez Bin Baz<br />
Fatawa Islamiyah, volume 5 / page 27</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Who is considered eligible to receive the Zakaat ?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It does not befit that the Zakaat be given to the one who does not utilize it for obedience to Allaah. For indeed Allaah The Most High has obligated it as an aid towards obedience to Him for whosoever is in need of it from the believers, such as the poor and those under debt or one who helps the believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever does not pray from the people who are needy should not be given anything until he repents; and until he adheres to the performance of the prayers in their correct times.</p>

Translated by Aboo Haatim Muhammad Farooq</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Is the Zakaat ul Fitr due on behalf of the unborn child?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abdullaah bin Ahmad bin Hanbal said: I heard my father say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Zakaat ul Fitr is to be given on behalf of the unborn child – if it is known of.’*</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abdullaah bin Ahmad bin Hanbal said: I heard my father say: Mu’tamir bin Sulaimaan At-Taymee narrated to us from Humaid from Bakr and Qataadah that ‘Uthmaan would give the Sadaqatul Fitr on behalf of the small child and the elder and the unborn child.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">_____________________</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">*Note: There occurs a narration from Imaam Ahmad with this meaning mentioned by Aboo Dawood in Al-Masaa’il page 86, and Ibn Haani’ in Al-Masaa’il vol 1 page 111 number 550.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the madhab itself (the Hanbali madhab): then within it the Zakaat ul Fitr is not obligatory on behalf of the foetus, this is because there is no ruling upon it until it is born. However; it is recommended that it is given on its behalf if it is known to exist due to the practice of ‘Uthmaan (radhiyallaahu ‘anhu). See: Mukhtasir Al-Kharqee page 75 and Al-Hidaayah vol 1 page 75 and Al-Mughnee vol 3 page 99 and Al-Furoo’ vol 2 page 526 and Al-Qawaa’id of Ibn Rajab page 189 and Al-Insaaf vol 3 page 168 and Al-Mubdi’ vol 2 page 388.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal<br />
Masaa&#8217;il Al-Imaam Ahmad vol 2 pages 585-586<br />
Translated by Aboo Haatim Muhammad Farooq</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The particular group of people to whom the Zakaat ul Fitr is to be distributed to</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Scholars have differed concerning the issue of distributing the Zakaat ul Fitr, such that there are two sayings:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first saying: That it is to be distributed amongst the eight types of individuals that have been mentioned by Allaah in Soorah At-Tawbah in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((Indeed the Sadaqaat (obligatory Zakaat) are for the poor and the destitute and those employed to collect (the funds); and for those whose hearts have inclined (towards Islaam), and to free the captives; and for those in debt, and in the Path of Allaah (the Mujahideen), and for the wayfarer: an obligation imposed by Allaah, and Allaah is All-Knower All-Wise.)) Soorah At-Tawbah: 60</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a saying which is well-known from amongst the Shaafi’ee’s.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second saying: Is that it is not to be distributed except amongst the poor and the destitute as occurs in the Hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas which preceded in which there was the statement: ((a sustenance for the destitute))*.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Al-Qayyim (rahimahullaah) said: ((It was from his guidance (Sallalaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) that he would specify those that were destitute for this particular Sadaqah, so he would not distribute it amongst the eight types of people – handful by handful. Nor did he command for that to be done that way, nor did any one of the companions do that, nor did those that came after them. Rather it is one of two sayings with us that it is impermissible to give it except to the destitute in particular.))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the saying which is to be taken, except if you see dire need amongst someone from the other categories or an acceptable advantage by way of the Sharee’ah (to give it such), in which case it is to be given from this Sadaqah after it has been given to the poor and the destitute – in an ample portion. This is because it is a means of sustenance for them as has been established through that narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here arises an issue which should be taken into consideration which is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That it is permissible for one individual person to distribute his Zakaat to either one destitute person or to a number of them. Just as it is (allowed) for a group of people to give their fitrah to a single poor person so long as they are not committing an injustice in the right of the others who are present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second issue which is also recommended to pay attention to is that: It is impermissible to give it to those that it is impermissible to give the Zakaat to in accordance to that which we mentioned concerning the Zakaat of the types of wealth. And Allaah Knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">__________________________</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">*The full text of the Hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((Allaah’s Messenger (Sallalaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) ordered the giving of Zakaat ul Fitr as a purification for the fasting person from idle talk and obscenity, and as a sustenance for the poor. So whosoever gives it before the prayer (of ‘Eid) then it is an accepted Zakaat, and whosoever gives it after the prayer, then it is a Sadaqah (charity) from the Sadaqaat.))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Aboo Dawood in the book of Zakaat chapter: Zakaat ul Fitr; number 1609 and Ibn Maajah in the book of Zakaat chapter: Sadaqatul Fitr; number 1827and Ad-Daaraqutnee in the book of Zakaat ul Fitr number 1.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fatawa on Zakah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Excerpted from Islamic Verdicts on the Pillars of Islam by Sheikh Muhammad Bin Salih Al-‘Uthaimeen, complied and arranged by Fahd Bin Nasir Ibrahim As-Sulaiman</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> What is the ruling on the Zakah of a rented house?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a rented house is rented out for profit, then there is no Zakah payable on the value of the house. The Zakah is only payable on the income that is generated from it if the hawl (passage of one Hijrah hear) is completed upon it from the time of the rental agreement. If the hawl has not been completed from the time of the rental agreement, then there is no Zakah payable upon it either.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, if the person rented out the house for ten thousand riyals, of which he receives five thousand at the time of the agreement which he spends. Then he receives five thousand in the middle of the year, which he spends before the end of the year, there is no Zakah upon him in this case. This is because the hawl has not been completed upon this money.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if he kept the house for sale and waited to receive the profit from it, but said: Since it has not been sold, I will rent it out,’ then in that case, he must pay Zakah for the value of the house because he has kept it for sale; he did not want to keep it and profit from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And everything which is intended for the purpose of trade and profit is liable for Zakah, according to the words of the Prophet (peace be upon him), “Deeds are according to intentions and every person shall have what he intended.” And Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A man has daughters and he gave them jewelry, and all the jewelry combined amounted to the nisab, but the jewelry of each of them did not amount to the nisab. Is all of the jewelry to be taken together for calculation and Zakah paid on it?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he gave this jewelry as a loan, then the jewelry is his property, and he must total it all and if that reaches the nisab, he must pay Zakah. But if he gave his daughters this jewelry with the intention that it was their property, then it is not incumbent upon him to combine the jewelry he gave to each one of them with the jewelry of the other daughters, because each of them owns it independently of the other. Based upon this, if the jewelry of one amounts to the nisab, she must pay Zakah for it, and if it does not, then she does not have to. And Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Is there Zakah payable on one’s personal car?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no Zakah payable on it. Everything a person uses for himself, except gold and silver jewelry, there is no Zakah to be paid on it, whether a car, a camel, a farm implement or anything else, according to a saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him), “<em>There is no Zakah payable by a Muslim on his slave, nor on his horse.</em>”[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Reported by Al-Bukhari in the book of Zakah, in the Chapter: No sadaqah is payable by the Musli for his Slave (1464) ; and by Muslim in the Book of Zakah, in the Chapter: There is no Zakah Incumbent Upon the Muslim for His Slave or His Horse (982).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Tafsir Ibn Kathir of </b><b>Surat</b><b> At-Talaq</b></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>(Chapter &#8211; 65)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b><b>Which was revealed in Al-Madinah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[يأيُّهَا النَّبِىُّ إِذَا طَلَّقْتُمُ النِّسَآءَ فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ لِعِدَّتِهِنَّ وَأَحْصُواْ الْعِدَّةَ وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ رَبَّكُمْ لاَ تُخْرِجُوهُنَّ مِن بُيُوتِهِنَّ وَلاَ يَخْرُجْنَ إِلاَّ أَن يَأْتِينَ بِفَـحِشَةٍ مُّبَيِّنَةٍ وَتِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ وَمَن يَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَ اللَّهِ فَقَدْ ظَلَمَ نَفْسَهُ لاَ تَدْرِى لَعَلَّ اللَّهَ يُحْدِثُ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ أَمْراً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1. O Prophet! When you divorce women, divorce them at their `Iddah and count their `Iddah. And have Taqwa of Allah, your Lord. And turn them not out of their homes nor shall they leave, except in case they are guilty of Fahishah Mubayyinah. And those are the set limits of Allah. And whosoever transgresses the set limits of Allah, then indeed he has wronged himself. You know not, it may be that Allah will afterward bring some new thing to pass.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>There is a Period during which Divorced Women remain in Their Homes</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet was addressed first in this Ayah, to honor him, even though his Ummah is also being addressed in Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[يأيُّهَا النَّبِىُّ إِذَا طَلَّقْتُمُ النِّسَآءَ فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ لِعِدَّتِهِنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Prophet! When you divorce women, divorce them at their `Iddah) Al-Bukhari recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar divorced his wife, during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Messenger , while she was menstruating. `Umar bin Al-Khattab mentioned that to Allah&#8217;s Messenger . Allah&#8217;s Messenger became angry and said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«لِيُرَاجِعْهَا ثُمَّ يُمْسِكْهَا حَتْى تَطْهُرَ، ثُمَّ تَحِيضَ فَتَطْهُرَ، فَإِنْ بَدَا لَهُ أَنْ يُطَلِّقَهَا، فَلْيُطَلِّقْهَا طَاهِرًا قَبْلَ أَنْ يَمَسَّهَا، فَتِلْكَ الْعِدَّةُ الَّتِي أَمَرَ بِهَا اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَل»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Order him to take her back and keep her until she is clean from her menses, and then to wait until she gets her next period and becomes clean again. Then, if he wishes to divorce her, he can divorce her when she is clean from her menses, before he has sexual intercourse with her. This is the `Iddah which Allah the Exalted and Most Honored has fixed.) Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith in several parts of his Sahih. Muslim collected this Hadith and his narration uses these words,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«فَتِلْكَ الْعِدَّةُ الَّتِي أَمَرَ اللهُ أَنْ يُطَلَّقَ لَهَا النِّسَاء»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(This is the `Iddah which Allah has fixed for the women being divorced.) In his Sahih, Muslim has recorded a Hadith which is a more appropriate version from a narration of Ibn Jurayj who said that Abu Az-Zubayr informed him that he heard `Abdur-Rahman bin Ayman, the freed slave of `Azzah, questioning `Abdullah bin `Umar. And Abu Az-Zubayr heard the question, &#8220;What about a man who divorces his wife while she is still on her menses&#8221; `Abdullah answered, &#8220;During the time of Allah&#8217;s Messenger , `Abdullah bin `Umar divorced his wife who was menstruating in the life time of Allah&#8217;s Messenger . So Allah&#8217;s Messenger said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«لِيُرَاجِعْهَا»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Let him take her back.) so she returned and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«إِذَا طَهُرَتْ فَلْيُطَلِّقْ أَوْ يُمْسِك»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When she is pure, then either divorce or keep her.) `Abdullah bin `Umar said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Messenger recited this Ayah: (ياأَيُّها النَّبِيُّ إِذا طَلَّقْتُمُ النِّساءَ فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ فِي قُبُلِ عِدَّتِهِنَّ) (O Prophet! When you divorce women, divorce them at their `Iddah) And `Abdullah (Ibn Mas`ud) commented on Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ لِعِدَّتِهِنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(divorce them at their `Iddah) He said, &#8220;Purity without intercourse.&#8221; Similar was reported from Ibn `Umar, `Ata&#8217;, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Ibn Sirin, Qatadah, Maymun bin Mihran and Muqatil bin Hayyan. It is also reported from `Ikrimah and Ad-Dahhak.`Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas about the Ayah;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ لِعِدَّتِهِنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(divorce them at their `Iddah), &#8220;He does not divorce her while she is on her menses nor while she is pure if he has had intercourse during that (purity). Rather, he leaves her until she has her menses and after the menses ends, then he divorces her once.&#8221; And `Ikrimah said about</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ لِعِدَّتِهِنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(divorce them at their `Iddah), &#8220;The `Iddah is made up of clean- liness and the menstrual period.&#8221; So he divorces her while it is clear that she is pregnant, or he does not due to having sex, or since he does not know if she is pregnant or not. This is why the scholars said that there are two types of divorce, one that conforms to the Sunnah and another innovated. The divorce that conforms to the Sunnah is one where the husband pronounces one divorce to his wife when she is not having her menses and without having had sexual intercourse with her after the menses ended. One could divorce his wife when it is clear that she is pregnant. As for the innovated divorce, it occurs when one divorces his wife when she is having her menses, or after the menses ends, has sexual intercourse with her and then divorces her, even though he does not know if she became pregnant or not. There is a third type of divorce, which is neither a Sunnah nor an innovation where one divorces a young wife who has not begun to have menses, the wife who is beyond the age of having menses, and divorcing one&#8217;s wife before the marriage was consummated. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأَحْصُواْ الْعِدَّةَ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and count their `Iddah.) meaning, count for it and know its beginning and end, so that the `Iddah does not become prolonged for the woman and she cannot get married again,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ رَبَّكُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And have Taqwa of Allah, your Lord.) in this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Spending and Housing is up to the Husband during the Revocable `Iddah Period</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ تُخْرِجُوهُنَّ مِن بُيُوتِهِنَّ وَلاَ يَخْرُجْنَ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And turn them not out of their homes nor shall they leave,) meaning, during the duration of the `Iddah, she has the right to housing from her husband, as long as the `Iddah period continues. Therefore, the husband does not have the right to force her out of her house, nor is she allowed to leave his house, because she is still tied to the marriage contract. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِلاَّ أَن يَأْتِينَ بِفَاحِشَةٍ مُّبَيِّنَةٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(except in case they are guilty of Fahishah Mubayyinah.) meaning that the divorced wife is not to abandon her husband&#8217;s house unless she commits Fahishah Mubayyinah, in which case, she vacates her husband&#8217;s house. For example, Fahishah Mubayyinah implies adultery, according to `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, Ash-Sha`bi, Al-Hasan, Ibn Sirin, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Qilabah, Abu Salih, Ad-Dahhak, Zayd bin Aslam, `Ata&#8217; Al-Khurasani, As-Suddi, Sa`id bin Hilal and others. Fahishah Mubayyinah implies disobeying her husband openly or when she abuses her husband&#8217;s family in words and actions, according to Ubay bin Ka`b, Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah and others. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَتِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And those are the set limits of Allah.) means, these are from His legislation and prohibitions,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَ اللَّهِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whosoever transgresses the set limits of Allah,) meaning, whoever violates these limits, transgresses them and implements anything else besides them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَقَدْ ظَلَمَ نَفْسَهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(then indeed he has wronged himself.) by doing so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Wisdom of `Iddah at the Husband&#8217;s House</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ تَدْرِى لَعَلَّ اللَّهَ يُحْدِثُ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ أَمْراً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(You know not, it may be that Allah will afterward bring some new thing to pass.) meaning, `We commanded that the divorced wife remains in her husband&#8217;s house during the `Iddah period, so that the husband might regret his action and Allah decides that the husband feels in his heart for the marriage to continue.&#8217; This way, returning to his wife will be easier for him. Az-Zuhri said that `Ubaydullah bin `Abdullah said that Fatimah bint Qays said about Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ تَدْرِى لَعَلَّ اللَّهَ يُحْدِثُ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ أَمْراً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(You know not, it may be that Allah will afterward bring some new thing to pass.) &#8220;Taking her back.&#8221; Similar was said by Ash-Sha`bi, `Ata&#8217;, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Muqatil bin Hayyan and Ath-Thawri.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Irrevocably Divorced Woman does not have a Right to Provisions and Accommodations from the Husband</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here the view of the scholars of the Salaf and those who follow them is that housing is not obligatory in the case of the irrevocably divorced woman. They also relied on the Hadith of Fatimah bint Qays Al-Fihriyah when her husband Abu `Amr bin Hafs divorced her the third and final time. He was away from her in Yemen at the time, and he sent her his decision to divorce her. He also sent some barley with his messenger, but she did not like the amount or method of compensation. He said, &#8220;By Allah I am not obligated to spend upon you.&#8221; So, she went to Allah&#8217;s Messenger , who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«لَيْسَ لَكِ عَلَيْهِ نَفَقَة»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(There is no obligation on him to spend on you.) Muslim added in his narration,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«وَلَا سُكْنَى»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(nor housing.) And he ordered her to finish her `Iddah period in the house of Umm Sharik. He then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«تِلْكَ امْرَأَةٌ يَغْشَاهَا أَصْحَابِي، اعْتَدِّي عِنْدَ ابْنِ أُمِّ مَكْتُومٍ، فَإِنَّهُ رَجُلٌ أَعْمَى تَضَعِينَ ثِيَابَك»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(She is a woman my Companions visit. Spend this period in the house of Ibn Umm Maktum, for he is a blind man; [he cannot see you if] you take off your garments.) Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith using another chain of narration. In his narration, the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«انْظُرِي يَا بِنْتَ آلِ قَيْسٍ إِنَّمَا النَّفَقَةُ وَالسُّكْنَى لِلْمَرْأَةِ عَلَى زَوْجِهَا، مَا كَانَتْ لَهُ عَلَيْهَا رَجْعَةٌ، فَإِذَا لَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ عَلَيْهَا رَجْعَةٌ فَلَا نَفَقَةَ وَلَا سُكْنَى،اخْرُجِي فَانْزِلِي عَلَى فُلَانَة»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Look O daughter of the family of Qays! Spending and housing are required from the husband who can return to his wife. So if he does not have the right to return to her, then she does not have the right to spending and housing. So leave his house and go to so-and-so woman.) He then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«إِنَّهُ يُتَحَدَّثُ إِلَيْهَا، انْزِلِي عَلَى ابْنِ أُمِّ مَكْتُومٍ فَإِنَّهُ أَعْمَى لَا يَرَاك»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(They speak to her. Therefore, go to Ibn Umm Maktum, for he is a blind man and cannot see you.) Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that `Amir Ash-Sha`bi went to Fatimah bint Qays, sister of Ad-Dahhak bin Qays, from the tribe of Quraysh. Fatimah was married to Abu `Amr bin Hafs bin Al-Mughirah, from Bani Makhzum. She said, &#8220;Abu `Amr bin Hafs sent me his decision to divorce me while he was in an army that had gone to Yemen. I asked his friends to provide me with financial provisions and housing. They said, `He did not send us anything for that, nor did he request it from us.&#8217; I went to Allah&#8217;s Messenger and said to him, `O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! Abu `Amr bin Hafs divorced me, and I asked his friends to provide me with spending and housing and they said that he did not send them anything for that.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Messenger said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«إِنَّمَا السُّكْنَى وَالنَّفَقَةُ لِلْمَرْأَةِ إِذَا كَانَ لِزَوْجِهَا عَلَيْهَا رَجْعَةٌ، فَإِذَا كَانَتْ لَا تَحِلُّ لَهُ حَتْى تَنْكِحَ زَوْجًا غَيْرَهُ:فَلَا نَفَقَةَ لَهَا وَلَا سُكْنَى»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Spending and housing are required from the husband for his divorced wife if he can return to her. If she is not permitted for him anymore, until she marries another husband, then he does not have to provide her with spending and housing.)&#8221; An-Nasa&#8217;i also recorded this narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ فَارِقُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَأَشْهِدُواْ ذَوَى عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ وَأَقِيمُواْ الشَّهَـدَةَ لِلَّهِ ذَلِكُمْ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَن كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً &#8211; وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَـلِغُ أَمْرِهِ قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدْراً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2. Then when they are about to attain their term appointed, either take them back in a good manner or part with them in a good manner. And take as witness two just persons from among you. And establish the testimony for Allah. That will be an admonition given to him who believes in Allah and the Last Day. And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out.) (3. And He will provide him from where he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Ordaining Kindness towards Divorced Women</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted says that when the woman who is in her `Iddah nears the end of the `Iddah term, the husband must decide to reconcile with her, thus keeping their marriage together,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[بِمَعْرُوفٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(in a good manner) while being kind to her in their companionship. Otherwise, he must decide to divorce her on good terms, without abusing, cursing, or admonishing her. To the contrary, he should divorce her on good terms, observing kindness and good manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Command to have Witnesses for the Return</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأَشْهِدُواْ ذَوَى عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take as witness two just persons from among you.) meaning when taking her back, if this is your decision. Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah recorded that `Imran bin Husayn was asked about a man who divorced his wife and then had sexual intercourse with her, without notifying witnesses of when he divorced her and when he took her back. `Imran said, &#8220;His divorce and taking her back was in contradiction to the Sunnah. Incorporate the presence of witnesses for divorcing her and taking her back, and do not repeat your conduct.&#8221; Ibn Jurayj said that `Ata&#8217; commented on the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأَشْهِدُواْ ذَوَى عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take as witness two just persons from among you.) &#8220;It is not permissible to marry, divorce or take back the divorced wife except with two just witnesses, just as Allah the Exalted has said, except when there is a valid excuse.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ذَلِكُمْ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَن كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(That will be an admonition given to him who believes in Allah and the Last Day.) means, `this, Our command to you to have witnesses in such cases and to establish the witness, is implemented by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day.&#8217; This legislation is meant to benefit those who fear Allah&#8217;s punishment in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Allah provides, suffices, and makes a Way out of Every Hardship for Those Who have Taqwa</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاًوَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out. And He will provide him from where he never could imagine.) meaning, whoever has Taqwa of Allah in what He has commanded and avoids what He has forbidden, then Allah will make a way out for him from every difficulty and will provide for him from resources he never anticipated or thought about. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, &#8220;The most comprehensive Ayah in the Qur&#8217;an is,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَأْمُرُ بِالْعَدْلِ وَالإْحْسَانِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, Allah enjoins Al-`Adl (justice) and Al-Ihsan (doing good) (16:90). The greatest Ayah in the Qur&#8217;an that contains relief is,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out.)&#8221; `Ikrimah also commented on the Ayah, &#8220;Whoever divorces as Allah commanded him, then Allah will make a way out for him.&#8221; Similar was reported from Ibn `Abbas and Ad-Dahhak.`Abdullah bin Mas`ud and Masruq commented on the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out.) &#8220;It pertains to when one knows that if Allah wills He gives, and if He wills He deprives,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(from where he never could imagine.) from resources he did not anticipate&#8221; Qatadah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out.) &#8220;meaning, from every doubt and the horrors experienced at the time of death,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And He will provide him from where he never could imagine) from where he never thought of or anticipated.&#8221; Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that he rode the Prophet&#8217;s camel while sitting behind the Prophet , and the Messenger of Allah said to him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«يَا غُلَامُ إِنِّي مُعَلِّمُكَ كَلِمَاتٍ: احْفَظِ اللهَ يَحْفَظْكَ، احْفَظِ اللهَ تَجِدْهُ تُجَاهَكَ، وَإِذَا سَأَلْتَ فَاسْأَلِ اللهَ، وَإِذَا اسْتَعَنْتَ فَاسْتَعِنْ بِاللهِ، وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ الْأُمَّةَ لَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَنْفَعُوكَ لَمْ يَنْفَعُوكَ إِلَّا بِشَيْءٍ قَدْ كَتَبَهُ اللهُ لَكَ، وَلَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَضُرُّوكَ لَمْ يَضُرُّوكَ إِلَّا بِشَيْءٍ قَدْ كَتَبَهُ اللهُ عَلَيْكَ، رُفِعَتِ الْأَقْلَامُ وَجَفَّتِ الصُّحُف»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O boy! I will teach you words [so learn them]. Be mindful of Allah and He will protect you, be mindful of Allah and He will be on your side. If you ask, ask Allah, and if you seek help, seek it from Allah. Know that if the Ummah gather their strength to bring you benefit, they will never bring you benefit, except that which Allah has decreed for you. Know that if they gather their strength to harm you, they will never harm you, except with that which Allah has decreed against you. The pens have been raised and the pages are dry.) At-Tirmidhi collected this Hadith and said: &#8220;Hasan Sahih.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَـلِغُ أَمْرِهِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose.) meaning, Allah will execute His decisions and judgement that He made for him, in whatever way He wills and chooses,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدْراً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things.) This is like His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَكُلُّ شَىْءٍ عِندَهُ بِمِقْدَارٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Everything with Him is in (due) proportion.) (13:8)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَاللاَّئِى يَئِسْنَ مِنَ الْمَحِيضِ مِن نِّسَآئِكُمْ إِنِ ارْتَبْتُمْ فَعِدَّتُهُنَّ ثَلَـثَةُ أَشْهُرٍ وَاللَّـتِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ وَأُوْلَـتُ الاٌّحْمَالِ أَجَلُهُنَّ أَن يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ يُسْراً &#8211; ذَلِكَ أَمْرُ اللَّهِ أَنزَلَهُ إِلَيْكُمْ وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يُكَفِّرْ عَنْهُ سَيِّئَـتِهِ وَيُعْظِمْ لَهُ أَجْراً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4. Those in menopause among your women, for them the `Iddah, if you have doubt, is three months; and for those who have no courses. And for those who are pregnant, their `Iddah is until they lay down their burden; and whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make his matter easy for him.) (5. That is the command of Allah, which He has sent down to you; and whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will expiate from him his sins, and will increase his reward.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The `Iddah of Those in Menopause and Those Who do not have Menses</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted clarifies the waiting period of the woman in menopause. And that is the one whose menstruation has stopped due to her older age. Her `Iddah is three months instead of the three monthly cycles for those who menstruate, which is based upon the Ayah in (Surat) Al-Baqarah. [see 2:228] The same for the young, who have not reached the years of menstruation. Their `Iddah is three months like those in menopause. This is the meaning of His saying;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَاللَّـتِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and for those who have no courses&#8230;) as for His saying;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِنِ ارْتَبْتُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(if you have doubt&#8230;) There are two opinions: First, is the saying of a group of the Salaf, like Mujahid, Az-Zuhri and Ibn Zayd. That is, if they see blood and there is doubt if it was menstrual blood or not. The second, is that if you do not know the ruling in this case, then know that their `Iddah is three months. This has been reported from Sa`id bin Jubayr and it is the view preferred by Ibn Jarir. And this is the more obvious meaning. Supporting this view is what is reported from Ubay bin Ka`b that he said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! Some women were not mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an, the young, the old and the pregnant.&#8221; Allah the Exalted and Most Honored sent down this Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَاللاَّئِى يَئِسْنَ مِنَ الْمَحِيضِ مِن نِّسَآئِكُمْ إِنِ ارْتَبْتُمْ فَعِدَّتُهُنَّ ثَلَـثَةُ أَشْهُرٍ وَاللَّـتِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ وَأُوْلَـتُ الاٌّحْمَالِ أَجَلُهُنَّ أَن يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Those in menopause among your women, for them the `Iddah, if you have doubt, is three months; and for those who have no courses. And for those who are pregnant, their `Iddah is until they lay down their burden.) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded a simpler narration than this one from Ubay bin Ka`b who said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! When the Ayah in Surat Al-Baqarah was revealed prescribing the `Iddah of divorce, some people in Al-Madinah said, `There are still some women whose `Iddah has not been mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an. There are the young, the old whose menstruation is discontinued, and the pregnant.&#8217; Later on, this Ayah was revealed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَاللاَّئِى يَئِسْنَ مِنَ الْمَحِيضِ مِن نِّسَآئِكُمْ إِنِ ارْتَبْتُمْ فَعِدَّتُهُنَّ ثَلَـثَةُ أَشْهُرٍ وَاللَّـتِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Those in menopause among your women, for them the `Iddah, if you have doubt, is three months; and for those who have no courses.)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>`Iddah of Pregnant Women</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأُوْلَـتُ الاٌّحْمَالِ أَجَلُهُنَّ أَن يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And for those who are pregnant, their `Iddah is until they lay down their burden;) Allah says: the pregnant woman&#8217;s `Iddah ends when she gives birth, whether in the case of divorce or death of the husband, according to the agreement of the majority of scholars of the Salaf and later generations. This is based upon this honorable Ayah and what is mentioned in the Prophetic Sunnah. Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Salamah said, &#8220;A man came to Ibn `Abbas while Abu Hurayrah was sitting with him and said, `Give me your verdict regarding a lady who delivered a baby forty days after the death of her husband.&#8217; Ibn `Abbas said,` [Her `Iddah period lasts until] the end of the longest among the two prescribed periods.&#8217; I recited,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأُوْلَـتُ الاٌّحْمَالِ أَجَلُهُنَّ أَن يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(For those who are pregnant, their prescribed period is until they deliver their burdens;) Abu Hurayrah said, `I agree with my cousin (Abu Salamah).&#8217; Then Ibn `Abbas sent his slave Kurayb to Umm Salamah to ask her. She replied, `The husband of Subay`ah Al-Aslamiyyah was killed while she was pregnant, and she delivered a baby forty days after his death. Then she received a marriage proposal and Allah&#8217;s Messenger married her to somebody. Abu As-Sanabil was one of those who proposed to her.&#8221; Al-Bukhari collected this short form of the Hadith, which Muslim and other scholars of Hadith collected using its longer form. Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Miswar bin Makhramah said, &#8220;Subay`ah Al-Aslamiyyah gave birth to a child a few days after the death of her husband. When she finished the postdelivery term, she was proposed to. So she sought the permission of Allah&#8217;s Messenger for the marriage, and he permitted her to marry, so she got married.&#8221; Al-Bukhari collected this narration, as did Muslim, Abu Dawud, An-Nasa&#8217;i and Ibn Majah with a different chain of narration from the Hadith of Subay`ah. Muslim bin Al-Hajjaj recorded that `Ubaydullah bin `Abdullah bin `Utbah said that his father wrote to `Umar bin `Abdullah bin Al-Arqam Az-Zuhri, requesting that he go to Subay`ah bint Al-Harith Al-Aslamiyyah to ask her about the matter in question, and about what Allah&#8217;s Messenger said to her when she sought his verdict. `Umar bin `Abdullah wrote to `Ubaydullah bin `Abdullah bin `Utbah informing him that Subay`ah told him that she had been married to Sa`d bin Khawlah, and he was one of those who participated in the battle of Badr. He died during the Farewell Pilgrimage, while she was pregnant. Soon after his death, she gave birth. When she passed the postnatal term, she beautified herself for those who might propose to her. Abu As-Sanabil bin Ba`kak came to her and said, `Why do I see you have beautified yourself Do you wish to remarry By Allah, you cannot marry unless four months and ten days have passed.&#8221; Subay`ah said, &#8220;When he said that, I dressed myself in the evening and went to Allah&#8217;s Messenger and asked him about his verdict. He gave me a religious verdict that I was allowed to marry after I had given birth to my child, saying I could marry if I wish.&#8221; This is the narration that Muslim collected. Al-Bukhari collected this Hadith in a shorter form. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ يُسْراً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make his matter easy for him.) means, Allah will make his matters lenient for him and will soon bring forth relief and a quick way out,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ذَلِكَ أَمْرُ اللَّهِ أَنزَلَهُ إِلَيْكُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(That is the command of Allah, which He has sent down to you;) meaning, this is His commandment and legislation that He sent down to you through His Messenger ,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يُكَفِّرْ عَنْهُ سَيِّئَـتِهِ وَيُعْظِمْ لَهُ أَجْراً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will expiate from him his sins, and will increase his reward.) means, Allah will prevent what he fears and multiply his reward even for the little good he does.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَسْكِنُوهُنَّ مِنْ حَيْثُ سَكَنتُم مِّن وُجْدِكُمْ وَلاَ تُضَآرُّوهُنَّ لِتُضَيِّقُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ وَإِن كُنَّ أُوْلَـتِ حَمْلٍ فَأَنفِقُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ حَتَّى يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ فَإِنْ أَرْضَعْنَ لَكُمْ فَـَاتُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ وَأْتَمِرُواْ بَيْنَكُمْ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَإِن تَعَاسَرْتُمْ فَسَتُرْضِعُ لَهُ أُخْرَى &#8211; لِيُنفِقْ ذُو سَعَةٍ مِّن سَعَتِهِ وَمَن قُدِرَ عَلَيْهِ رِزْقُهُ فَلْيُنفِقْ مِمَّآ ءَاتَاهُ اللَّهُ لاَ يُكَلِّفُ اللَّهُ نَفْساً إِلاَّ مَآ ءَاتَاهَا سَيَجْعَلُ اللَّهُ بَعْدَ عُسْرٍ يُسْراً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(6. Lodge them where you dwell, according to what you have, and do not harm them so as to suppress them. And if they are pregnant, then spend on them till they lay down their burden. Then if they suckle the children for you, give them their due payment, and let each of you deal with each other in a mannerly way. But if you make difficulties for one another, then some other woman may suckle for him.) (7. Let the rich man spend according to his means; and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allah has given him. Allah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him. Allah will grant after hardship, ease.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Divorced Woman has the Right to Decent Accommodations, and what is Reasonable</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted orders His faithful servants that when one of them divorces his wife, he should provide housing for her until the end of her `Iddah period,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَسْكِنُوهُنَّ مِنْ حَيْثُ سَكَنتُم]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Lodge them where you dwell,) means, with you,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[مِّن وُجْدِكُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(according to what you have,) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and several others said, it refers to &#8220;Your ability.&#8221; Qatadah said, &#8220;If you can only afford to accommodate her in a corner of your house, then do so.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Forbidding Ill-Treatment of Divorced Women</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلاَ تُضَآرُّوهُنَّ لِتُضَيِّقُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and do not harm them in order to suppress them.) Muqatil bin Hayyan said, &#8220;meaning, do not annoy her to force her to pay her way out nor expel her from your house.&#8221; Ath-Thawri said from Mansur, from Abu Ad-Duha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلاَ تُضَآرُّوهُنَّ لِتُضَيِّقُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and do not harm them in order to suppress them) &#8220;He divorces her, and when a few days remain, he takes her back.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Irrevocable Divorced Pregnant Woman has the Right of Support (Maintenance) from Her Husband until She gives Birth</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَإِن كُنَّ أُوْلَـتِ حَمْلٍ فَأَنفِقُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ حَتَّى يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And if they are pregnant, then spend on them till they lay down their burden.) This is about the woman who is irrevocably divorced. If she is pregnant, then she is to be spent on her until she lays down her burden. This is supported due to the fact that if she is revocably divorced, the she has then right to receive her support (maintenance) whether she is pregnant or not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Divorced Mother may take Compensation for suckling Her Child</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَإِنْ أَرْضَعْنَ لَكُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then if they suckle them for you,) meaning, when pregnant women give birth and they are irrevocably divorced by the expiration of the `Iddah, then at that time they may either suckle the child or not. But that is only after she nourishes him with the milk, that is the early on milk which the infant&#8217;s well-being depends upon. Then, if she suckles, she has the right to compensation for it. She is allowed to enter into a contract with the father or his representative in return for whatever payment they agree to. This is why Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَإِنْ أَرْضَعْنَ لَكُمْ فَـَاتُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then if they suckle the children for you, give them their due payment,) Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأْتَمِرُواْ بَيْنَكُمْ بِمَعْرُوفٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and let each of you deal with each other in a mannerly way.) meaning, the affairs of the divorced couple should be managed in a just way without causing harm to either one of them, just as Allah the Exalted said in Surat Al-Baqarah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ تُضَآرَّ وَلِدَةٌ بِوَلَدِهَا وَلاَ مَوْلُودٌ لَّهُ بِوَلَدِهِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(No mother shall be treated unfairly on account of her child, nor father on account of child.) (2:233) Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَإِن تَعَاسَرْتُمْ فَسَتُرْضِعُ لَهُ أُخْرَى]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(But if you make difficulties for one another, then some other woman may suckle for him.) meaning, if the divorced couple disagrees, because the woman asks for an unreasonable fee for suckling their child, and the father refuses to pay the amount or offers an unreasonable amount, he may find another woman to suckle his child. If the mother agrees to accept the amount that was to be paid to the woman who agreed to suckle the child, then she has more right to suckle her own child. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لِيُنفِقْ ذُو سَعَةٍ مِّن سَعَتِهِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Let the rich man spend according to his means;) means, the wealthy father or his representative should spend on the child according to his means,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن قُدِرَ عَلَيْهِ رِزْقُهُ فَلْيُنفِقْ مِمَّآ ءَاتَاهُ اللَّهُ لاَ يُكَلِّفُ اللَّهُ نَفْساً إِلاَّ مَآ ءَاتَاهَا]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allah has given him. Allah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him.) This is as Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ يُكَلِّفُ اللَّهُ نَفْسًا إِلاَّ وُسْعَهَا]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah will grant after hardship, ease.) This is a sure promise from Him, and indeed, Allah&#8217;s promises are true and He never breaks them, This is an Allah&#8217;s saying;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَإِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْراً &#8211; إِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْراً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, along with every hardship is relief. Verily, along with every hardship is relief.) [94:5-6] There is a relevant Hadith that we should mention here. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, &#8220;A man and his wife from an earlier generation were poor. Once when the man came back from a journey, he went to his wife saying to her, while feeling hunger and fatigued, `Do you have anything to eat&#8217; She said, `Yes, receive the good news of Allah&#8217;s provisions.&#8217; He again said to her, `If you have anything to eat, bring it to me.&#8217; She said, `Wait a little longer.&#8217; She was awaiting Allah&#8217;s mercy. When the matter was prolonged, he said to her, `Get up and bring me whatever you have to eat, because I am real hungry and fatigued.&#8217; She said, `I will. Soon I will open the oven&#8217;s cover, so do not be hasty.&#8217; When he was busy and refrained from insisting for a while, she said to herself, `I should look in my oven.&#8217; So she got up and looked in her oven and found it full of the meat of a lamb, and her mortar and pestle was full of seed grains; it was crushing the seeds on its own. So, she took out what was in the mortar and pestle, after shaking it to remove everything from inside, and also took the meat out that she found in the oven.&#8221; Abu Hurayrah added, &#8220;By He in Whose Hand is the life of Abu Al-Qasim (Prophet Muhammad )! This is the same statement that Muhammad said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«لَوْ أَخَذَتْ مَا فِي رَحْيَيْهَا وَلَمْ تَنْفُضْهَا (لَطَحَنَتْهَا) إِلى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَة»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Had she taken out what was in her mortar and not emptied it fully by shaking it, it would have continued crushing the seeds until the Day of Resurrection.)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَكَأِيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ عَتَتْ عَنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّهَا وَرُسُلِهِ فَحَاسَبْنَـهَا حِسَاباً شَدِيداً وَعَذَّبْنَـهَا عَذَاباً نُّكْراً &#8211; فَذَاقَتْ وَبَالَ أَمْرِهَا وَكَانَ عَـقِبَةُ أَمْرِهَا خُسْراً &#8211; أَعَدَّ اللَّهُ لَهُمْ عَذَاباً شَدِيداً فَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ يأُوْلِى الأَلْبَـبِ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ قَدْ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ إِلَيْكُمْ ذِكْراً &#8211; رَّسُولاً يَتْلُو عَلَيْكُمْ ءَايَـتِ اللَّهِ مُبَيِّنَـتٍ لِّيُخْرِجَ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ مِنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ وَمَن يُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ وَيَعْمَلْ صَـلِحاً يُدْخِلْهُ جَنَّـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَداً قَدْ أَحْسَنَ اللَّهُ لَهُ رِزْقاً ]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ يأُوْلِى الأَلْبَـبِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So have Taqwa of Allah, O men of understanding,) meaning, `O you who have sound understanding, do not be like them because if you do, you will suffer what they suffered, O people of comprehension,&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(who believe) meaning, in Allah and His Messengers,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[قَدْ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ إِلَيْكُمْ ذِكْراً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah has indeed sent down to you a Reminder.) meaning, this Qur&#8217;an. Allah also said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِنَّا نَحْنُ نَزَّلْنَا الذِّكْرَ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَـفِظُونَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr and surely, We will preserve it.) (15:9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Qualities of the Messenger</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[رَّسُولاً يَتْلُو عَلَيْكُمْ ءَايَـتِ اللَّهِ مُبَيِّنَـتٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(A Messenger, who recites to you the Ayat of Allah containing clear explanations,) Some said that the Messenger is the subject of what is being sent [as a reminder] because the Messenger is the one that conveys the Dhikr. Ibn Jarir said that what is correct is that the Messenger explains the Dhikr. This is why Allah the Exalted said here,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[رَّسُولاً يَتْلُو عَلَيْكُمْ ءَايَـتِ اللَّهِ مُبَيِّنَـتٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(A Messenger, who recites to you the Ayat of Allah containing clear explanations,) meaning, plain and apparent. The statement of Allah;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لِّيُخْرِجَ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ مِنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(that He may take out those who believe and do righteous good deeds, from the darkness to the light.) Allah&#8217;s is like saying;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[كِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَـهُ إِلَيْكَ لِتُخْرِجَ النَّاسَ مِنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(A Book which We have revealed unto you in order that you might lead mankind out of darkness) (14:1), and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[اللَّهُ وَلِيُّ الَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ يُخْرِجُهُم مِّنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah is the Guardian of those who believe. He brings them out from darkness into light.) (2:257) meaning, out of the darkness of disbelief and ignorance into the light of faith and knowledge. Allah the Exalted called the revelation that He has sent down, light, on account of the guidance that it brings. Allah also called it Ruh, in that, it brings life to the hearts,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَكَذَلِكَ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ رُوحاً مِّنْ أَمْرِنَا مَا كُنتَ تَدْرِى مَا الْكِتَـبُ وَلاَ الإِيمَـنُ وَلَـكِن جَعَلْنَـهُ نُوراً نَّهْدِى بِهِ مَن نَّشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا وَإِنَّكَ لَتَهْدِى إِلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And thus We have sent to you Ruh of our command. You knew not what is the book, nor what is faith But We have made it a light wherewith we guide whosoever of Our servants We will. And verily, you are indeed guiding to the straight path.) (42:52) Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ وَيَعْمَلْ صَـلِحاً يُدْخِلْهُ جَنَّـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَداً قَدْ أَحْسَنَ اللَّهُ لَهُ رِزْقاً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whosoever believes in Allah and performs righteous good deeds, He will admit him into Gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. Allah has indeed granted for him an excellent provision.) was explained several times before, and therefore, we do not need to repeat its explanation here. All the thanks and praises are due to Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[اللَّهُ الَّذِى خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَـوَتٍ وَمِنَ الاٌّرْضِ مِثْلَهُنَّ يَتَنَزَّلُ الاٌّمْرُ بَيْنَهُنَّ لِّتَعْلَمُواْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ قَدْ أَحَاطَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عِلْمَا ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(12. It is Allah Who has created seven heavens and of the earth the like thereof. His command descends between them, that you may know that Allah has power over all things, and that Allah surrounds all things with (His) knowledge.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Allah&#8217;s Perfect Power</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted asserts His perfect power and infinite greatness, so that the great religion that He has legislated is honored and implemented,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[اللَّهُ الَّذِى خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَـوَتٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(It is Allah Who has created seven heavens) Allah said in similar Ayat, like what Prophet Nuh said to his people,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَلَمْ تَرَوْاْ كَيْفَ خَلَقَ اللَّهُ سَبْعَ سَمَـوَتٍ طِبَاقاً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(See you not how Allah has created the seven heavens one above another) (71:15), and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[تُسَبِّحُ لَهُ السَّمَـوَتُ السَّبْعُ وَالاٌّرْضُ وَمَن فِيهِنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify him.) (17:44) Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمِنَ الاٌّرْضِ مِثْلَهُنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and of the earth the like thereof.) means, He created seven earths. In the Two Sahihs, there is a Hadith that states,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«مَنْ ظَلَمَ قِيدَ شِبْرٍ مِنَ الْأَرْضِ طُوِّقَهُ مِنْ سَبْعِ أَرَضِين»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Whoever usurps the land of somebody unjustly, even if it was a mere hand span, then his neck will be encircled with it down to the seven earths.) And in Sahih Al-Bukhari the wording is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«خُسِفَ بِهِ إِلَى سَبْعِ أَرَضِين»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;he will sink down to the seven earths.) In the beginning of my book, Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah, I mentioned the various narrations for this Hadith when I narrated the story of the creation of the earth. All the thanks and praise is due to Allah. Those who explained this Hadith to mean the seven continents have brought an implausible explanation that contradicts the letter of the Qur&#8217;an and the Hadith without having proof. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat At-Talaq, all the thanks and praise is due to Allah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from Fataawaa Islaamiyyah (3/264)]<br />
Shaykh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez Ibn ‘Abdullaah Ibn Baaz (rahimahullaah)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Q]:</strong> What are the valid reasons for divorce, from your point of view your Eminence?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [A]:</strong> For divorce there are many reasons: From them (i.e. the many reasons for divorce) is lack of harmony between the husband and the wife such that it does not cause love from either one for the other or from both of them. And from them is bad behaviour of the woman or lack of listening and obedience to the husband in what he commands of the good. And from them is bad behaviour of the husband and his oppressing the woman and lack of fairness/justice for her. And from them is his falling short of fulfilling her rights and her falling short of fulfilling his rights. And from this is the occurrence of wrongdoing from one of them or both of them such that the situation is made worse because of this, so the only route is divorce, and from this is the husband or the wife turning to intoxicants and smoking. And from them is the bad state of affairs between the woman and the husband&#8217;s parents or either of them, and the lack of use of wise politics in dealing with each other. And from them is the lack of the woman in caring and showing concern in cleanliness and dressing up and beautifying herself for her husband with perfume and good speech and cheerfulness when she meets her husband and when they have sexual intercourse.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">By Imaam ’Abdullaah Ibn ’Abdul ’Azeez Ibn Baaz</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it permissible for a menstruating woman to recite the du’aa’s of the Day of ‘Arafaah despite the fact that they include aayaat from the Qur’aan?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing wrong with the woman who is menstruating or bleeding after childbirth reciting du’aa’s that are prescribed for the rituals of Hajj. Also, according to the correct opinion, there is nothing wrong with them reading Qur’aan as well, because there is no clear <i>saheeh</i> report that states that the woman who is menstruating or bleeding after childbirth should not read Qur’aan. It was reported that the man who is <i>junub</i> (in a state of impurity following sexual activity), in particular, should not read Qur’aan whilst he is <i>junub</i>, because of the hadeeth of ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him). With regard to the woman who is menstruating or bleeding after childbirth there is the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar: &#8220;The menstruating woman and the man who is junub should not read Qur’aan&#8221; – but it is da’eef (weak), because the hadeeth was reported by Ismaa’eel ibn ‘Ayyaash from the Hijaaziyeen, and he is da’eef in his reports from them. But she should read without touching the Mus-haf (copy of the Qur’aan in Arabic), from memory. In the case of the man who is junub, he should not recite Qur’an at all, either from memory or from the Mus-haf, until he has done ghusl. The difference between them is that the timespan for the one who is junub is very short, he can do ghusl straightaway, as soon as he finished having intercourse with his wife. He is not junub for long, and it is up to him when he wants to do ghusl; if he cannot find water, he can do tayammum (&#8220;dry ablution&#8221; using dust etc.) and pray and read Qur’aan. But the woman who is menstruating or bleeding after childbirth has no control over her situation – it rests with Allaah, may He be glorified. The period lasts for a number of days and nifaas (post-natal bleeding) is the same. So it is permissible for them to recite Qur’aan so that they do not forget it and so that they do not miss out on the blessings of reciting Qur’aan and learning the rules of sharee’ah from the Book of Allaah. If that is the case, then it should certainly be permissible for them to read books containing du’aas that are a mixture of aayaat and ahaadeeth, etc… this is the more correct of the two opinions of the scholars, may Allaah have mercy on them. [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Question:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I read some Tafseers (Qur’anic commentaries) when I am not taahir (ritually pure), such as during my monthly period. Is there any sin on me for doing that? Will I be committing a sin if I do that?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no sin on the woman who is menstruating or bleeding after childbirth if she reads books of Tafseer or even if she reads Qur’aan without touching the Mus-haf, according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions. As for the man who is junub, he should not read Qur’aan at all until he has done ghusl, but he can read books of Tafseer and hadeeth etc., without reading whatever they contain of aayaat, because of the report that nothing would stop the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) from reading Qur’aan except janaabah (being junub). According to a hadeeth narrated by Imaam Ahmad with a jayyid isnaad, he said: &#8220;As for the man who is junub, he should not read even one aayah.&#8221; [2]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement; (Allah will grant after hardship, ease.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a sure promise from Him, and indeed, Allah&#8217;s promises are true and He never breaks them, This is an Allah&#8217;s saying; (Verily, along with every hardship is relief. Verily, along with every hardship is relief.) [94:5-6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a relevant Hadith that we should mention here. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;A man and his wife from an earlier generation were poor. Once when the man came back from a journey, he went to his wife saying to her, while feeling hunger and fatigued, `Do you have anything to eat&#8217; She said, `Yes, receive the good news of Allah&#8217;s provisions.&#8217; He again said to her, `If you have anything to eat, bring it to me.&#8217; She said, `Wait a little longer.&#8217; She was awaiting Allah&#8217;s mercy. When the matter was prolonged, he said to her, `Get up and bring me whatever you have to eat, because I am real hungry and fatigued.&#8217; She said, `I will. Soon I will open the oven&#8217;s cover, so do not be hasty.&#8217; When he was busy and refrained from insisting for a while, she said to herself, `I should look in my oven.&#8217; So she got up and looked in her oven and found it full of the meat of a lamb, and her mortar and pestle was full of seed grains; it was crushing the seeds on its own. So, she took out what was in the mortar and pestle, after shaking it to remove everything from inside, and also took the meat out that she found in the oven.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah added, &#8220;By He in Whose Hand is the life of Abu Al-Qasim (Prophet Muhammad )! This is the same statement that Muhammad said, (Had she taken out what was in her mortar and not emptied it fully by shaking it, it would have continued crushing the seeds until the Day of Resurrection.)&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Enjoining certain Manners so that the Mothers of the Believers may be an Example; and the Prohibition of Tabarruj</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tafsir Ibn Kathir</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the good manners which Allah enjoined upon the wives of the Prophet so that they would be an example for the women of the Ummah to follow. Allah said, addressing the wives of the Prophet that they should fear Allah as He commanded them, and that no other woman is like them or can be their equal in virtue and status. Then Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَلاَ تَخْضَعْنَ بِالْقَوْلِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(then be not soft in speech,) As-Suddi and others said, this means, do not be gentle in speech when addressing men. Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَيَطْمَعَ الَّذِى فِى قَلْبِهِ مَرَضٌ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(lest he in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire,) means, something unclean.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَقُلْنَ قَوْلاً مَّعْرُوفاً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(but speak in an honorable manner.) Ibn Zayd said: &#8220;Decent and honorable talk that is known to be good.&#8221; This means that she should address non-Mahram men in a manner in which there is no softness, i.e., a woman should not address a non-Mahram man in the same way that she addresses her husband.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَقَرْنَ فِى بُيُوتِكُنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And stay in your houses,) means, stay in your houses and do not come out except for a purpose. One of the purposes mentioned in Shari`ah is prayer in the Masjid, so long as the conditions are fulfilled, as the Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«لَا تَمْنَعُوا إِمَاءَ اللهِ مَسَاجِدَ اللهِ وَلْيَخْرُجْنَ وَهُنَّ تَفِلَات»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Do not prevent the female servants of Allah from the Masjids of Allah, but have them go out without wearing fragrance.) According to another report:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«وَبُيُوتُهُنَّ خَيْرٌ لَهُن»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(even though their houses are better for them.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلاَ تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَـهِلِيَّةِ الاٍّولَى]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and do not Tabarruj yourselves like the Tabarruj of the times of ignorance,) Mujahid said: &#8220;Women used to go out walking in front of men, and this was the Tabarruj of Jahiliyyah.&#8221; Qatadah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلاَ تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَـهِلِيَّةِ الاٍّولَى]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and do not Tabarruj yourselves like the Taburruj of the times of ignorance,) &#8220;When they go out of their homes walking in a shameless and flirtatious manner, and Allah, may He be exalted, forbade that.&#8221; Muqatil bin Hayyan said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلاَ تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَـهِلِيَّةِ الاٍّولَى]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and do not Tabarruj yourselves like the Tabarruj of the times of ignorance,) &#8220;Tabarruj is when a woman puts a Khimar on her head but does not tie it properly.&#8221; So her necklaces, earrings and neck, and all of that can be seen. This is Tabarruj, and Allah addresses all the women of the believers with regard to Tabarruj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأَقِمْنَ الصَّلَوةَ وَءَاتِينَ الزَّكَـوةَ وَأَطِعْنَ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and perform the Salah, and give Zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger.) Allah first forbids them from evil, then He enjoins them to do good by establishing regular prayer, which means worshipping Allah alone with no partner or associate, and paying Zakah, which means doing good to other people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأَطِعْنَ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and obey Allah and His Messenger.) This is an instance of something specific being followed by something general.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s saying: (And let them not stamp their feet&#8230;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During Jahiliyyah, when women walked in the street wearing anklets and no one could hear them, they would stamp their feet so that men could hear their anklets ringing. Allah forbade the believing women to do this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By the same token, if there is any other kind of adornment that is hidden, women are forbidden to make any movements that would reveal what is hidden, because Allah says: (And let them not stamp their feet&#8230;) to the end of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From that, women are also prohibited from wearing scent and perfume when they are going outside the home, lest men should smell their perfume. Abu `Isa At-Tirmidhi recorded that Abu Musa, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Prophet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Every eye commits fornication and adultery, and when a woman puts on perfume and passes through a gathering, she is such and such) &#8212; meaning an adulteress.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;And there is a similar report from Abu Hurayrah, and this is Hasan Sahih.&#8221; It was also recorded by Abu Dawud and An-Nasa&#8217;i.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By the same token, women are also forbidden to walk in the middle of the street, because of what this involves of wanton display.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dawud recorded that Abu Usayd Al-Ansari said that he heard the Messenger of Allah , as he was coming out of the Masjid and men and women were mixing in the street, telling the women:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Keep back, for you have no right to walk in the middle of the street. You should keep to the sides of the road.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The women used to cling to the walls so much that their clothes would catch on the walls.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And all of you beg Allah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful.) means, practice what you are commanded in these beautiful manners and praiseworthy characteristics, and give up the evil ways of the people of Jahiliyyah, for the greatest success is to be found in doing what Allah and His Messenger command and avoiding what He forbids.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah is the source of strength.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَـهُ فِى لَيْلَةِ الْقَدْرِ </span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"> وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ</span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ أَلْفِ شَهْرٍ</span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">تَنَزَّلُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ وَالرُّوحُ فِيهَا بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِم مِّن كُلِّ أَمْرٍ</span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">سَلَـمٌ هِىَ حَتَّى مَطْلَعِ الْفَجْرِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(1. Verily, We have sent it down in the Night of Al-Qadr.) (2. And what will make you know what the Night of Al-Qadr is) (3. The Night of Al-Qadr is better than a thousand months.) (4. Therein descend the angels and the Ruh by their Lord&#8217;s permission with every matter.) (5. There is peace until the appearance of dawn.)</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>The Virtues of the Night of Al-Qadr(the Decree)</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah informs that He sent the Qur&#8217;an down during the Night of Al-Qadr, and it is a blessed night about which Allah says,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَاهُ فِي لَيْلَةٍ مُّبَارَكَةٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(We sent it down on a blessed night.)</span> (44:3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Night of Al-Qadr and it occurs during the month of Ramadan. This is as Allah says,</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ الَّذِي أُنزِلَ فِيهِ الْقُرْآنُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Qur&#8217;an.)</span> (2:185)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Abbas and others have said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Allah sent the Qur&#8217;an down all at one time from the Preserved Tablet (<em>Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz</em>) to the House of Might (<em>Baytul-`Izzah</em>), which is in the heaven of this world. Then it came down in parts to the Messenger of Allah based upon the incidents that occurred over a period of twenty-three years.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah magnified the status of the Night of Al-Qadr, which He chose for the revelation of the Mighty Qur&#8217;an, by His saying,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ &#8211; لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ أَلْفِ شَهْرٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(And what will make you know what the Night of Al-Qadr is The Night of Al-Qadr is better than a thousand months.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah &#8220;When Ramadan would come, the Messenger of Allah would say,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قَدْ جَاءَكُمْ شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ، شَهْرٌ مُبَارَكٌ، افْتَرَضَ اللهُ عَلَيْكُمْ صِيَامَهُ، تُفْتَحُ فِيهِ أَبْوَابُ الْجَنَّةِ، وَتُغْلَقُ فِيهِ أَبْوَابُ الْجَحِيمِ، وَتُغَلُّ فِيهِ الشَّيَاطِينُ، فِيهِ لَيْلَةٌ خَيْرٌ مِنْ أَلْفِ شَهْرٍ، مَنْ حُرِمَ خَيْرَهَا فَقَدْ حُرِم</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">(Verily, the month of Ramadan has come to you all. It is a blessed month, which Allah has obligated you all to fast. During it the gates of Paradise are opened, the gates of Hell are closed and the devils are shackled. In it there is a night that is better than one thousand months. Whoever is deprived of its good, then he has truly been deprived.)&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nasa&#8217;i recorded this same Hadith. Aside from the fact that worship during the Night of Al-Qadr is equivalent to worship performed for a period of one thousand months, it is also confirmed in the Two Sahihs from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ قَامَ لَيْلَةَ الْقَدْرِ إِيمَانًا وَاحْتِسَابًا غُفِرَ لَهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِنْ ذَنْبِه</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">(Whoever stands (in prayer) during the Night of Al-Qadr with faith and expecting reward (from Allah), he will be forgiven for his previous sins.)</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>The Descent of the Angels and the Decree for Every Good during the Night of Al-Qadr</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">تَنَزَّلُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ وَالرُّوحُ فِيهَا بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِم مِّن كُلِّ أَمْرٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Therein descend the angels and the Ruh by their Lord&#8217;s permission with every matter.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">meaning, the angels descend in abundance during the Night of Al-Qadr due to its abundant blessings. The angels descend with the descending of blessings and mercy, just as they descend when the Qur&#8217;an is recited, they surround the circles of Dhikr (remembrance of Allah) and they lower their wings with true respect for the student of knowledge. In reference to Ar-Ruh, it is said that here it means the angel Jibril. Therefore, the wording of the Ayah is a method of adding the name of the distinct object (in this case Jibril) separate from the general group (in this case the angels). Concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">مِّن كُلِّ أَمْرٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(with every matter.)</span> Mujahid said, &#8220;Peace concerning every matter.&#8221; Sa`id bin Mansur said, `Isa bin Yunus told us that Al-A`mash narrated to them that Mujahid said concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">سَلَـمٌ هِىَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(There is peace)</span> &#8220;It is security in which Shaytan cannot do any evil or any harm.&#8221; Qatadah and others have said, <strong>&#8220;The matters are determined during it, and the times of death and provisions are measured out (i.e., decided) during it.&#8221;</strong> Allah says,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">فِيهَا يُفْرَقُ كُلُّ أَمْرٍ حَكِيمٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Therein is decreed every matter of decree.)</span> (44:4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah says,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">سَلَـمٌ هِىَ حَتَّى مَطْلَعِ الْفَجْرِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(There is peace until the appearance of dawn.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa`id bin Mansur said, &#8220;Hushaym narrated to us on the authority of Abu Ishaq, who narrated that Ash-Sha`bi said concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">تَنَزَّلُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ وَالرُّوحُ فِيهَا بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِم مِّن كُلِّ أَمْرٍ &#8211; سَلَـمٌ هِىَ حَتَّى مَطْلَعِ الْفَجْرِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(With every matter, there is a peace until the appearance of dawn.)</span> `<strong>The angels giving the greetings of peace during the Night of Al-Qadr to the people in the Masjids until the coming of Fajr (dawn)</strong>.&#8221;&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qatadah and Ibn Zayd both said concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">سَلَـمٌ هِىَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(There is peace.)</span> &#8220;This means all of it is good and there is no evil in it until the coming of Fajr (dawn).&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Specifying the Night of Decree and its Signs</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is supported by what Imam Ahmad recorded from `Ubadah bin As-Samit that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ فِي الْعَشْرِ الْبَوَاقِي، مَنْ قَامَهُنَّ ابْتِغَاءَ حِسْبَتِهِنَّ فَإِنَّ اللهَ يَغْفِرُ لَهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِنْ ذَنْبِهِ وَمَا تَأَخَّرَ، وَهِيَ لَيْلَةُ وِتْرٍ: تِسْعٍ أَوْ سَبْعٍ أَوْ خَامِسَةٍ أَوْ ثَالِثَةٍ أَوْ آخِرِ لَيْلَة</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">(The Night of Al-Qadr occurs during the last ten (nights). Whoever stands for them (in prayer) seeking their reward, then indeed Allah will forgive his previous sins and his latter sins. It is an odd night: the ninth, or the seventh, or the fifth, or the third or the last night (of Ramadan).) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah also said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ أَمَارَةَ لَيْلَةِ الْقَدْرِ أَنَّهَا صَافِيَةٌ بَلْجَةٌ، كَأَنَّ فِيهَا قَمَرًا سَاطِعًا، سَاكِنَةٌ سَاجِيَةٌ، لَا بَرْدَ فِيهَا وَلَا حَرَّ، وَلَا يَحِلُّ لِكَوْكَبٍ يُرْمَى بِهِ فِيهَا حَتْى يُصْبِحَ، وَإِنَّ أَمَارَتَهَا أَنَّ الشَّمْسَ صَبِيحَتَهَا تَخْرُجُ مُسْتَوِيَةً لَيْسَ لَهَا شُعَاعٌ، مِثْلَ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَلَا يَحِلُّ لِلشَّيْطَانِ أَنْ يَخْرُجَ مَعَهَا يَوْمَئِذ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">(Verily, the sign of the Night of Al-Qadr is that it is pure and glowing as if there were a bright, tranquil, calm moon during it. It is not cold, nor is it hot, and no shooting star is permitted until morning. Its sign is that the sun appears on the morning following it smooth having no rays on it, just like the moon on a full moon night. Shaytan is not allowed to come out with it (the sun) on that day.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This chain of narration is good. In its text there is some oddities and in some of its wordings there are things that are objectionable. Abu Dawud mentioned a section in his Sunan that he titled, &#8220;Chapter: Clarification that the Night of Al-Qadr occurs during every Ramadan.&#8221; Then he recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah was asked about the Night of Al-Qadr while I was listening and he said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">هِيَ فِي كُلِّ رَمَضَان</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(It occurs during every Ramadan.)&#8221; The men of this chain of narration are all reliable, but Abu Dawud said that Shu`bah and Sufyan both narrated it from Ishaq and they both considered it to be a statement of the Companion (Ibn `Umar, and thus not the statement of the Prophet ).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been reported that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Messenger of Allah performed I`tikaf during the first ten nights of Ramadan and we performed I`tikaf with him. Then Jibril came to him and said, `That which you are seeking is in front of you.&#8217; So the Prophet performed I`tikaf during the middle ten days of Ramadan and we also performed I`tikaf with him. Then Jibril came to him and said; `That which you are seeking is ahead of you.&#8217; So the Prophet stood up and gave a sermon on the morning of the twentieth of Ramadan and he said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ كَانَ اعْتَكَفَ مَعِيَ فَلْيَرْجِعْ فَإِنِّي رَأَيْتُ لَيْلَةَ الْقَدْرِ، وَإِنِّي أُنْسِيتُهَا، وَإِنَّهَا فِي الْعَشْرِ الْأَوَاخِرِ فِي وِتْرٍ، وَإِنِّي رَأَيْتُ كَأَنِّي أَسْجُدُ فِي طِينٍ وَمَاء</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#808000;">(Whoever performed I`tikaf with me, let him come back (for I`tikaf again), for verily I saw the Night of Al-Qadr, and I was caused to forget it, and indeed it is during the last ten (nights). It is during an odd night and I saw myself as if I were prostrating in mud and water.)</span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The roof of the Masjid was made of dried palm-tree leaves and we did not see anything (i.e., clouds) in the sky. But then a patch of wind-driven clouds came and it rained. So the Prophet lead us in prayer until we saw the traces of mud and water on the forehead of the Messenger of Allah , which confirmed his dream.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one narration it adds that this occurred on the morning of the twenty-first night (meaning the next morning). They both (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) recorded it in the Two Sahihs. Ash-Shafi`i said, &#8220;This Hadith is the most authentic of what has been reported.&#8221; It has also been said that it is on the twenty-third night due to a Hadith narrated from `Abdullah bin Unays in Sahih Muslim. It has also been said that it is on the twenty-fifth night due to what Al-Bukhari recorded from Ibn `Abbas that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الْتَمِسُوهَا فِي الْعَشْرِ الْأَوَاخِرِ مِنْ رَمَضَانَ فِي تَاسِعَةٍ تَبْقَى، فِي سَابِعَةٍ تَبْقَى، فِي خَامِسَةٍ تَبْقَى</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#808000;">(Seek it in the last ten (nights) of Ramadan. In the ninth it still remains, in the seventh it still remains, in the fifth it still remains.)</span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many have explained this Hadith to refer to the odd nights, and this is the most apparent and most popular explanation. It has also been said that it occurs on the twenty-seventh night because of what Muslim recorded in his Sahih from Ubay bin Ka`b that the Messenger of Allah mentioned that it was on the twenty-seventh night. Imam Ahmad recorded from Zirr that he asked Ubayy bin Ka`b, &#8220;O Abu Al-Mundhir! Verily, your brother Ibn Mas`ud says whoever stands for prayer (at night) the entire year, will catch the Night of Al-Qadr.&#8221; He (Ubayy) said, &#8220;May Allah have mercy upon him. Indeed he knows that it is during the month of Ramadan and that it is the twenty-seventh night.&#8221; Then he swore by Allah. Zirr then said, &#8220;How do you know that&#8221; Ubayy replied, &#8220;By a sign or an indication that he (the Prophet ) informed us of. It rises that next day having no rays on it &#8212; meaning the sun.&#8221; Muslim has also recorded it. It has been said that it is the night of the twenty-ninth. Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal recorded from `Ubadah bin As-Samit that he asked the Messenger of Allah about the Night of Decree and he replied,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فِي رَمَضَانَ فَالْتَمِسُوهَا فِي الْعَشْرِ الْأَوَاخِرِ، فَإِنَّهَا فِي وِتْرٍ إِحْدَى وَعِشْرِينَ، أَوْ ثَلَاثٍ وَعِشْرِينَ، أَوْ خَمْسٍ وَعِشْرِينَ، أَوْ سَبْعٍ وَعِشْرِينَ، أَوْ تِسْعٍ وَعِشْرِينَ، أَوْ فِي آخِرِ لَيْلَة</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">(Seek it in Ramadan in the last ten nights. For verily, it is during the odd nights, the twenty-first, or the twenty-third, or the twenty-fifth, or the twenty-seventh, or the twenty-ninth, or during the last night.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad also recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said about the Night of Al-Qadr,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهَا لَيْلَةُ سَابِعَةٍ أَوْ تَاسِعَةٍ وَعِشْرِينَ، وَإِنَّ الْمَلَائِكَةَ تِلْكَ اللَّيْلَةَ فِي الْأَرْضِ أَكْثَرُ مِنْ عَدَدِ الْحَصَى</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">(Verily, it is during the twenty-seventh or the twenty-ninth night. And verily, the angels who are on the earth during that night are more numerous than the number of pebbles.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad was alone in recording this Hadith and there is nothing wrong with its chain of narration. At-Tirmidhi recorded from Abu Qilabah that he said, &#8220;<strong>The Night of Al-Qadr moves around (i.e., from year to year) throughout the last ten nights.</strong>&#8221; This view that At-Tirmidhi mentions from Abu Qilabah has also been recorded by Malik, Ath-Thawri, Ahmad bin Hanbal, Ishaq bin Rahuyah, Abu Thawr, Al-Muzani, Abu Bakr bin Khuzaymah and others. It has also been related from Ash-Shafi`i, and Al-Qadi reported it from him, and this is most likely. And Allah knows best.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Supplication during the Night of Decree</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is recommended to supplicate often during all times, especially during the month of Ramadan, in the last ten nights, and during the odd nights of it even more so. It is recommended that one say the following supplication a lot: &#8220;O Allah! Verily, You are the Oft-Pardoning, You love to pardon, so pardon me.&#8221; This is due to what Imam Ahmad recorded from `A&#8217;ishah, that she said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! If I find the Night of Al-Qadr what should I say&#8221; He replied,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>قُولِي: اللْهُمَّ إِنَّكَ عَفُوٌّ تُحِبُّ الْعَفْوَ فَاعْفُ عَنِّي</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#808000;">O Allah! Verily, You are the Oft-Pardoning, You love to pardon, so pardon me.</span></strong>&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa&#8217;i and Ibn Majah have all recorded this Hadith. At-Tirmidhi said, &#8220;This Hadith is Hasan Sahih.&#8221; Al-Hakim recorded it in his Mustadrak (with a different chain of narration) and he said that it is authentic according to the criteria of the two Shaykhs (Al-Bukhari and Muslim). An-Nasa&#8217;i also recorded it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah Laylat Al-Qadr, and all praise and blessings are due to Allah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">See <em>Fataawa Arkaan al-Islam</em> by Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy o­n him), p. 398; <em>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah</em>, 8/300-316).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Eid prayer is o­ne where the imam attends and leads the people in praying two rak’ahs. ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The prayer of al-Fitr is two rak’ahs and the prayer of al-Adha is two rak’ahs, complete and not shortened, o­n the tongue of your Prophet, and the o­ne who fabricates lies is doomed.” Narrated by al-Nasaa’i, 1420 and Ibn Khuzaymah. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <em>Saheeh al-Nasaa’i</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was narrated that Abu Sa’eed said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to come out o­n the day of al-Fitr and al-Adha to the prayer place, and the first thing he would do was to offer the prayer. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 956</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In the first rak’ah he should say Takbeerat al-ihraam (say “Allaahu akbar” to start the prayer), after which he should say six or seven more takbeers, because of the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), “The takbeer of al-Fitr and al-Adha is seven takbeers in the first rak’ah and five takbeers in the second, apart from the takbeer of rukoo’.” Narrated by Abu Dawood and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <em>Irwa’ al-Ghaleel</em>, 639. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he should recite al-Faatihah, and recite Soorat Qaf in the first rak’ah. In the second rak’ah he should stand up saying takbeer, and when he has stood up completely he should say takbeer five times, and recite Soorat al-Faatihah then Soorat al-Qamr. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to recite these two soorahs during the two Eids. Or if he wishes he can recite Soorat al-A’la in the first rak’ah and Soorat al-Ghaashiyah in the second, because it was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to recite al-A’la and al-Ghaashiyah in the Eid prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The imam should revive the Sunnah be reciting these soorahs so that the Muslims will become familiar with the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the prayer, the imam should address the people. Part of the khutbah should be addressed specifically to the women, telling them of the things that they should do and warning them against the things that they should avoid, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from his book &#8220;The Pillars of Islam and Iman &#8211; and what every muslim must know about the religion</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There are things which nullify Imân (Faith) i.e. Belief, just as there are things which nullify Wudhû&#8217;. If a person does any single one of them, he loses his state of ritual purity. The same is true with Belief. The nullifiers of Belief can be classified into four categories:<i>First category</i>: Denial of Rabb&#8217;s existence or reviling and speaking ill of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Second category</i>: Denial of Allâh&#8217;s right to be worshipped or worshipping anything or anyone along with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Third category</i>: Denial of any of Allâh&#8217;s Names or Attributes established in the Qur&#8217;ân and Sunnah or reviling them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Fourth category</i>: Denial of the role of Muhammed (pbuh) as the messenger of Allâh, or reviling His Message.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1. Denial of the existence of Rabb nullifies Imân</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This first category encompasses several types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Pure atheism; such as the belief of communists who deny that the universe has a creator and say: &#8220;There is no god, and life is a purely material phenomenon.&#8221; They attribute the creation and all actions to pure chance, or &#8220;nature&#8221; but forget the One Who created even the &#8220;chance&#8221; and the &#8220;nature&#8221;, as Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allâh is the Creator of all things, and He is the Wakîl (Trustee, Disposer of affaires, Guardian, etc.) over all things.&#8221; (39:62)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This category of disbeliever is more hardened in their apostasy than the polytheist Arabs of post-islamic period, and even Satan himself, as those polytheist Arabs did admit the existence of their creator as the Qur&#8217;ân states about them saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: &#8216;Allâh&#8230;'&#8221; (43:87)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and the Qur&#8217;ân mentions the statement of Satan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;(Iblîs) said: I am better then he, You (Allâh) created me from fire, and You created him from clay.&#8221; (38:76)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is an act of disbelief for a Muslim to say, &#8220;Nature created something or that it came into being by chance.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Or if a person claims to be the Rabb; as Pharaoh claimed saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;I am your lord, most high.&#8221; (79:24)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Or to claim that there are great saints [called &#8220;Qutb&#8221; in Sufi terminology, which literally means axes (of creation)] who have control over what happens in the universe, even if this claim is accompanied with the admissions that Allâh, the Soverign Lord exists. People who have this belief are in a worse condition than the idol worshippers before Islâm, who used to admit that Allâh is the Sole Controller of the affairs of the universe, as is indicated by Allâh&#8217;s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Say: &#8216;Who provides for you from the sky and from the earth? Or who owns hearing and sight? And who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living? And who disposes the affairs? They will say: &#8216;Allâh.&#8217; Say: &#8216;Will you not then be afraid of Allâh&#8217;s punishment (for setting up rivals in worship with Allâh?'&#8221; (10:31)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Or the statements of some Sufis that Allâh pervades in His creation, or became incarnate in it. The Sufi, Ibn Arabi, who is buried in Damascus, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Lord is a slave, and the slave is my Lord. I only wish I knew, which one is the Mukallaf.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Mukallaf is a basic Sharî&#8217;ah terminology, that refers to the essential role of the adult, sane human being: That he or she is charged by Allâh with a series of duties and responsibilities, orders and prohibitions, and he will be questioned on the basis of how well he discharged his responsibilities.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this transgressor of the Sufis has stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And the dog and the pig is nothing other then our deity, nor is Allâh other then a monk in a church.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Hallâj (a Sufi of Baghdad) stated: &#8220;I am He (i.e. the Rabb) and He is I.&#8221; Due to this statement of his, which he would not retract; the scholars agreed that he should be executed as an apostate. High Exalted is Allâh above what such people say. <b>2. Shirk (polytheism) in Worship nullifies Imân</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This second category includes the denail of Allâh as the object of worship or ascribing a partner along with Allâh. It too has various manifestations:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Those who worship the sun, the moon, the stars, the trees, Satan or any other created being, and abandon the worship of Allâh, Who created all these things which have no power to benefit nor to harm. Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And from among His Signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Prostrate not to the sun nor to the moon, but prostrate to Allâh Who created them, if you (really) worship Him.&#8221; (41:37)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Those who worship Allâh, and worship along with Him some of His creations, such as saints, as embodied in idols, grave-worship, etc. The Arab idol worshippers before Islâm were of this category, as they used to call upon Allâh only in times of hardship and pressing need, and would worship others in times of ease. As the Qur&#8217;ân described them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And when they embark on a ship, they invoke Allâh, making their Faith pure for Him only, but when He brings them safely to land, behold, they give a share of their worships to others.&#8221; (29:65)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are characterized as Al-Mushrikûn, (i.e. those who associate and attribute partners with Allâh), even though they made supplication to Allâh Alone when they were afraid of drowning at sea, because they didn&#8217;t stay like that. Instead they called upon others after He saved them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Since Allâh was displeased with the idol worshipping Arabs before Islam, He branded them as Kâfiroon (i.e. the disbelievers), and ordered His Prophet to fight them, because they called upon others besides Allâh at the time of ease. He didn&#8217;t accept their whole-heartedness when they called upon Him alone in hardship, and He labelled them Mushrikîn. Therefor, what can we say about certain Muslims today, who resort to dead saints at the time of ease as well as at the time of hardship? And they ask of them only Allâh has the power to bestow, like curing the sick, and granting sustance and guidance, etc., and they forget the Creator of those saints, whereas He is the only One Who cures, the Substainer, and the Guide. And those dead people have no power at all and cannot even hear those who are calling upon them, as Allâh stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;And those, whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmîr (the thin membrane over the datestone). If you invoke (or call upon) them, they hear not your call, and if (in case) they were to hear, they could not grant it (your request) to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your worshipping them. And none can inform you (O Muhammed pbuh) like Him Who is the All-Knower (of each and every thing).&#8221; (35:13,14)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse is explicit to the effect that the dead cannot hear those who call upon them, and explicit in stating that their supplication is major Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of them might say: &#8220;We don&#8217;t believe that these saints and righteous people have the power to benefit or harm. We only take them as intermediaries who will intercede with Allâh on our behalf, and through them we get closer to Allâh.&#8221; Our reply to them is that the idolaters before Islâm used to hold a similar belief, as is mentioned in the Qur&#8217;ân:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And they worship besides Allâh things that hurt them not, nor profit them, and they say: &#8216;These are our intercessors with Allâh.&#8217; Say: &#8216;Do you inform Allâh of that which He knows not in the heavens and on the earth?&#8217; Glorified and Exalted is He above all that which they associate as partners with Him!&#8221; (10:18)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse is explicit in proving that whoever worships and supplicates other then Allâh, he is a Mushrik even if he believes that those other beings cannot benefit nor harm, but only sees them as intercessors.<br />
Allâh said about the idolaters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;And those who take Awliya&#8217; (protectors and helpers) besides Him (say): &#8216;We worship them only that they may bring us near to Allâh.&#8217; Verily, Allâh will judge between them concerning that wherein they differ. Truly, Allâh guides not him who is a liar, and a disbeliever.&#8221; (39:3)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse is explicit in proving the disbelief of those who call upon other than Allâh with the intention of getting thereby closer to Allâh.<br />
The Prophet (pbuh) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Because supplication is worship&#8221; (Tirmidhi)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Among the nullifiers of Belief is to rule by other than what Allâh has revealed; if it is accompanied by the belief that Allâh&#8217;s Laws are inappropriate or less appropriate, or that man made laws which contradict them are equally appropriate; Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;The command (or the judgement) is for none but Allâh. He has commanded that you worship non but Him (i.e. His Monotheism), that is the (true) straight religion, but most men know not.&#8221; (12:40)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;And whosoever does not judge by what Allâh has revealed, such are the Kâfîrun (i.e. disbelievers &#8211; of a lesser degree as they do not act upon Allâh&#8217;s Laws).&#8221; (5:44)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the ruler is applying a law other than what Allah has revealed, while believing that the revealed Law is the only Legitimate Law, but he is contradicting it on the basis of personal whims and inclinations or because of what he considers to be external pressure beyond his control, then he is injust and tyrannical or corrupt, but he did not cross the line of disbelief. This is according to the statement of Ibn Abbas who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever repudiates what Allâh has revealed, the he surely disbelieved, while one who accepted it (while acting in contradiction to it), he is unjust and corrupt.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the interpretation of the verse chosen by the great exegete Ibn Jarîr At-Tabari, and &#8216;Atâ said with regard to the second state:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;A level of disbelief below the level which takes one out of Islâm.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who suspended the Laws of Allâh and replaced them with man-made laws which oppose them, believing in the validity of their man-made laws, they have disbelieved and gone out of Islâm by the consensus of the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Among the nullifiers of Belief is displeasure with Allâh&#8217;s Legislation, or the opinion that it is too confining and strict or that it imposes undue hardship. Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (Muhammed pbuh) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.&#8221; (4:65)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or to dislike the orded which is revealed, as Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;But those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allâh &#8211; Islamic Monotheism), for them is destruction, and (Allâh) will make their deeds vain. That is because they hate that which Allâh has sent down (this Qur&#8217;ân and Islâmic laws, etc.), so He has made their deeds fruitless.&#8221; (47:8,9)</b> 3. Shirk in Allâh&#8217;s Attributes nullifies Imân</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This third category includes denail of some of all of Allâh&#8217;s Attributes or His Names or speaking ill of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. It nullifies Belief when a believer denies the Names of Allâh or His Attributes which are established by the texts of the Qur&#8217;ân and the authentic Sunnah; for example, to deny that Allâh&#8217;s Knowledge is total, or His Power, or His Life or His Hearing or Sight or Speech or Mercy, or His Establishment over His Throne or His Transcendence above it, or His Descent to the lowest heaven or that He has a Hand or an Eye, or other than that of the Attributes which befit His Splendour and which do not resemble the attributes of anything in creation. Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.&#8221; (42:11)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this verse Allâh denied His Resemblance to His creatures, and attributed to Himself the faculties of hearing and sight; and all His other Attributes must be understood in the same way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. It is an error and misguidance to interpret something some of His affirmed Attributes, and to change the meanings of the words used to describe them from their primary meaning in the Arabic language to obscure meanings, like the interpretation of the word Istawâ which means ascension and establishment above something, to mean Istilâ which means to take power. Imam Al-Bukhâri in his Sahîh transmitted the authentic interpretation of Istawâ from Mujâhid and Abul-&#8216;Âliyah, two of the prominent scholars among the Tabi&#8217;în, the successors of the Sahâbah. The diversionary interpretation of Allâh&#8217;s Attributes leads to their denial. As the interpretation of Istawâ meaning to take power is, in fact, a denial of one of Allâh&#8217;s Attributes, which is Allâh&#8217;s Elevation above His Throne, which is established in numerous places in the Qur&#8217;ân and Sunnah. Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;The Most Beneficent (Allâh) Istawâ (rose over) the (mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty).&#8221; (20:5)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven (Allâh), will not cause the earth to sink with you&#8230;&#8221; (67:16)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (pbuh) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allâh recorded a Book which is with Him above the Throne.&#8221; (Agreed upon)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This type of interpretation of the Divine Attributes is a form of distortion as Shaikh Muhammed Amîn Shinqeeti states in his book &#8220;Manhaj wa Darâsât feel-Asmâ&#8217;i was-Sifât &#8211; Studies in the (Divine) Names and Attributes&#8221; on page 26:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;To sum up the issue, I would like to make two points. First the interpreter should consider Allâh&#8217;s Statement to the Jews:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;say Hittatun&#8230;&#8221; (2:58)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hittatun means repentance, they added a letter &#8220;N&#8221; in it and said &#8220;Hintatun&#8221;, Allâh called this addition a change. Allâh said in Surah Al-Baqarah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;But those who did wrong changed the word from that which had been told to them for another, so We sent upon the wrong-doers Rijzan (a punishment) from the heaven because of their rebelling against Allâh&#8217;s obedience.&#8221; (2:59)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise are those who interpret Allâh&#8217;s Attributes with diversionary interpretation. It was said to them Istawâ so they added an &#8220;L&#8221; and said Istawlâ. Consider the resemblance between the &#8220;L&#8221; they added and the &#8220;N&#8221; the Jews added (this point was originally mentioned by Ibn Al-Qayyim).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. There are certain Attributes which are exclusive to Allâh, like Knowledge of the unseen, which no one in creation possesses. Allâh said in his book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And with Him are the keys of the Ghaib (all that is hidden), non knows them but He&#8230;&#8221; (6:59)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh might reveal certain aspects of the unseen to His Messengers through Revelation when He wants, Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;(He Alone) the All-Knower of the Ghaib (unseen), and He reveals to non His Ghaib (unseen) except to a Messenger (from mankind) whom He has chosen (He informs him of the unseen as much as He likes)&#8230;&#8221; (72:26,27)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among the statements of disbelief and error is the statement of the poet Al-Busairy in Qasîdah Burdah describing the Prophet (pbuh)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily, from your generosity is the world and its rival (that is the Hereafter) and a part of your knowledge is the knowledge of the Tablet and the Pen.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This world and the Hereafter are certainly part of the creation of Allâh and from His Generosity, not from the generosity or creation of the Messenger, as the poet claimed.<br />
Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And truly, unto Us (belong) the last (Hereafter) and the first (this world).&#8221; (92:13)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh&#8217;s Messenger (pbuh) does not know what is in the Preserved Tablet, nor what the Pen wrote, as the poet claimed, since this is part of the absolute unseen, which no one knows exept Allâh. As the Qur&#8217;ân mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Say: None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghaib (unseen) except Allâh.&#8221; (27:65)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the saints, it is only logical that they have less access to knowledge of the absolute unseen as they do not even have access to direct Revelation by which Allâh informed His Prophets and Messengers of certain aspects of the unseen, because Revelation does not descend on saints; it is reserved for Prophets and Messengers, so whoever else claims knowledge of the unseen, and whoever believes their claims, has nullified his belief in Islâm. The Prophet (pbuh) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever goes to a fortuneteller or astrologer and believes what he says, has disbelieved in what was revealed to Muhammad.&#8221; (Ahmad)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Occasionally the predictions of these fortuntellers do turn out true, but part of that is due to chance, because they are guessing and trying to extrapolate on what they already know. If they were really truthful in their claim to knowledge of the unseen, they would be right all the time, and they would have informed us the secrets of the Jews, and they could have uncovered all the buried treasures of the earth, and they would not be dependent on the people for money, taking their wealth from them under false pretenses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Defamation of Prophets nullifies Imân</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This fourth category is the rejection of any of the messengers of Allâh or defaming their characters. These are the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. To deny the Message of Muhammed (pbuh) because the testimony that &#8216;Muhammed is the Messenger of Allâh&#8217; is one of the pillars of Belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. To disparage the Messenger of Allâh (pbuh) or his truthfulness, or his faithfulness in discharge of what he was entrusted with, or his chasteness or to revile him or make fun of him, or make light of him, or find fault with any of his documented behaviour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. To attack his authentic Ahâdîth (transmitted sayings) and disbelieve them, or to reject the true news which he has described for us including his documented prophecies. Examples are the appearance of the Dajjâl (the Antichrist) or the descent of Jesus who will rule by the Sharî&#8217;ah of Muhammed (pbuh) and other prophecies documented in the Qur&#8217;ân and Sunnah. It is a nullification of Imân to reject these matters after accepting the attribution of the Ahâdîth to the Prophet (pbuh) as being authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. To deny any of the Messengers sent by Allâh before Muhammed (pbuh) or to deny the stories and sayings in regards to them and their nations, as reported in the Qur&#8217;ân or by the Messenger of Allâh (pbuh) in authentic Ahâdîth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. To claim Prophethood after Muhammed (pbuh) for example Ghulam Ahmed, the Qâdiyâni (i.e. from Qadiyan, India), who claimed Prophethood, while the Qur&#8217;ân says in this verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Muhammed (pbuh) is not the father of any man among you, but he is the Messenger of Allâh, and the Last (end) of the Prophets&#8230;&#8221; (33:40)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Messenger of Allâh (pbuh) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I am the last one, after whom there will be no Prophet.&#8221; (Agreed upon)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And anyone who believes that there is a Prophet after Muhammed (pbuh) whether he is a Qâdiyâni (follower of the deviant heretic, Ghulâm Ahmad) or from any other group, he has disbelieved and nullified his Belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. To describe the Prophet (pbuh) with attributes which belong to Allâh only, such as unlimited knowledge of the unseen, as some Sufis claim. One of their poets said:<br />
&#8220;Oh (total) knower of the unseen, we resorted to you; Oh curer of the hearts, blessing upon you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. To supplicate to the Prophet (pbuh) for what only Allâh has the power to bestow, such as supplicating for victory and help, cure of illness, etc., as is happening today among the Muslims, especially among the Sufis as their poet, Al-Busairy said:<br />
&#8220;Whoever asks by the Messenger of Allâh gets victory, even if a lion meets him in the forest;<br />
Never did time impose on me a hardship and I sought his protection except that I got his protection and no harm came to me.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This conception of the station of the Prophet (pbuh) is Shirk, contradicting the unequivocal announcement of the Qur&#8217;ân:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;And there is no victory except by the help of Allâh&#8230;&#8221; (8:10)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and contradicting the order of the Prophet (pbuh):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When you ask, ask from Allâh, and when you seek help, seek the help from Allâh.&#8221; (Tirmidhi)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what should we think about those who attribute to &#8220;saints&#8221; knowledge of the unseen, or make a Nadhr (a vow to give charity or perform some other optional good deed) for their sake, or dedicate animal sacrifices to them or ask of them what may only be requested of Allâh, such as sustenance or cure of illness, or victory, etc.? No doubt, these are Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. We do not deny the miracles that appeared from the Messengers of Allâh nor those miraculous feets that came from the saints, but what we deny is making them partners with Allâh, supplicating them as we supplicate Allâh, and dedicating sacrifies to them, and undertaking a regime of optional worship for their sake. It has gotten to the point that the graves of some notable &#8220;saints&#8221; are showered with donations which are appropriated by the custodians and servants of these shrines, who then divide them among themselves, consuming people&#8217;s money under false pretenses. At the same time they are surrounded by multitudes of poor people who don&#8217;t get enough to eat for a day.<br />
One poet said: &#8220;Our living don&#8217;t even get a Dhirham (a coin of silver), while thousands and thousands go to the dead.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Not all of these shrines and graves even contain the body of a saint. But swindlers erect some of them as a means of taking the money of the gullible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, one of my fellow teachers related to me that a certain Sufi Shaikh came to his mother&#8217;s house requesting a donation in order to erect a green flag to indicate the presence of a saint on a certain street, so she gave him some money. He bought some green cloth and fixed it to a wall and started telling people, &#8220;There is a Wali (saint) here, one of the friends of Allâh. I saw him in my dream.&#8221; And thus he started collecting money. One day the government decided to widen that street, which would require removing the grave. The man who had started the whole story started telling people that they had tried to remove it, but the equipment used had broken, and some people believed him, and this rumor started circulating, which caused the government to proceed with caution. The Mufti of that country himself told me that the government called him in the middle of the night to the site of that saint&#8217;s grave. He found it surrounded by soldiers. Then the excavator was brought and the grave was dug up. The Mufti looked inside and found nothing there, and knew the whole thing was a lie and fabrication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example, which I heard from a teacher in the Haram in Makkah: One poor man met another and they complained to each other of their poverty. Then they saw a saint&#8217;s grave which was filled with welth. One said to the other: &#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s dig up a grave and put a saint in it, and the money will start rolling in.&#8221; His friend agreed, so they set out until they came to a braying donkey. They killed it and laid it to rest in a pit, they raised a mausoleum with a dome over it. And then both of them proceeded to roll around in the dust of the grave to get the Barakat (blessing) from it. When people passing by asked them what they were doing they said: &#8220;This is the grave of the saint Hubaish bin Tubaish, who worked miracles which defy description.&#8221; People were taking in by their spell and they began laying donations before the grave as charity and to fulfill vows, until they had gathered great wealth. When they started dividing it, they got into argument and started shouting at each other, which attracted a crowd of spectators. One of the two said: &#8220;I swear to you by this saint I didn&#8217;t take anything from you.&#8221; His friend said: &#8220;You swear to me by this saint while the both of us know there is a donkey in this grave that we buried together?&#8221; The people were astonished and felt foolish due to the donations they had made as vows, and took them back after beating the two men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">from &#8220;The Pillars of Islam and Iman &#8211; and what every muslim must know about the religion&#8221;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">La ilaha ill Allaah, Muhammad-ur- Rasul-Allaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah, and Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam = May the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is the Messenger of Allaah ].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have noticed that most of the Europeans and others, who embrace Islam, do not understand the reality of the meaning of the first fundamental principle of Islam, i.e. &#8220;La ilaha ill Allaah (None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah &#8211; and Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) is the Messenger of Allaah.&#8221; So I consider it essential to explain something of the meanings of this Great Sentence (i.e. Principle) in some detail:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">La ilaha ill Allaah, Muhammad-ur-: Rasulullah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah &#8230;.. and Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) is the Messenger of Allaah&#8221; It has <strong>three aspects</strong> : A, B and C.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aspect A: It is that, you have. to pledge a covenant with (Allaah), the Creator of the Heavens and Earth, the Ruler of all that exists, the Lord of Majesty and Highness, on four points (or conditions):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point 1</strong>: A confession with your heart that the-Creator (of everything) is Allaah, it is that you have to say: &#8220;I testify that the Creator of all the universe including the stars, the planets, the sun, the moon, the heavens, the earth with all its known and unknown forms of life, is Allaah.. He is the Organizer and Planner of all its affairs. It is He Who gives life and death, and He (i.e. .Allaah -Alone) is the Sustainer, and the Giver of Security, etc. &#8220;And this is called your confession for the Oneness of the Lordship of Allaah,&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;TAUHID Ar-Rububiyya&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point 2</strong>: A confession with your heart that you have to say: &#8220;I testify that: None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah Alone. The word &#8220;Worship&#8221; (i.e. &#8216;Ibadah) carries a great number of meanings in the Arabic language: It conveys that all kinds of worship are meant for Allaah (and none .else, whether it be an angel, Messenger, Prophet, Jesus-son of Mary, Ezra, Muhammad, saint, idol, the sun, the moon and all other kinds of false deities). So pray to none but Allaah, invoke none but Allaah, ask for help from none (unseen) but Allaah, swear by none but Allaah, offer an animal as sacrifice to none but Allaah,&#8230;etc., and that means &#8211; all what Allaah and His Messenger (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) order you to do, (in His Book. The Qur&#8217;an and in the As-Sunna (Legal ways of Prophet Muhammad , sallalahu alayhi wa sallam ) you must do, and all that Allaah and His Messenger (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) forbid you, you must not do.&#8221; And this is called (your confession for the) &#8220;Oneness of the Worship of Allaah.&#8221;&#8211; &#8220;Tauhid Al-Uluhiyya&#8221;. And that you (mankind) worship none but Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point 3</strong>: A confession with your heart that you have to say: &#8220;O Allaah! I testify that all the best of names and the most perfect qualities with which You have named or qualified Yourself in Your Book (i.e. the Qur&#8217;an) or as Your Prophet Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) has named or qualified You, with his statement,&#8221; &#8230;&#8230; I confirm that all those (names and qualifications) are for You without changing their meanings or neglecting them completely or giving resemblance to others.&#8221; As Allaah said: &#8220;There is nothing like unto Him and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.&#8221; (Qur&#8217;an 42:11). This Holy Verse confirms the quality of hearing and the quality of sight for Allaah without resemblance to others (the creation), and likewise. He also said: &#8220;To one whom I have created with Both My Hands,&#8221; ( Qur&#8217;an 38:75).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and He also said: &#8220;The Hand of Allaah is over their hands.&#8221; (Qur&#8217;an 48: 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This confirms two Hands for Allaah, but there is no similarity (i.e. they are NOT like human hands) for them. Similarly Allaah said: &#8220;The Most Beneficent (Allaah) &#8220;Istawa&#8221; (rose over) the (Mighty) Throne.&#8221; (Qur&#8217;an 20:5).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He rose over the Throne really in a manner that suits His Majesty. And Allaah is over His Throne over the seventh Heaven, as the slave-girl pointed towards the Heavens, when Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Muhammad sallalahu alayhi wa sallam ) asked her as to where Allaah is? He only comes down over the first (nearest) Heaven to us on the Day of &#8216;Arafat (Hajj, i.e. the 9th of Dhul-Hijja), and also during the last third part of the night as mentioned by the Prophet (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam), but He is with us by His Knowledge only, not by His Personal-Self (bidhatihi). It is not like that, as some people say that Allaah is present everywhere, here. there, and even inside the breasts of men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He sees and hears all that we do or utter, etc. And this is called (your confession for the) &#8220;Oneness of the Names and Qualities of Allaah&#8221; &#8220;Tauhid Al-Asma was-Sifat&#8221; and this is the Right Faith, the faith which was followed by the Messengers of Allaah (from Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, Solomon, Jesus to Muhammad ( peace of Allaah be upon them all) and the companions of the Prophet Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) and the righteous followers of these Messengers (peace of Allaah be upon them all).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point IV</strong>:A confession with your heart that you have to say: &#8220;O Allaah! I testify that Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) is Your Messenger.&#8221; That means that none has the right to be followed after Allaah. but the Prophet Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam), as he is the Last of His Messengers. As Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) is not the father of any man among you but he is the Messenger of Allaah and the last (end) of the Prophets and Allaah is Ever All-Aware of everything&#8221; ( Qur&#8217;an 33:40).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam ) gives you, take it and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain from it,&#8221;(Qur&#8217;an 59:7).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah said: &#8220;Say (O Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam, to mankind): If you (really) love Allaah, then follow me.&#8221; (Qur&#8217;an 3:31).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for others than Muhammad ( sallalahu alayhi wa sallam ), their statements are to be taken or rejected as to whether these are in accordance with Allaah&#8217;s Book (i.e. the Qur&#8217;an) or with the Sunna (legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statements, etc.) of the Prophet (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) or not. As the Divine Inspiration has stopped after the death of the Prophet Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) and it will not resume except at the time of the Descent of Jesus, son of Mary and he (i.e. Jesus) will rule with justice according to the Islamic Laws. during the last days of the world as it has been mentioned in the authentic Hadith (i.e. Narration of the Prophet Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam ) (sahih-Al-Bukhari Vol. 3, Hadith No. 425)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aspect B:. It is essential to utter, &#8220;La ilaha ill Allaah, Muhammad-ur-Rasul Allaah&#8221; (&#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah, and Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) is the Messenger of Allaah &#8220;. As it has come in the statement of the Prophet Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) to his uncle Abu Talib at the time of the latter&#8217;s death: &#8220;O uncle, if you utter it (&#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah, and Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam, is the Messenger of Allaah&#8217;), then I shall be able to argue on your behalf before Allaah, on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; Similarly, when Abu Dhar Al-Ghifari embraced Islam, he went to Al-Masjid-al-Haram and he proclaimed it loudly in front of the Quraish infidels Until he was beaten severely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aspect C: . It is essential that the limbs and all other parts and organs of one&#8217;s body testify to it, and this is very important as regards its meaning (i.e., the meaning of &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah. and Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam, is the Messenger of Allaah&#8221;). So whoever has confessed this (with his Lord), he shall not Commit sins like robbing. killing, stealing, illegal sexual intercourse, eating pig meat. drinking alcoholic beverages, taking undue advantage of orphan&#8217;s property. cheating in trade. bribery and earning money through illegal means. etc&#8230; or otherwise the limbs, all other parts and organs of his body will testify against him that he was a liar in his words which he pledged to Allaah. In case he commits the above sins, he should know that it is a sin that obliges him to repent to Allaah, and ask His Forgiveness, as (his) body parts (i.e. skin, private parts, hands, tongue ears. etc.) will testify to the above mentioned crimes (i.e. actions) against his self on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And with the confession of this Great Sentence (i.e. Principle) a person enters in the fold of (i.e. embraces) the Islamic Religion accordingly, it is essential for him to believe in all the Messengers of Allaah and not to differentiate between them. As it is mentioned in His Book, Allaah said: &#8220;Do then those who disbelieve think that they can take My Slaves (i.e. the angels; Allaah&#8217;s Messengers; Jesus, son of Mary, etc.) as Auliya&#8221; (Lords, Gods, Protectors etc.) besides Me? Verily, We have prepared Hell as an entertainment for the disbelievers (in the Oneness of Allaah&#8211;Islamic Monotheism). Say (O Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam): Shall We tell you the greatest losers in respect of (their) deeds?&#8221; Those whose efforts have been wasted in this life, while they thought they were acquiring good by their deeds&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Those are they who deny the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of their Lord and in the meeting with Him (in the Hereafter). So their works are in vain, and on the Day of Resurrection, We shall not give them any weight.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;That shall be their recompense, Hell, because they disbelieved and took My Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, revelations, etc.) and My Messengers by way of jest and mockery. &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily! Those who believe (in the Oneness of Allaah Islamic&#8211;Monotheism), and do righteous deeds, they shall have the gardens of Al-Firdaus (Paradise) for their entertainment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Wherein they shall dwell (for ever). No desire will they have to be removed there from.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Say ( O Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam ! to Mankind): If the sea were ink ( with which to write) the Words of my Lord, surely the sea would be exhausted, before the Words of my Lord would be finished even if We brought (another sea) like it for its aid.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Say (O Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam ), I am only a man like you, it has been inspired to me that your Ilah (God) is One Ilah (God &#8212; i.e. Allaah). So whoever hopes for the meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord.&#8221; (The Qur&#8217;an 18: 102-1 10).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This introduction is necessary for anyone who wishes to embrace Islam. After this confession he (or she ) should take a bath (i.e. Ghusl) and then offer a two Rak&#8217;at prayer, and act upon the five Principles of Islam, as narrated by Ibn &#8216;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) in the Book, Sahih Al-Bukhari. Vol. I Hadith No.7 : Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him), Allaah&#8217;s Messenger , sallalahu alayhi wa sallam, said: Islam is based on (the following five (principles):</p>
<p>1. To testify La ilaha ill Allaah wa anna Muhammad-ar-Rasul Allaah (None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah and that Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam, is Allaah&#8217;s Messenger).</p>
<p>2. To offer the (compulsory congregational) prayers dutifully and perfectly (Iqamat-as -Salat).</p>
<p>3. To pay Zakat (i.e. obligatory charity).</p>
<p>4. To perform Hajj (i.e. Pilgrimage to Makka).</p>
<p>5. To observe fast during the month of Ramadan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and must believe in the six Articles of Faith, i.e. to believe in:</p>
<p>(I) Allaah,<br />
(2) His Angels,<br />
(3) His Messengers,<br />
(4) His Revealed Books,<br />
(5) the Day of Resurrection, and<br />
(6) Al-Qadar (Divine Preordainments i.e. whatever Allaah has ordained must come to pass).]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"> <strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is the ruling on Insurance, wether it be life insurance or property insurance?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Insuring one&#8217;s life and property is forbidden; it is not permissible due to the fact that Al-Gharar (Uncertainty, Risk or Speculation) and usury are involved therein. And Allah &#8211; the Almighty the All-Powerful &#8211; has forbidden all types of dealings that involver usury and dealings in which there is Al-Gharar (Uncertainty, Risk or Speculation), as a mercy for the (muslim) community and a protection for them for what is harmful to them. Allah &#8211; Most Glorified, Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;where as Allah has permitted trading and forbidden riba&#8221; (usury). Al-Baqarah 2:275</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it has been authentically reported from the Messenger of Allah (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) that he forbade selling AL-Gharar. And Allah is the granter of success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Two Episodes of Jewish Mischief [From Tafsir Soorah al-`Isra]<br />
Imam Ibn Kathir<br />
Tafsir Ibn Kathir (Abridged), Volume 5<br />
© Darussalam 2000</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Surah 17. Al-Isra&#8217; (4-8)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. And We decreed for the Children of Israel in the Scripture:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed you would do mischief in the land twice and you will become tyrants and extremely arrogant!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. So, when the promise came for the first of the two, We sent against you servants of Ours given to terrible warfare. They entered the very innermost parts of your homes. And it was a promise (completely) fulfilled. 6. <i>Then We gave you a return of victory over them. And We helped you with wealth and children and made you more numerous in manpower.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>7. (And We said): &#8220;If you do good, you do good for your own selves, and if you do evil (you do it) against yourselves.&#8221; Then, when the second promise came to pass, (We permitted your enemies) to disgrace your faces and to enter the Masjid as they had entered it before, and to destroy with utter destruction all that fell in their hands.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>8. It may be that your Lord may show mercy unto you, but if you return (to sins). We shall return (to Our punishment). And We have made Hell a prison for the disbelievers.</i></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">It was mentioned in the Tawrah that the Jews would spread Mischief twice</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah tells us that He made a declaration to the Children of Israel in the Scripture, meaning that He had already told them in the Book which He revealed to them, that they would cause mischief on the earth twice, and would become tyrants and extremely arrogant, meaning they would become shameless oppressors of people, Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And We made known this decree to him, that the root of those (sinners) was to be cut off in the early morning. </strong>(15:66),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">meaning, We already told him about that and informed him of it.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">The First Episode of Mischief caused by the Jews, and their Punishment for it</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So, when the promise came for the first of the two</strong>, meaning the first of the two episodes of mischief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>We sent against you servants of Ours given to terrible warfare.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">means, &#8216;We unleashed soldiers against you from among Our creatures who were given to terrible warfare,&#8217; i.e., they had great strength and weapons and power. They entered the very innermost parts of your homes, meaning they took possession of your land and invaded the very innermost parts of your homes, going between and through your houses, coming and going freely with no fear of anyone. This was the promise (completely) fulfilled.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The earlier and later commentators differed over the identity of these invaders. Many <i>Isra`iliyyat</i> (reports from Jewish sources) were narrated about this, but I did not want to make this book too long by mentioning them, because some of them are fabricated, concocted by their heretics, and others may be true, but we have no need of them, praise be to Allah. What Allah has told us in His Book (the Qur&#8217;an) is sufficient and we have no need of what is in the other books that came before. Neither Allah nor His Messenger required us to refer to them. Allah told His Messenger sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam that when (the Jews) committed transgression and aggression, Allah gave their enemies power over them to destroy their country and enter the innermost parts of their homes. Their humiliation and subjugation was a befitting punishment, and your Lord is never unfair or unjust to His servants. They had rebelled and killed many of the Prophets and scholars. Ibn Jarir recorded that Yahya bin Satd said: &#8220;I heard Sa&#8217;id bin Al-Musayyib saying: &#8216;Nebuchadnezzar conquered Ash-Sham (Greater Syria, including Palestine), destroying Jerusalem and killing them, then he came to Damascus and found blood boiling in a censer. He asked them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is this blood? They said: We found our forefathers doing this. Because of that blood, he killed seventy thousand of the believers and others, then the blood stoppedboiling.&#8221;[At-Tabari 17:369.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This report is <i>Sahih</i> from Said bin Al-Musayyib, and this event is well-known, as he (Nebuchadnezzar) killed their nobles and scholars, and did not leave alive anyone who knew the Tawrah by heart. He took many prisoners from the sons of the Prophets and others, and did many other things that would take too long to mention here. If we had found anything that was correct or close enough, we could have written it and reported it here. And Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And We said): &#8220;If you do good, you do good for your own selves, and if you do evil (you do it) against yourselves.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allah says elsewhere:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Whosoever does a righteous good deed, it is for (the benefit of) himself; and whosoever does evil, it is against himself. </strong>[45:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Second Episode of Mischief</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Then, when the second promise came to pass</strong>, meaning, the second episode of mischief, when your enemies came again,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(We permitted your enemies) to disgrace your faces</strong>, meaning, to humiliate you and subdue you,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>and to enter the Masjid</strong>, meaning, Bayt Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>as they had entered it before</strong>, when they entered the very innermost parts of your homes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and to destroy wrecking and inflicting ruin upon it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>all that fell in their hands</strong>, everything they could get their hands on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>with utter destruction. It may be that your Lord may show mercy unto you</strong> , meaning that He may rid you of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>but if you return (to sins). We shall return (to Our punishment)</strong>,  meaning, if you return to causing mischief,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>We shall return </strong>means We will once again punish you in this world, along with the punishment and torment We save for you in the Hereafter.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And We have made Hell a prison [Hasir] for the disbelievers</strong>, meaning, a place of permanent detention, a prison which cannot be avoided or escaped. Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;<i>Hasiir </i>here means a jail.&#8221; [At-Tabari 17:390] Mujahid said, &#8220;They will be detained in it.&#8221; [At-Tabari 17:390] Others said likewise. Al-Hasan said, &#8220;<i>Hasir </i>means a bed of Fire.&#8221; [At-Tabari 17:390] Qatadah said: &#8220;The Children of Israel returned to aggression, so Allah sent this group against them, Muhammad sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam and his companions, who made them pay the <i>Jizyah</i>, [a tax levied from People of the Book (Jews and Christians) who are under the protection of a Muslim government] with willing submission, and feeling themselves subdued.&#8221; [At-Tabari 17:389]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Source: Tafseer Ibn Katheer</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2.246. Have you not thought about the group of the Children of Israel after (the time of) Musa When they said to a Prophet of theirs, &#8220;Appoint for us a king and we will fight in Allah&#8217;s way.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Would you then refrain from fighting, if fighting was prescribed for you&#8221; They said, &#8220;Why should we not fight in Allah&#8217;s way while we have been driven out of our homes and our children (families have been taken as captives)&#8221; But when fighting was ordered for them, they turned away, all except a few of them. And Allah is All-Aware of the wrongdoers.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujahid said that the Prophet (mentioned in the Ayah 2:246 above) is Shamwil (Samuel). Wahb bin Munabbih said: The Children of Israel remained on the straight path for a period of time after Moses. They then innovated in the religion and some of them even worshipped the idols. Yet, there were always Prophets sent among them who would command them to work righteous deeds, refrain from doing evil and who would rule them according to the commands of the Torah. When they (Israelites) committed the evil that they committed, Allah caused their enemies to overwhelm them, and many fatalities fell among them as a consequence. Their enemies also captured a great number of them, and took over large areas of their land. Earlier, anyone who would fight the Israelites would lose, because they had the Torah and the Tabut, which they inherited generation after generation ever since the time of Moses, who spoke to Allah directly. Yet, the Israelites kept indulging in misguidance until some king took the Tabut from them during a battle. That king also took possession of the Torah, and only a few of the Israelites who memorized it remained. The prophethood halted among their various tribes and only a pregnant woman remained of the offspring of Lavi (Levi), in whom the prophethood still appeared. Her husband had been killed, so the Israelites kept her in a house so that Allah may give her a boy, who would be their Prophet. The woman also kept invoking Allah to grant her a boy. Allah heard her pleas and gave her a boy whom she called `Shamwil&#8217; meaning `Allah has heard my pleas.&#8217; Some people said that the boy&#8217;s name was Sham`un (Simeon), which also has a similar meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As that boy grew, Allah raised him to be a righteous person. When he reached the age of prophethood, Allah revealed to him and commanded him to call (his people) to Him and to His Tawhid (Oneness). Shamwil called the Children of Israel (to Allah) and they asked him to appoint a king over them so that they could fight their enemies under his command. The kingship had also ended among them. Their Prophet said to them, &#8220;What if Allah appoints a king over you, would you fulfill your vow to fight under his command&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(They said, &#8220;Why should we not fight in Allah&#8217;s way while we have been driven out of our homes and our children&#8221;) meaning, `After our land had been confiscated and our children had been taken from us&#8217; Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(But when fighting was ordered for them, they turned away, all except a few of them. And Allah is All-Aware of the wrongdoers) meaning, only a few of them kept their promise, but the majority abandoned Jihad and Allah has full knowledge of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(247. And their Prophet said to them, &#8220;Indeed Allah has appointed Talut (Saul) as a king over you.&#8221; They said, &#8220;How can he be a king over us when we are fitter than him for the kingdom, and he has not been given enough wealth.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Verily, Allah has chosen him above you and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature. And Allah grants His kingdom to whom He wills. And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures&#8217; needs, All-Knower.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Israelites asked their Prophet to appoint a king over them, he appointed Talut (Saul), who was then a soldier. But, Talut was not a descendant of the house of kings among them, which was exclusively in the offspring of Yahudha (Judah). This is why they said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(How can he be a king over us) meaning, how can he be the king for us,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(when we are fitter than him for the kingdom, and he has not been given enough wealth) They said that Talut was also poor and did not have the wealth that justifies him being king. Some people stated that Talut used to bring water to the people, while others stated that his profession was dyeing skins. The Jews, thus, disputed with their Prophet while they were supposed to obey him and to say good words to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their Prophet answered them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, Allah has chosen him above you) meaning, `Allah chose Talut from amongst you while having better knowledge about him.&#8217; Their Prophet stated, &#8220;I did not choose Talut to be your king on my own. Rather, Allah has commanded that upon your request.&#8221; Further:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature.) meaning, `Talut is more knowledgeable and honorable than you, and stronger and more patient during combat, and has more knowledge of warfare. In short, he has more knowledge and is stronger than you are. The king should have sufficient knowledge, be fair looking and should have a strong soul and body.&#8217; He then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And Allah grants His kingdom to whom He wills.) meaning, Allah Alone is the Supreme Authority Who does what He wills and no one can ask Him about His actions, while they will be asked (about their actions by Him). This is because Allah has perfect knowledge, wisdom and kindness with His creation. Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures&#8217; needs, All-Knower.) meaning, His favor is encompassing and He grants His mercy to whom He wills. He also knows those who deserve to be kings and those who do not deserve it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(248. And their Prophet said to them: &#8220;Verily! The sign of His kingdom is that there shall come to you At-Tabut, wherein is Sakinah (peace and reassurance) from your Lord and a remnant of that which Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron) left behind, carried by the angels. Verily, in this is a sign for you if you are indeed believers.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their Prophet then proclaimed, &#8220;The sign of the blessings of Talut&#8217;s kingship over you is that Allah will give you back the Tabut (wooden box) that has been taken from you.&#8221; Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(wherein is Sakinah from your Lord) meaning, peace (or grace) and reassurance. `Abdur-Razzaq stated that Qatadah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(wherein is Sakinah) means grace. In addition, Ar-Rabi` said that Sakinah means mercy. This is also the meaning given by Ibn `Abbas, as Al-`Awfi narrated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;and a remnant of that which Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron) left behind,)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jarir related that Ibn `Abbas said about this Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;and a remnant of that which Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron) left behind, ) Meaning, Moses&#8217; staff and the remnants of the Tablets. This is the same Tafsir of Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and `Ikrimah, who added, &#8220;And also the Torah.&#8221; `Abdur-Razzaq said that he asked Ath-Thawri about the meaning of,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;and a remnant of that which Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron) left behind,)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ath-Thawri said, &#8220;Some said that it contained a pot of manna and the remnants of the Tablets, while some others said that it contained (Moses&#8217;) staff and two shoes (and refer to 20:12).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;carried by the angels.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jurayj stated that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;The angels came down while carrying the Tabut between the sky and the earth, until they placed it before Talut while the people were watching.&#8221; As-Suddi said, &#8220;The Tabut was brought to Talut&#8217;s house, so the people believed in the prophethood of Sham`un (Simeon) and obeyed Talut&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, in this is a sign for you) testifying to my truth in what I was sent with, my prophethood, and my command to you to obey Talut,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(if you are indeed believers. ) in Allah and the Hereafter.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(249. Then when Talut set out with the army, he said: &#8220;Verily, Allah will try you by a river. So whoever drinks thereof, he is not of me; and whoever tastes it not, he is of me, except him who takes (thereof) in the hollow of his hand.&#8221; Yet, they drank thereof, all, except a few of them. So when he had crossed it (the river), he and those who believed with him, they said: &#8220;We have no power this day against Jalut (Goliath) and his hosts.&#8221; But those who knew with certainty that they were going to meet Allah, said: &#8220;How often has a small group overcome a mighty host by Allah&#8217;s leave&#8221; And Allah is with As-Sabirin (the patient).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah states that Talut, the king of the Children of Israel, marched forth with his soldiers and the Israelites who obeyed him. His army was of eighty thousand then, according to As-Suddi, but Allah knows best. Talut said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, Allah will try you) meaning, He will test you with a river, which flowed between Jordan and Palestine, i.e. , the Shari`ah river, according to Ibn `Abbas and others. He continued,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So whoever drinks thereof, he is not of me;) meaning, shall not accompany me today,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and whoever tastes it not, he is of me, except him who takes (thereof) in the hollow of his hand.) meaning, there is no harm in this case. Allah then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Yet, they drank thereof, all, except a few of them.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jurayj stated that Ibn `Abbas commented, &#8220;Whoever took some of it (the river&#8217;s water) in the hollow of his hand, quenched his thirst; as for those who drank freely from it, their thirst was not quenched.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jarir reported that Al-Bara&#8217; bin `Azib said, &#8220;We used to say that the Companions of Muhammad who accompanied him on the battle of Badr were more than three hundred and ten, just as many as the soldiers who crossed the river with Talut. Only those who believed crossed the river with him.&#8221; Al-Bukhari also reported this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So when he had crossed it (the river), he and those who believed with him, they said: &#8220;We have no power this day against Jalut (Goliath) and his hosts.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah indicates that the Israelites (who remained with Saul) thought that they were few in the face of their enemy who were many then. So, their knowledgeable scholars strengthened their resolve by stating that Allah&#8217;s promise is true and that triumph comes from Allah Alone, not from the large numbers or the adequacy of the supplies. They said to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;How often has a small group overcome a mighty host by Allah&#8217;s leave&#8221; And Allah is with As-Sabirin (the patient).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(250. And when they advanced to meet Jalut (Goliath) and his forces, they invoked: &#8220;Our Lord! Pour forth on us patience, and set firm our feet and make us victorious over the disbelieving people.&#8221;) (251. So they routed them by Allah&#8217;s leave and Dawud (David) killed Jalut (Goliath), and Allah gave him (Dawud) the kingdom ﴿after the death of Talut and Samuel﴾ and Al-Hikmah (prophethood), and taught him of that which He willed. And if Allah did not check one set of people by means of another, the earth would indeed be full of mischief. But Allah is full of bounty to the `Alamin (mankind, Jinn and all that exists).) (252. These are the verses of Allah, We recite them to you (O Muhammad ) in truth, and surely, you are one of the Messengers (of Allah.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the faithful party, who were few under the command of Talut, faced their enemy, who were many under the command of Jalut,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(they invoked: &#8220;Our Lord! Pour forth on us patience&#8230;&#8221;) meaning, send down patience on us from You.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and set firm our feet) meaning, against the enemy and save us from running away and from feebleness,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and make us victorious over the disbelieving people.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So they routed them by Allah&#8217;s leave) meaning, they defeated and overwhelmed them by Allah&#8217;s aid and support. Then,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and Dawud killed Jalut)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Israelite accounts claimed that (Prophet) David killed Goliath with a slingshot that he had, which he launched at Goliath causing his death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Talut promised that whoever killed Jalut, would marry his daughter and would share his kingship and authority. He kept his promise. Later, the kingship was transferred to Prophet Dawud in addition to being granted Prophethood by Allah. So, Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;and Allah gave him (Dawud) the kingdom) that Talut had and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and Al-Hikmah) that comes with the prophethood, meaning, after Shamwil. ﴿Allah then said:﴾</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and taught him of that which He willed.) meaning, what He willed of the knowledge that He bestowed on (Prophet) Dawud.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Next, Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And if Allah did not check one set of people by means of another, the earth would indeed be full of mischief.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah indicates that if it were not for the fact that Allah checks one set of people with another, such as when Talut and the bravery of Dawud helped the Children of Israel (against Goliath), then people would have perished. Similarly, Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(For had it not been that Allah checks one set of people by means of another, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and Masjids, wherein the Name of Allah is mentioned much, would surely, have been pulled down.) (22:40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(But Allah is full of bounty to the `Alamin (mankind, Jinn and all that exists)) meaning, by His mercy and favor He fixes some of them by some others. Surely, Allah has the wisdom, the supreme authority and the clear proof against His creation in all of His actions and statements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(These are the verses of Allah, We recite them to you (O Muhammad ) in truth, and surely, you are one of the Messengers (of Allah).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah states, `These Ayat (verses) of Allah that We have narrated for you in truth conform to the exact manner that these stories have occurred and to the truth that still remain in the (Divine) Books that the scholars of the Children of Israel have and know. Allah said: O Muhammad,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(you are)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(one of the Messengers (of Allah)) emphatically stating the truth of his prophet hood</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Tafseer Ibn Katheer from SuratAl Baqara</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2.80. And they (Jews) say, &#8220;The Fire shall not touch us but for a few numbered days.&#8221; Say (O Muhammad to them): &#8220;Have you taken a covenant from Allah, so that Allah will not break His covenant Or is it that you say of Allah what you know not&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah mentioned the claim of the Jews, that the Fire will only touch them for a few days, and then they will be saved from it. Allah refuted this claim by saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say (O Muhammad to them): &#8220;Have you taken a covenant from Allah&#8217;). Hence, the Ayah proclaims, `if you had a promise from Allah for that, then Allah will never break His promise. However, such promise never existed. Rather, what you say, about Allah, you have no knowledge of and you thus utter a lie about Him.&#8217; Al-`Awfi said that Ibn `Abbas said about the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And they (Jews) say, &#8220;The Fire shall not touch us but for a few numbered days.&#8221;). &#8220;The Jews said, `The Fire will only touch us for forty days.&#8221;&#8217; Others added that this was the period during which the Jews worshipped the calf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr bin Marduwyah reported Abu Hurayrah saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When Khaybar was conquered, a roasted poisoned sheep was presented to the Prophet as a gift (by the Jews). The Messenger of Allah ordered, `Assemble before me all the Jews who were here.&#8217; The Jews were summoned and the Prophet said (to them), `Who is your father&#8217; They replied, `So-and-so.&#8217; He said, `You have lied; your father is so-and-so.&#8217; They said, `You have uttered the truth.&#8217; He said, `Will you now tell me the truth, if I ask you about something&#8217; They replied, `Yes, O Abul-Qasim; and if we should tell a lie, you will know our lie as you have about our fathers.&#8217; On that he asked, `Who are the people of the (Hell) Fire&#8217; They said, `We shall remain in the (Hell) Fire for a short period, and after that you will replace us in it.&#8217; The Prophet said, `May you be cursed and humiliated in it! By Allah, we shall never replace you in it.&#8217; Then he asked, `Will you tell me the truth if I ask you a question&#8217; They said, `Yes, O Abul-Qasim.&#8217; He asked, `Have you poisoned this sheep&#8217; They said, `Yes.&#8217; He asked, `What made you do so&#8217; They said, `We wanted to know if you were a liar, in which case we would get rid of you, and if you were a Prophet then the poison would not harm you.&#8217;) Imam Ahmad, Al-Bukhari and An-Nasa&#8217;i recorded similarly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.5em;">Source: Tafseer Ibn Katheer (Dar-us-salam), Surah Ale-Imran , after the verses 93 to 95</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(93. All food was lawful to the Children of Israel, except what Isra&#8217;il made unlawful for himself before the Tawrah was revealed. Say: &#8220;Bring here the Tawrah and recite it, if you are truthful. &#8221;) (94. Then after that, whosoever shall invent a lie against Allah, then it is these that are the wrongdoers.) (95. Say:&#8221;Allah has spoken the truth; follow the religion of Ibrahim the Hanif (monotheist), and he was not of the Mushrikin (idolators).&#8221;)</span></p>
<p><strong>The Questions that the Jews Asked Our Prophet</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;A group of Jews came to Allah&#8217;s Prophet and said, `Talk to us about some things we will ask you and which only a Prophet would know.&#8217; He said, `Ask me about whatever you wish. However, give your pledge to Allah, similar to the pledge that Ya`qub took from his children, that if I tell you something and you recognize its truth, you will follow me in Islam.&#8217; They said, `Agreed.&#8217; The Prophet said, `Ask me about whatever you wish.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said, `Tell us about four matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. What kinds of food did Isra&#8217;il prohibit for himself</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. What about the sexual discharge of the woman and the man, and what role does each play in producing male or female offspring</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Tell us about the condition of the unlettered Prophet during sleep,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. And who is his Wali (supporter) among the angels&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet took their covenant that they will follow him if he answers these questions, and they agreed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, `I ask you by He Who sent down the Tawrah to Musa, do you not know that Isra&#8217;il once became very ill When his illness was prolonged, he vowed to Allah that if He cures His illness, he would prohibit the best types of drink and food for himself. Was not the best food to him camel meat and the best drink camel milk&#8217; They said, `Yes, by Allah.&#8217; The Messenger said, `O Allah, be Witness against them.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet then said, `I ask you by Allah, other than Whom there is no deity (worthy of worship), Who sent down the Tawrah to Musa, do you not know that man&#8217;s discharge is thick and white and woman&#8217;s is yellow and thin If any of these fluids becomes dominant, the offspring will take its sex and resemblance by Allah&#8217;s leave. Hence, if the man&#8217;s is more than the woman&#8217;s, the child will be male, by Allah&#8217;s leave. If the woman&#8217;s discharge is more than the man&#8217;s, then the child will be female, by Allah&#8217;s leave.&#8217; They said, `Yes.&#8217; He said, `O Allah, be Witness against them.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then said, `I ask you by He Who sent down the Tawrah to Musa, do you not know that the eyes of this unlettered Prophet sleep, but his heart does not sleep&#8217; They said, `Yes, by Allah!&#8217; He said, `O Allah, be Witness.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said, `Tell us now about your Wali among the angels, for this is when we either follow or shun you.&#8217; He said, `My Wali (who brings down the revelation from Allah) is Jibril, and Allah never sent a Prophet, but Jibril is his Wali.&#8217; They said, `We then shun you. Had you a Wali other than Jibril, we would have followed you.&#8217; On that, Allah, the Exalted revealed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say: &#8220;Whoever is an enemy to Jibril&#8230;&#8221;) ﴿2:97﴾.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(before the Tawrah was revealed) ﴿3:93﴾, means, Isra&#8217;il forbade that for himself before the Tawrah was revealed. There are two objectives behind revealing this segment of the Ayah. First, he forbade himself the most delightful things for Allah&#8217;s sake. This practice was allowed during his period of Law, and is, thus, suitable that it is mentioned after Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(By no means shall you attain Al-Birr, unless you spend of that which you love) ﴿3: 92﴾.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What we are allowed in our Law is to spend in Allah&#8217;s obedience from what we like and covet ﴿but not to prohibit what Allah has allowed﴾. Allah said in other Ayat;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And gives his wealth, in spite of love for it,) ﴿2:177﴾, and;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And they give food, in spite of their love for it,) ﴿76:8﴾.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second reason is that after Allah refuted the false Christian beliefs and allegations about `Isa and his mother. Allah started refuting the Jews here, may Allah curse them, by stating that the abrogation of the Law, that they denied occurs, already occurred in their Law. For instance, Allah has stated in their Book, the Tawrah, that when Nuh departed from the ark, Allah allowed him to eat the meat of all types of animals. Afterwards, Isra&#8217;il forbade the meat and milk of camels for himself, and his children imitated this practice after him. The Tawrah later on prohibited this type of food, and added several more types of prohibitions. Allah allowed Adam to marry his daughters to his sons, and this practice was later forbidden. The Law of Ibrahim allowed the man to take female servants as companions along with his wife, as Ibrahim did when he took Hajar, while he was married to Sarah. Later on, the Tawrah prohibited this practice. It was previously allowed to take two sisters as wives at the same time, as Ya`qub married two sisters at the same time. Later on, this practice was prohibited in the Tawrah. All these examples are in the Tawrah and constitute a Naskh (abrogation) of the Law. Therefore, let the Jews consider what Allah legislated for `Isa and if such legislation falls under the category of abrogation or not. Why do they not then follow `Isa in this regard Rather, the Jews defied and rebelled against `Isa and against the correct religion that Allah sent Muhammad with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(All food was lawful to the Children of Israel, except what Isra&#8217;il made unlawful for himself before the Tawrah was revealed) ﴿3:93﴾ meaning, before the Tawrah was revealed, all types of foods were allowed, except what Isra&#8217;il prohibited for himself. Allah then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say: &#8220;Bring here the Tawrah and recite it, if you are truthful.&#8221;),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">for the Tawrah affirms what we are stating here. Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then after that, whosoever shall invent a lie against Allah, then these it is that are the wrongdoers.) ﴿3:94﴾, in reference to those who lie about Allah and claim that He made the Sabbath and the Tawrah eternal. They are those who claim that Allah did not send another Prophet calling to Allah with the proofs and evidences, although evidence indicates that abrogation, as we have described, occurred before in the Tawrah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(then these it is that are the wrongdoers.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say, &#8220;Allah has spoken the truth;&#8221;) ﴿3:95﴾ meaning, O Muhammad, say that Allah has said the truth in what He conveyed and legislated in the Qur&#8217;an,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(follow the religion of Ibrahim the Hanif, and he was not of the idolators.&#8221;) ﴿3:95﴾.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, follow the religion of Ibrahim that Allah legislated in the Qur&#8217;an. Indeed, this is the truth, there is no doubt in it, and the perfect way, and no Prophet has brought a more complete, clear, plain and perfect way than he did. Allah said in other Ayat,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say: &#8220;Truly, my Lord has guided me to a straight path, a right religion, the religion of Ibrahim, the Hanif, and he was not of the idolators.&#8221;) ﴿6:161﴾</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then, We have sent the revelation to you (saying): &#8220;Follow the religion of Ibrahim, the Hanif, and he was not of the idolaters.) ﴿16:123﴾.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews are the Enemies of Jibril</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Al Baqara 2.97). Say (O Muhammad ): &#8220;Whoever is an enemy to Jibril (Gabriel) (let him die in his fury), for indeed he has brought it (this Qur&#8217;an) down to your heart by Allah&#8217;s permission, confirming what came before it (i.e. the Tawrah and the Injil) and guidance and glad tidings for the believers).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(98. &#8220;Whoever is an enemy to Allah, His Angels, His Messengers, Jibril and Mika&#8217;il, then verily, Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews are the Enemies of Jibril</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Abu Ja`far bin Jarir At-Tabari said, &#8220;The scholars of Tafsir agree that this Ayah (2: 97-98) was revealed in response to the Jews who claimed that Jibril (Gabriel) is an enemy of the Jews and that Mika&#8217;il (Michael) is their friend.&#8221; Al-Bukhari said, &#8220;Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Whoever is an enemy of Jibril (let him die in his fury)). `Ikrimah said, &#8220;Jibr, Mik and Israf all mean, worshipper, while il means, Allah&#8221;. Anas bin Malik said, &#8220;When `Abdullah bin Salam heard of the arrival of the Prophet in Al-Madinah, he was working on his land. He came to the Prophet and said, `I am going to ask you about three things which nobody knows except a Prophet. What will be the first portent of the Hour What will be the first meal taken by the people of Paradise Why does a child resemble its father, and why does it resemble its maternal uncle&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Messenger said, (Jibril has just told me the answers.) `Abdullah said, `He (i.e. Jibril), among all the angels, is the enemy of the Jews.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Messenger recited the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Whoever is an enemy to Jibril (Gabriel) (let him die in his fury), for indeed he has brought it (this Qur&#8217;an) down to your heart). Allah&#8217;s Messenger then said, (The first portent of the Hour will be a fire that will bring together the people from the east to the west; the first meal of the people of Paradise will be the caudate lobe of the liver of fish. As for the child resembling his parents: If a man has sexual intercourse with his wife and his discharge is first, the child will resemble the father. If the woman has a discharge first, the child will resemble her side of the family.) On that `Abdullah bin Salam said, `I testify that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and you are the Messenger of Allah.&#8217; `Abdullah bin Salam further said, `O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! The Jews are liars, and if they should come to know about my conversion to Islam before you ask them (about me), they will tell a lie about me.&#8217; The Jews came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger , and `Abdullah went inside the house. Allah&#8217;s Messenger asked (the Jews), (`What kind of man is `Abdullah bin Salam&#8217;) They replied, `He is the best among us, the son of the best among us, our master and the son of our master.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Messenger said, (What do you think if he would embrace Islam) The Jews said, `May Allah save him from it.&#8217; Then `Abdullah bin Salam came out in front of them saying, `I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.&#8217; Thereupon they said, `He is the evilest among us, and the son of the evilest among us.&#8217; And they continued talking badly about him. Ibn Salam said, `This is what I feared, O Messenger of Allah!.&#8221;&#8217; Only Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith with this chain of narration. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this Hadith from Anas using another chain of narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people say that `il&#8217; means worshipper while whatever word that is added to it becomes Allah&#8217;s Name, because `il&#8217; is a constant in such conjunction. This is similar to the names `Abdullah, `Abdur-Rahman, `Abdul-Malik, `Abdul-Quddus, `Abdus-Salam, `Abdul-Kafi, `Abdul-Jalil, and so forth. Hence, `Abd&#8217; is constant in these compound names, while the remainder differs from name to name. This is the same case with Jibril, Mika&#8217;il, `Azra&#8217;il, Israfil, and so forth. Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Choosing Some Angels to believe in over Others is Disbelief like choosing Some Prophets over Others</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Whoever is an enemy to Jibril (Gabriel) (let him die in his fury), for indeed he has brought it (this Qur&#8217;an) down to your heart by Allah&#8217;s permission,) meaning, whoever becomes an enemy of Jibril, let him know that he is Ruh Al-Qudus who brought down the Glorious Dhikr (Qur&#8217;an) to your heart from Allah by His leave. Hence, he is a messenger from Allah. Whoever takes a messenger as an enemy, will have taken all the messengers as enemies. Further, whoever believes in one messenger, is required to believe in all of the messengers. Whoever rejects one messenger, he has rejected all of the messengers. Similarly, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, those who disbelieve in Allah and His Messengers and wish to make distinction between Allah and His Messengers (by believing in Allah and disbelieving in His Messengers) saying, &#8220;We believe in some but reject others.&#8221;) (4:150)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah decreed that they are disbelievers, because they believe in some Prophets and reject others. This is the same with those who take Jibril as an enemy, because Jibril did not choose missions on his own, but by the command of his Lord,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And we (angels) descend not except by the command of your Lord) (19: 64), and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And truly, this (the Qur&#8217;an) is a revelation from the Lord of all that exists. Which the trustworthy Ruh (Jibril) has brought down. Upon your heart (O Muhammad ) that you may be (one) of the warners) (26:192-194).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari reported that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah said, `Whoever takes a friend of Mine as an enemy, will have started a war with Me.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Allah became angry with those who took Jibril as an enemy. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Whoever is an enemy to Jibril (Gabriel) (let him die in his fury), for indeed he has brought it (this Qur&#8217;an) down to your heart by Allah&#8217;s permission, confirming what came before it) meaning, the previous Books,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and guidance and glad tidings for the believers) meaning, as guidance to their hearts and bringer of the good news of Paradise, which is exclusively for the believers. Similarly, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say: &#8220;It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing.&#8221;) (41:44), and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And We send down of the Qur&#8217;an that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe) (17:82).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Whoever is an enemy to Allah, His Angels, His Messengers, Jibril and Mika&#8217;il (Michael), then verily, Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah stated that whoever takes Him, His angels and messengers as enemies, then&#8230;Allah&#8217;s messengers include angels and men, for Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah chooses Messengers from angels and from men) (22:75). Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Jibril (Gabriel) and Mika&#8217;il (Michael)). Allah mentioned Jibril and Mika&#8217;il specifically &#8211; although they are included among the angels who were messengers &#8211; only because this Ayah was meant to support Jibril the emissary between Allah and His Prophets. Allah also mentioned Mika&#8217;il here, because the Jews claimed that Jibril was their enemy and Mika&#8217;il was their friend. Allah informed them that whoever is an enemy of either of them, then he is also an enemy of the other as well as Allah. We should state here that Mika&#8217;il sometimes descended to some of Allah&#8217;s Prophets, although to a lesser extent than Jibril, because this was primarily Jibril&#8217;s task, and Israfil is entrusted with the job of blowing the Trumpet for the commencement of Resurrection on the Day of Judgment. It is recorded in the Sahih that whenever the Messenger of Allah would wake up at night, he would supplicate,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Allah, Lord of Jibril, Mika&#8217;il and Israfil, Creator of the heavens and earth and Knower of the seen and the unseen! You judge between Your servants regarding what they differ in, so direct me to the truth which they differ on, by Your leave. Verily, You guide whom You will to the straight path.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(then verily, Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers) informed the disbelievers that whoever takes a friend of Allah as an enemy, then he has taken Allah as an enemy, and whoever treats Allah as an enemy, then he shall be Allah&#8217;s enemy. Indeed, whoever is an enemy of Allah then he will lose in this life and the Hereafter, as stated earlier;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Whoever takes a friend of Mine as an enemy, I shall wage war on him.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Tafsir Ibn Kathir (Abridged) &#8211; Al-Ma&#8217;idah surah 5© Darussalam 2000</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(64. The Jews say: &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Hand is tied up.&#8221; Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for what they uttered. Nay, both His Hands are widely outstretched. He spends as He wills. Verily, the revelation that has come to you from your Lord makes many of them increase in rebellion and disbelief. We have put enmity and hatred among them till the Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindled the fire of war, Allah extinguished it; and they (ever) strive to make mischief on the earth. And Allah does not like the mischief-makers.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(65. And if only the People of the Scripture had believed and had Taqwa, We would indeed have expiated for them their sins and admitted them to Gardens of pleasure (in Paradise).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(66. And if only they had acted according to the Tawrah, the Injil, and what has (now) been sent down to them from their Lord (the Qur&#8217;an), they would surely have gotten provision from above them and from underneath their feet. And among them is a Muqtasid Ummah, but for most of them; evil is their work.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah states that the Jews, may Allah&#8217;s continuous curses descend on them until the Day of Resurrection, describe Him as a miser. Allah is far holier than what they attribute to Him. The Jews also claim that Allah is poor, while they are rich. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Jews say, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Hand is tied up.&#8221;) &#8220;They do not mean that Allah&#8217;s Hand is literally tied up. Rather, they mean that He is a miser and does not spend from what He has. Allah is far holier than what they attribute to Him.&#8221; Similar was reported from Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak. Allah said in another Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck, nor stretch it forth to its utmost reach (like a spendthrift), so that you become blameworthy and in severe poverty.) In this Ayah, Allah prohibits stinginess and extravagance, which includes unnecessary and improper expenditures. Allah describes stinginess by saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck. ) Therefore, this is the meaning that the Jews meant, may Allah&#8217;s curses be on them. `Ikrimah said that this Ayah was revealed about Finhas, one of the Jews, may Allah curse him. We mentioned before that Finhas said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;Truly, Allah is poor and we are rich!&#8221;) and that Abu Bakr smacked him. Allah has refuted what the Jews attribute to Him and cursed them in retaliation for their lies and fabrications about Him. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for what they uttered.) What Allah said occurred, for the Jews are indeed miserly, envious, cowards and tremendously humiliated. Allah said in other Ayat,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Or have they a share in the dominion Then in that case they would not give mankind even a Naqir. Or do they envy men for what Allah has given them of His bounty Then, We had already given the family of Ibrahim the Book and the Hikmah, and conferred upon them a great kingdom.) and, n</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Indignity is put over them.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Hands are Widely Outstretched</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay, both His Hands are widely outstretched. He spends (of His bounty) as He wills.) Allah&#8217;s favors are ample, His bounty unlimited, as He owns the treasures of everything. Any good that reaches His servants is from Him alone, without partners. He has created everything that we need by night or by day, while traveling or at home and in all situations and conditions. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And He gave you of all that you asked for, and if you count the blessings of Allah, never will you be able to count them. Verily, man is indeed an extreme wrongdoer, an extreme ingrate.) There are many other Ayat on this subject. Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal said that `Abdur-Razzaq narrated to him that Ma`mar said that Hammam bin Munabbih said, &#8220;This is what Abu Hurayrah narrated to us that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah&#8217;s Right Hand is perfectly full, and no amount of spending can decrease what He has, even though He spends by night and by day. Do you see how much Allah has spent since He created the heavens and earth Yet surely it has not decreased what He has in His Right Hand. His Throne is over the water and in His Other Hand is the hold by which He raises and lowers.) He also said, قُولُ اللهُ تَعَالى:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah said, `Spend and I will spend on you.&#8217;)&#8221; This Hadith was recorded in the Two Sahihs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Tafseer Ibn Katheer : Al-Ma&#8217;idah surah 5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(They change the words from their places:) by altering their meanings and knowingly distorting them after they comprehended them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(they say, &#8220;If you are given this, take it, but if you are not given this, then beware!&#8221;) It was reported that this part of the Ayah was revealed about some Jews who committed murder and who said to each other, &#8220;Let us ask Muhammad to judge between us, and if he decides that we pay the Diyah, accept his judgement. If he decides on capital punishment, do not accept his judgement.&#8221; The correct opinion is that this Ayah was revealed about the two Jews who committed adultery. The Jews changed the law they had in their Book from Allah on the matter of punishment for adultery, from stoning to death, to a hundred flogs and making the offenders ride a donkey facing the back of the donkey. When this incident of adultery occurred after the Hijrah, they said to each other, &#8220;Let us go to Muhammad and seek his judgement. If he gives a ruling of flogging, then implement his decision and make it a proof for you with Allah. This way, one of Allah&#8217;s Prophets will have upheld this ruling amongst you. But if he decides that the punishment should be stoning to death, then do not accept his decision.&#8221; There are several Hadiths mentioning this story. Malik reported that Nafi` said that `Abdullah bin `Umar said, &#8220;The Jews came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger and mentioned that a man and a woman from them committed adultery. Allah&#8217;s Messenger said to them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(What do find of the ruling about stoning in the Tawrah) They said, `We only find that they should be exposed and flogged.&#8217; `Abdullah bin Salam said, `You lie. The Tawrah mentions stoning, so bring the Tawrah.&#8217; They brought the Tawrah and opened it but one of them hid the verse about stoning with his hand and recited what is before and after that verse. `Abdullah bin Salam said to him, `Remove your hand,&#8217; and he removed it, thus uncovering the verse about stoning. So they said, He (`Abdullah bin Salam) has said the truth, O Muhammad! It is the verse about stoning.&#8217; The Messenger of Allah decided that the adulterers be stoned to death and his command was carried out. I saw that man shading the woman from the stones with his body.&#8221; Al-Bukhari and Muslim also collected this Hadith and this is the wording collected by Al-Bukhari. In another narration by Al-Bukhari, the Prophet said to the Jews,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(What would you do in this case) They said, &#8220;We would humiliate and expose them.&#8221; The Prophet recited,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Bring here the Tawrah and recite it, if you are truthful.) So they brought a man who was blind in one eye and who was respected among them and said to him, &#8220;Read (from the Tawrah).&#8221; So he read until he reached a certain verse and then covered it with his hand. He was told, &#8220;Remove your hand,&#8221; and it was the verse about stoning. So that man said, &#8220;O Muhammad! This is the verse about stoning, and we had hid its knowledge among us.&#8221; So the Messenger ordered that the two adulterers be stoned, and they were stoned. Muslim recorded that a Jewish man and a Jewish woman were brought before Allah&#8217;s Messenger because they committed adultery. The Messenger of Allah went to the Jews and asked them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(What is the ruling that you find in the Tawrah for adultery) hThey said, &#8220;We expose them, carry them (on donkeys) backwards and parade them in public.&#8221; The Prophet recited;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Bring here the Tawrah and recite it, if you are truthful.) So they brought the Tawrah and read from it until the reader reached the verse about stoning. Then he placed his hand on that verse and read what was before and after it. `Abdullah bin Salam, who was with the Messenger of Allah , said, &#8220;Order him to remove his hand,&#8221; and he removed his hand and under it was the verse about stoning. So the Messenger of Allah commanded that the adulterers be stoned, and they were stoned. `Abdullah bin `Umar said, &#8220;I was among those who stoned them and I saw the man shading the woman from the stones with his body.&#8221; Abu Dawud recorded that Ibn `Umar said, &#8220;Some Jews came to the Messenger of Allah and invited him to go to the Quff area. So he went to the house of Al-Midras and they said, `O Abu Al-Qasim! A man from us committed adultery with a woman, so decide on their matter.&#8217; They arranged a pillow for the Messenger of Allah and he sat on it and said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Bring the Tawrah to me.) He was brought the Tawrah and he removed the pillow from under him and placed the Tawrah on it, saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I trust you and He Who revealed it to you.) He then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Bring me your most knowledgeable person.) So he was brought a young man&#8230; &#8221; and then he mentioned the rest of the story that Malik narrated from Nafi`. These Hadiths state that the Messenger of Allah issued a decision that conforms with the ruling in the Tawrah, not to honor the Jews in what they believe in, for the Jews were commanded to follow the Law of Muhammad only. Rather, the Prophet did this because Allah commanded him to do so. He asked them about the ruling of stoning in the Tawrah to make them admit to what the Tawrah contains and what they collaborated to hide, deny and exclude from implementing for all that time. They had to admit to what they did, although they did it while having knowledge of the correct ruling. What made them go to the Prophet for judgement in this matter was their lusts and desires, hoping that the Prophet would agree with their opinion, not that they believed in the correctness of his judgment. This is why they said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(If you are given this,) referring to flogging, then take it,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(but if you are not given this, then beware!) and do not accept or implement it. Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whomsoever Allah wants to put in Fitnah, you can do nothing for him against Allah. Those are the ones whose hearts Allah does not want to purify; for them there is a disgrace in this world, and in the Hereafter a great torment. They (like to) listen to falsehood, to devour Suht) `Suht&#8217; refers to bribes, as Ibn Mas`ud and others stated. The Ayah states that if one is like this, how can Allah cleanse his heart and accept his supplication Allah said to His Prophet ,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So if they come to you&#8230;) so that you judge between them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(either judge between them, or turn away from them. If you turn away from them, they cannot hurt you in the least.) meaning, there is no harm if you do not judge between them. This is because when they came to you to judge between them, they did not seek to follow the truth, but only what conformed to their lusts. We should mention here that Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Zayd bin Aslam, `Ata&#8217; Al-Khurasani, and several others said that this part of the Ayah was abrogated by Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And so judge among them by what Allah has revealed.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And if you judge, judge with justice between them.) and with fairness, even if the Jews were unjust and outcasts from the path of fairness,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, Allah loves those who act justly.)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then refutes the Christians&#8217; and Jews&#8217; false claims and lies,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And the Jews and the Christians say, &#8220;We are the children of Allah and His loved ones.&#8221;) They claim: &#8220;We are the followers of Allah&#8217;s Prophets, who are His children, whom He takes care of. He also loves us.&#8221; The People of the Book claim in their Book that Allah said to His servant Isra&#8217;il, &#8220;You are my firstborn.&#8221; But they explained this statement in an improper manner and altered its meaning. Some of the People of the Book who later became Muslims refuted this false statement saying, &#8220;This statement only indicates honor and respect, as is common in their speech at that time.&#8221; The Christians claim that `Isa said to them, &#8220;I will go back to my father and your father,&#8221; meaning, my Lord and your Lord. It is a fact that the Christians did not claim that they too are Allah&#8217;s sons as they claimed about `Isa. Rather this statement by `Isa only meant to indicate a closeness with Allah. This is why when they said that they are Allah&#8217;s children and loved ones, Allah refuted their claim,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say, &#8220;Why then does He punish you for your sins&#8221;) meaning, if you were truly as you claim, Allah&#8217;s children and loved ones, then why did He prepare the Fire because of your disbelief, lies and false claims</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay, you are but human beings, of those He has created,) Allah states: you are just like the rest of the children of Adam, and Allah is the Lord of all His creation,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills.) Allah does what He wills, there is none who can escape His judgement, and He is swift in reckoning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them;) Therefore, everything is Allah&#8217;s property and under His power and control,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and to Him is the return.) In the end, the return will be to Allah and He will judge between His servants as He will, and He is the Most Just Who is never wrong in His judgment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source : Tafsir Ibn Kathir (Abridged)<br />
Ale Imraan Verses 3.65 and 3.67 © Darussalam 2000</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(65. O people of the Scripture! Why do you dispute about Ibrahim, while the Tawrah and the Injil were not revealed till after him Have you then no sense) (66. Verily, you are those who have disputed about that of which you have knowledge. Why do you then dispute concerning that of which you have no knowledge It is Allah Who knows, and you know not.) (67. Ibrahim was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a true Muslim Hanifa and he was not of the Mushrikin ) (68. Verily, among mankind who have the best claim to Ibrahim are those who followed him, and this Prophet and those who have believed. And Allah is the Wali (Protector and Helper) of the believers.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah censures the Jews and Christians for their dispute with Muslims over Ibrahim Al-Khalil and the claim each group made that he was one of them. Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar reported that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;The Christians of Najran and Jewish rabbis gathered before the Messenger of Allah and disputed in front of him. The rabbis said, `Ibrahim was certainly Jewish.&#8217; The Christians said, `Certainly, Ibrahim was Christian.&#8217; So Allah sent down,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Why do you dispute about Ibrahim,) meaning, `How is it that you, Jews, claim that Ibrahim was Jew, although he lived before Allah sent down the Tawrah to Musa How is it that you, Christians, claim that Ibrahim was Christian, although Christianity came after his time&#8221; This is why Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Have you then no sense)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, you are those who have disputed about that of which you have knowledge. Why do you then dispute concerning that of which you have no knowledge)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah criticizes those who argue and dispute without knowledge, just as the Jews and Christians did concerning Ibrahim. Had they disputed about their religions, which they had knowledge of, and about the Law that was legislated for them until Muhammad was sent, it would have been better for them. Rather, they disputed about what they had no knowledge of, so Allah criticized them for this behavior. Allah commanded them to refer what they have no knowledge of to He Who knows the seen and unseen matters and Who knows the true reality of all things. This is why Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(It is Allah Who knows, and you know not.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Ibrahim was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a true Muslim Hanifa), shunning Shirk and living in Iman,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and he was not of the Mushrikin.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah is similar to the Ayah in Surat Al-Baqarah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And they say, &#8220;Be Jews or Christians, then you will be guided&#8230;&#8221;) 2:135</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, among mankind who have the best claim to Ibrahim are those who followed him, and this Prophet and those who have believed. And Allah is the Wali (Protector and Helper) of the believers.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah means, &#8220;The people who have the most right to be followers of Ibrahim are those who followed his religion and this Prophet, Muhammad , and his Companions from the Muhajirin, Ansar and those who followed their lead.&#8221; Sa`id bin Mansur recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Every Prophet had a Wali (supporter, best friend) from among the Prophets. My Wali among them is my father Ibrahim, the Khalil (intimate friend) of my Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet then recited,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, among mankind who have the best claim to Ibrahim are those who followed him&#8230;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And Allah is the Wali (Protector and Helper) of the believers.) means, Allah is the Protector of all those who believe in His Messengers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Tafsir Ibn Kathir (Abridged) &#8211; Al-Nisa surah 4 © Darussalam 2000</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And because of their (Jews) disbelief and uttering against Maryam a grave false charge.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas stated that the Jews accused Maryam of fornication.This is also the saying of As-Suddi, Juwaybir, Muhammad bin Ishaq and several others. This meaning is also apparent in the Ayah, as the Jews accused Maryam and her son of grave accusations: They accused her of fornication and claimed that `Isa was an illegitimate son. Some of them even claimed that she was menstruating while fornicating. May Allah&#8217;s continued curse be upon them until the Day of Resurrection. The Jews also said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;We killed Al-Masih, `Isa, son of Maryam, the Messenger of Allah,&#8221;) meaning, we killed the person who claimed to be the Messenger of Allah. The Jews only uttered these words in jest and mockery, just as the polytheists said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O you to whom the Dhikr (the Qur&#8217;an) has been sent down! Verily, you are a mad man!) When Allah sent `Isa with proofs and guidance, the Jews, may Allah&#8217;s curses, anger, torment and punishment be upon them, envied him because of his prophethood and obvious miracles; curing the blind and leprous and bringing the dead back to life, by Allah&#8217;s leave. He also used to make the shape of a bird from clay and blow in it, and it became a bird by Allah&#8217;s leave and flew. `Isa performed other miracles that Allah honored him with, yet the Jews defied and bellied him and tried their best to harm him. Allah&#8217;s Prophet `Isa could not live in any one city for long and he had to travel often with his mother, peace be upon them. Even so, the Jews were not satisfied, and they went to the king of Damascus at that time, a Greek polytheist who worshipped the stars. They told him that there was a man in Bayt Al-Maqdis misguiding and dividing the people in Jerusalem and stirring unrest among the king&#8217;s subjects. The king became angry and wrote to his deputy in Jerusalem to arrest the rebel leader, stop him from causing unrest, crucify him and make him wear a crown of thorns. When the king&#8217;s deputy in Jerusalem received these orders, he went with some Jews to the house that `Isa was residing in, and he was then with twelve, thirteen or seventeen of his companions. That day was a Friday, in the evening. They surrounded `Isa in the house, and when he felt that they would soon enter the house or that he would sooner or later have to leave it, he said to his companions, &#8220;Who volunteers to be made to look like me, for which he will be my companion in Paradise&#8221; A young man volunteered, but `Isa thought that he was too young. He asked the question a second and third time, each time the young man volunteering, prompting `Isa to say, &#8220;Well then, you will be that man.&#8221; Allah made the young man look exactly like `Isa, while a hole opened in the roof of the house, and `Isa was made to sleep and ascended to heaven while asleep. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And (remember) when Allah said: &#8220;O `Isa! I will take you and raise you to Myself.&#8221;) When `Isa ascended, those who were in the house came out. When those surrounding the house saw the man who looked like `Isa, they thought that he was `Isa. So they took him at night, crucified him and placed a crown of thorns on his head. The Jews then boasted that they killed `Isa and some Christians accepted their false claim, due to their ignorance and lack of reason. As for those who were in the house with `Isa, they witnessed his ascension to heaven, while the rest thought that the Jews killed `Isa by crucifixion. They even said that Maryam sat under the corpse of the crucified man and cried, and they say that the dead man spoke to her. All this was a test from Allah for His servants out of His wisdom. Allah explained this matter in the Glorious Qur&#8217;an which He sent to His honorable Messenger, whom He supported with miracles and clear, unequivocal evidence. Allah is the Most Truthful, and He is the Lord of the worlds Who knows the secrets, what the hearts conceal, the hidden matters in heaven and earth, what has occurred, what will occur, and what would occur if it was decreed. He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but it appeared as that to them,) referring to the person whom the Jews thought was `Isa. This is why Allah said afterwards,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and those who differ therein are full of doubts. They have no (certain) knowledge, they follow nothing but conjecture.) referring to the Jews who claimed to kill `Isa and the ignorant Christians who believed them. Indeed they are all in confusion, misguidance and bewilderment. This is why Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(For surely; they killed him not.) meaning they are not sure that `Isa was the one whom they killed. Rather, they are in doubt and confusion over this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(But Allah raised him up unto Himself. And Allah is Ever All-Powerful,) meaning, He is the Almighty, and He is never weak, nor will those who seek refuge in Him ever be subjected to disgrace,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(All-Wise.) in all that He decides and ordains for His creatures. Indeed, Allah&#8217;s is the clearest wisdom, unequivocal proof and the most glorious authority. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;Just before Allah raised `Isa to the heavens, `Isa went to his companions, who were twelve inside the house. When he arrived, his hair was dripping water and he said, `There are those among you who will disbelieve in me twelve times after he had believed in me.&#8217; He then asked, `Who volunteers that his image appear as mine, and be killed in my place. He will be with me (in Paradise)&#8217; One of the youngest ones among them volunteered and `Isa asked him to sit down. `Isa again asked for a volunteer, and the young man kept volunteering and `Isa asking him to sit down. Then the young man volunteered again and `Isa said, `You will be that man,&#8217; and the resemblance of `Isa was cast over that man while `Isa ascended to heaven from a hole in the house.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Jews came looking for `Isa, they found that young man and crucified him. Some of `Isa&#8217;s followers disbelieved in him twelve times after they had believed in him. They then divided into three groups. One group, Al-Ya`qubiyyah (Jacobites), said, `Allah remained with us as long as He willed and then ascended to heaven.&#8217; Another group, An-Nasturiyyah (Nestorians), said, `The son of Allah was with us as long as he willed and Allah took him to heaven.&#8217; Another group, Muslims, said, `The servant and Messenger of Allah remained with us as long as Allah willed, and Allah then took him to Him.&#8217; The two disbelieving groups cooperated against the Muslim group and they killed them. Ever since that happened, Islam was then veiled until Allah sent Muhammad .&#8221; This statement has an authentic chain of narration leading to Ibn `Abbas, and An-Nasa&#8217;i narrated it through Abu Kurayb who reported it from Abu Mu`awiyah. Many among the Salaf stated that `Isa asked if someone would volunteer for his appearance to be cast over him, and that he will be killed instead of `Isa, for which he would be his companion in Paradise.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(Have you not seen those who were forbidden to hold secret counsels, and afterwards returned to that which they had been forbidden,) He said, &#8220;The Jews.&#8221; Similar was said by Muqatil bin Hayyan, who added, &#8220;The Prophet had a peace treaty with the Jews. When one of the Prophet&#8217;s Companions would pass by a gathering of Jews, they would speak among themselves in secret, prompting the believer to think that they were plotting to kill or harm him. When the believer saw this, he feared for his safety and changed the route he was taking. The Prophet advised them to abandon their evil secret talks, but they did not listen and kept on holding the Najwa. Allah the Exalted sent down this Ayah in their case,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Have you not seen those who were forbidden to hold secret counsels, and afterwards returned to that which they had been forbidden).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and conspired together for sin and wrongdoing and disobedience to the Messenger.) means, they used to talk to each other,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(for sin) which involves themselves,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and wrongdoing) which effects others. They speak about disobedience and defying of the Messenger , with persistence and recommending each other to follow their way,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And when they come to you, they greet you with a greeting wherewith Allah greets you not,) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `A&#8217;ishah said, &#8220;Some Jews came to the Prophet and greeted him by saying, `As-Sam `Alayka, O Abul-Qasim.&#8217; So I said to them, `wa `Alaykum As-Sam (the same death be upon you).&#8217; The Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O `A&#8217;ishah, Allah does not like rudeness and foul speech.) I said, `Didn&#8217;t you hear them say, `As-Sam Alayka&#8217; He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Didn&#8217;t you hear me answering them back by saying, `Wa `Alaykum (And the same upon you)&#8217;) Allah the Exalted then sent down this Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And when they come to you, they greet you with a greeting wherewith Allah greets you not,)&#8221; The narration collected in the Sahih states that `A&#8217;ishah said, &#8220;And be upon you the death, disgrace and curse.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah said to her,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah accepts our supplication against them, but not theirs against us.) Ibn Jarir recorded that Anas bin Malik said, &#8220;A Jew passed by Allah&#8217;s Messenger , who was sitting with his Companions, he greeted them and they greeted him back. Allah&#8217;s Messenger then said to his Companions,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Do you know what he just said) They said, `He said: As-Salam, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger.&#8217; The Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Rather he said, Sam `Alaykum.) meaning, `may you disgrace your religion.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Messenger then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Bring him back,) and when he was brought back, the Prophet asked him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Did you say: Sam `Alaykum) He said, `Yes.&#8217; The Prophet then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When the people of the Book greet you, say, `Wa `Alaykum.&#8217;)&#8221; meaning, `and the same on you too.&#8217; The basis for the Hadith of Anas is in the Sahih and similar to this Hadith of `A&#8217;ishah is in the Sahih. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and say within themselves:&#8221;Why should Allah punish us not for what we say&#8221;) means, the Jews say these words, changing the meaning of the Islamic greeting, into an abusive statement, and then say, `Had he been a Prophet, Allah would have punished us for what we said. Allah knows what we conceal. Therefore, if Muhammad were a Prophet, Allah would have sent His punishment on us sooner, in this life.&#8217; Allah the Exalted replied,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Hell will be sufficient for them;) ell should be sufficient for them in the Hereafter,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(they will enter therein. And worst indeed is that destination!) Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said that the Jews used to say, &#8220;Sam `Alayka,&#8221; to Allah&#8217;s Messenger . They would say then within themselves, &#8220;Why does Allah not punish us for what we say&#8221; This Ayah was later revealed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And when they come to you, they greet you with a greeting wherewith Allah greets you not, and say within themselves: &#8220;Why should Allah punish us not for what we say&#8221; Hell will be sufficient for them; they will enter therein. And worst indeed is that destination!) Its chain of narration is Hasan, but they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not collect it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Manners of the Najwa, (Secret Counsel)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted teaches His believing servants to avoid the ways of the disbelievers and hypocrites,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O you who believe! When you hold secret counsel, do it not for sin and wrongdoing, and disobedience to the Messenger,) meaning, do not hold evil secret counsels like the ignorant disbelieving People of the Scriptures and their allies among the hypocrites, who imitate their ways,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(but do it for Al-Birr and Taqwa; and have Taqwa of Allah unto Whom you shall be gathered.) and He will then inform you of all your deeds and statements; He has counted and recorded them and will justly hold you accountable for them. Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(An-Najwa are only from the Shaytan, in order that he may cause grief to the believers. But he cannot harm them in the least, except as Allah permits. And in Allah let the believers put their trust.) Allah states that secret talks, where the believers feel anxious, are</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(only from Shaytan, in order that he may cause grief to the believers.) meaning, that those who hold such counsels do so because of the lures of the devil,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(in order that he may cause grief to the believers.) The devil seeks to bother the believers, even though his plots will not harm the believers, except if Allah wills it. Those who are the subject of evil Najwa, should seek refuge in Allah and put his trust in Him, for none of it will harm them, Allah willing. The Sunnah also forbids the Najwa so that no Muslim is bothered by it. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(If you were three, then two of you should not hold a secret counsel in the presence of the third person, because that would cause him to be worried.) This Hadith is collected in the Two Sahihs using a chain of narration that contained Al-A`mash. `Abdur-Razzaq narrated that `Abdullah bin `Umar said that Allah&#8217;s Messenger said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(If you were three, then two of you should not hold a secret counsel in the presence of the third person, except with his permission, because that would cause him to be worried.) Muslim collected this Hadith.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Source: Tafseer Ibn Katheer</span>. From Surah A Hashr</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The End that Bani An-Nadir suffered</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He it is Who drove out the disbelievers among the People of the Scripture) referring to the Jewish tribe of Bani An-Nadir, according to Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Az-Zuhri and several others. When the Messenger of Allah migrated to Al-Madinah, he made a peace treaty with the Jews stipulating that he would not fight them and they would not fight him. They soon betrayed the treaty that they made with Allah&#8217;s Messenger . Therefore, Allah sent His torment down on them; it can never be averted, and His appointed destiny touched them; it can never be resisted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet forced them to evacuate and abandon their fortified forts that Muslims did not think they would ever control. The Jews thought that their fortifications will save them from Allah&#8217;s torment, but they did not help them against Allah in the least. Then, that which they did not expect came to them from Allah, and Allah&#8217;s Messenger forced them to leave Al-Madinah. Some of them went to Adhri`at in the area of Ash-Sham, which is the area of the grand Gathering and Resurrection, while others went to Khaybar. The Prophet allowed them to evacuate their forts and take whatever their camels could carry. They destroyed the property that they could not carry. This is why Allah the Exalted said, (they demolished their own dwellings with their own hands and the hands of the believers Then take admonition, O you with eyes.) meaning, &#8220;Contemplate the end of those who defied Allah&#8217;s command, contradicted His Messenger and denied His Book. See how Allah&#8217;s humiliating torment struck them in this life, as well as, the painful torment that Allah has reserved for them in the Hereafter.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dawud recorded that `Abdur-Rahman bin Ka`b bin Malik said that one of the Prophet&#8217;s Companions said, &#8220;The Quraysh idolators wrote to `Abdullah bin Ubayy and those who were still worshipping idols among the tribes of Al-Aws and Al-Khazraj. The Messenger of Allah was in Al-Madinah at the time, before the battle of Badr occurred. They wrote: `You have given refuge to our citizen. We swear by Allah, you should fight him, or we will expel you or gather all our forces, until we kill your soldiers and take your women captive.&#8217; When the news of this threat reached `Abdullah bin Ubayy and the idolators of Al-Aws and Al-Khazraj, they prepared to fight the Prophet . The news of this reached the Prophet and he went to them saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The threat of the Quraysh has caused you extreme anxiety! The Quraysh cannot cause you more harm than what you will cause yourselves by your actions. Do you want to fight your children and brethren) When they heard these words from the Prophet , they dis- persed and the news of what happened reached the Quraysh idolators. After the battle of Badr, the Quraysh idolators wrote to the Jews of Al-Madinah, `You have armor and forts! You should fight our citizen or we will do such and such to you, and nothing will prevent us from acquiring your women.&#8217;The news of this letter also reached the Prophet and Bani An-Nadir intended to betray their treaty. Bani An-Nadir sent a message to the Prophet asking him to come with thirty of his Companions to meet thirty of their rabbis half way, from either side. They said that the rabbis would listen to the Prophet and if they believe in him, the rest of Bani An-Nadir would believe. They intended to kill the Messenger , and Allah informed His Messenger of this plot before they could harm him. The next day, the Prophet gathered his forces and laid siege to their area, saying to them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(By Allah ! You will not be safe until and unless you renew your peace treaty with me.) They refused to do so, and the Prophet fought them the rest of that day. The next morning, the Prophet laid siege to the tribe of Bani Qurayzah and left Bani An-Nadir alone that day. The Prophet ordered Bani Qurayzah to sign a new treaty of peace, and they accepted. The Prophet left Bani Qurayzah and went back to Bani An-Nadir with his forces and fought them until they agreed to surrender in return for safe passage out of Al-Madinah. Bani An-Nadir evacuated Al-Madinah and took with them all whatever their camels could carry from their furniture, including even the wood and the doors to their houses. The date trees of Bani An-Nadir were granted to the Messenger by Allah when He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And what Allah gave as booty to His Messenger from them &#8212; for this you made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry) that is, what you earned without a fight. The Prophet divided most of their trees between the emigrants and gave to only two men who were poor from Al-Ansar. He did not give the Ansar any of it, except for these two men. The Prophet kept a part of the war booty for himself and that part of charity of the Prophet was transferred to the administration of his daughter&#8217;s children, i.e., children of Fatimah.&#8221; However, let us summarize the battle of Bani An-Nadir here. From Allah alone we seek help.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Reason behind the Battle of Bani An-Nadir</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the seventy Companions whom the Prophet sent to teach the Qur&#8217;an were killed at the area of Bi&#8217;r Ma`unah, excluding `Amr bin Umayyah Ad-Damri, who killed two men from the tribe of Bani `Amir on his way back to Al-Madinah. He did not know that these two men had a promise of safe passage from Allah&#8217;s Messenger . When he went back to Al-Madinah, he told the Prophet what happened and the Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(You have killed two men, I shall pay the blood money for them.) Bani An-Nadir and Bani `Amir were allies and had treaties. The Prophet asked Bani An-Nadir to help pay the blood money for the two dead men. The area of Bani An-Nadir was in a suburb of Al-Madinah, a few miles to the east. In his book of Sirah, Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar said; &#8220;Then the Messenger of Allah went to Bani An-Nadir to ask them for financial help to pay the blood money of the two men from Bani `Amir, who were killed by `Amr bin Umayyah Ad-Damri. They had a promise of safe passage from the Prophet according to the (subnarrator) Yazid bin Ruman. Bani An-Nadir and Bani `Amir had a treaty and were allies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Messenger went to Bani An-Nadir asking them for help to pay the blood money for the two men, they said, `Yes, O Abu Al-Qasim! We will help you, since you asked us for help.&#8217; Yet, when they met each other in secret, they said, `You will not find a better chance with this man than this,&#8217; while the Messenger of Allah was sitting next to a wall of one of their houses. They said, `Who will ascend this wall and drop a stone on this man and rid us of his trouble&#8217; `Amr bin Jihash bin Ka`b volunteered and ascended the wall of the house to drop a stone on the Messenger .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah was sitting with several of his Companions, such as Abu Bakr, `Umar and `Ali. The news of this plot was conveyed to the Prophet from heaven, and he stood up and went back to Al-Madinah. When the Companions thought that the Messenger was absent for a long time, they went to see where he was and saw a man coming from Al-Madinah. They asked him, and he said that he saw the Prophet enter Al-Madinah. The Messenger&#8217;s Companions went to him, and he told them the news of the betraying plot that the Jews planned against him. He ordered them to prepare for war and to march forth to Bani An-Nadir.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet gathered his forces and marched to the area of Bani An-Nadir, who had taken refuge in their fortified forts. The Messenger ordered their date trees be cut down and burned. The Jews heralded at the Prophet, `O Muhammad! You used to forbid mischief in the earth and blame those who did it. Why is it that you had the date trees cut down and burned&#8217; Meanwhile, `Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul, Wadi`ah, Malik bin Abi Qawqal, Suwayd, Da`is and several other men who all belonged to the tribe of Al-Khazraj bin Bani `Awf, sent a message to Bani An-Nadir saying, `Be firm and strong. We will never abandon you. If you are fought against, we will fight along with you and if you are forced to leave Al-Madinah, we will accompany you.&#8217; The Jews waited for this claim of support, but the hypocrites did not deliver. Allah cast terror in the hearts of the Jews. They asked the Messenger to allow them safe passage out of Al-Madinah and to spare their lives. In return, they would only take what their camels could carry, except for weapons. The Prophet agreed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews collected all the wealth their camels could transport. One of the Jews would demolish his own house around its door, so that he could carry the door on the back of his camel. Bani An-Nadir moved to Khaybar, and some of them went to Ash-Sham. They left all that remained behind for the Messenger of Allah , who had control over how it was to be divided.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet divided it between the emigrants and none of Al-Ansar got a share, except for Sahl bin Hunayf and Abu Dujanah Simak bin Kharashah. They said that they were poor and the Messenger of Allah gave them their share. Only two men from Bani An-Nadir embraced Islam, Yamin bin Umayr bin Ka`b bin `Amr bin Jihash and Abu Sa`d bin Wahb and they saved their wealth due to their acceptance of Islam.&#8221; Ibn Ishaq continued, &#8220;Some of the offspring of Yamin narrated to me that the Messenger of Allah said to Yamin,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Have you not heard what your cousin plotted to do against me) Yamin bin `Umayr promised someone a reward if he killed his cousin `Amr bin Jihash, and someone killed him, according to their claim&#8221; Ibn Ishaq then said, &#8220;All of Surat Al-Hashr was revealed about Bani An-Nadir. &#8221; A similar story was recorded by Yunus bin Bukayr from Ibn Ishaq. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He it is Who drove out the disbelievers among the People of the Scripture) refers to Bani An-Nadir,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(from their homes at the first gathering.) Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(You did not think that they would get out.) i.e., within the few days you laid siege against them. The Companions had surrounded their forts for only six days, and their forts were fortified and formidable. This is why Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And they thought that their fortresses would defend them from Allah! But Allah reached them from a place where they expected it not.) meaning, there came to them from Allah what they did not expect or anticipate. Allah said in another Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Those before them indeed plotted, but Allah struck at the foundation of their building, and then the roof fell down upon them, from above them, and the torment overtook them from directions they did not perceive.)(16:26) Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and He cast terror into their hearts) means, Allah cast fear, terror and fright in their hearts, and why would that not happen to them He who was given victory, by Allah frightening his enemies the distance of a month, laid siege to them. May Allah&#8217;s peace and blessings be on the Prophet. As in Ibn Ishaq&#8217;s explanation &#8212; which preceded;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(that they demolished their own dwellings with their own hands and the hands of the believers.) the Jews brought down what they wanted to transport from their roofs and doors, so that they could carry them on camels. Similar was said by `Urwah bin Az-Zubayr, `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam and several others. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And had it not been that Allah had decreed exile for them, He would certainly have punished them in this world;) meaning, if it was not for the fact that Allah had already decreed that they would evacuate Al-Madinah, leaving behind their homes and wealth, He would have sent another type of punishment upon them, such as being killed and captured. This was said by Az-Zuhri. `Urwah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd said that Allah decreed that the Jews would be punished in the life of this world and face the torment of the fire of Hell He prepared for them in the Hereafter. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and in the Hereafter theirs shall be the torment of the Fire.) meaning, it is a matter ordained that they will surely face,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(That is because they opposed Allah and His Messenger.) means, Allah prepared this specific punishment and sent His Messenger and his Companions against them, because they defied Allah and His Messenger and denied the good news that Allah sent forth in the Books of previous Messengers regarding the coming of Muhammad . The Jews knew these facts about Muhammad just as they knew their own children. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whosoever opposes Allah, then verily, Allah is Severe in punishment.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet Cut down the Date Trees of the Jews by the Leave of Allah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(What you cut down of the Linah, or you left them standing on their stems, it was by leave of Allah, and in order that He might disgrace the rebellious.) Linah is an especially good type of date tree. Abu `Ubaydah said that Linah is a different kind of dates than `Ajwah and Barni. Several others said that Linah refers to every type of date fruits, except for the `Ajwah (ripen dates), while Ibn Jarir said that it refers to all kinds of date trees. Ibn Jarir quoted Mujahid saying that it also includes the Buwayrah type. When the Messenger of Allah laid siege to Bani An-Nadir, to humiliate them and bring fear and terror to their hearts, he ordered their date trees to be cut down. Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated that Yazid bin Ruman, Qatadah and Muqatil bin Hayyan said, &#8220;Bani An-Nadir sent a message to the Messenger , saying that he used to outlaw mischief in the earth, so why did he order that their trees be cut down Allah sent down this honorable Ayah stating that whatever Linah was felled or left intact by the Muslims, has been done by His permission, will, leave and pleasure to humiliate and disgrace the enemy and degrade them.&#8221; Mujahid said, &#8220;Some of the emigrants discouraged others from chopping down the date trees of Jews, saying that they were war spoils for Muslims. The Qur&#8217;an approved of the actions of those who discouraged and those who approved of cutting these trees, stating that those who cut them or did not, did so only by Allah&#8217;s leave.&#8221; There is also a Hadith narrated from the Prophet with this meaning. An-Nasa&#8217;i recorded that Ibn `Abbas said about Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(What you cut down of the Linah, or you left them standing on their stems, it was by leave of Allah, and in order that He might disgrace the rebellious.) &#8220;They forced them to come down from their forts and were ordered to cut their trees cut down. So the Muslims hesitated, and some of them said, `We cut down some and left some. We must ask Allah&#8217;s Messenger if we will earn a reward for what we cut and if we will be burdened for what we left intact.&#8217; Allah sent down this Ayah, t</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(What you cut down of the Linah, or you left them standing on their stems, it was by leave of Allah).&#8221; Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah ordered that the date trees of Bani An-Nadir be cut down and burned. The Two Sahihs collected a similar narration. Al-Bukhari recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said,&#8221;Bani An-Nadir and Bani Qurayzah fought (against the Prophet ), and the Prophet exiled Bani An-Nadir and allowed Bani Qurayzah to remain in their area until later, when the Prophet fought against Qurayzah. Their men were executed and their women, children and wealth were confiscated and divided among Muslims. Some of them, however, were saved because they returned to the Prophet&#8217;s side, who granted them asylum, and they embraced Islam. All of the Jews of Al-Madinah, Bani Qaynuqa`, the tribe of `Abdullah bin Salam, Bani Harithah and the rest of the Jewish tribes in Al-Madinah were exiled.&#8221; The Two Sahihs also recorded from Ibn `Umar that the Messenger of Allah burned down the date trees of Bani An-Nadir and had them cut down the date palms of Al-Buwayrah. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored revealed this Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(What you cut down of the Linah, or you left them standing on their stems, it was by leave of Allah, and in order that He might disgrace the rebellious.)&#8221; Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that the battle of Bani An-Nadir occurred after the battles of Uhud and Bi&#8217;r Ma`unah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Tafseer Ibn Katheer</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Al-Bukhari reported that Al-Bara&#8217; bin `Azib narrated: &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Messenger offered his prayers facing Bayt Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) for sixteen or seventeen months, but he wished that he could pray facing the Ka`bah (at Makkah). The first prayer which he offered (facing the Ka`bah) was the `Asr (Afternoon) prayer in the company of some people. Then one of those who had offered that prayer with him, went out and passed by some people in a mosque who were in the bowing position (in Ruku`) during their prayers (facing Jerusalem). He addressed them saying, `By Allah, I bear witness that I have offered prayer with the Prophet facing Makkah (Ka`bah).&#8217; Hearing that, those people immediately changed their direction towards the House (Ka`bah) while still as they were (i.e., in the same bowing position). Some Muslims who offered prayer towards the previous Qiblah (Jerusalem) before it was changed towards the House (the Ka`bah in Makkah) had died or had been martyred, and we did not know what to say about them (regarding their prayers towards Jerusalem). Allah then revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And Allah would never make your faith (prayers) to be lost (i.e., the prayers of those Muslims were valid)) (2:143).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari collected this narration, while Muslim collected it using another chain of narrators. Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that Al-Bara&#8217; narrated: Allah&#8217;s Messenger used to offer prayers towards Bayt Al-Maqdis (in Jerusalem), but would keep looking at the sky awaiting Allah&#8217;s command (to change the Qiblah). Then Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, We have seen the turning of your (Muhammad&#8217;s) face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a Qiblah (prayer direction) that shall please you, so turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah).) (2:144)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man from among the Muslims then said, &#8220;We wish we could know about those among us who died before the Qiblah was changed (i.e., towards Makkah) and also about our own prayers, that we had performed towards Bayt Al-Maqdis.&#8221; Allah then revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And Allah would never make your faith (prayers) to be lost.) (2:143)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fools among the people, meaning the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), said, &#8220;What made them change the former Qiblah that they used to face&#8221; Allah then revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The fools (idolators, hypocrites, and Jews) among the people will say&#8230;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">until the end of the Ayah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali bin Abu Talhah related that Ibn `Abbas said: When Allah&#8217;s Messenger migrated to Al-Madinah, Allah commanded him to face Bayt Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem). The Jews were delighted then. Allah&#8217;s Messenger faced Jerusalem for over ten months. However, he liked (to offer prayer in the direction of) Prophet Ibrahim&#8217;s Qiblah (the Ka`bah in Makkah) and used to supplicate to Allah and kept looking up to the sky (awaiting Allah&#8217;s command in this regard). Allah then revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(turn your faces (in prayer) in that direction.) meaning, its direction. The Jews did not like this change and said, &#8220;What made them change the Qiblah that they used to face (meaning Jerusalem)&#8221; Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say (O Muhammad ): &#8220;To Allah belong both, east and the west. He guides whom He wills to the straight way.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are several other Ahadith on this subject. In summary, Allah&#8217;s Messenger was commanded to face Bayt Al-Maqdis (during the prayer) and he used to offer prayer towards it in Makkah between the two corners (of Ka`bah), so that the Ka`bah would be between him and Bayt Al-Maqdis8. When the Prophet migrated to Al-Madinah, this practice was no longer possible; then Allah commanded him to offer prayer towards Bayt Al-Maqdis, as Ibn Abbas and the majority of the scholars have stated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari reported in his Sahih that the news (of the change of Qiblah) was conveyed to some of the Ansar while they were performing the `Asr (Afternoon) prayer towards Bayt Al-Maqdis, upon hearing that, they immediately changed their direction and faced the Ka`bah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in the Sahihayn (Al-Bukhari Muslim) that Ibn `Umar narrated: While the people were in Quba&#8217; (Mosque) performing the Fajr (Dawn) prayer, a man came and said, &#8220;A (part of the) Qur&#8217;an was revealed tonight to Allah&#8217;s Messenger and he was commanded to face the Ka`bah. Therefore, face the Ka`bah. They were facing Ash-Sham, so they turned towards the Ka`bah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These Hadiths prove that the Nasikh (a Text that abrogates a previous Text) only applies after one acquires knowledge of it, even if the Nasikh had already been revealed and announced. This is why the Companions mentioned above were not commanded to repeat the previous `Asr, Maghrib and `Isha&#8217; prayers (although they had prayed them towards Jerusalem after Allah had changed the Qiblah). Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the change of Qiblah (to Ka`bah in Makkah) occurred, those inflicted with hypocrisy and mistrust, and the disbelieving Jews, both were led astray from the right guidance and fell into confusion. They said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(What has turned them (Muslims) from their Qiblah to which they used to face in prayer.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They asked, &#8220;What is the matter with these people (Muslims) who one time face this direction (Jerusalem), and then face that direction (Makkah)&#8221; Allah answered their questions when He stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say (O Muhammad ): &#8220;To Allah belong both, east and the west.) meaning, the command, the decision and the authority are for Allah Alone. Hence:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;so wherever you turn (yourselves or your faces) there is the Face of Allah (and He is High above, over His Throne).) (2:115),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">( It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness) that you turn your faces towards east and (or) west (in prayers); but Al-Birr is the one who believes in Allah.) (2:177) This statement means, the best act is to adhere to Allah&#8217;s commands. Hence, wherever He commands us to face, we should face. Also, since obedience requires implementing Allah&#8217;s commands, if He commands us every day to face different places, we are His servants and under His disposal, and we face whatever He orders us to face. Certainly, Allah&#8217;s care and kindness towards His servant and Messenger, Muhammad , and certainly, his Ummah (Muslim nation) is profoundly great. Allah has guided them to the Qiblah of (Prophet) Ibrahim &#8212; Allah&#8217;s Khalil (intimate friend). He has commanded them to face the Ka`bah, the most honorable house (of worship) on the face of the earth, which was built by Ibrahim Al-Khalil in the Name of Allah, the One without a partner. This is why Allah said afterwards:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say (O Muhammad ): &#8220;To Allah belong both, east and the west. He guides whom He wills to the straight way.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad reported that `A&#8217;ishah (the Prophet&#8217;s wife) said that Allah&#8217;s Messenger said about the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(They do not envy us for a matter more than they envy us for Jumu`ah (Friday) to which Allah has guided us and from which they were led astray; for the (true) Qiblah to which Allah has directed us and from which they were led astray; and for our saying `Amin&#8217; behind the Imam (leader of the prayer).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews had Knowledge that the (Muslim) Qiblah would later be changed</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah stated that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Certainly, the people who were given the Scripture (i.e., Jews and the Christians) know well that, that (your turning towards the direction of the Ka`bah at Makkah in prayers) is the truth from their Lord.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah means: The Jews, who did not like that you change your Qiblah from Bayt Al-Maqdis, already knew that Allah will command you (O Muhammad) to face the Ka`bah. The Jews read in their Books their Prophets&#8217; description of Allah&#8217;s Messenger and his Ummah, and that Allah has endowed and honored him with the complete and honorable legislation. Yet, the People of the Book deny these facts because of their envy, disbelief and rebellion. This is why Allah threatened them when He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And Allah is not unaware of what they do.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(145. And even if you were to bring to the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) all the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they would not follow your Qiblah (prayer direction), nor are you going to follow their Qiblah. And they will not follow each other&#8217;s Qiblah. Verily, if you follow their desires after that which you have received of knowledge (from Allah), then indeed you will be one of the wrongdoers.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why was changing the Qiblah mentioned thrice</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a third command from Allah to face Al-Masjid Al-Haram (the Sacred Mosque) from every part of the world (during prayer). It was said that Allah mentioned this ruling again here because it is connected to whatever is before and whatever is after it. Hence, Allah first said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, We have seen the turning of your (Muhammad&#8217;s) face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a Qiblah (prayer direction) that shall please you) (2:144), until:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Certainly, the people who were given the Scripture (i.e., Jews and the Christians) know well that, that (your turning towards the direction of the Ka`bah at Makkah in prayers) is the truth from their Lord. And Allah is not unaware of what they do.) (2:144)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah mentioned in these Ayat His fulfillment of the Prophet&#8217;s wish and ordered him to face the Qiblah that he liked and is pleased with. In the second command, Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And from wheresoever you start forth (for prayers), turn your face in the direction of Al-Masid Al-Haram that is indeed the truth from your Lord. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Allah states here that changing the Qiblah is also the truth from Him, thus upgrading the subject more than in the first Ayah, in which Allah agreed to what His Prophet had wished for. Thus Allah states that this is also the truth from Him that He likes and is pleased with. In the third command, Allah refutes the Jewish assertion that the Prophet faced their Qiblah, as they knew in their Books that the Prophet will later on be commanded to face the Qiblah of Ibrahim, the Ka`bah. The Arab disbelievers had no more argument concerning the Prophet&#8217;s Qiblah after Allah commanded the Prophet to face the Qiblah of Ibrahim, which is more respected and honored, rather than the Qiblah of the Jews. The Arabs used to honor the Ka`bah and liked the fact that the Messenger was commanded to face it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The First Abrogation in the Qur&#8217;an was about the Qiblah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali bin Abu Talhah related that Ibn `Abbas narrated: The first abrogated part in the Qur&#8217;an was about the Qiblah. When Allah&#8217;s Messenger migrated to Al-Madinah, the majority of its people were Jews, and Allah commanded him to face Bayt Al-Maqdis. The Jews were delighted then. Allah&#8217;s Messenger faced it for ten and some months, but he liked to face the Qiblah of Ibrahim (Ka`bah in Makkah). He used to supplicate to Allah and look up to the sky (awaiting Allah&#8217;s command). Allah then revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, We have seen the turning of your (Muhammad&#8217;s) face towards the heaven), until,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(turn your faces (in prayer) in that direction.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews did not like this ruling and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;What has turned them (Muslims) from their Qiblah (prayer direction) to which they used to face in prayer.&#8221; Say (O Muhammad), &#8220;To Allah belong both, east and the west.&#8221;) (2:142)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(. ..so wherever you turn (yourselves or your faces) there is the Face of Allah) (2:115),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And We made the Qiblah (prayer direction towards Jerusalem) which you used to face, only to test those who followed the Messenger (Muhammad ) from those who would turn on their heels (i.e., disobey the Messenger).) (2:143)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Wisdom behind abrogating the Previous Qiblah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;so that men may have no argument against you)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the People of the Book knew from the description of the Muslim Ummah that they would be ordered to face the Ka`bah. If the Muslims did not fit this description, the Jews would have used this fact against the Muslims. If the Muslims had remained on the Qiblah of Bayt Al-Maqdis, which was also the Qiblah of the Jews, this fact could have been used as the basis of argument by the Jews against other people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;except those of them that are wrongdoers,) indicates the Mushrikin (polytheists) of Quraysh. The reasoning of these unjust persons was the unsound statement: &#8220;This man (Muhammad) claims that he follows the religion of Ibrahim! Hence, if his facing Bayt Al-Maqdis was a part of the religion of Ibrahim, why did he change it&#8221; The answer to this question is that Allah has chosen His Prophet to face Bayt Al-Maqdis first for certain wisdom, and he obeyed Allah regarding this command. Then, Allah changed the Qiblah to the Qiblah of Ibrahim, which is the Ka`bah, and he also obeyed Allah in this command. He, obeys Allah in all cases and never engages in the defiance of Allah even for an instant, and his Ummah imitates him in this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(. ..so fear them not, but fear Me!) meaning: `Do not fear the doubts that the unjust, stubborn persons raise and fear Me Alone.&#8217; Indeed, Allah Alone deserves to be feared.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;so that I may complete My blessings on you.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah relates to Allah&#8217;s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;so that men may have no argument against you), meaning: I will perfect My bounty on you by legislating for you to face the Ka`bah, so that the (Islamic) Shari`ah (law) is complete in every respect. Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;that you may be guided.), meaning: `To be directed and guided to what the nations have been led astray from, We have guided you to it and preferred you with it.&#8217; This is why this Ummah is the best and most honored nation ever.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><strong>Question</strong>: One of the preachers in one of the mosques in Europe claimed that it is not allowed to consider Jews and Christians disbelievers. You know &#8211; may Allaah preserve you &#8211; that most of the people who attend the mosques in Europe have very little knowledge. We fear that statements like this one will become widespread. Therefore, we request from you a complete and clear answer to this question.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: I say: The statement that came from that man is misguidance. In fact, it can be blasphemy. This is because Allaah has declared that Jews and Christians are disbelievers (kuffaar) in His Book. Allaah has said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And the Jews say, ‘Ezra is the son of Allaah,’ and the Christians say, ‘The Messiah is the son of Allaah.’ This is a saying from their mouths. They imitate the saying of the disbelievers of old. Allaah’s curse be on them, how they are deluded away from the truth. They took their rabbis and their monks as lords besides Allaah and [they also took as Lord] the Messiah, son of Mary. But they were commanded only to worship none but One God. Praise and Glory be to Him, [far above is He] from having the partners they associate with Him.&#8221;</span> [at-Taubah 9:30-31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That shows that they are polytheists who associate partners with Allaah. In other verses, Allaah has made it clear that they are disbelievers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Surely in disbelief are they who say that Allaah is the Messiah, son of Mary.&#8221;</span> [al-Maidah 5:17 and 72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Surely, disbelievers are those who said, ‘Allaah is the third of the three [in a Trinity].&#8221;</span> [al-Maidah 5:73]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Those among the Children of Israel who disbelieved were cursed by the tongue of David and Jesus, son of Mary.&#8221;</span> [al-Maidah 5:87]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Those who disbelieve among the People of the Book and the idolaters will abide in the Fire of Hell.&#8221;</span> [al-Bayyinah 98:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many verses and hadith express the same meaning. The one who rejects the idea that the Jews and the Christians who do not believe in Muhammad [peace be upon him] and deny him are disbelievers is, in fact, denying what Allaah has said. Denying what Allaah has said is blasphemy. <strong>If anyone has any doubt concerning them being disbelievers, then he himself is also a disbeliever.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Glory be to Allaah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How could that man be pleased to say that it is not allowed to say that they are disbelievers when they themselves say that Allaah is one of a Trinity? Their Creator Himself has declared that they are disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How could this man not be pleased to call them disbelievers when they actually say, &#8220;Jesus is the son of God&#8221; or &#8220;the hand of Allaah is tied,&#8221; and &#8220;Allaah is poor and we are rich&#8221;?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How could this man not be pleased to call them disbelievers and apply the word of disbelief (kufr) to them in general when they describe their Lord in such ways that are nothing but cursing and abusing Allaah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I call upon that man to repent to Allaah and to read Allaah’s words, <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;They wish that you should compromise (in religion out of courtesy) with them, so that they (too) would compromise with you.&#8221;</span> [al-Qalam (68):9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He should make it clear to everyone that they are disbelievers and that they are the inhabitants of the Hell-fire. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">&#8220;By the One in whose hand my soul is, no Jew or Christian of this community hears about me &#8211; that is from the community of people from the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him) until the Day of Judgment &#8211; and then does not follow me &#8211; or he said does not believe in what I brought &#8211; except that he is from the inhabitants of the Hell-fire.&#8221;</span> [Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who made such a statement must repent to his Lord because of this great falsehood he has stated. He must make a clear announcement that they are disbelievers and that they are inhabitants of the Hell-fire. He must also announce that it is obligatory upon them to follow the unlettered Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). he is the one that the Jews and the Christians know and they know him like they know their own sons. Allaah has stated,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Those who follow the Messenger, the illiterate Prophet whom they find written about with them in the Torah and the Gospel, he commands what is right and forbids what is evil. He allows them the good things and forbids for them disdainful things. He releases them from their heavy burdens and from the fetters that were upon them. So those who believe in him, honor him, help him, and follow the light which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful.&#8221;</span> [al-Araf 7:157]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is the one of whom Jesus, son of Mary (peace be upon him) gave glad tidings. Jesus said, as His Lord states in the Quran,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O Israel, I am the Messenger of Allaah for you confirming the Torah (which came) before me, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name is Ahmad [one of the names of the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him]. But when he came to them with clear proofs, they said, ‘This is clear magic.’&#8221;</span> [as-Saff 61:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the one, Ahmad, who was promised came to them with clear signs, they said that it was nothing but magic. By this, we can refute those Christians who say that the one Jesus promised was named Ahmad and not Muhammad. We say to that that Allaah said, &#8220;When he came with clear proofs,&#8221; and none has come to you after Jesus except Muhammad (peace be upon him). Muhammad is Ahmad and Allaah inspired Jesus to call Muhammad Ahmad. This is because Ahmad is a name from the root meaning, &#8220;to praise,&#8221; and the name itself means, &#8220;One who praises Allaah more than others.&#8221; Therefore, [Muhammad (peace be upon him)] is the most praiseworthy of Allaah among all peoples&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I further say: If anyone claims that there is a religion on earth other than Islam that is acceptable to Allaah, then the person who made that claim is a disbeliever and there is no doubt about his disbelief. This is because Allaah has said in His Book, <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted from him and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.&#8221;</span> [ali-Imran 3:85]. Allaah has also said, <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Truly, the religion in the sight of Allaah is Islam&#8221;</span> [ali-Imran 3:19]. Another verse states, <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion&#8221;</span> [al-Maida 5:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on that &#8211; and I repeat it for a third time &#8211; the person who made that statement [mentioned in the question] must repent to Allaah, Most High. And he must also make it clear to all the people that those Jews and Christians are disbelievers. This is so because the proof has been established against them, they have received the message but they have refused to believe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews have been described as those who have earned Allaah’s wrath. That is because they knew the truth and chose to go against it. The Christians have been described as those who have gone astray. This is because they sought the truth but were misled from it. Now, all of them have knowledge of the truth and recognize it. However, they go against it. Therefore, they all deserve to have the wrath of Allaah upon them. I call all those Jews and Christians to believe in Allaah and all of His Messengers. I call upon them to follow the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). This is what they have been ordered to do in their own books. Allaah states in the Quran,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;My Mercy embraces all things. That (Mercy) I shall ordain for those who are God-fearing and give zakat, and those who believe in Our revelations. Those who follow the Messenger, the illiterate Prophet whom they find written about with them in the Torah and the Gospel, he commands what is right and forbids what is evil. He allows them the good things and forbids for them disdainful things. He releases them from their heavy burdens and from the fetters that were upon them. So those who believe in him, honor him, help him, and follow the light which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful. Say (O Muhammad): O Mankind! Verily, I am sent to all of you as the Messenger of Allaah, to whom belongs the heavens and the earth. There is no true God but He. It is He who gives life and causes death. So believe in Allaah and His Messenger, the unlettered, who believes in Allaah and His Words. And follow him so that you may be guided.&#8221;</span> [al-Araf 7:156-158].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[By having such faith, those converts from Judaism and Christianity] shall receive their reward twice. The Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There are three people who will receive their rewards twice: A person from the People of the Book [Jews and Christians] who believed in his prophet and believed in Muhammad&#8230;&#8221;</span> [al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have also found in the law book al-Iqna`, in the section on apostasy, where the author has stated,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;One who does not consider as a disbeliever one who follows a religion other than Islam, such as the Christians, or who has doubt about their disbelief or who approves of their way himself is a disbeliever.&#8221; </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he quotes Ibn Taimiya as saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;[The following is] a disbeliever: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Whoever believes that churches are the houses of Allaah in which he He is worshipped or who thinks that what the Jews and Christians do are valid acts of worship of Allaah and obedience to Him and His Messenger, or loves or approves of what they do, or aids them in having such places and establishing their religion, and he does so thinking that is a way of getting closer to Allaah or worshipping Allaah.&#8221; </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>He also stated, </strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;If someone believes that visiting the Jews and the Christians in their places of worship is an act that brings him closer to Allaah, then he is an apostate.&#8221;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These statements support what was stated in the text of the answer. This is a matter concerning which there is no room for doubt. And help is sought only with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>This question was responded by Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen, Fatawa Islamiya, vol. 1, p. 87, Darussalam publishers</em></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Tafsir Ibn Kathir (Abridged) &#8211; Al Baqarah surah 2 © Darussalam 2000</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Prescription of the Sabbath for the Jews</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that for every nation, Allah prescribed one day of the week for people to gather to worship Him. For this Ummah He prescribed Friday, because it is the sixth day, on which Allah completed and perfected His creation. On this day He gathered and completed His blessings for His servants. It was said that Allah prescribed this day for the Children of Israel through His Prophet Musa, but they changed it and chose Saturday because it was the day on which the Creator did not create anything, as He had completed His creation on Friday. Allah made observance of the Sabbath obligatory for them in the laws of the Tawrah (Torah), telling them to keep the Sabbath. At the same time, He told them to follow Muhammad when he was sent, and took their promises and covenant to that effect. Hence Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sabbath was only prescribed for those who differed concerning it,) Mujahid said: &#8220;They observed the Sabbath (Saturday) and ignored Friday.&#8221; Then they continued to observe Saturday until Allah sent `Isa bin Maryam. It was said that he told them to change it to Sunday, and it was also said that he did not forsake the laws of the Tawrah except for a few rulings which were abrogated, and he continued to observe the Sabbath until he was taken up (into heaven). Afterwards, the Christians at the time of Constantine were the ones who changed it to Sunday in order to be different from the Jews, and they started to pray towards the east instead of facing the Dome (i.e., Jerusalem). And Allah knows best. It was reported in the Two Sahihs that Abu Hurayrah heard the Messenger of Allah say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(We are the last, but we will be the first on the Day of Resurrection, even though they were given the Book before us. This is the day that Allah obligated upon them, but they differed concerning it. Allah guided us to this day, and the people observe their days after us, the Jews on the following day and the Christians on the day after that.) This version was recorded by Al-Bukhari. It was reported that Abu Hurayrah and Hudhayfah said that the Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah let the people who came before us stray from Friday, so the Jews had Saturday and the Christians had Sunday. Then Allah brought us and guided us to Friday. So now there are Friday, Saturday and Sunday, thus they will follow us on the Day of Resurrection. We are the last of the people of this world, but will be the first on the Day of Resurrection, and will be the first to be judged, before all of creation.) It was reported by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Jews breach the Sanctity of the Sabbath</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2.65. And indeed you knew those amongst you who transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath (i.e. Saturday). We said to them: &#8220;Be you monkeys, despised and rejected.&#8221;) (66. So We made this punishment an example for those in front of it and those behind it, and a lesson for Al-Muttaqin (the pious.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And indeed you knew). This Ayah means, O Jews! Remember that Allah sent His torment on the village that disobeyed Him and broke their pledge and their covenant to observe the sanctity of the Sabbath. They began using deceitful means to avoid honoring the Sabbath by placing nets, ropes and artificial pools of water for the purpose of fishing before the Sabbath. When the fish came in abundance on Saturday as usual, they were caught in the ropes and nets for the rest of Saturday. During the night, the Jews collected the fish after the Sabbath ended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When they did that, Allah changed them from humans into monkeys, the animals having the form closest to humans. Their evil deeds and deceit appeared lawful on the surface, but they were in reality wicked. This is why their punishment was compatible with their crime. This story is explained in detail in Surat Al-A`raf, where Allah said (7:163),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And ask them (O Muhammad ) about the town that was by the sea; when they transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath (i.e. Saturday): when their fish came to them openly on the Sabbath day, and did not come to them on the day they had no Sabbath. Thus We made a trial of them, for they used to rebel (disobey Allah).)(7:163)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his Tafsir, Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(We said to them: &#8220;Be you monkeys, despised and rejected&#8221;) means, &#8220;Allah changed their bodies into those of monkeys and swines. The young people turned into monkeys while the old people turned into swine.&#8221; Shayban An-Nahwi reported that Qatadah commented on,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(We said to them: &#8220;Be you monkeys, despised and rejected&#8221;), &#8220;These people were turned into howling monkeys with tails, after being men and women.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Monkeys and Swine that exist now are not the Descendants of Those that were transformed</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;Those who violated the sanctity of the Sabbath were turned into monkeys, then they perished without offspring.&#8221; Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;Allah turned them into monkeys because of their sins. They only lived on the earth for three days, for no transformed person ever lives more than three days. They did not eat, drink or have offspring. Allah transformed their shapes into monkeys, and He does what He wills, with whom He wills and He changes the shape of whomever He wills. On the other hand, Allah created the monkeys, swines and the rest of the creation in the six days (of creation) that He mentioned in His Book.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So We made this punishment an example) means, Allah made the people of this village, who violated the sanctity of the Sabbath,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(an example) via the way they were punished. Similarly, Allah said about Pharaoh,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So Allah, seized him with punishing example for his last and first transgression) (79:25). nAllah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(for those in front of it and those behind it) meaning, for the other villages. Ibn `Abbas commented, &#8220;Meaning, `We made this village an example for the villages around it by the manner in which We punished its people.&#8221;&#8217; Similarly, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And indeed We have destroyed towns (populations) round about you, and We have (repeatedly) shown (them) the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) in various ways that they might return (to the truth and believe in the Oneness of Allah ـ Islamic Monotheism)).(46:27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Allah made them an example for those who lived during their time as well as a reminder for those to come, by preserving their story. This is why Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and a lesson for Al-Muttaqin (the pious)), meaning, a reminder. This Ayah means, &#8220;The torment and punishment that this village suffered was a result of indulging in Allah&#8217;s prohibitions and their deceit. Hence, those who have Taqwa should be aware of their evil behavior, so that what occurred to this village does not befall them as well.&#8221; Also, Imam Abu `Abdullah bin Battah reported that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Do not commit what the Jews committed, breaching what Allah has forbidden, by resorting to the lowest types of deceit.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Hadith has a good (Jayid) chain of narration. Allah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:Are there any authentic Hadeeths that mention the virtues of Zamzam water?<strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are Hadeeths which indicate that Zamzam water is noble and blessed. In a Hadeeth confirmed in the Sahih, the Prophet (sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) said about Zamzam water:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed it is blessed, and that like food, it fills.&#8221; (Muslim no. 2473)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in Abu Dawud&#8217;s narration, there is this addition:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And a cure for illness.&#8221; (Abu Dawud At-Tiyalsi 2nd Volume no. 61)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this Hadeeth proves its virtues, that it is a <strong>filling food, a cure for illness, and that it is blessed.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sunnah is to drink it as the Prophet (sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) drank it, but it is also <em><strong>permissible to make ablution with it, to use it to purify yourself after you have relieved yourself, and if necessary, to take a shower using it when you are Junub (impure).</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is confirmed that on one occasion, water poured forth from between the Prophet&#8217;s fingers, and then people took what they needed from that water, using it to drink, to make ablution, to wash their clothes, or to purify themselves after relieving themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zamzam water may not be the same as the water that poured forth from between the Prophet&#8217;s fingers, but it is also not more blessed, for each has its place as pure water. If it is permissible to use the water that miraculously poured forth from between the Prophet&#8217;s fingers for all the purposes mentioned above, then it is also permissible in the case of Zamzam.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Following is taken from Tafseer Ibn Kathir</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah encouraged His Prophet to pray in Masjid Quba&#8217; which, from the first day, was built on Taqwa, obedience to Allah and His Messenger , for gathering the word of the believers and as an outpost and a fort for Islam and its people. This is why Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Verily, the Masjid whose foundation was laid from the first day on Taqwa is more worthy that you stand therein (to pray).)</span></strong> in reference to the Masjid of Quba&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An authentic Hadith records that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(One prayer in Masjid Quba&#8217; is just like an `Umrah.)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah used to visit Masjid Quba&#8217; while riding and walking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Other Notes:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">It is prescribed for the visitor to Madeenah and for the one who lives there to go to the Mosque of Quba’ and pray there, following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and seeking the reward of ‘Umrah. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fatwa by Shaykh Ibn Baz Fatawa Islamiyah , Darussalam, Vol 4, Page 127</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q. Is it better for the Muhrim to cover the two shoulders or to uncover one of them during the Ihram?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. The sunnah for the Muhrim is that he places the Rida&#8217; (upper garment) over both of his shoulders and put its ends on his chest. This is the Sunnah and it is what the Prophet (Sallalahu Alahi wa Sallam) did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if the person wants to perform the Tawaf of Arrival (Tawaful-Qudum) , he does Al-Idhtiba&#8217;. This is by him placing the center of his Rida&#8217; under his right armpit and its edges over his left shoulder. Thus he uncovers his right shoulder. This is specifically for the Tawaf of Arrival, meaning when the person first arrives in Makkah for Hajj or &#8216;Umrah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then when he completes the Tawaf, he adjusts the Rida&#8217; and places it over both of his shoulders, and he prays two Rak&#8217;ahs of Tawaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The person who always keeps one shoulder uncovered, this is opposed to the Sunnah, and so is uncovering both of the shoulders. The Sunnah is only to cover both of them with the Rida&#8217; while the person is in Ihram. If the person takes off the Rida&#8217; and does not cover his shoulders while he is sitting or eating or talking with his brothers, there is no harm in that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the Sunnah is that when the person wears the Rida&#8217;, it should be over his two shoulders and its ends should be on his chest.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imam Ibn Kathir<br />
</strong>Tafsir Ibn Katheer (Abridged) Volume 9<br />
© Darussalam 2000</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Know that the life of this world is only play and amusement, pomp and mutual boasting among you, and rivalry in respect of wealth and children.  (It is) like a rain (Ghayth), thereof the growth is pleasing to the tiller; afterwards it dries up and you see it turning yellow; then it becomes straw.  But in the Hereafter (there is) a severe torment, and (there is) forgiveness from Allah and (His) pleasure.  And the life of this world is only a deceiving enjoyment.&#8221; [57:20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted degrades the significance of this life and belittles it by saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;that the life of this world is only play and amusement, pomp and mutual boasting among you, and rivalry in respect of wealth and children.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, this is the significance of this life to its people, just as He said in another Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Beautified for men is the love of things they covet; women, children, much of gold and silver (wealth), branded beautiful horses, cattle and well-tilled land.  This is the pleasure of the present world&#8217;s life; but Allah has the excellent return with Him.&#8221; ( 3:14 )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted also sets a parable for this life, declaring that its joys are fading and its delights are perishable, saying that life is,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Like a rain (Ghayth),&#8221; which is the rain that comes down to mankind, after they had felt despair.  Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And He is it Who sends down the Ghayth (rain) after they have despaired.&#8221; (42:28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;thereof the growth is pleasing to the tiller;&#8221; meaning that farmers admire the vegetation that grows in the aftermath of rain.  And just as farmers admire vegetation, the disbelievers admire this life; they are the most eager to acquire the traits of life, and life is most dear to them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;afterwards it dries up and you see it turning yellow; then it becomes straw.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, that vegetation soon turns yellow in color, after being fresh and green.  After that, the green fades away and becomes scattered pieces of dust.  This is the parable of this worldly life, it starts young, then matures and then turns old and feeble.  This is also the parable of mankind in this life; they are young and strong in the beginning.  In this stage of life, they look youthful and handsome.  Slowly, they begin growing older, their mannerism changes and their strength weakens.  They then grow old and feeble; moving becomes difficult for them, while doing easy things becomes beyond their ability.  Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allah is He Who created you in (a state of) weakness, then gave you strength after weakness, then after strength gave (you) weakness and gray hair.  He creates what He wills.  And He is the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful.&#8221; (30:54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This parable indicates the near demise of this life and the imminent end of it, while in contrast, the Hereafter is surely coming.  Those who hear this parable should, therefore, be aware of the significance of the Hereafter and feel eagerness in the goodness that it contains,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;But in the Hereafter (there is) a severe torment, and (there is) forgiveness from Allah and (His) pleasure.  And the life of this world is only a deceiving enjoyment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, surely, the Hereafter that will certainly come contains two things either severe punishment or forgiveness from Allah and His good pleasure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And the life of this world is only a deceiving enjoyment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, this life is only a form of enjoyment that deceives those who incline to it.  Surely, those who recline to this life will admire it and feel that it is dear to them, so much so, that they might think that this is the only life, no life or dwelling after it.  Yet, in reality, this life is insignificant as compared to the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah, sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; Paradise is nearer to any of you than the strap of his shoe, and so is the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; [Ahmad 1:387]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari collected this Hadith through the narration of Ath-Thawri [Fath al-Bari 11:328].  This Hadith indicates the close proximity of both good and evil in relation to mankind.  If this is the case, then this is the reason Allah the Exalted encouraged mankind to rush to perform acts of righteousness and obedience and to avoid the prohibitions.  By doing so, their sins and errors will be forgiven and they will acquire rewards and an exalted status.  Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Race with one another in hastening towards forgiveness from your Lord, and Paradise the width whereof is as the width of the heaven and the earth.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And march forth in the way (to) forgiveness from your Lord, and for Paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth, prepared for those who have Taqwa.&#8221; (3:133)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said here,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;prepared for those who believe in Allah and His Messengers.  That is the grace of Allah which He bestows on whom He is pleased with.  And Allah is the Owner of the great bounty.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, &#8220;This, that Allah has qualified them for, is all a part of His favor, bounty and compassion.&#8221;  We mentioned a Hadith collected in the Sahih in which the poor emigrants said to the Messenger, sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger!  The wealthy people will get higher grades and permanent enjoyment.&#8221;  He asked, &#8220;Why is that?&#8221;  They said, &#8220;They pray like us and fast as we do.  However, they give in charity, whereas we cannot do that, and they free servants, whereas we cannot afford it.&#8221;  The Prophet, sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam, said, &#8220;Shall I tell you of a good deed that, if you acted upon, you would catch up with those who have surpassed you? None would overtake you and be better than you, except those who might do the same.  Say, &#8220;Glorious is Allah,&#8221; Allah is Most Great&#8221;, and &#8220;Praise be to Allah&#8221;, thirty three times each after every prayer.&#8221;  They later came back and said, &#8220;Our wealthy brethren heard what we did and they started doing the same.&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Messenger, sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This is the favor that He gives to whom He wills.&#8221; [Muslim 1:416]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1-10 Verses of Al-Momin Surah<br />
</strong><strong>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What is Jannat ul Firdaus?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah said: (If you ask Allah for Paradise, then ask him for Al-Firdaws, for it is the highest part of Paradise, in the middle of Paradise, and from it spring the rivers of Paradise, and above it is the (Mighty) Throne of the Most Merciful.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Who shall inherit Firdaws? (1-10 Verses of Al-Monin Surah)</strong></p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Successful indeed are the believers.</li>
<li>Those who with their Salah are Khashi`un (with fear and with tranquillity).</li>
<li>And those who turn away from Al-Laghw.</li>
<li>And those who pay the Zakah.</li>
<li>And those who guard their private parts.</li>
<li>Except from their wives or their right hand possessions, for then, they are free from blame.</li>
<li>But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors.</li>
<li>Those who are faithfully true to their Amanat and to their covenants are Ra`un.</li>
<li>And those who strictly guard their Salawat.</li>
<li>These are indeed the heirs.</li>
<li>Who shall inherit <strong>Firdaws</strong>. They shall dwell therein forever.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Success is for the believers whose qualities are described here</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Successful indeed are the believers) means, they have attained victory and are blessed, for they have succeeded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">***These are the believers who have the following characteristics ***</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Those who with their Salah are Khashi`un.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said: &#8220;(Khashi`un) means those with<strong> fear and with tranquillity</strong>.&#8221; This was also narrated from Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and Az-Zuhri.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was reported from `Ali bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, that Khushu` means the <strong>Khushu` of the heart.</strong> This was also the view of Ibrahim An-Nakha`i.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, &#8220;Their Khushu` was in their hearts.&#8221; So they lowered their gaze and were humble towards others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khushu` in prayer is only attained by the one who has emptied his heart totally, who does not pay attention to anything else besides it, and who prefers it above all else. At that point it becomes a delight and a joy for eyes, as in the Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad and An-Nasai from Anas, who said that the Messenger of Allah said:(Fragrance and women have been made dear to me, and Salah was made the joy of my eye.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And those who turn away from Al-Laghw.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It refers to falsehood, which includes Shirk and sin, and any words or deeds that are of no benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allah says: (<em><strong>And if they pass by Al-Laghw, they pass by it with dignity</strong></em>)[25:72].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qatadah said: &#8220;By Allah, there came to them from Allah that which kept them away from that (evil).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And those who pay the Zakah.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most commentators say that the meaning here is the Zakah that is paid on wealth, even though this Ayah was revealed in Makkah, and Zakah was ordained in Al-Madinah in the year 2 H. The apparent meaning is that the Zakah that was instituted in Al-Madinah is the one based upon the Nusub and the specific amounts, apart from which it seems that the basic principle of Zakah was enjoined in Makkah. As Allah says in Surat Al-An`am, which was also revealed in Makkah: (but pay the due thereof on the day of their harvest, ) [6:141]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It could be that what is meant here by Zakah is purification of the soul from Shirk and filth, as in the Ayah:(Indeed he succeeds who purifies himself (Zakkaha). And indeed he fails who corrupts himself.) [91:9-10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It could be that both meanings are intended, purification of the soul and of one&#8217;s wealth, because that is part of the purification of the soul, and the true believer is one who pays attention to both matters. And Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And those who guard their private parts. Except from their wives and their right hand possessions, for then, they are free from blame. But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It means, those who protect their private parts from unlawful actions and do not do that which Allah has forbidden; fornication and homosexuality, and do not approach anyone except the wives whom Allah has made permissible for them or their right hand possessions from the captives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One who seeks what Allah has made permissible for him is not to be blamed and there is no sin on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says: (they are free from blame. But whoever seeks beyond that) meaning, other than a wife or slave girl, (then those are the transgressors.) meaning , aggressors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Those who are faithfully true to their Amanat and to their covenants)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When they are entrusted with something, they do not betray that trust, but they fulfill it, and when they make a promise or make a pledge, they are true to their word.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is not like the hypocrites about whom the Messenger of Allah said: (The signs of the hypocrite are three: when he speaks he lies, when he makes a promise he breaks it, and when he is entrusted with something he betrays that trust.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And those who strictly guard their Salawat.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It means, they persistently offer their prayers at their appointed times, as Ibn Mas`ud said: &#8220;I asked the Messenger of Allah , `O Messenger of Allah, which deed is most beloved to Allah&#8217; He said, (Prayer at the appointed time.) I said, `Then what&#8217; He said,(Kindness to one&#8217;s parents. ) I said, `Then what&#8217; He said,(Jihad in the way of Allah.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was recorded in the Two Sahihs. Qatadah said: &#8220;At the fixed times, with the proper bowing and prostration.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah begins and ends this list of praiseworthy qualities with Salah, which is indicative of its virtue, as the Prophet said: (Adhere to righteousness, you will never be able encompass it all. Know that the best of your deeds is Salah. None will preserve his Wuddu&#8217; except the believer.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having described them with these praiseworthy characteristics and righteous deeds, Allah then says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(These are indeed the heirs. Who shall inherit Firdaws. They shall dwell therein forever.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah said: (If you ask Allah for Paradise, then ask him for Al-Firdaws, for it is the highest part of Paradise, in the middle of Paradise, and from it spring the rivers of Paradise, and above it is the (Mighty) Throne of the Most Merciful.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah said:(There is not one among you who does not have two homes, a home in Paradise and a home in Hell. If he dies and enters Hell, the people of Paradise will inherit his home, and this is what Allah said: (These are indeed the heirs.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jurayj narrated from Layth from Mujahid:(These are indeed the heirs.) &#8220;The believers will inherit the homes of the disbelievers because they were created to worship Allah Alone with no partner or associate. So when these believers did what was enjoined on them of worship, and the disbelievers neglected to do that which they were commanded to do and for which they had been created, the believers gained the share that they would have been given if they had obeyed their Lord. Indeed, they will be given more than that as well.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what was reported in Sahih Muslim from Abu Burdah, from his father, from the Prophet who said: (Some of the Muslims will come on the Day of Resurrection with sins like mountains, but Allah will forgive them and put (their burden of sin) on the Jews and Christians.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to another version: the Messenger of Allah said: (When the Day of Resurrection comes, Allah will appoint for every Muslim a Jew or Christian, and it will be said, &#8220;This is your ransom from the Fire.&#8221;) `</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz asked Abu Burdah to swear by Allah besides Whom there is no other God, three times, that his father told him that from the Prophet , and he swore that oath. I say: this Ayah is like Allah&#8217;s saying: (Such is the Paradise which We shall give as an inheritance to those of Our servants who have had Taqwa.) [19:63] (This is the Paradise which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds which you used to do.) [43:72]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness, etc.) that you enter the houses from the back, but Al-Birr is from Taqwa. So enter houses through their proper doors.)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari recorded that Al-Bara&#8217; said, &#8220;During the time of Jahiliyyah, they used to enter the house from the back upon assuming the Ihram. Thereafter, Allah revealed (the following Ayah):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness, etc.) that you enter the houses from the back but Al-Birr is from Taqwa. So enter houses through their proper doors.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded the same Hadith from Al-Bara&#8217; but with the wording; &#8220;The Ansar used to enter their houses from the back when returning from a journey. Thereafter, this Ayah (2:189 above) was revealed&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan said, &#8220;When some people during the time of Jahiliyyah would leave home to travel, and then decide not to travel, they would not enter the house from its door. Rather, they would climb over the back wall. Allah the Exalted said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness) that you enter the houses from the back,).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement:<br />
(&#8230;and have Taqwa of Allah that you may be successful.) Have Taqwa of Allah, means to do what He has commanded you and refrain from what He has forbidden for you,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From Fatawah Islamiyyah Vol. 1 and 2<br />
Published by Darussalaam</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong style="line-height:1.5em;">The Remedy for Whispering (of Shaytan) in the Prayer</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I begin to pray, I am afflicted by a kind of whispering and thoughts, and sometimes I do not know what I have recited, not how many Raka&#8217;ahs I have prayed. Please advice me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is prescribed for the worshiper, man or woman, to approach the prayer with humility towards Allah and to call to mind that he stands before his Lord, so that Shaytan will stay away from him and the whispering will be reduced, in implementation of Allah&#8217;s Words: &#8220;Successful indeed are the believers. Those who offers their prayers with all solemnity and full submission.&#8221; [Soorah Muminoon (23): 1-2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the whispering become frequent, it is prescribed to seek refuge with Allah, from Shaytan, as the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) ordered Uthman Ibn Abi al-As when he informed him (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) that Shaytan had confused his prayers. And when the worshiper becomes confused as to the number of Raka&#8217;ahs he has prayed, he should assume the minimum, base his estimation upon what he is sure of, and then complete his prayer. Afterwards, he performs two prostration of forgetfulness before making the Tasleem, based upon the narration of Abu Said (radhi allahu anhu) from the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) in which he said: &#8220;If any of you is in doubt regarding his prayer, and he does not know how much he has prayed, three or four (Raka&#8217;ahs) then let him cast aside doubt and base his estimation upon what he is sure of. Then prostrate twice before making the Tasleem; if he has prayed five, his prayer will be an intercessor for him, and if he has completed the prayer correctly, it will be a humiliation for Shaytan.&#8221; [Saheeh Muslim (571)], And Allah is the Grantor of success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Ibn Baz (rahimahullah)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Tafseer Ibn Kathir &#8211; Surah Fatihah</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[1]</strong><strong> Why the Devil is called Shaytan ?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Arabic language, Shaytan is derived from Shatana, which means the far thing. Hence, the Shaytan has a different nature than mankind, and his sinful ways are far away from every type of righteousness. It was also said that Shaytan is derived from Shata, (literally `burned&#8217;), because it was created from fire. Some scholars said that both meanings are correct, although they state that the first meaning is more plausible. Further, Siybawayh (the renowned Arab linguistic) said, &#8220;The Arabs say, `So-and-so has Tashaytan,&#8217; when he commits the act of the devils. If Shaytan was derived from Shata, they would have said, Tashayyata (rather than Tashaytan).&#8221; Hence, Shaytan is derived from the word that means, far away. This is why they call those who are rebellious (or mischievous) from among the Jinns and mankind a `Shaytan&#8217;. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And so We have appointed for every Prophet enemies ـ Shayatin (devils) among mankind and Jinn, inspiring one another with adorned speech as a delusion (or by way of deception)) (6:112).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, the Musnad by Imam Ahmad records that Abu Dharr said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Abu Dharr! Seek refuge with Allah from the devils of mankind and the Jinns.) Abu Dharr said, &#8220;I asked him , `Are there human devils&#8217; He said, (Yes.)&#8221; Furthermore, it is recorded in Sahih Muslim that Abu Dharr said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The woman, the donkey and the black dog interrupt the prayer (if they pass in front of those who do not pray behind a Sutrah, i.e. a barrier).) Abu Dharr said, &#8220;I said, `What is the difference between the black dog and the red or yellow dog&#8217; He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The black dog is a devil.).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Ibn Jarir At-Tabari recorded that `Umar bin Al-Khattab once rode a Berthawn (huge camel) which started to proceed arrogantly. `Umar kept striking the animal, but the animal kept walking in an arrogant manner. `Umar dismounted the animal and said, &#8220;By Allah! You have carried me on a Shaytan. I did not come down from it until after I had felt something strange in my heart.&#8221; This Hadith has an authentic chain of narrators.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[2] What does Isti`adhah mean</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Isti`adhah means, &#8220;I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed Satan so that he is prevented from affecting my religious or worldly affairs, or hindering me from adhering to what I was commanded, or luring me into what I was prohibited from.&#8221; Indeed, only Allah is able to prevent the evil of Satan from touching the son of Adam. This is why Allah allowed us to be lenient and kind with the human devil, so that his soft nature might cause him to refrain from the evil he is indulging in. However, Allah required us to seek refuge with Him from the evil of Satan, because he neither accepts bribes nor does kindness affect him, for he is pure evil. Thus, only He Who created Satan is able to stop his evil. This meaning is reiterated in only three Ayat in the Qur&#8217;an. Allah said in Surat Al-A`raf,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the foolish (i.e. don&#8217;t punish them).) (7:199)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is about dealing with human beings. He then said in the same Surah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And if an evil whisper comes to you from Shaytan, then seek refuge with Allah. Verily, He is Hearing, Knowing (7: 200).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also said in Surat Al-Mu&#8217;minun,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Repel evil with that which is better. We are Best-Acquainted with the things they utter. And say: &#8220;My Lord! I seek refuge with You from the whisperings (suggestions) of the Shayatin (devils). And I seek refuge with You, My Lord! lest they should come near me.&#8221; (23:96-98).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further, Allah said in Surat As-Sajdah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal. Repel (the evil) with one which is better, then verily he, between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend. But none is granted it (the above quality) except those who are patient ـ and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion (of happiness in the Hereafter, i.e. Paradise and of a high moral character) in this world. And if an evil whisper from Shaytan tries to turn you away (from doing good), then seek refuge in Allah. Verily, He is the Hearing, the Knowing) (41:34-36).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[3] The Tafsir of Isti`adhah (seeking Refuge)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and stay away from the foolish (i.e. don&#8217;t punish them). And if an evil whisper comes to you from Shaytan (Satan), then seek refuge with Allah. Verily, He is Hearing, Knowing) (7:199-200),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Repel evil with that which is better. We are Best-Acquainted with things they utter. And say: &#8220;My Lord! I seek refuge with You from the whisperings (suggestions) of the Shayatin (devils). And I seek refuge with You, My Lord! lest they should come near me.&#8221;) (23:96-98) and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Repel (an evil) with one which is better, then verily he with whom there was enmity between you, (will become) as though he was a close friend. But none is granted it except those who are patient ـ and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion (of happiness in the Hereafter, i.e. Paradise and of a high moral character) in this world. And if an evil whisper from Shaytan tries to turn you away (O Muhammad ) (from doing good), then seek refuge in Allah. Verily, He is the Hearing, the Knowing.) (41:34-36) These are the only three Ayat that carry this meaning. Allah commanded that we be lenient human enemy, so that his soft nature might make him an ally and a supporter. He also commanded that we seek refuge from the satanic enemy, because the devil does not relent in his enmity if we treat him with kindness and leniency. The devil only seeks the destruction of the Son of Adam due to the vicious enmity and hatred he has always had towards man&#8217;s father, Adam. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Children of Adam! Let not Shaytan deceive you, as he got your parents ﴿Adam and Hawwa&#8217; (Eve)﴾ out of Paradise) (7:27),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surely, Shaytan is an enemy to you, so take (treat) him as an enemy. He only invites his Hizb (followers) that they may become the dwellers of the blazing Fire) (35:6) and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Will you then take him (Iblis) and his offspring as protectors and helpers rather than Me while they are enemies to you What an evil is the exchange for the Zalimun (polytheists, and wrongdoers, etc)) (18:50).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The devil assured Adam that he wanted to advise him, but he was lying. Hence, how would he treat us after he had vowed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;By Your might, then I will surely, mislead them all. Except Your chosen servants among them (i.e. faithful, obedient, true believers of Islamic Monotheism).&#8221;) (38:82-83)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So when you ﴿want to﴾ recite the Qur&#8217;an, seek refuge with Allah from Shaytan, the outcast (the cursed one). Verily, he has no power over those who believe and put their trust only in their Lord (Allah). His power is only over those who obey and follow him (Satan), and those who join partners with Him.) (16:98-100).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[4] The Meaning of Ar-Rajim</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ar-Rajim means, being expelled from all types of righteousness. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And indeed We have adorned the nearest heaven with lamps, and We have made such lamps Rujuman (as missiles) to drive away the Shayatin (devils)) (67:5).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, We have adorned the near heaven with the stars (for beauty). And to guard against every rebellious devil. They cannot listen to the higher group (angels) for they are pelted from every side. Outcast, and theirs is a constant (or painful) torment. Except such as snatch away something by stealing, and they are pursued by a flaming fire of piercing brightness) (37:6-10).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And indeed, We have put the big stars in the heaven and We beautified it for the beholders. And We have guarded it (near heaven) from every Shaytan Rajim (outcast Shaytan). Except him (devil) who steals the hearing then he is pursued by a clear flaming fire.) (15:16-18).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are several similar Ayat. It was also said that Rajim means, the person who throws or bombards things, because the devil throws doubts and evil thoughts in people&#8217;s hearts. The first meaning is more popular and accurate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[5] Virtues of the Isti`adhah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Isti`adhah cleanses the mouth from the foul speech that it has indulged in. It also purifies the mouth and prepares it to recite the speech of Allah. Further, the Isti`adhah entails seeking Allah&#8217;s help and acknowledging His ability to do everything. The Isti`adhah also affirms the servant&#8217;s meekness, weakness and inability to face the enemy of his inner evil, whom Allah alone, Who created this enemy, is able to repel and defeat. This enemy does not accept kindness, unlike the human enemy. There are three Ayat in the Qur&#8217;an that affirm this fact. Also, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, My servants (i.e. the true believers of Islamic Monotheism) ـ you have no authority over them. And sufficient is your Lord as a Guardian.) (17:65).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We should state here that the believers, whom the human enemies kill, become martyrs, while those who fall victim to the inner enemy &#8211; Satan &#8211; become bandits. Further, the believers who are defeated by the apparent enemy &#8211; disbelievers &#8211; gain a reward, while those defeated by the inner enemy earn a sin and become misguided. Since Satan sees man where man cannot see him, it is befitting that the believers seek refuge from Satan with Whom Satan cannot see. The Isti`adhah is a form of drawing closer to Allah and seeking refuge with Him from the evil of every evil creature.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[6] Is the Isti`adhah (seeking Refuge) required</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The majority of the scholars state that reciting the Isti`adhah (in the prayer and when reciting the Qur&#8217;an) is recommended and not required, and therefore, not reciting it does not constitute a sin. However, Ar-Razi recorded that `Ata&#8217; bin Abi Rabah said that the Isti`adhah is required in the prayer and when one reads the Qur&#8217;an. In support of `Ata&#8217;s statement, Ar-Razi relied upon the apparent meaning of the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then seek refuge.) He said that the Ayah contains a command that requires implementation. Also, the Prophet always said the Isti`adhah. In addition, the Isti`adhah wards off the evil of Satan, which is neccessary, the rule is that the means needed to implement a requirement of the religion is itself also required. And when one says, &#8220;I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed devil.&#8221; Then this will suffice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[7] Seeking Refuge before reciting the Qur&#8217;an</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So when you ﴿want to﴾ recite the Qur&#8217;an, seek refuge with Allah from Shaytan, the outcast (the cursed one).) meaning, before you recite the Qur&#8217;an. Similarly, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When you intend to offer As-Salah (the prayer), wash your faces and your hands (forearms)) (5:6) meaning, before you stand in prayer, as evident by the Hadiths that we mentioned. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, &#8220;When the Messenger of Allah would stand up in prayer at night, he would start his prayer with the Takbir (saying &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221;; Allah is Greater) and would then supplicate,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(All praise is due to You, O Allah, and also the thanks. Blessed be Your Name, Exalted be Your sovereignty, and there is no deity worthy of worship except You.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would then say thrice,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah,).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would then say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I seek refuge with Allah, the Hearing, the Knowing, from the cursed Satan, from his coercion, lures to arrogance and poems.).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The four collectors of the Sunan recorded this Hadith, which At-Tirmidhi considered the most famous Hadith on this subject.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah recorded that Jubayr bin Mut`im said that his father said, &#8220;When the Messenger of Allah started the prayer, he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah is the Greater, truly the Greatest (thrice); all praise is due to Allah always (thrice); and all praise is due to Allah day and night (thrice). O Allah! I seek refuge with You from the cursed Satan, from his Hamz, Nafkh and Nafth.).&#8221; `Amr said, &#8220;The Hamz means asphyxiation, the Nafkh means arrogance, and the Nafth means poetry.&#8221; Also, Ibn Majah recorded that `Ali bin Al-Mundhir said that Ibn Fudayl narrated that `Ata&#8217; bin As-Sa&#8217;ib said that Abu `Abdur-Rahman As-Sulami said that Ibn Mas`ud said that the Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Allah! I seek refuge with You from the cursed devil, from his Hamz, Nafkh and Nafth.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;The Hamz means death, the Nafkh means arrogance, and the Nafth means poetry.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] Seeking Refuge with Allah when One is Angry</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his Musnad, Al-Hafiz Abu Ya`la Ahmad bin `Ali bin Al-Muthanna Al-Mawsili reported that Ubayy bin Ka`b said, &#8220;Two men disputed with each other in the presence of the Messenger of Allah and the nose of one of them became swollen because of extreme anger. The Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I know of some words that if he said them, what he feels will go away, &#8216;I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed Satan.&#8217;)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nasa&#8217;i also recorded this Hadith in his book, Al-Yawm wal-Laylah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari recorded that Sulayman bin Surad said, &#8220;Two men disputed in the presence of the Prophet while we were sitting with him. One of them was cursing the other fellow and his face turned red due to anger. The Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I know of a statement which if he said it, will make what he feels disappear, `I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed Satan.&#8217;) They said to the man, `Do you not hear what the Messenger of Allah is saying&#8217; He said, `I am not insane.&#8221;&#8217; Also, Muslim, Abu Dawud and An-Nasa&#8217;i recorded this Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many other Hadiths about seeking refuge with Allah. One can find this subject in the books on supplication and the virtues of righteous, good deeds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Tafseer Ibn Kathir &#8211; Surah 3 : Ale Imraan :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(31. Say (O Muhammad to mankind): &#8220;If you (really) love Allah, then follow me (i.e. Muhammad), Allah will love you and forgive you your sins. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;) (32. Say: &#8220;Obey Allah and the Messenger.&#8221; But if they turn away, then Allah does not like the disbelievers.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This honorable Ayah judges against those who claim to love Allah, yet do not follow the way of Muhammad . Such people are not true in their claim until they follow the Shari`ah (Law) of Muhammad and his religion in all his statements, actions and conditions. It is recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Whoever commits an act that does not conform with our matter (religion), then it will be rejected of him.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Allah said here,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say (O Muhammad to mankind): &#8220;If you (really) love Allah, then follow me, Allah will love you&#8230;&#8221;) meaning, what you will earn is much more than what you sought in loving Him, for Allah will love you. Al-Hasan Al-Basri and several scholars among the Salaf commented, &#8220;Some people claimed that they love Allah. So Allah tested them with this Ayah;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say (O Muhammad to mankind): &#8220;If you (really) love Allah, then follow me, Allah will love you&#8230;&#8221;). &#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;And forgive you your sins. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;) meaning, by your following the Messenger , you will earn all this with the blessing of his mission. Allah next commands everyone,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say: &#8220;Obey Allah and the Messenger.&#8221; But if they turn away) by defying the Prophet ,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(then Allah does not like the disbelievers.) thus, testifying that defiance of the Messenger&#8217;s way constitutes Kufr. Indeed, Allah does not like whoever does this, even if he claims that he loves Allah and seeks a means of approach to Him, unless, and until, he follows the unlettered Prophet, the Final Messenger from Allah to the two creations: mankind and the Jinn. This is the Prophet who, if the previous Prophets and mighty Messengers were to have been alive during his time, they would have no choice but to follow, obey him, and to abide by his Law.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Tafseer Ibn Kathir . The Noble Qur&#8217;an An-Nisa 4:86</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When you are greeted with a greeting, greet in return with what is better than it, or (at least) return it equally.) meaning, if the Muslim greets you with the Salam, then return the greeting with a better Salam, or at least equal to the Salam that was given. Therefore, the better Salam is recommended, while returning it equally is an obligation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Raja&#8217; Al-`Utaridi said that `Imran bin Husayn said that a man came to the Messenger of Allah and said, &#8220;As-Salamu `Alaykum&#8221;. The Prophet returned the greeting, and after the man sat down he said, &#8220;Ten.&#8221; Another man came and said, &#8220;As-Salamu `Alaykum wa Rahmatullah, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger.&#8221; The Prophet returned the greeting, and after the man sat down he said, &#8220;Twenty.&#8221; Then another man came and said, &#8220;As-Salamu `Alaykum wa Rahmatullah wa Barakatuh.&#8221; The Prophet returned the greeting, and after the man sat down he said, &#8220;Thirty.&#8221; This is the narration recorded by Abu Dawud. At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa&#8217;i and Al-Bazzar also recorded it. At-Tirmidhi said, &#8220;Hasan Gharib&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are several other Hadiths on this subject from Abu Sa`id, `Ali, and Sahl bin Hanif. When the Muslim is greeted with the full form of Salam, he is obliged to return the greeting equally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Ahl Adh-Dhimmah the Salam should not be initiated nor should the greeting be added to when returning their greeting. Rather, as recorded in the Two Sahihs their greeting is returned to them equally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Umar narrated that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When the Jews greet you, one of them would say, `As-Samu `Alayka (death be unto you).&#8217; Therefore, say, `Wa `Alayka (and the same to you).&#8217;) In his Sahih, Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Do not initiate greeting the Jews and Christians with the Salam, and when you pass by them on a road, force them to its narrowest path.) Abu Dawud recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(By He in Whose Hand is my soul! You will not enter Paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love each other. Should I direct you to an action that would direct you to love each other Spread the Salam among yourselves.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tafseer Ibn kathir</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Surah 4: Ayah 94.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O you who believe! When you go (to fight) in the cause of Allah, verify (the truth), and say not to anyone who greets you: &#8220;You are not a believer;&#8221; seeking the perishable goods of the worldly life. There is much more benefit with Allah. Even as he is now, so were you yourselves before, till Allah conferred on you His Favors, therefore, be cautious in discrimination. Allah is Ever Well-Aware of what you do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that `Ikrimah said that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;A man from Bani Sulaym, who was tending a flock of sheep, passed by some of the Companions of the Prophet and said Salam to them. They said (to each other), `He only said Salam to protect himself from us.&#8217; Then they attacked him and killed him. They brought his sheep to the Prophet , and this Ayah was revealed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O you who believe!), until the end of the Ayah.&#8221; At-Tirmidhi recorded this in his (chapter on) Tafsir, and said, &#8220;This Hadith is Hasan, and it is also reported from Usamah bin Zayd.&#8221; Al-Hakim also recorded it and said, &#8220;Its chain is Sahih, but they did not collect it.&#8221; Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas commented;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and say not to anyone who greets you: &#8220;You are not a believer;&#8221;), &#8220;A man was tending his sheep and the Muslims caught up with him. He said, `As-Salamu `Alaykum.&#8217; However, they killed him and took his sheep. Allah revealed the Ayah;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And say not to anyone who greets you: &#8220;You are not a believer; seeking the perishable goods of the worldly life).&#8221; Ibn `Abbas said; &#8220;The goods of this world were those sheep.&#8221; And he recited,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Peace) Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Qa`qa` bin Abdullah bin Abi Hadrad narrated that his father `Abdullah bin Abi Hadrad said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah sent us to (the area of) Idam. I rode out with a group of Muslims that included Abu Qatadah, Al-Harith bin Rab`i and Muhallam bin Juthamah bin Qays. We continued on until we reached the area of Idam, where `Amr bin Al-Adbat Al-Ashja`i passed by us on his camel. When he passed by us he said Salam to us, and we did not attack him. Because of some previous problems with him, Muhallam bin Juthamah killed him and took his camel. When we went back to the Messenger of Allah and told him what had happened, a part of the Qur&#8217;an was revealed about us,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O you who believe! When you go (to fight) in the cause of Allah), until,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Well-Aware).&#8221; Only Ahmad recorded this Hadith. Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that the Messenger of Allah said to Al-Miqdad,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(You killed a believing man who hid his faith with disbelieving people, after he had announced his faith to you. Remember that you used to hide your faith in Makkah before.) Al-Bukhari recorded this shorter version without a complete chain of narrators. However a longer version with a connected chain of narrators has also been recorded. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bazzar recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah sent a military expedition under the authority of Al-Miqdad bin Al-Aswad and when they reached the designated area, they found the people had dispersed. However, a man with a lot of wealth did not leave and said, `I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah.&#8217; Yet, Al-Miqdad killed him, and a man said to him, `You killed a man after he proclaimed: &#8220;There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah. By Allah I will mention what you did to the Prophet .&#8217; When they went back to the Messenger of Allah, they said, `O Messenger of Allah! Al-Miqdad killed a man who testified that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah.&#8217; He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Summon Al-Miqdad before me. O Miqdad! Did you kill a man who proclaimed, &#8220;There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah&#8221; What would you do when you face, &#8220;There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah tomorrow&#8221;) Allah then revealed;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O you who believe! When you go (to fight) in the cause of Allah, verify (the truth), and say not to anyone who greets you: &#8220;You are not a believer;&#8221; seeking the perishable goods of the worldly life. There are much more profits and booties with Allah. Even as he is now, so were you yourselves before till Allah conferred on you His Favors, therefore, be cautious in discrimination). The Messenger of Allah said to Al-Miqdad,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He was a believing man who hid his faith among disbelieving people, and he announced his faith to you, but you killed him, although you used to hide your faith before, in Makkah.)&#8221; Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(There is much more benefit with Allah.) means, better than what you desired of worldly possessions which made you kill the one who greeted you with the Salam and pronounced his faith to you. Yet, you ignored all this and accused him of hypocrisy, to acquire the gains of this life. However, the pure wealth with Allah is far better than what you acquired. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(so were you yourselves before, till Allah conferred on you His Favors.) means, beforehand, you used to be in the same situation like this person who hid his faith from his people. We mentioned the relevant Hadiths above. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And remember when you were few and were reckoned weak in the land). `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Sa`id bin Jubayr commented about Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(so were you yourselves before), &#8220;You used to hide your faith, just as this shepherd hid his faith.&#8221; Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(therefore, be cautious in discrimination), then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah is Ever Well-Aware of what you do.) and this part of the Ayah contains a threat and a warning, as Sa`id bin Jubayr stated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Fatawa Arkanul Islam<br />
</span>Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Uthaymeen (Rahimallah) Pgs. 55-60</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a man who suffers from the whisperings of Shaytan. He whispers things to him that are great sins, concerning Allah, the Almighty, the All-Powerful and he is very much afraid of this; what is the advice of your eminence?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding what has been mentioned concerning the problem of the questioner, which is that he fears the result of it, I say to him: Rejoice at the good news that there will be no result from it except a good result. This is the whispering by which Shaytan assails the believers in order to upset the sound belief in their hearts and to cause them sprirtual and mental agitation and disturb the serenity of their faith, indeed the serenity of their lives, if they are believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is not the 1st among the people of faith to be confronted by this situation, nor is he the last, for it will continue as long as there is a believer in the world; and this same situation confronted the Sahabahs (radiallahu anhum), for it was reported o­n the authority of Abu Hurayrah (radiallahu anhu) that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Some people from among the Companions of the Messenger of Allah came to the Rasool (alayhi salatul wasalam) and said to him, &#8216;Verily we perceive in our minds that which every o­ne of us considers too grave to express&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (alayhi salatul wasalam) said: &#8220;Do you really perceive it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;They said: &#8220;Yes&#8221;. Upon this he (alayhi salatul wasalam) remarked:&#8221;That is true faith.&#8221; *</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* [(It was reported by Muslim in the Book of Faith, in the Chapter of Explanation of the (evil) whispering regarding Faith (132)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Two Sahihs , it is also narrated from Abu Hurayrah (radiallahu anhu) that the Rasool (alayhi salatul wasalam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Satan may come to anyone of you and say: &#8216;Who created such and such? Who created such and such?&#8217; until he says, &#8216;Who created your Lord?&#8217; So, when he inspires such a question, o­ne should seek refuge w/Allah and give up such thoughts.&#8221; *</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* (Reported by Bukhari in the Book of Beginning of Creation, in the Chapter: The description of Iblis and his Legions (3276) and it was reported by Muslim in the Book of Faith, in the Chapter o­n the Description of the (evil) Whispering regarding Faith (134).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported o­n the authority of Ibn Abbas (radiallahu anhu) that a man came to the Rasool (alayhi salatul wasalam) and said: &#8220;Oh, Messenger of Allah! o­ne of us has thoughts of such a nature that he would rather be reduced to charcoal than speak about them.&#8221; The Rasool (alayhi salatul wasalam) said:&#8221;All praise and thanks be to Allah who has reduced his matter (shaytan&#8217;s guile) to (evil) whispering.&#8221; *</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">*(It was reported by Abu Dawud in the Book of Good Manners, in the Chapter: Regarding the response to (evil) Whispering (5112) and by Imam Ahmed in Al-Musnad (1:340)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul Islam Ibn Taymiyah (rahimallah) said in the Book of Faith:<br />
&#8220;The believer is put to trial by the whispering of Satan, the whispering of kufr which causes him distress, as the Companions (radiallahu anhum) said: &#8220;Oh Messenger of Allah! o­ne of us has thoughts within himself of such a nature that he would rather fall down from the heaven than speak of them.&#8221; The Rasool (alayhi salatul wasalam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;That is true faith&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration: &#8220;he considers it too grave to express.&#8221; He (alayhi salatul wasalam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;All praise and thanks are Allah&#8217;s who has reduced his (shaytan) intrigue to (evil) whispering)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is, the occurence of his whispering along with this great hatred for it and repelling it from the heart is a part of true faith, like the warrior in Allah&#8217;s Cause who met the enemy and fought him until he overcame him, for that is a great Jihad up to his words.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This why the seekers of knowledge and worship are assailed by whispering and uncertainty which do not afflict another, b/c he (the other) does not follow the Law of Allah and His way; rather, he follows his own desires, heedless of the rememberance of his Lord and this is the goal of Shaytan, as opposed to those who turn towards their Lord with knowledge and (acts of ) worship, for he is their enemy and he seeks to prevent them from (worshipping) Allah, the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, I say to this questioner: o­nce it is clear to you that this whispering is from Shaytan, then you must struggle and stand against it, know that it will never harm you as long as you undertake the necessary struggle, reject it and cease thinking about it. The Rasool (alayhi salatul wasalam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allah has forgiven what is whispered in the hearts of my followers, unless they put it into action or utter it.&#8221; *</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">*(Reported by Bukhari in the Book of Manumission, in the Chapter: Error and Forgetfulness in Manumission and Divorce (2528) and by Muslim in the Book of Faith, in the Chapter: Allah has forgiven what is whispered in heart (127)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if it is said to you:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do you believe what is whispered to you? And do you think it is the truth? And is it possible to describe Allah, the Most Glorified by it? You would say: It is not for us to speak of this; Glorified are You (Oh Allah), this is a great lie! You would reject it with your heart and by your words; and of the people, you would flee further than any of them from it. Then it is, o­nly whispering and perils displayed to your heart, and a window to polythesim from Shaytan, who courses throughout the human body as blood courses through it, in order to destroy and obscure your deen for you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why you find that Shaytan does not place doubt or rejection about trivial things in your heart, so you hear for example, of the existence of large and important cities filled w/residents and buildings in the east and west and yet doubt their existence never o­nce crossed your mind, nor regarding their faults, such as that their buildings are destroyed or are unfit for habitation or that there are no occupants in them and so o­n. There is no goal for Shaytan in making man kind doubt such things. But Shaytan&#8217;s important great goal is destroying the faith of the believer, so he strives by his horse, and o­n o­n foot, to extinguish the light of knowledge and guidance in o­ne&#8217;s heart and to cause him to fall into the darkness of doubt and uncertainty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Rasool (alayhi salatul wasalam) explained the beneficial medicine which contains a cure for this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Then let him seek refuge with Allah and cease doing it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a person ceases doing that and continues to worship Allah, seeking &amp; desiring that which is with Allah, it will stop troubling him, by Allah&#8217;s Power. So, avoid all suppositions which pass through your heart o­n this subject and worship Allah, supplicate to Him and glorfiy Him, and if you heard anyone describing Him with what was whispered to him, you would kill him if you could. Therefore, what is whispered is not a fact; rather it is simply thoughts and whisperings which have no basis. Like in the case of someone wearing a clean garment which he has just washed and then he is assailed by thoughts that maybe it is impure, and maybe it is not permissble to pray in it, but he should pay no heed to this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And my advice may be summarized as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Seek protection with Allah and completely stop these suppositions as the Rasool (alayhi salatul wasalam) ordered us to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Mention Allah, the Most High and restrain yourself from this whisperings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Wholehearted dedication to worship and acting in accordance with the Command of Allah and seeking His Pleasure, for when you give worship your undivided attention with earnestness and striving, you will forget about occupying yourself with this whispering, Inshallah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Seeking refuge with Allah much and asking Him to protect you from this thing.And I ask Allah, the Most High for protection for you and safety from every evil and every destable thing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Question:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Please explain this <i>Hadeeth</i> so that we have a correct understanding of it: لو أنكم كنتم توكلون على الله حق توكله لرزقكم كما يرزق الطير تغدو خماصا وتروح بطانا <i>&#8220;Were you to depend upon Allaah with true dependence, He would have provided for you like He provides for the bird; early in the morning he leaves hungry, but returns at the end of the day with a full stomach.&#8221;</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <i>Hadeeth</i> from &#8216;Umar, may Allaah be pleased with him, that the Prophet (sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">لو أنكم كنتم توكلون على الله حق توكله لرزقكم كما يرزق الطير تغدو خماصا وتروح بطانا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;Were you to depend upon Allaah with true dependence, He would have provided for you like He provides for the bird; early in the morning he leaves hungry, but returns at the end of the day with a full stomach.&#8221;</i> (At-Tirmithi no. 2344, Ibn Majah no.4I64, Ahmad 1/30,52, Ibn Hibban no. 2548 and Al-Hakim 4/318)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">was recorded by Imam Ahmad, At-Tirmithi, An-Nisa&#8217;i, Ibn Majah, Ibn Hibban, and Al-Hakim, and At-Tirmithi said, &#8220;This <i>Hadeeth</i> is <i>Hasan Sahih</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The (Arabic) word (in the <i>Hadeeth</i> is) &#8220;<i>Tawakkul</i>,&#8221; means to depend sincerely in one&#8217;s heart upon Allaah Almighty, for bringing blessings and warding off harms, for this world and the Hereafter. If people were to sincerely trust and depend upon Allaah to bring them that which benefits them and to keep away that which harms them, and if they take reasonable, practical steps themselves, Allaah will send their provision to them by the simplest of means. Just as Allaah Almighty gives the bird provision when it simply leaves in the morning, seeking its sustenance, and returns at the end of the day. Yes, it does go out to search, but it is an easy effort. <i>Tawakkul</i> in reality does not deny actually working and striving for provision, for Allaah Almighty has decreed that we should work and it is from His ways that he gives people when they strive. In fact, Allaah Almighty ordered us to both depend upon Him and to work, to take the necessary steps needed to achieve our goals, and so the act of striving for our sustenance is an act of physical worship while trusting and depending upon Allaah is faith in Him. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَعلَى اللّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>&#8220;And in Allaah let believers put their Trust&#8221;</i></b> [Ibrahim 14:11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He made <i>Tawakkul</i> like <i>Taqwa</i> which is to establish the means that have been ordered, while depending upon Allaah. Dependence without working and striving is mere impotence, even though, when one does this, he may appear to depend on Allaah to a certain degree. No one, then, should transform his trust into mere impotence and weakness. One should rather deem his trust in Allaah to be like working and striving: it is one of the necessary steps one must take to achieve his goal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And with Allaah is the facilitation to do what is right. May Allaah send peace and blessings upon Muhammad, his family, and his Companions</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Seeking Blessings from Graves</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible to stand or sit by a grave for supplication in favour of the deceased?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The purpose of the legitimate visitation to graves is <strong>to get a lesson</strong>, <strong>remember death and heed</strong>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not for seeking blessings from the buried</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When one enters a cemetery he should greet the dead saying: <em>As-Salaamu Alaikum, O people of this place, believers and Muslims, and we will &#8211; if Allah wills &#8211; follow you. We ask Allah safety for ourselves and yourselves</em>.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One may also recite other supplication in favour of the dead that are recommended by the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> But he should not ask the dead people to fulfil his needs, seek relief or benefit from them.</strong> Supplication alone is an act of worship which must be dedicated to Allah alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">There is not harm however, in standing or sitting by the grave while supplicating, but not for seeking blessings or taking rest.</span> Graveyards are not resting places or residential area for people to sit in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is legitimate to stand by the grave areas right after burial to supplicate in favour of the buried asking Allah to confirm him and forgive him. It is authentically reported that <span style="color:#008000;">whenever the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) buried a dead, he would stand by his grave and say: Ask Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for your brother, and ask him to make him give firm answers, for right now he is being questioned.</span>[2]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5;"><strong>Question</strong>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud, may Allaah be pleased with him, said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) say: <em>Verily, incantations, amulets and Tiwalah are Shirk</em>. [1] Jabir, may Allaah be pleased with him, said:I had an uncle who used to treat people with incantations for the scorpion&#8217;s sting. When the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) forbade incantations, he came to him and asked him: O Messenger of Allaah, You have forbidden incantations, and I treat those who are stung by scorpions with incantations. He (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: He who can help his brother, let him do so. [2] How do we compromise between the Hadith which forbids, and that which permits? And what is the ruling on wearing an amulet containing Qur&#8217;anic words on the chest of the affected person?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The forbidden formulas for incantations are those containing Shirk, beseeching other than Allaah, or meaningless words. But incantations that are free from such things, are legitimate, and are among the great means of healing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: <span style="color:#008000;">There is no harm in incantations as long as they do not include Shirk.</span> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: <span style="color:#008000;">He who can help his brother, let him do so.</span>[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said: <span style="color:#008000;">No incantation for other than the envious eye or venomous sting.</span> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means the most affective and beneficial incantation is that which is used in these two cases. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) was himself treated with incantation, and he treated others with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for wearing <strong>amulets</strong> by children and patients, it is not permissible. Such are called <strong>trinkets</strong>. But the most valid opinion is that they are a form of Shirk, and unlawful, because the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: <span style="color:#008000;">He who wears an amulet; may Allaah not help him, and he who wears a shell; may Allaah not protect him.</span> [6] <span style="color:#008000;">He who wears an amulet commits Shirk</span>.[7] And he (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: <span style="color:#008000;">Verily, incantations, amulets and Tiwalah are Shirk.</span> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars are at variance regarding the legality of wearing <strong>amulets containing Qur&#8217;anic Verses</strong>. The correct verdict is that they are unlawful, for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The general prohibition of wearing any kind of amulets according to the Prophetic traditions whether they contain Qur&#8217;anic Verses or not.</li>
<li>Leaving no room for formulas of Shirk, for if the amulets containing Qur&#8217;anic verses were allowed then they may be confused with the other amulets, and that will keep the door open to Shirk, and all kinds of amulets would be worn on that ground. It is known that closing the door to things that lead to Shirk and evil deeds is one of the greatest judicial objectives. It is Allaah who grants success.</li>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">We joined a karate club in America, and when our trainer told us that we had to bow to him after he bowed to us, we refused, explaining to him that we couldn&#8217;t because of our religion. He accepted our excuse but then he said that we had to bow our heads at least. He said that since he began the greeting by bowing, we had to respond. What is the ruling in this issue?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To greet somebody by bowing is unlawful, regardless whether that person is a Muslim or a disbeliever, and <strong>regardless whether you bow with our entire upper body or with your head only</strong>. This is because bowing is a kind of worship, and worship is for Allaah Almighty alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah send peace and blessing upon Muhammad, his family, and his Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Shorts That Do Not Cover Ones Knees</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What is the ruling regarding people who wear shorts when they play sports and people who watch them play?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Playing sports is allowed when it does not prevent one from what is obligatory. If it were to prevent one from something that is obligatory then it would be unlawful. If it becomes something that people spend most of their time in, then it would become a waste of time, in which case the least of what could be said is that it is Makruh (disliked). As for a person playing a sport, who is wearing only shorts that expose his thigh, or even more then that, then this is not allowed. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>For what is correct is that it is obligatory for young men to cover their thighs, and that watching a sport whose participants have their thighs exposed like this is not allowed</strong></span>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Story of a man who succumbed to Temptation</strong><br />
<span style="color:#808080;">Inspirational Read !!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related that a group of people were once seated in the company of Al-Hasan Al-Basri, when some men passed by, dragging along with them a body of a dead man. When Al-Hasan saw the dead man, a glint of instant recognition could be discerned in his eyes, and he fell unconscious from the shock of some memory that had just been rekindled. When he regained consciousness, his companions asked him what was wrong with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: This man – referring to the dead man being dragged along on the ground – used to be one of the best worshipers and one of the most renowned ascetics (in the world) (renouncing all the temporary pleasures of this world because he was so busy and devoted to worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One day he left his home, intending to go to the Masjid to pray, but on the way, he saw a beautiful young Christian women, who became an immediate temptation to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he proposed to her, she refused, saying; “I will not marry you until you become an adherent of my religion.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He went on his way, but as time went on, he yearned for her continued to increase. He then succumbed to her wish and exited from the fold of (Islaam) the religion of pure, unadulterated Monotheism.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After he became a Christian and some time passed, the woman came out to him from behind the curtain and said, “You are a man who is bereft of goodness. You have forsaken your religion, which was important to you for your entire life, simply for the sake of a lust that is of no value. Indeed, I too am forsaking my religion, but not for the same reason. I am doing so in order to achieve a blissful existence that never comes to an end, an eternal existence under the care of the One, the As-Samad (i.e., Allaah; The Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creature need, He neither eats nor drinks).” She then recited the entire Chapter of Al-Ikhlaas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">Say (O Muhammad (saw): “He is Allaah, (the) One. Allaah-us-Samad (The Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, He neither eats nor drinks). He begets not, nor was He begotten; And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.</span>” [Qur&#8217;aan:112:1-4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the people had heard about what she had said, they approached her and asked, “All along, you had this Chapter memorized?“</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“No,” she answered. “By Allaah, I had never known it before. But after this man continued to insist upon having me, I saw a dream; I saw Hellfire, and my place in it was shown to me. I became terrified and panic-stricken. Maalik – the custodian of the Hellfire – said to me: ‘Do not be afraid or sad, for Allaah has ransomed (i.e., saved) you with this man (i.e., he will take the place in Hellfire that you would have taken had not Allaah saved you).’ He then took me by the hand and admitted me into Paradise. Seeing a line written inside of it, I read it; among what was written were these Words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Allaah blots out what He wills and confirms (what He wills). And with Him is the Mother of the Book (Al-Lauh Al-Mahfooz).”</span> {Qur’aan 13:39]}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then recited the Al-Ikhlas Chapter to me, and I began to repeat it. Then I woke up and had it (the Al-Ikhlas Chapter) memorized.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan then said, “The woman then embraced Islaam, and the man whose corpse you just saw being dragged away was killed for having apostatized. And I ask Allaah to make us firm and steadfast upon guidance and to grant us safety and success.”¹</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>:  <span style="color:#993300;">Why is our religion called &#8220;Islaam&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because one who enters it <span style="color:#800080;"><strong>submits (Aslama)</strong></span> himself to Allaah, and he <span style="color:#800080;"><strong>surrenders to (Istislam)</strong></span>, and abides by, all of the judgements that come from Allaah and from His Messenger Salallaahu alayhi wasallam. Allaah Almighty said:</p>
<p>وَمَن يَرْغَبُ عَن مِّلَّةِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِلاَّ مَن سَفِهَ نَفْسَهُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And who turns away from the religion of Ibraheem except him who fools himself?</span> [Baqarah 2:130]</p>
<p>He also said:</p>
<p>إِذْ قَالَ لَهُ رَبُّهُ أَسْلِمْ قَالَ أَسْلَمْتُ لِرَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">When His Lord said to him, &#8220;Submit (i.e. be a Muslim)!&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have submitted myself (as a Muslim) to the Lord of all that exists.&#8221;</span> [Baqarah 2:131]</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>مَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لِلّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ فَلَهُ أَجْرُهُ عِندَ رَبِّهِ</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">But whoever submits his face (himself) to Allaah and he is a good-doer then his reward is with his Lord</span> [Baqarah 2:112]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Some women are overcome by the urge to communicate what is said in the house and their marital life to their relatives and friends. Some of what is said is secret, and the husband does not want anyone else to know it. What is the ruling on women who divulge these secrets and communicate them to those outside the house, or to some members of the household?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The practice, as some women do, of communicating what is said in the house, and communicating details about their marital life to relatives and friends, is a forbidden thing. It is not permissible for a woman to divulge the secrets of her house or her affairs with her husband to any person. Allaah, The Most High says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to Allaah and to their husbands), and guard in the husband’s absence what Allaah orders them to guard (e.g. their chastity and their husband’s property)”</span> An-Nisa’ 4:34</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; and the prophet Sallalaahu alaihi wa sallam informed us that the worst of people in rank before Allaah on the Day of Resurrection will be a man who has sexual intercourse with his wife and she with him, then he communicates her secrets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Shaytan disowns His Followers on the Day of Resurrection</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(And Shaytan will say when the matter has been decided: &#8220;Verily, Allah promised you a promise of truth. And I too promised you, but I betrayed you. I had no authority over you except that I called you, and you responded to me. So blame me not, but blame yourselves. I cannot help you, nor can you help me. I deny your former act in associating me (Shaytan) as a partner with Allah (by obeying me in the life of the world). Verily, there is a painful torment for the wrongdoers.&#8221;)</span> (Ibrahim 14:22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah narrates to us what Iblis will say to his followers after Allah finishes with the judgement between His servants, sending the believers to the gardens of Paradise and the disbelievers to the lows (of the Fire). Iblis, may Allah curse him, will stand and address the latter, in order to add depression to their depression, sorrow to their sorrow and grief to their grief. He will declare,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Verily, Allah promised you a promise of truth.)</strong> by the words of His Messengers that if you follow them, you will gain safety and deliverance. Truly, Allah&#8217;s promise was true and correct news, while I promised you then betrayed you.&#8217; Allah said in another Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(He (Shaytan) makes promises to them, and arouses in them false desires; and Shaytan&#8217;s promises are nothing but deceptions.)</strong> (4:120)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(I had no authority over you)</strong> Shaytan will say, `I had no proof for what I called you to, nor evidence for what I promised you,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(except that I called you, and you responded to me.)</strong> even though the Messengers establish the proof and unequivocal evidences against you and affirmed the truth of what they were sent to you with. But you disobeyed the Messengers and ended up earning this fate,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(So blame me not,)</strong> today,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(but blame yourselves.)</strong>, because it is your fault for defying the proofs and following me in the falsehood that I called you to.&#8217; Shaytan will say next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(I cannot help you)</strong>, I cannot benefit, save, or deliver you from what you are suffering,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(nor can you help me.)</strong>, nor can you save me and deliver me from the torment and punishment I am suffering,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(I deny your former act of associating me (Shaytan) as a partner with Allah.)</strong> or because you associated me with Allah before,&#8217; according to Qatadah. Ibn Jarir commented; &#8220;I deny being a partner with Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored.&#8221; This opinion is the most plausible, for Allah said in other Ayat,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And who is more astray than one who calls on others besides Allah, such as will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls to them And when mankind are gathered, they will become their enemies and will deny their worshipping.)</strong> (46:5-6) and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Nay, but they (the so-called gods) will deny their worship of them, and become opponents to them.)</strong>(19:82) Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>(Verily, the wrongdoers)</strong></span>, who deviate from truth and follow falsehood, will earn a painful torment. It appears that this part of the Ayah narrates the speech that Shaytan will deliver to the people of the Fire after they enter it, as we stated. `Amir Ash-Sha`bi said, &#8220;On the Day of Resurrection, two speakers will address the people. Allah the Exalted will say to `Isa, son of Maryam,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>(Did you say unto men: &#8220;Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allah&#8221;)</strong></span> (5:116) until,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>(Allah will say: &#8220;This is a Day on which the truthful will profit from their truth.&#8221;)</strong></span>(5:119) Shaytan, may Allah curse him, will stand and address the people,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#333333;"><strong>I had no authority over you except that I called you, and you responded to me</strong></span>.) Allah next mentioned the final destination of the miserable ones, who earned the disgrace and torment and having to listen to Shaytan address them, then He mentioned the final destination of the happy ones.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">What is the interpretation of seeing a deceased every time in dreams?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one sees a deceased in a good state in a dream, this lends hope that he is in a good state. If one sees him in another type of state, this could simply be devils taking on the form of people. Devils take on the shapes of people in a disliked situation in order to grieve the living. This is because devils are very avaricious to do anything that brings grief, worry and sadness to the believers. Allah has said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Secret counsels are only from Satan, in order that he may cause grief to the believers. But he cannot harm them in the least, except as Allah permits&#8221;</span></strong> (al-Mujadalah 10).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a person sees something evil for a deceased in a dream, he must seek refuge in Allah from the evil of Satan and the evil of what he saw. He should not communicate that dream to anyone concerning that deceased. In that way, the deceased will not harm whatsoever. In fact, any time a person sees something disturbing in a dream, he should then seek refuge in Allah from the evil of Satan and the evil of what he saw. Then he should spit three times on his left side. He should then change his side upon which he was sleeping to the other side. If he makes ablution and prays, that is better and superior. He should not communicate that dream to anyone and, in that case, he will not be harmed by it at all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Purity and Ostentation</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Many times a person thinks about doing a good deed and then Satan comes to him and whispers to him, saying, &#8220;You are doing that ostentatiously, to be seen of men and for a good reputation.&#8221; Therefore, he makes us go away from the good deed. How can one remain free of such occurrences?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Response: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One can remain free of such occurrences by seeking refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan, as well as by continually performing good deeds. He should not pay attention to such whisperings that make him stop doing good deeds. If he turns away from such whisperings and seeks refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan, such whisperings will stop by the permission of Allah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">When a menstruating woman becomes pure before before sunrise is it obligatory upon her to perform the maghrib and &#8216;ishaa prayers? Similarly, if she becomes pure before sunset, is it obligatory upon her to perform the dhuhr and &#8216;asr prayer?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;">If a mentruating or post-partum bleeding woman becomes pure<strong> before sunset</strong>, it is obligatory upon her to perform both <strong>dhuhr and &#8216;asr</strong> prayers according to the strongest opinion among the scholars.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;">Similar is the case if she becomes pure <strong>before dawn</strong>. In that case, she must perform the <strong>maghrib and &#8216;ishaa</strong> prayers. This has been narrated from &#8216;Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Awf and &#8216;Abdullaah ibn Abbaas. This is the opinion of the majority of the Scholars.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;">Similarly, if a menstruating or post-partum bleeding woman becomes pure <strong>before sunrise</strong>, it is obligatory upon her to perform the <strong>Fajr</strong> prayer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from Allaah is guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah informs about the Jinns when He sent His Messenger Muhammad and revealed the Qur&#8217;an to him. Among the ways He protected it (the Qur&#8217;an) was by filling sky with stern guards guarding it from all of its sides. The devils were then expelled from the places where they used to sit prior to that. This was so that they could not steal anything from the Qur&#8217;an and tell it to the soothsayers, thereby causing matters to be confused and mixed up. If this happened it would not be known who was being truthful. Allah did this out of His kindness to His creation, His mercy upon His servants and His protection of His Mighty Book (the Qur&#8217;an).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the Jinns said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#339966;">And we have sought to reach the heaven; but found it filled with stern guards and flaming fires. And verily, we used to sit there in stations, to (steal) a hearing, but any who listens now will find a flaming fire watching him in ambush</span>.) meaning, whoever would like to steal some information by listening, he will find a flaming fire waiting in ambush for him. It will not pass him or miss him, but it will wipe him out and destroy him completely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#339966;">And we know not whether evil is intended for those on earth, or whether their Lord intends for them guidance</span>.) meaning, `we do not know if this &#8212; the matter which has occurred in the sky &#8212; is intended for those who are in the earth or if their Lord intends some guidance for them.&#8217; They stated this in such a manner out of their etiquette in phrasing their speech, because they did not attribute the doing of evil to anyone and they attributed the good to Allah. Verily, it has been recorded in the Sahih,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#339966;">And evil is not attributed to You (Allah)</span>.) It used to be that shooting stars (meteors) occurred before this, however it did not happen much, rather only occasionally. As was reported in the Hadith of Ibn `Abbas when he said, &#8220;While we were sitting with the Messenger of Allah a shooting star flashed in the sky. So the Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;">(What did you all used to say about this)</span> We replied, &#8220;We used to say that a great person has been born and a great person has died.&#8221; The Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;">(This is not so, rather whenever Allah decrees a matter in the heaven&#8230;)&#8217;</span>&#8216; and then he went on to narrate the rest of the Hadith which we have already mentioned in its entirety in Surah Saba&#8217;. This is what caused them to seek the reason for this occurrence. So they set out searching in the east and the west. Then they found the Messenger of Allah reciting (the Qur&#8217;an) while leading his Companions in prayer. Thus, they knew that this Qur&#8217;an was the reason for the sky being guarded. Therefore, some among them believed in it and the others became more rebellious in their transgression. A discussion of this has preceded in a Hadith of Ibn `Abbas concerning Allah&#8217;s statement in Surat Al-Ahqaf,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;">(And (remember) when We sent towards you (Muhammad) a group of the Jinn (quietly) listening to the Qur&#8217;an.) (46:29)</span> There is no doubt that when so many shooting stars began appearing in the sky, it horrified humans and Jinns alike. They were very disturbed and alarmed by it. They thought that it was the destruction of the world. As-Suddi said, &#8220;The sky was never guarded except if there was a Prophet in the earth or the religion of Allah was victorious and dominant in the earth.&#8221; So the devils before the time of Muhammad had taken sitting stations for themselves in the heaven of this world and they would listen to the matters that occurred in the heaven. But when Allah sent Muhammad as a Prophet and Messenger, they were suddenly pelted one night (with the flaming, shooting stars).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the people of Ta&#8217;if were frightened because of this and they began to say, `The dwellers of the sky have been destroyed.&#8217; This was because they saw the severe fires in the sky and the shooting flames. They began freeing their servants and abandoning their luxuries. So `Abd Yalayl bin `Amr bin `Umayr said to them and he was referred to for judgement among them &#8220;Woe to you O people of Ta&#8217;if! Hold on to your wealth and look at these guiding stars in the sky.If you see them remaining in their place, then the dwellers of the sky have not been destroyed, rather this has happened because of Ibn Abi Kabshah (&#8211; meaning Muhammad ). And if you look and see that you can no longer see these stars, then verily the dwellers of the sky have been destroyed.&#8221; So, they looked and saw that the stars still remained, and thus, they kept their wealth. The devils also were frightened during that night. They went to Iblis and informed him of what happened to them. So he (Iblis) said, &#8220;Bring me a handful of dirt from every land so that I may smell it.&#8221; So they brought it and he smelled it and said, &#8220;It is your friend in Makkah.&#8221; Then he sent a group of seven Jinns to Makkah, and they found the Prophet of Allah standing in prayer in Al-Masjid Al-Haram while reciting the Qur&#8217;an. They drew near to him eager to hear the Qur&#8217;an, until their chests almost pressed against him. Then they accepted Islam and Allah revealed their matter to His Messenger . We have mentioned this chapter in its entirety in the first section of the Kitab As-Sirah with lengthy discussion. Allah knows best and unto Him is all praise and blessings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the males among the Jinn, but they increased them in Rahaq</span>.</strong>) (27:7) meaning,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`we (Jinn) used to think that we had some virtuous status over mankind because they used to seek refuge with us whenever they (men) would settle in a valley or any place in the wilderness, the open country steppes and other places.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the custom of the Arabs in the pre-Islamic days of ignorance. They used to seek refuge with the greatest Jinn of a particular place so that no harm or evil would afflict them. Like one would do if he entered into the land of his enemies, in the vicinity of a great and powerful man, he would seek the protection and guardianship of that man. So when the Jinns saw that the humans were seeking refuge with them due to their fear of them, they increased them in Rahaq which means fear, terror and fright. They did this so that the people would be more afraid of them and seek refuge with them even more. As Qatadah said concerning this Ayah, (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">but they increased them in Rahaq</span></strong>.) means, &#8220;the Jinns were courageous and increased in insolence against them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As-Suddi</strong> said, &#8220;A man used to set out with his family (on a journey) until he came to a piece of land where he would settle. Then he would say, `I seek refuge with the master (Jinn) of this valley from the Jinns, or that myself, my wealth, my child or my animals are harmed in it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Qatadah</strong> said, &#8220;When they sought refuge with them instead of Allah, the Jinns would overcome them with harm because of that.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from `<strong>Ikrimah</strong> that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Jinns used to fear humans just like humans fear them, or even worse. So whenever humans would come to a valley the Jinns would flee. So the leader of the people would say, `We seek refuge with the leader of the inhabitants of this valley.&#8217; So the Jinns said, `We see these people fleeing from us just like we flee from them.&#8217; Thus, the Jinns started coming near the humans and afflicting them with insanity and madness.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, Allah said, (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the males among the Jinn, but they increased them in Rahaq</span></strong>.) meaning, in sin. Abu `Aliyah, Ar-Rabi` and Zayd bin Aslam, all said, (in Rahaq) &#8220;This means in fear.&#8221; Mujahid said, &#8220;The disbelievers would increase in transgression.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Tafseer Ibn Katheer of the above Verses (Darussalam Eng. publication)</strong></span></p>
<p>Allah, the Exalted, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(He is Allah, beside Whom La ilaha illa Huwa, the All-Knower of the unseen and the seen. He is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah states that He Alone is worthy of worship, there is no Lord or God for the existence, except Him. All that is being worshipped instead of Allah are false deities. Allah is the All-Knower in the unseen and the seen, He knows all that pertains to the creations that we see, and those we cannot see. Nothing in heaven or on earth ever escapes His knowledge, no matter how great or insignificant, big or small, including ants in darkness. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(He is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.)</strong></span> was duly explained before at the very beginning of this Tafsir, so it is not necessary to repeat it here, and it asserts that Allah is the Owner of the wide encompassing mercy that entails all of His creation. He is Ar-Rahman and Ar-Rahim of this life and the Hereafter. Allah the Exalted said in other Ayat,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>And My mercy embraces all things.</strong>)(7:156),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>Your Lord has written (prescribed) mercy for Himself.</strong>)(6:54), and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Say: &#8220;In the bounty of Allah, and in His mercy; &#8212; therein let them rejoice.&#8221; That is better than what (the wealth) they amass.)</strong>(10:58) Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(He is Allah, beside Whom La ilaha illa Huwa, Al-Malik.)</strong></span> Al-Malik, meaning &#8220;The Owner and King of all things,&#8221; Who has full power over them without resistance or hindrance. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(Al-Quddus,)</strong></span> meaning &#8220;The Pure,&#8221; according to Wahb bin Munabbih, while Mujahid and Qatadah said that Al-Quddus means &#8220;The Blessed.&#8221; Ibn Jurayj said that Al-Quddus means &#8220;He Whom the honorable angels glorify.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(As-Salam,)</strong></span> meaning &#8220;Free from any defects or shortcomings that lessen or decrease His perfect attributes and actions.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(Al-Mu&#8217;min,)</strong></span> means &#8220;Who has granted safety to His servants by promising that He will never be unjust to them, &#8221; according to Ad-Dahhak who reported it from Ibn `Abbas. Qatadah said that Al-Mu&#8217;min means that &#8220;Allah affirms that His statements are true,&#8221; while Ibn Zayd said that it means, &#8220;He attested to His faithful servants&#8217; having faith in Him.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(Al-Muhaymin,)</strong></span> means, according to Ibn `Abbas and others, &#8220;The Witness for His servants actions,&#8221; that is, the Ever-Watcher over them. Allah said in similar Ayat,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>And Allah is Witness over all things</strong>.)(58:6),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>and moreover Allah is Witness over what they used to do</strong>.)(10:46), and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>Is then He (Allah) Who takes charge (guards) of every person and knows all that he has earned</strong>)(13:33) Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(Al-`Aziz,)</strong></span> meaning that &#8220;He is the Almighty, Dominant over all things.&#8221; Therefore, His majesty is never violated, due to His might, greatness, irresistible power and pride. Allah said;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(Al-Jabbar, Al-Mutakabbir)</strong>,</span> meaning &#8220;The Only One worthy of being the Compeller and Supreme.&#8221; There is a Hadith in the Sahih Collection in which Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>Might is My Izar and pride is My Rida; if anyone disputes any one of them with Me, then I will punish him</strong>.) Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(Glory be to Allah! (High is He) above all that they associate as partners with Him.)</strong></span>, then He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(He is Allah, Al-Khaliq, Al-Bari, Al-Musawwir.)</strong></span> Al-Khaliq refers to measuring and proportioning, Al-Bari refers to inventing and bringing into existence what He has created and measured. Surely, none except Allah is able to measure, bring forth and create whatever He wills to come to existence. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(Al-Khaliq, Al-Bari, Al-Musawwir.)</strong> </span>means, if Allah wills something, He merely says to it &#8220;be&#8221; and it comes to existence in the form that He wills and the shape He chooses,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>In whatever form He willed, He put you together.)</strong>(82:8) Allah describing Himself as being Al-Musawwir, Who brings into existence anything He wills in the shape and form He decides.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(To Him belong Al-Asma&#8217; Al-Husna (the Best Names).)</strong></span> We explained the meaning of this Ayah in the Tafsir of Surat Al-A`raf. The Two Sahihs recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah the Exalted has ninety-nine Names, one hundred less one; whoever then preserves them, will enter Paradise. Allah is Witr (One) and He likes the Witr.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(All that is in the heavens and the earth glorify Him.)</strong></span> is similar to His other statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify Him and there is not a thing but glorifies His praise. But you understand not their glorification. Truly, He is Ever Forbearing, Oft&#8211;Forgiving</strong>.)(17:44) Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(and He is Al-`Aziz)</strong> </span>The Almighty, meaning, His greatness is never humbled,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(Al-Hakim)</strong> </span>the All-Wise, in His legislation and decrees.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When the Messenger of Allah conquered Makkah, he sent Khalid bin Al-Walid to the area of Nakhlah where the idol of Al-`Uzza was erected on three trees of a forest. Khalid cut the three trees and approached the house built around it and destroyed it. When he went back to the Prophet and informed him of the story, the Prophet said to him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Go back and finish your mission, for you have not finished it.)</strong> Khalid went back and when the custodians who were also its servants of Al-`Uzza saw him, they started invoking by calling Al-`Uzza! When Khalid approached it, he found a naked woman whose hair was untidy and who was throwing sand on her head. Khalid killed her with the sword and went back to the Messenger of Allah , who said to him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(That was Al-`Uzza!)&#8221;</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahya was commanded by Allaah with Tawheed, singling out Allaah with all worship, without ascribing partners to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imam Ahmad</strong> narrated that Al-Harith Al-Ash&#8217;ari said that the Prophet of Allaah <em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah commanded Yahya bin [son of] Zakariya to implement <strong>five commands</strong> and to order the Children of Israel to implement them, but Yahya was slow in carrying out these commands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Isa (Jesus, son of Mary) said to Yahya, &#8216;<em>You were ordered to implement five commands and to order the Children of Israel to implement them. So either order, or I will do it</em>.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahya said, &#8216;<em>My brother! I fear that if you do it before me, I will be punished or the earth will be shaken under my feet</em>.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, Yahya bin Zakariya called the Children of Israel to <em><strong>Bayt Al-Maqdis</strong></em> (Jerusalem), until they filled the Masjid. He sat on the balcony, thanked Allaah and praised him and then said, &#8216;A<em>llaah ordered me to implement five commandments and that I should order you to adhere to them</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">The first</span></strong> is that you <strong>worship Allaah alone</strong> and not associate any with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The example of this command is the example of a man who bought a servant from his money with paper or gold. The servant started to work for the master, but was paying the profits to another person. Who among you would like his servant to do that? Allaah created you and sustains you. Therefore, worship Him alone and do not associate anything with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also command you to <strong>pray</strong>, for Allaah directs His Face towards His servant&#8217;s face, as long as the servant does not turn away. So when you pray, do not turn your heads to and fro.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also command you to <strong>fast</strong>. The example of it is the example of a man in a group of men and he has some musk wrapped in a piece of cloth, and consequently, all of the group smells the scent of the wrapped musk. Verily, the odor of the mouth of a fasting person is better before Allaah than the scent of musk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also command you to give <strong>charity</strong>. The example of this is the example of a man who was captured by the enemy. They tied his hands to his neck and brought him forth to cut off his neck. He said to them, &#8216;Can I pay a ransom for myself?&#8217; He kept ransoming himself with small and large amounts until he liberated himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I also command you to always remember Allaah. The example of this deed is that of a man who the enemy is tirelessly pursuing. He takes refuge in a fortified fort. When the servant remembers Allaah, he will be resorting to the best refuge from Satan.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says in Surah Al-A&#8217;raf,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(201. Verily, those who have Taqwa, when an evil thought comes to them from Shaytan, they remember (Allah), and (indeed) they then see (aright).)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(202. But (as for) their brothers (the devils&#8217; brothers) they (the devils) plunge them deeper into error, and they never stop short.)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#000000;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Allah mentions His servants who have <span style="color:#800080;text-decoration:underline;">Taqwa</span>, obeying His orders, and avoid what He forbade</strong></span></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">(when comes to them)</span> an evil thought, or anger, or the whispers of Shaytan cross their mind, or intend to err, or commit an error,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">(they remember)</span> Allah&#8217;s punishment, as well as, His tremendous reward. They remember Allah&#8217;s promises and threats, then repent, go back to Him, seek refuge with Him and ask for forgiveness before death,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">(and (indeed) they then see (aright))</span> they become aright and aware of the error of their ways.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allah said next,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">(But (as for) their brothers they plunge them deeper)</span> in reference to the devils&#8217; brothers among mankind. Allah said in another Ayah, (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Verily, the spendthrifts are brothers of the Shayatin</strong></span>) (17:27) for they are followers of the Shayatin, who listen to them and obey their orders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">(They plunge them deeper into error)</span> the devils help them commit sins, making this path easy and appealing to them</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">(and they never stop short)</span> for the devils never cease inciting mankind to commit errors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">(But (as for) their brothers they plunge them deeper into error, and they never stop short.)</span> &#8220;Neither mankind stop short of the evil that they are doing nor the devils stop short of luring them. &#8221; Therefore,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">(they never stop short)</span> refers to the devils getting tired or stopping their whispering.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allah said in another Ayah,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>See you not that We have sent Shayatin against the disbelievers to push them to do evil</strong></span>) (19:83) persistently luring the disbelievers to commit evil, according to Ibn `Abbas and others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Source : Tafseer Ibn Kathir of Surah Al-Kahf</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> And never say of anything, &#8220;I shall do such and such thing tomorrow.&#8221; Except (with the saying), &#8220;If Allah wills!&#8221; And remember your Lord when you forget and say: &#8220;It may be that my Lord guides me to a nearer way of truth than this.&#8221;</span> &#8211; Surah Kahf: (23, 24 ayah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) declared Allah&#8217;s Oneness and proclaimed to be the Messenger of Allah (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) and revelation of Divine Message, the disbeliveers of Makkah sent some men to Jewish rabbis in al-Medina and said: &#8220;Ask them (the rabbis) about Muhammad (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam), and describe him to them, and tell them what he is saying.They are the people of the first Book, and they have more knowledge of the Prophets than we do.&#8217; So they set out for al-Medina, they asked the Jewish rabbis about the Messenger of Allah (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam). They described him to them and told them some of his teachings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The rabbis said: &#8216;Ask him about three things which we will tell you to ask, if he answers them then he is a Prophet who has been sent (by Allah); if he does not, then he is saying things that are not true, in which case how you will deal with him will be up to you. Ask him about some young men in ancient times, what was their story? For there is a strange and wondrous tale. Ask him about a man who traveled a great deal and reached the east and the west of the earth. What was his story? And ask him about he Ruh (soul or spirit) what is it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he tells you about these things, then he is a Prophet, so follow him, but if he does not tell you, then he is a man who is making things up, so deal with him as you see fit.&#8217; So, the men came back to Makkah and said: &#8216;O people! We have come to you with a decisive solution which will put an end to the problem between you and Muhammad (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam). The Jewish rabbis told us to ask him about some matters,&#8217; and they told them what they were. Then they came to the Messenger of Allah (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) and said: &#8216;O Muhammad (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) tell us,&#8217; and they asked him about the things they had been told to ask.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) said: &#8220;I will tell you tomorrow about what you have asked me.&#8221; But he (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) did not say, &#8216;If Allah Wills.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah Messenger (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) never spoke anything except with revelation. So, he waited for the revelation from Allah but fifteen days passed away without any revelation concerning those matter which the disbelievers asked, neither did Jibreel (alaihis-salaam) come to him. The people of Makkah started to doubt him and said: &#8216;Muhammad (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) promised to tell us the next day and now fifteen days have gone by and he has not told us anything in response to the questions we asked.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) felt sad because of the delay in revelation and was grieved by what the people of Makkah were saying about him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Jibreel (alaihis-salaam) came with the revelation of Soorah al-Kahf, which contained answers to the questions and also the above mentioned verse explaining the correct etiquette when determining to do something in the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Determining to do something in the future should always be attributed to the Will of Allah, Who is the Knower of the Unseen and Who Alone Knows what was and what is yet to happen and what is not to be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in Saheeh al-Bukharee from Abu Hurayrah (radhiyallahu anhu), who said: &#8220;The Messenger of Allah (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) said: &#8220;<strong>Sulaiman Ibn Dawood (alaihimus-salaam)</strong> said: &#8216;Tonight I will go around to all my seventy wives (according to some reports it is ninety or one hundred wives) so that each one of them will give birth to a son who will fight for the sake of Allah.&#8217; It was said to him, (according to one narration, an Angel said to him), say, &#8216;If Allah Wills.&#8217; But he did not say it. He went around to the women but none of them gave birth except for one, who gave birth to a half-formed child.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) said: &#8220;By the One, in Whose Hands is my soul, had he said, &#8216;If Allah wills,&#8217; he would not have broken his oath, and that would have helped him to attain what he wanted.&#8221; [Saheeh Muslim (vol. 3, no. 1275)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if one determines to do something in the future or even takes an oath, he should say, &#8216;If Allah Wills&#8217; or &#8216;Insha&#8217;Allah.&#8217; If one forgets to say &#8220;Insha&#8217;Allah&#8221; then he should say when he remembers it even if it is a year later, as Ibn Abbas (radhiallahu anhu) explained.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Jesus and  Muhammad (peace be upon them) in the BIBLE and the QUR&#8217;AN</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Biblical evidence of Jesus being a servant of God and having no share in Divinity</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">by Dr. M. Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali, Ph.D.<br />
Professor of Islamic Faith and Teachings, Islamic University, Al-Madina</p>
<hr width="100%" />
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to the One to Whom all Dignity, Honour and Glory are due; the Unique with perfect attributes, Who begets not, nor is He begotten. He has no equal but He is the Almighty, Omnipotent. He sent His Messengers and Prophets to guide humanity towards monotheism; to worship Him Alone, the only One Worthy of worship, and to warn them of the eternal dire consequences of polytheism; associating partners with One Allah and the worship of creatures.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon all the Prophets and Messengers, especially on Muhammad, the last of the Prophets, and on all who follow him in righteousness until the Day of Recompense.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTIANITY: MEN WITHOUT RELIGION </strong></p>
<p><strong>ISLAM: RELIGION WITHOUT MEN</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Muslim never lacks proofs about the purity and truthfulness of his religion, but what he lacks are those truthful brothers who stand for Allah and His Prophet <tt>SAW</tt> testifying to the truth. Indeed, in this age, Islam is a religion without men (custodians and propagators) whereas Christianity is men without a religion; yet, by their endeavour, adventurous spirit, patience and monetary contributions they are able to falsify truth and make falsehood appear true. In this materialistic age most of humanity have become slaves to wealth, fashions, and mansions.</p>
<p>There is none worthy of worship but Allah and in Him (Alone) do I put my trust, and towards Him am I destined.</p>
<p><strong>JESUS AND THE DEVIL IN THE BIBLE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the New Testament of the Bible, in the fourth chapter of the Gospel according to Matthew, the sixth and seventh verses clearly indicate that Jesus is an obedient mortal and God is the Master and Lord according to his saying in the seventh verse:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord, thy God.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this chapter we read that the Devil actually carried the Messiah, and took him from place to place. How can the Devil carry God? Glory be to Allah; He is above such blasphemy!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Devil orders him to prostrate before him and worship him, even tempting him with worldly possessions. How can the Devil even dare such an audacity with God? When the Devil wanted Jesus to comply with his orders, he (Jesus) replied by saying that it was written (in the previous Books):</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou shalt worship the Lord, thy God; And Him only shalt thou serve.&#8221; Matthew 4:10.</p>
<p><strong>CHILDREN OF GOD</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jesus never called himself <em>Son of God</em> as far as I know but he used to call himself the &#8216;Son of Man&#8217; (ref. Mark 2:10) although he heard himself being called by that name he did not object as assumed in the Bible and did not consider the title exclusively for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the Biblical term in the Old and New Testaments, every God- fearing righteous person is called &#8216;Son of God&#8217;. In Matthew 5:9 we read:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Blessed are the peace-makers, for they shall be called the children of God.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Matthew 5:45 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;That ye may be children of your Father which is in heaven&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>GOD THE FATHER</strong></p>
<p>In Matthew 5:48 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Matthew 6:1 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matthew 7:21 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not every one that sayeth unto me (Jesus), Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven: but he that doeth the will of my Father, which is in heaven.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>N.B. </strong>The word &#8216;Lord&#8217; here was translated as <em>Rabb</em> in the Arabic version of the Bible so that people may be convinced that Jesus is God! But if one studies the rest of the verse, one will note that the verse bears testimony to the subservience (to God&#8217;s Will) of the Messiah (Jesus). Therefore the correct translation should be:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Not every one that sayeth to me, O my Master, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obvious from the above readings from the Bible that the term &#8216;Father&#8217; is used for God in numerous places in the Bible. It is never used exclusively for the Messiah (Jesus).</p>
<p>Matthew 11:25 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;At that time Jesus answered and said, &#8216;I thank Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes.'&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>JESUS THE WORSHIPPER </strong></p>
<p>Matthew 14:23 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray&#8230;..&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: If he (Jesus) is God or a part of God then why did he pray? In fact, prayer is always from a submitting, needy and dependent one for the Mercy of Almighty Allah as mentioned in the Qur&#8217;ân. (V. 35:15):-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O mankind! it is you who stand in need of Allah but Allah is Rich (Free of all wants and needs), Worthy of all praise&#8221; (35:15).</p>
<p>And in (V. 19:93) of Qur&#8217;ân:-</p>
<p>&#8220;There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most Beneficent (Allah) as a slave.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>A BIBLICAL STORY </strong></p>
<p>Matthew 15:22-28 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts and cried unto him, saying, &#8216;Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David: my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.&#8217; But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying; &#8216;Send her away, for she crieth after us.&#8217; But he answered and said, &#8216;I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then came she and worshipped him, saying, &#8216;Lord, help me.&#8217; But he answered and said, &#8216;It is not meet to take the children&#8217;s bread and to cast it to dogs.&#8217;</p>
<p>And she said, &#8216;Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters&#8217; table.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Jesus answered and said unto her, &#8216;O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<p>In this story about a woman from Canaan there are noteworthy points:</p>
<p>(1) Lack of mercy and love charged against Jesus (if the incident is reported correctly).</p>
<p>(2) Degraded discrimination in regard to the uplifting of his tribe and not for the others.</p>
<p>(3) Tribal pride of descendance and prejudice against others and calling them dogs.</p>
<p>(4) An ignorant polytheist woman debated with him and won him over.</p>
<p><strong>JESUS: A PROPHET OF ALLAH.</strong></p>
<p>Matthew 19:16-17 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And behold, one came and said unto him, &#8216;Good master, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?&#8217; And he said unto him, &#8216;Why callest thou me good? (There is) none good but one, (i.e.) God, but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<p>In the above verses we note this acknowledgment of his submissiveness (to Allah&#8217;s Will).</p>
<p>Matthew 21:45-46 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And when the chief priests and pharisees had heard his parable, they perceived that he spoke of them. But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude because they took him for a Prophet.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here it is proved that all those who believed in Jesus during his life-time did not believe in him being God or the Son of God or one in the doctrine of Trinity; but they believed in him as being a Prophet only. This is indeed one of the strongest points of evidence against those who believe in the Divinity of Jesus (Incarnation of God) if only they pondered.</p>
<p><strong>JESUS: A SERVANT OF ALLAH.</strong></p>
<p>Matthew 23:8 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8216;But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your master, even Jesus, and all ye are brethern.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here it is clearly proved that Jesus was servant of Allah, and that there is only One Master and He is Allah. In the Arabic version of the Bible this verse has been translated so that Jesus is meant to be the master whereas the English rendering is nearer the original sense.</p>
<p>Matthew 23:9 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father which is in heaven.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this you will note that fatherhood and sonship is meant to be the relationship between the Lord and His servants: it is meant in a general sense and not specifically for Jesus.</p>
<p>Matthew 24:36 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a definite proof that the Final Hour is unknown to any but Allah, thus Jesus&#8217; knowledge is imperfect like all other men; Allah Alone is All-Knowing, Omniscient.</p>
<p>Matthew 26:39 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And he (Jesus) went a little farther, and fell on his face and prayed, saying, &#8216;O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We note here that the person speaking is unaware of Allah&#8217;s Will and realizes the fact that he is a servant of Allah. He (Allah) Alone can cause the change.</p>
<p><strong>THE COMPILATION OF THE BIBLE</strong></p>
<p>Matthew 27:7-8 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And they took counsel and bought with them the potter&#8217;s field to bury strangers in. Wherefore that field was called the Field of Blood, unto this day.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From these verses we understand that the Bible (the New Testament) was not written during Jesus&#8217; life-time but long after the occurrence of the events described, having been retained in the memory of the people.</p>
<p>Matthew 27:46 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, &#8216;Eli,Eli, lama sabachthani? (My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?&#8217;)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is according to their (Christians&#8217;) assumption that Jesus cried in a loud voice saying the above words while he was being crucified. This is a great insult as such words could only come from unbelievers in Allah. Further, it is incredible that such words should come out from a Prophet of Allah because Allah never breaks His Promise and His Prophets never complained against His Promise.</p>
<p><strong>JESUS: PREACHER OF MONOTHEISM (<em><strong>TAUHID</strong></em></strong><strong>)</strong></p>
<p>In John 17:3 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And this is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Mark 12:28-30 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, &#8216;Which is the first commandment of all?&#8217; And Jesus answered him: &#8216;The first of all the commandments is; hear O Israel, the Lord thy God is One Lord: and thou shalt love the Lord, thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<p>In Mark 12:32 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And the scribe said unto him, &#8216;Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is One God; and there is none other but He.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<p>In Mark 12:34 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;he (Jesus) said unto him, &#8216;Thou art not far from the kingdom of God&#8230;&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In these verses, Jesus (peace be upon him) himself had testified that Allah is the One God, there is none other than Him, and that whoever believes in His Oneness, he is near the Kingdom of Allah. Therefore whoever associates partners with Allah or believes in the Trinity is far away from the Kingdom of Allah, and whoever is far away from the Kingdom of Allah he is the enemy of Allah.</p>
<p>In Matthew 24:36 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of the heaven, but my Father only.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: A similar text was quoted from S.Matthew which is exactly as proclaimed by the Qur&#8217;ân in that none knows when the Hour will come except Allah. This establishes the fact that Jesus was subservient to Allah and that he had no share in Divinity: that he was an incarnation of God, was an innovation by the people of Canaan.</p>
<p>In John 20:16 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Jesus said unto her, &#8216;Mary&#8217;. She turned herself, and sayeth unto him, &#8216;Rabboni&#8217;, which is to say, Master, Jesus saith unto her, &#8216;Touch me not: For I am not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father; and to my God and your God.&#8217; Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she has seen the Lord, and that He had spoken these things unto her.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the above narrative Jesus clearly testified that Allah is his God and their God, making no difference between him and them in the worship of the One Allah. Whoever believes that Jesus is God has indeed blasphemed against Allah and betrayed the Messiah (Jesus) and all the Prophets and Messengers of Allah.</p>

<p><strong>BIBLICAL PROPHECY ON THE ADVENT OF MUHAMMAD (peace be upon him)</strong>John 14:15-16 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If you love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray the Father and He shall give you another Comforter that he may abide with you forever.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim theologians have said that &#8220;another Comforter&#8221; is Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah; and him to &#8220;abide forever&#8221; means the perpetuity of his laws and way of life (<em>Sharia&#8217;</em>) and the Book (Qur&#8217;ân) which was revaled to him.</p>
<p>John 15:26-27 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me: And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.&#8221;</p>
<p>John 16:5-8 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;But now I go my way to Him that sent me and none of you asketh me &#8216;Whither goest thou?&#8217; But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart. Nevertheless I tell you the truth; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and approve righteousness and judgment.&#8221;</p>
<p>John 16:12-14 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I have yet many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now. How be it when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak; and he will shew you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and he shall shew it unto you.&#8221;</p>
<p>John 16:16 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;A little while and ye shall not see me: and again a little while, ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim theologians have stated that the person who is described by Jesus to come after him in the above verses does not comply with any other person but Muhammad (peace be upon him) the Messenger of Allah. This &#8216;person&#8217; whom Jesus prophesied will come after him is called in the Bible &#8216;Parqaleeta&#8217; This word was deleted by later interpreters and translators and changed at times to &#8216;Spirit of Truth&#8217;, and at other times, to &#8216;Comforter&#8217; and sometimes to &#8216;Holy Spirit&#8217;. The original word is Greek and its meaning is &#8216;one whom people praise exceedingly.&#8217; The sense of the word is applicable to the word &#8216;Muhammad&#8217; (in Arabic).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>FINALITY ON PROOFS ON THE FABRICATION </strong><strong>OF THE STORY OF THE CROSS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) The Bible testifies to the fact that Jesus was known among the Jews; he used to preach and deliver sermons in the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem. It was therefore, unnecessary to hire a Jew for thirty pieces of silver to direct them to him as related in S. Matthew.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) It is related that one of the twelve disciples named Judas Iscariot was hired to direct the Jews to Jesus. They then sentenced him after which Judas was greatly ashamed and dissociated himself from their act and then committed suicide. All this took place within twenty four hours. The contradictions are obvious.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) The clearest proof which alone is sufficient to discredit this story is when the Jews passed the sentence of death against Jesus and intended to get the approval of the governor, Pontious Pilate.</p>
<p>Matthew 27:11-14 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And Jesus stood before the governor: The governor asked him, saying, &#8216;Art thou the king of the Jews!&#8217; And Jesus said unto him, &#8216;Thou sayeth (sayest)&#8217;: And when he was accused of (by) the chief priests and elders. He answered nothing. Then said Pilate unto him, &#8216;Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?&#8217; And he answered him never (to) a word&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Christians will interpret the above verse to mean that Jesus wanted to die on the Cross for the redemption of mankind and for the forgiveness of their sins: if so, then why did he ask to turn away that cup from him (i.e. death)? Why did he cry out while on the Cross (as they assume): &#8220;O Lord, why hast thou forsaken me?&#8221; How could he have remained silent when the truth was being challenged? He was known for his soul-inspiring sermons challenging the learned Jewish <em>Rabbis.</em> No sane person can believe in this. If the story of the Cross is disproved then the very foundation on which Christianity is based, will be demolished.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslims believe that Jesus was not crucified by the Jews as revealed in the Holy Qur&#8217;ân by Allah in a crystal clear manner: V. 4:157,158.-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And because of their saying (in boast): &#8216;We killed Messiah Jesus, son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah&#8217;; &#8211; but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but the resemblance of Jesus was put over another man (and they killed that man), and those who differ therein are full of doubts. They have no (certain) knowledge, they follow nothing but conjecture. For surely, they killed him not (i.e., Jesus, son of Mary). But Allah raised him (Jesus) up (with his body and soul) unto Himself (and he <tt>alai-hiss-salaam</tt> is in the heavens).. And Allah is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews themselves, together with the entire Christian world, believe that he was crucified. As proofs against their views and to prove the truth of the Muslim verdict through the Bible, I prepared the following set of questions based on the Book of S. Matthew in the New Testament of Bible. (Chapters 26 and 27):</p>
<p>(1) Did those who captured Jesus (according to their assumption) know him in person? or did they not know him?</p>
<p>S. Matthew testifies that they did not know him.</p>
<p>(2) Was it during the day or night that he was captured?</p>
<p>S.Matthew says it was during the night.</p>
<p>(3) Who was the one that directed them to him?</p>
<p>S. Matthew says: He was one of his twelve disciples called Judas lscariot.</p>
<p>(4) Did he direct them free of charge or for a fixed reward which they specified, for him?</p>
<p>S. Matthew says: He directed them to him for a fixed reward of thirty pieces of silver.</p>
<p>(5) What was the condition of Jesus during that night?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">S. Matthew says: He was fearful and prostrated in prayer saying: &#8220;O God, if it is possible for You to let this cup pass from me, then let it pass.&#8221; It is incredible that such words could come from a believer in God, let alone a Prophet of God, because all believers believe that God has power over all things.</p>
<p>(6) What was the condition of his eleven disciples?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">S. Matthew says: Sleep overcame them that night together with their teacher (according to their assumption) out of fear.</p>
<p>(7) Was Jesus contented with their condition?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">S. Matthew says (verses 40-46): He was not satisfied. He used to come to them to wake them up saying: &#8220;Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak.&#8221; Then he would come again to find them asleep and he would again wake them up and say the same thing. This weakness could not have been spoken of righteous pupils even if they were pupils of an ordinary pious teacher, let alone the disciples of Jesus, son of Mary.</p>
<p>(8) Did they help him when those ruffians captured him?</p>
<p>S. Matthew says: They forsook him and fled.</p>
<p>(9) Did Jesus have confidence in his disciples that night?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">S. Matthew says: Jesus informed them that they will all forsake him. Then Jesus said unto them: &#8220;Verily I say unto thee that this night before the cock crows, thou shall deny me thrice.&#8221; Peter said unto him, &#8220;Although I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee.&#8221; Likewise also said all the disciples. And so it happened.</p>
<p>(10) How did those ruffians capture him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">S. Matthew says: They came to him with swords and staves after they were directed to him by a Jew, then they captured him as described in verse 57:</p>
<p>&#8220;And they that had laid hold on Jesus, led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the elders were assembled.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There they passed the sentence of death on him. The ruffians then took him away, spat on his face and struck him with their hands after which they stripped him of his clothes and clad him in scarlet robes, then placed a crown of thorns on his head and took him about, teasing and mocking him. They said to him: &#8216;You are the king of Israel according to your claim.&#8217; They severely degraded him.</p>
<p>(11) Who finally decided to pass the death sentence against him?</p>
<p>S. Matthew says: He was Pontious Pilate, a Greek Roman, who was at that time the governor of Palestine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(12) When the ruffians brought that man before the governor and informed him that the priest of the Jews passed the sentence of death by crucifixion according to their law (Torah), did he believe in them without investigation?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">S. Matthew says: He did not believe them but asked that man: &#8220;Is it true what they have said?&#8221; He remained silent. The question was repeated and he continued to remain silent. He remained silent in view of the truth; it was essential for him even if he was not a Prophet to clarify the truth and deny the false accusation of the Jews. The governor&#8217;s wife went to the governor and she said to him: &#8220;Have thou nothing to do with that just man? for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Bible states that Jesus delivered lengthy speeches to the Jews rebuking and warning them which amounted to defaming them. Then why was he silent that day? The governor&#8217;s intention for asking him was to stand for the truth.</p>
<p>(13) How was he crucified according to their assumption?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">S. Matthew says: They crucified him between two thieves both of whom abused him by saying to him, &#8220;If you are truthful then save yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>(14) This was a great calamity. What did he say while on the cross (according to their assumption)?</p>
<p>S. Matthew says (27:46):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, &#8220;Eli, Eli, Iama sabachthani? (that is to say,) my God, my God, why has Thou forsaken me?&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a blatant declaration of disbelief according to all theological authorities. Whoever relates it to a Prophet is a disbeliever according to the revealed religions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Almighty Allah, in the Qur&#8217;ân warns, the Jews and the Christians against their blasphemy; that Jesus is an incarnation of God (Allah) or the son of God (Allah) or in rejecting him totally; and that they must believe in him as a Messenger of Allah only:</p>
<p>&#8220;And there is none of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), but must believe in him (Jesus, son of Mary, as only a Messenger of Allah and a human being), before his (Jesus <tt>alai-hiss-salaam </tt> or a Jew&#8217;s or a Christian&#8217;s) death (at the time of the appearance of the angel of death). And on the Day of Resurrection, he (Jesus) will be a witness against them.&#8221; (V.4:159).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Why Allah sent Prophets and Messengers ?</strong></span><br />
Source:  Appendix II from  &#8216;Interpretations and Meanings of the Noble Qu&#8217;ran&#8217;<br />
By Dr. Muhammad Taqiuddeen al-Hilaalee, Ph.D. and Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ever since people innovated the dogma of joining others in worship along with Allah, Allah had been sending Prophets and Messengers to His devotees in order to invite them to the worship of Allah and Allah Alone, to order them not to ascribe partners unto Him and bring them out of the darkness of polytheism and into the light of Monotheism. All the Prophets preached the belief in the Oneness of Allah. The following verses from the Noble Qur&#8217;an illustrate this fact:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed, We sent Nooh (Noah) to his people and he said: &#8216;O my people! Worship Allah! You have no other Ilaah (God) but him. (Laa ilaaha ill Allaah, none has the right to be worshipped but Allah). Certainly, I fear for you the torment of a great Day!'&#8221; (Al-A&#8217;araaf, The Heights 7:59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And to &#8216;Aad (people, We sent) their brother Hood. He said: &#8216;O my people! Worship Allah! You have no other Ilaah (God) but Him. (Laa ilaaha ill Allaah, none has the right to be worshipped but Allah). Will you not fear (Allah)?'&#8221; (Al-A&#8217;araaf, The Heights 7:65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And to (the people of) Madyaan (Midian), (We sent) their brother Shu&#8217;ayb. He said: &#8216;O my People! Worship Allah! You have no other Ilaah (God) but Him. (Laa ilaaha ill Allaah, none has the right to be worshipped but Allah). Verily, a clear proof (sign) from your Lord has come unto you, so give full measure and full weight and wrong not men in their things, and do not make mischief on the earth after it has been set in order, that will be better for you, if you are believers.'&#8221; (Al-A&#8217;araaf, The Heights 7:85)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And to Thamood (people, We sent) their brother Saalih. He said: &#8216;O my people! Worship Allah! You have no other Ilaah (God) but Him. (Laa ilaaha ill Allaah, none has the right to be worshipped but Allah).'&#8221; (Al-A&#8217;araaf, The Heights 7:73)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): Worship Allah (Alone) and avoid (or keep away from) Taaghoot (all false deities etc. do not worship Taaghoots besides Allah).&#8221; (An-Nahl, The Bee 16:36)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every Prophet was sent unto his own nation for their guidance, but the Message of Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam &#8211; peace be upon him) was general for all mankind and jinn (a being created from smokeless flames).</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Say [O Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam)]: &#8216;O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allah.'&#8221; (Al-A&#8217;araaf, The Heights 7:158)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the aim of sending these Prophets and Messengers to mankind and jinn was only that they should worship Allah Alone, as Allah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And I (Allah) created not the jinn and men except they should worship Me (Alone)&#8221; (Adh-Dhaariyaat, The Winds that Scatter 51:56)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And to worship Allah means to obey Him and to do all that He has ordained, &#8211; and to fear Him by abstaining from all that He has forbidden. Then those who will obey Allaah will be rewarded in Paradise, and those who will disobey Him will be punished in the Hell-fire.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Imaam Sufyaan</strong> (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Be truthful at all times and in all places. Stay away from lying and from deception, and do not sit alongside liars and deceivers, for all such deeds are sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My brother, be careful not to show off, either in speech or in deed, for showing off is <em>Shirk</em> itself (<em>Shirk</em> being to associate partners with Allaah in worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not be conceited, for even a good deed is not raised (to the heavens) if any conceitedness is involved in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Take your religion only from one who is sincerely and compassionately concerned about his own religious guidance. The example of a scholar who is not concerned about his own religious well-being is that of a sick doctor: If he cannot treat his own disease…then how can he treat the diseases of others…? Likewise, if one is not concerned about his own religious well-being, then how can he be concerned about the religious well-being of others?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My brother, your religion is nothing more than your flesh and blood (i.e., You should be concerned about your religious well-being, because if you aren’t, it is your flesh and blood that will pay the penalty through the punishment of Allaah). Cry out of concern for your soul and have mercy on it; if you do not have mercy on it, then mercy will not be shown to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sit only in the company of one who advises you to desire little from this world and who encourages you to put your hopes in the Hereafter. Take care not to sit with worldly people who speak constantly about worldly affairs; such people will ruin your religious well-being and will corrupt your heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Remember death frequently, and just as frequently ask Allaah to forgive you for your past sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ask Allaah to keep you safe (safe from evil, from dangerous diseases, from trials and tribulations, etc) for the remainder of your life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My brother, develop a good character and noble manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not act contrary to the <em>Jamaa’ah</em> (the general body of <em>Sunni</em> Muslims), for goodness and safety are the consequences of being in harmony with the <em>Jamaa’ah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Someone who strives constantly for this world is like a person who builds one home and destroys another (because he builds prosperity for himself in this world, while he destroys all chances of becoming prosperous in the Hereafter).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Give sincere advice to every believer who asks you a question regarding his religion. And never hide good advice to someone who asks you about a matter that leads to the Good Pleasure of Allaah (<em>subhaanahu wa ta’aala</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you love your (Muslim) brother for the sake of Allaah, then give him generously from your self and your wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Stay far away from arguments, quarrels, and disputes; otherwise, you will become a wrongdoer, a transgressor, and a deceiver.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Be patient at all times and in all places, for patience leads to righteousness, and righteousness leads to Paradise. Do not become angry and furious, for those two emotions lead to wickedness, and wickedness leads to the Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not argue with a scholar, for that will lead to him loathing you. Being able to visit scholars (and learn from them) is a mercy, and cutting oneself off from them means that one is bringing down upon himself the wrath of Allaah (<em>subhaanahu wa ta’aala</em>). Verily, the scholars are the treasurers of the Prophets (<em>‘alayhumus salaam</em>) and are also their inheritors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Turn away from worldly pleasures and things (to a certain degree), and, as a result, Allaah will enable you to see the faults and defects of this world. Be a man of <em>Wara’</em> (one who forsakes all dubious and some lawful things because he fears that those things will lead to what is prohibited in Islaam), and (on the Day of Resurrection) Allaah will make your session of accountability easier for you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Leave many of the things regarding which you are doubtful, and replace them with things regarding which you are not doubtful, and you will, as a result, remain safe: So by warding off doubt with certainty, you will remain safe in your religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Enjoin good and forbid evil — thus will you become loved by Allaah. Despise wicked-doers, and drive away devils (regardless of whether they are humans or jinn).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you want to become strong (in faith)…then be exultant only a little and laugh only a little when you get something you want from this world. Concentrate on working for the Hereafter; if you do that, Allaah will be sufficient for you regarding your worldly concerns….</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ask Allaah for safety (in both your religious and worldly affairs). If you intend to something for your Hereafter – such as giving charity – then apply yourself to doing it quickly before the <em>Shaytaan</em> (the Devil) weakens your resolve and thus prevents you from doing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not be a heavy eater, whereby you work less than you eat, for that is disliked (in Islaam). Do not eat without an intention, and do not eat when you are not hungry. And do not fill your stomach constantly until you become a corpse, not having remembered Allaah while you were alive (but instead having been concerned with eating to your full and fulfilling your desires).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Decrease the frequency with which you fall into error, accept apologizes (from those who wronged you), and forgive the person who wronged you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Be the type of person from whom people generally expect good things and from whose evil people feel safe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not hate anyone who obeys Allaah, and be merciful both towards people in general and towards those with whom you are well-acquainted (or both to the general masses of Muslim and to people of high standing in society).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not sever the ties of the womb (i.e., do not cut off relations with family members and relatives), and join ties with those who have severed them from you. Pardon those who wronged you, and you will, as a result, become a companion of the Prophets and martyrs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not be a frequent visitor of the marketplace, for the people there (mostly sellers, but some buyers also) are wolves in men’s clothing. Marketplaces are often frequented by devils – devils both of the human kind and of the jinn kind. When you enter the marketplace, it becomes obligatory upon you to enjoin good and forbid evil – but know that you will only see evil there. Stand to one side of the marketplace and call out: ‘<span style="color:#993300;">I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Allaah alone; He has no partner; the dominion of all that exists belongs to Him. He is deserving of all praise. It is He Who gives life, and it is He Who causes death. All goodness is in His hands, and He is upon all things capable. There is neither might nor power except with Allaah, the All-High, the All-Mighty</span>.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not enter into disputes with worldly people over their worldly things, and, as a result, Allaah will love you, and the people of earth will love you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And be humble….When you are healthy, do good deeds, and you will be granted safety and health (physically and spiritually) from above.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Be a forgiving person, and you will get the things you want. Be a merciful person, and all things will be merciful towards you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My brother, do not allow your days, nights, and hours to be wasted on falsehood. Spend from your self for yourself – for the Day of Thirst (the Day of Resurrection). My brother, your thirst will not be quenched on the Day of Resurrection unless the Most Merciful is pleased with you, and you will not achieve His Good pleasure unless you are obedient to Him. Perform many voluntary good deeds, for they have the effect of bringing you closer to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Be generous, and your faults will be covered, and Allaah will make easier for you your session of accountability (on the Day of Resurrection) as well as the horrors (that will take place on that day).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perform many good deeds, and Allaah will make you feel happy and at ease in your grave.&nbsp; Stay away from all prohibited deeds, and thus will you taste the sweetness of faith (<em>Eemaan</em>). Sit in the company of righteous and pious people, and Allaah will make well for you the affairs of your religion. And in the affairs of your religion, consult those who fear Allaah. Hasten to perform good deeds, and Allaah will protect you from disobeying Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Remember Allaah frequently, and, as a result, Allaah will make you less desirous of this world (and its pleasures and possessions). Remember death, and, as a result, Allaah will make your worldly affairs easier for you. Yearn for Paradise, and, as a result, Allaah will help you obey Him. Be frightened by the Hellfire, and,&nbsp; as a result, Allaah will make it easier for you to endure the hardships of this life.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">I was looking though the subjects covered in the book Aqd Ad-Durar fee Akhbar Al-Muntathar &#8230; in some of the narrations attributed to Ali bin Abi Talib, may Allaah be pleased with him, I find that they are written thus: It is reported on the authority of Ali bin Abi Talib, Alaihis-Salam (upon him be peace) that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: There will come forth a man from among my family with nine banners. What is the ruling on using this expression, I mean Alaihis-Salam (upon him be peace) or the like for other then the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not appropriate to distinguish Ali with this saying. Rather, what is legislated is that it be said in his case and the case of other Companions: <strong>Radhi Allahu Anhu</strong> (may Allaah be pleased with him), <strong>Radhi Allahu Anhum</strong> (may Allaah be pleased with them) or: <strong>Rahimahullah </strong>(may Allaah have mercy on him). This is because there is no evidence for distinguishing him by it. Likewise is the expression used by some: Karram Allahu Wajhahu (may Allaah bless his countenance), there is no evidence for using it, nor is there any reason to distinguish him by it. It is best to treat him the same as the rest of the Well-Guided Caliphs and not to apply any special words to him which are not applied to the others, when there is no evidence to support it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">In Al-Fawaaid Ad-daraaree, Al-Ajloonee related that Imam Bukhaaree (may Allah have mercy on him) once travelled by boat on a journey to seek out knowledge and that  he had taken with him one-thousand dinars. One of his fellow travelers ingratiated himself with Imam Bukharee, outwadly showing him love and admiration. During the sea-voyage, the man often made it a point to sit in his company. On long journeys, friendships develop faster than normal, and during the course of the time they spent together, Imam Bukhaaree informed the man that he had one-thousand dinars with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The morning after Imam Bukharee spoke about the money, the man woke up and began to cry, scream, rip his clothing apart, and slap his own face, as if he had just been afflicted with a great loss. His fellow shipmates asked him what was wrong, and he refused to answer at first, as if he was still in a state of  shock and could not bring himself to speak about his situation. After they continually insisted that he tell them what the matter was with him, he finally said, &#8220;I had a bag that contained one-thousand dinars, and I lost it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The crewmen who were incharge of the ship began to search the passengers. One by one everyone was being searched, and upon realizing what was happening, Imam Bukharee, making sure that no one was looking, threw his bag of money over the side of the ship. When it was his turn to be searched, nothing was found. When the entire ship and all of its passengers were searched, and when no bag of money was found, those in authority on the ship went back to the man who had made up the story and chastised him for making a false claim and for putting them through so much trouble. As soon as the ship finally reached shore, the passengers began to disembark;meanwhile, Imam Bukhaaree&#8217;s old friend went to him and asked him what he had done with the bag of money.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I threw it into the sea,&#8221; Imam Bukhaaree matter-of-factly replied.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And you are patiently accepting the fact that you have just lost such a huge sum of money?&#8221; the man asked in bewilderment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O ignorant one,&#8221; Imam Bukhaaree said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;Do you not know that I have spent my entire life gathering the Ahadeeth of the Messenger (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and that  the world now acknowledges my trustworthiness. Would it then have been befitting for me to subject  myself to the accusation of theft? And shall I lose the precious pearl (i.e my knowledge and achievements as a scholar) that I have earned over a lifetime over a limited number of dinars?&#8221;</span>[1]</p>
