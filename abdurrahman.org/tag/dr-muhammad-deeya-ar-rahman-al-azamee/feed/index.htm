										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">By Dr. Muhammad Deeya ar-Rahman al-Azamee</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After knowing the authenticity of a hadeeth or its weakness, then it becomes obligatory to busy yourself with its understanding since that is the fruit of this knowledge.  Indeed a foundation without a building upon it is like a house which is demolished as Khateeb said in the introduction to his book ‘Muaalim’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haakim said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the <em>Fuqaha</em> (scholars of Sharia’) of Islaam, the people of<em>Qiyaas</em> (analogy), opinions, derivation, debate and reflection are well-known in every age and are people of every country.  However we will mention here, in this place by Allaah’s permission, the <em>Fiqh</em> of hadeeth according to its people as evidence so that the people who work in and study this science thoroughly (<em>Muhadditheen</em>) are not ignorant of the <em>Fiqh</em> of hadeeth as it is a portion from the categoriesof this knowledge.’[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he lists the names of these <em>Muhadditheen</em> <em>al-Fuqaha</em> with a brief mention of their <em>Fiqh</em>, so from them are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad bin Sheehab az-Zuhri, Yahya bin Sa’eed al-Ansaari, AbdurRahman bin ‘Amr al-Awzaee, Sufyaan bin Uyaina al-Hilaalee, Abdullaah bin al-Mubarak, Yahya bin Sa’eed al-Qataan, AbdurRahman bin Mahdi, Yahya bin Yahya at-Tameemee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding Ahmad bin Hanbal, ash-Shafi’ee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I left Baghdad and I never left behind anyone who had more understanding of the <em>Deen</em>, was more abstinent from the <em>Duniya</em>, more pious or more knowledgeable than Ahmad bin Hanbal.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The list continues with:) ‘Alee bin Abdullaah bin Jafar al-Madeeni, Yahya bin Ma’een, Ishaaq bin Ibraheem al-Hanthaali, Muhammad bin Yahya ath-Thuaali, Muhammad bin Isma’eel al-Bukhari, Abu Zur’ah Ubaydillaah bin AbdulKareem, Abu Hatim Muhammad bin Idrees al-Hanthaali, Ibraheem ibn Ishaaq al-Hanthaali, Muslim bin al-Hajjaj al-Qushaayri, Abu Abdullaah Muhammad bin Ibraheem al-Abdi, ‘Uthmaan bin Sa’eed al-Darmi, Abu Abdullaah bin Muhammad bin Nasr al-Marwazi, Abu AbduRahman bin Shu’aib an-Nisaaee, Abu Bakr Muhammad bin Ishaaq bin Khuzaymah, Abu Daawood, Muhammad bin AbdulWahhab al-Abdi, Abu Bakr aj-Jaarudi, Ibraheem bin Abee Taalib, Abu ‘Isa at-Tirmidhi, Musa bin Haroon al-Bazaar, al-Hasan bin ‘Alee al-Ma’mari, ‘Alee bin al-Hussain bin al-Junaid, Muhammad bin Muslim bin Warah, Muhammad bin ‘Aqeel al-Balkhi and other than them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the <em>Fuqaha</em> of Ahl-ul-Hadeeth is Abu Bakr an-Neesaabooree of whom Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah – may Allaah have mercy on him –said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abu Bakr an-Neesaabooree was an <em>Imaam</em> in <em>Fiqh</em> and hadeeth, he was concerned with the Ahadeeth of <em>Fiqh</em> and with the variantwordings of the Ahadeeth.  He was close to the way and knowledgeof <em>Ahl-ul-Hadeeth </em>such that he was not biased towards the sayings of any of the <em>Fuqaha</em>, just as the famous Imaams of Hadeeth were not.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for Bukhari and Abu Daawood, then they are two Imaams in<em>Fiqh</em> from the people of <em>Ijtihaad</em>.  As for Muslim, Tirmidhee, Nisaaee, Ibn Maja, Abu Ya’ala, al-Bazaar and those similar to them then they were upon the <em>madh-hab </em>of <em>Ahl-ul-Hadeeth</em>.  They were not blind-followers of any single individual from amongst the scholars, nor were they absolutely from the Imaams of <em>Ijtihaad</em>, but rather they were not inclined to take the sayings of the Imaams of hadeeth such as Shafi’ee, Ahmad, Ishaaq, Abu Ubayd and their likes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for al-Bayhaqi then he was on the <em>Madh-hab </em>of ash-Shafi’ee, supporting it with its general statements.  Daraqutnee also inclined towards the <em>Madh-hab </em>of Shafi’ee and the Imaams of the chains of narrations (<em>asaaneed</em>) and hadeeth, but he was not like al-Bayhaqi in blindly following Shafi’ee.  So, even though al-Bayhaqi carried out<em>Ijtihaad</em> in many issues, the <em>Ijtihaad</em> of Daraqutnee was stronger than his as he was more knowledgeable and had a stronger comprehension than him (i.e. al-Bayhaqi).’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘From them there were those who specialised with some of the scholars just as Abu Daawood specialised with Ahmad bin Hanbal so they are more inclined to the <em>Madh-hab</em> of <em>Ahl-ul-Hijaaz</em> – such as Maalik and his likes– than the <em>Madh-hab</em> of <em>Ahl-ul-Iraq</em>  &#8211; the likes of Abu Hanifah and Thawree.’  The end of Shaykh ul-Islaam’s saying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Knowledge of the <em>Fiqh</em> of hadeeth cannot be achieved except if the different paths of the hadeeth are gathered just as Imaam Ahmad said: ‘If the different paths (narrations) are not gathered, the hadeeth cannot be understood.  The hadeeth are explained, some by others.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahya bin Ma’een said: ‘If a hadeeth was not written with 30 different chains, we would not have understood it.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Shafi’ee authored a booklet in ‘Ihktilaaf of hadeeth’, then Ibn Qutaybah followed him in that as did Abu Yahya Zakareeyah bin Yahya as-Saajee, Tahawee, Tabaree, Ibn Abdul Barr and Ibn al-Jawzi.  All of this shows the importance of <em>Fiqh ul-Hadeeth</em> to the<em>Muhaddithee</em>n, researchers and those who extrapolate rulings.  This is what al-Khateeb indicated in his book ‘al-Kafaya’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If it were not for the concern of <em>As-haabul-Hadeeth</em> (the companions of hadeeth) with the precision of the <em>Sunnan</em>, gathering them, extracting them from their sources and researching the different paths, the <em>Sharia’</em> would have become void and its rulings would have been cancelled out because the rulings were extrapolated from preserved <em>Athaar</em> (narrations) and they took benefit from the transmitted <em>Sunnan</em>.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">By  Dr. Muhammad Deeya ar-Rahman al-Azamee</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam said: ‘We do not mean to limit <em>Ahl-ul-Hadeeth</em> just to those who convey hadeeth, write them or narrate them but we mean by them: everyone who rightfully memorises the hadeeth, knowing them and understanding their apparent and hidden meanings and following them in what is apparent and hidden, and also the people of al-Qur’aan.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The least of their traits is: love of the Qur’aan and hadeeth, researching them, seeking their meanings and practising that which they know is binding upon them.  The <em>Fuqaha</em> of hadeeth are better informed about the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> than <em>Fuqaha</em> other than them.’[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<em>Ahl-ul-Hadeeth</em> are those about whom the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘What I am upon and my Companions.’  And in another narration: ‘It is the <em>Jamaah</em>, The Hand of Allaah is over the <em>Jamaah</em>.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Ahl-ul-Hadeeth</em> are the best people of the <em>Duniya</em>, as Hafs bin Ghayaath said.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shafi’ee said: ‘If I see a companion of Hadeeth then it is as if I see a man from the Companions of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> he is of that status.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘May Allaah reward them with goodness on our behalf, they preserved the foundation for us so they have an excellence over us.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alee bin al-Madini said: ‘There are no people better than the companions of Hadeeth.  The rest of the people were in search of the <em>Duniya</em> while they were establishing the <em>Deen</em>.’[5] i.e. the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hafidh Ibn Rajab said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<em>Ahl-ul-Hadeeth</em> are an authority in knowing hadeeth and knowing the authentic from the weak hadeeth.’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> supplicated for illumination of the one who busies himself with the knowledge of hadeeth, memorizing it, conveying it and understanding it.  He <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘May Allaah illuminate the person who hears a hadeeth from me and memorizes it until he conveys it.  Perhaps a person who carries <em>Fiqh</em>conveys it to someone with more <em>Fiqh</em> than that person and perhaps the carrier of this <em>Fiqh</em> is not a <em>Faqihi</em>.’[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hafidh Abu Bakr Ahmad bin ‘Alee al-Khateeb al-Bagdadispecifically authored a book which he called ‘Sharf Ashaabul-hadeeth’ (the nobility of the companions of hadeeth).  In it mentions Ahadeeth and <em>Athaar</em> from the Companions, <em>Ta’bieen</em>, kings,ministers and others from those who followed them about the excellence of knowledge of hadeeth, being busy with it and the nobility of its people over those of <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> and those of misguidance from the <em>Zinaadiqa</em> (heretics) who concerned themselves with the knowledge of rhetoric and philosophy.  This book is a masterpiece in this subject.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* Taken from ‘Mu’jam Mustalah al-Hadeeth wa laataif al-Assaneed’ p.61-63</p>
