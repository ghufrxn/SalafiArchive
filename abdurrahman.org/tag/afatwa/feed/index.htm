<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: There are some Islâmic Anâshîd that are sung together with tambourines (daff). They lead to enthusiasm and consist of good meanings. What is your opinion on it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn &#8216;Uthaymîn</strong>: A lot is said about Islâmic Anâshîd. It was a long time ago I listened to them. They were okay when they first emerged. They were free from tambourines. They did not cause any tribulations and they were not sung in accordance with forbidden melodic tones. They have evolved through time. They began to be combined with percussion instruments, it may have been tambourines or something else. Subsequently, they further evolved and started to be sung with beautified, trying voices. Later on, they evolved even more and started to be sung as the forbidden songs. That is why I am not comfortable with them. It cannot be said that all of them are allowed just as it cannot be said that all of them are forbidden. They are allowed if they are free from the things I have mentioned. Nevertheless, if they are combined with tambourines, beautiful, trying voices or forbidden melodic tones, then they are not permissible to listen to.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: There are those who say that the Kuffâr (disbelievers) are our brothers in humanity and not in the religion. Is this true?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân</strong>: It is not sufficient with the humanity. One does not speak like that in order to please them or to gain their sympathies. One does not speak like that. One says that they are our enemies and not that they are our brothers in humanity. One says that they are our enemies. What is the benefit of a human fraternity if they are our enemies in the religion? What does it benefit? Pharaoh was also a human. Right? Was he also our brother? We do not say that.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Does the one that listens to the cassette tapes of Ahl-ul-Bid&#8217;ah or reads their books in order to know what they believe fall into sitting with innovators?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân</strong>: It is as sitting with them or maybe even worse. But if he is learned and armed with knowledge and listens to them or reads their books to refute them and warn against them, it is okay.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, were he not to have knowledge and insight and wants to read them or listen to them, it is not allowed. It will get stuck into his head and he has nothing to repel it with. It is not allowed for him to listen to them if he cannot defend himself against these poisons and evilnesses.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: Is a boy who has not reached the age of six allowed to wear the pants below the ankles?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân:</strong> No, it is not allowed with Isbâl. A child should be raised in accordance with the Sunnah. One should not let it practice Isbâl.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân:</strong> We love Jihâd and wish for it, but this is not Jihâd! We have said that this is not Jihâd. This is destruction! Is it Jihâd to kill people without due right? He even kills himself without due right. Is this Jihâd? This is not Jihâd. Jihâd has rulings, conditions and rules. It is the Muslim ruler who leads and calls to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even the israelites said to their prophet:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Send to us a king, and we will fight in the way of Allah&#8221;</span> (2:246)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They didn&#8217;t go armed to fight on their own:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Send to us a king, and we will fight in the way of Allah&#8221;</span> (2:246)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I.e. a leader. Who did they ask it from? One of their prophets, the ruler.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jihâd, which is one of the disposals of the ruler, is referred to the ruler. He is the one who orders it and takes on it. He is the one who recruits armies and prepares weapons. Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;&#8230; by which you may terrify the enemy of Allah and your enemy&#8230;&#8221;</span> (8:60)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He did not say you should terrify the Muslims and those one has a treaty with. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;&#8230; by which you may terrify the enemy of Allah and your enemy&#8230;&#8221;</span> (8:60)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albânî:</strong> There are no doubts that poetry exists in Islâm. The messenger (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There is poetry that most certainly is wisdom.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, that one sings the poetry and calls it as “Anâshîd” and “Religious Anâshîd”, then it is something our righteous Salaf (predecessors) did not know of at all. This, in fact, has a connection to the principle we mentioned earlier and which is a summary of that which the scholars always speak of in similar contexts, namely:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All good lies in following the earlier ones and all evil lies in that which the later ones have innovated</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Salaf did not used to sing Anâshîd and call them as “religious”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> _____________________________</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a side note, the Shaykh (al-Albânî) deemed singing to be allowed on some occasions, when he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“In these Hadiths and narrations exists an apparent evidence for it being allowed to sing without music on some occasions such as when one is thinking about death, longs for the family or home country, relaxes a little, gets away from the difficulties of the trip and the like.” (Tahrim-ul-Alat, p. 129, afatwa.com)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: There are those who incite the youths and say that our brothers are dying everywhere. They call in the name of Jihâd and that one shouldn&#8217;t obey the ruler in this (I.e. in Jihâd). Can you say something regarding this matter?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân</strong>: Shall we then also kill our own children, tear our homes apart and kill the Muslims if our brothers die everywhere? They rejoice in this. They rejoice in getting our brothers into these countries. They rejoice over these homicide-attacks in our countries. Is this Jihâd? Does this affect our enemies? It only affects us. It only affects the Muslims.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> What is the ruling regarding me saying to my wife that she is divorced jokingly with laughter?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân:</strong> There is no joking or laughing when it comes to the divorce. Its joking is seriousness, as the prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said. If you jokingly tell her that she is divorced, she is divorced.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Scholar</strong>: Imâm Muhammad Nâsir-ud-Dîn al-Albânî<br />
<strong>Source</strong>: Silsilat-ul-Hudâ wan-Nûr (15)<br />
<strong>Reference</strong>: Darulhadith, Sweden<br />
aFatwa.com (site is down)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: What is the ruling on singing religious songs (Qasâ’id Dîniyyah) aloud in the mosques during religious holidays?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albânî</strong>: First and foremost, there is nothing in Islâm called as “religious songs”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly, it is not allowed to disturb the worshipers in the mosque even if it be with Qur’ân-verses. What should then be said about songs that are allegedly religious? They have even more right to be disallowed. The prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“O people! Each one of you is having a conversation in seclusion with their Lord. No one from among you should trouble the other and no one from among you should raise his voice when he reads over the voice of the other.”</em> (Ahmad 3/94)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said in another narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“…when he reads the Qur’ân.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner:</strong> They compare this with the poetry of Hassân bin Thâbit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albânî</strong>: The poetry of Hassân bin Thâbit? Is that a religious song? I say to you that there is nothing that is called as ‘religious songs’. As for the poetry in which the messenger (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) is defended, then say as you wish, but you should not sing and let it constitute a religious aspect. It should be read in the same way as you mention Allâh and ask for blessings and peace over the messenger (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: How can there not exist Islâmic and religious songs when one sings about Islâm and Islâmic characters?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albânî</strong>: Did this, what you are speaking of, exist with our righteous Salaf? We will treat you with leniency – may Allâh forgive you and me. Did this type exist with the Salaf?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: What type?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albânî</strong>: The type you are referring to… Why are you not speaking? [Everybody laughs]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner:</strong> The purpose of poetry and Arabic songs…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albânî</strong>: Excuse me. I do not want you to repeat your earlier speech. I understand what you are saying. I want you to concisely answer my question: Was this known with the righteous Salaf?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner:</strong> In the past? No.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albânî</strong>: There it is! You are now beginning to talk, after having been silent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: No, I wasn’t silent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albânî</strong>: No worries, no worries [Shaykh laughs]. That which was enough for them is thusly also enough for us.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong> What is the ruling on internet softwares and methods of communication such as WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook and other that basically consist of all sorts of things and how should we raise our children in relation to these things?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân:</strong> One should <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>stay away from them as good as one can</strong></span>. One should stay away from them and avoid them. They affect ways of thinking. They affect vigilant people who see how these matters criticize the religion and the scholars. They will affect and trouble them. One should stay away from them as good as one can.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">As for the person who has capacity, knowledge and insight and is able to differentiate between good and evil and intends to adopt the good and spread it and warn against the evil and refute it, then it is Okay and a good deed. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, it is risky and difficult to escape from unscathedly. It is in any case safer and sounder to avoid them and stay away from them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: Is it a correct method to call towards Islâm through funny lectures so that the youths can assimilate and like the call (Da’wah) and the straight path?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân</strong>: Religious matters should not be mixed with these factors. The religious matters are serious, determined, and elucidative. They should not be mixed with comedies and entertainment. This has been introduced by some people who wrongfully deem themselves to be callers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The messenger (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) did not call the people by way of these matters. He recited the Qur’ân unto them. He called them, ordered them and forbade them. He did not offer them comedies and similar tasteless matters that are used these days by those who subscribe to the Da’wah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner:</strong> As soon as a man receives more money, he thinks of polygyny. His purpose is not to build a family. His purpose is enjoyment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albânî:</strong> That is good. That is good. That is good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the gathering and the shaykh laugh)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong> Does he not fall into something?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Albânî</strong>: Do you want to say that he falls into Haram? His purpose is allowed and he does not fall into any prohibition. However, we order him to add a recommended factor to this allowed deed. We order him to increase the Ummah of Muhammad (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) so that he is rewarded more with his Lord when he raises his offspring.</p>

Translation and Video by  aFatwa.com (site is down)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#808080;">In our country the means of transport are in groups and mixed and sometimes touching some women might occur accidentally or unwillingly in result to the crowding, so are we sinful upon that? And what do we do when we don&#8217;t have any other way (in transport) and we are in need of it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn &#8216;Uthaymîn</strong>: What is obligatory upon the man is to avoid touching women meaning to crowd (women) where his body touches/attaches to their bodies even behind a barrier. As that is a call to fitna and the human is not infallible, as he could see himself to be cautious regarding these matters and not being affected by it however;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Shaytân circulates in the body of a son of Adam as his blood circulates in it</span>.&#8221; (Bukhârî).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So perhaps he makes a move that will corrupt his way. Therefore, if the human is compelled into this like a necessity that is inevitable and he is diligent knowing that he will not be affected (by the fitna) then I hope that there&#8217;s no harm upon him. However in my opinion I think that he is not forced into this an inevitable necessity as he can look for a place that is not near a woman even if he stood up . And by that he will get rid of this matter that will bring fitna. And what is an obligation is that he fears Allâh Almighty the best way he can and not belittle these matters. And we also hope from those who organize the means of transportation to make a specific place for women so men cannot reach them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen about the Arab rulers (exclusive, detailed Fatwâ)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Scholar</strong>: Imâm Muhammad bin Sâlih bin ´Uthaymîn<br />
<strong>Source:</strong> Liqâ’ al-Bâb al-Maftûh (51 B)<br />
<strong>Reference</strong>: Darulhadith.com<br />
Translation and Video by aFatwa.com (site is down)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">There is a matter it is written much about and it goes by the name “Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamâ’ah” while in fact it is the methodology of Khawârij. We would like to confirm this matter with you. It is namely about the general legislation the rulers are judged by. They argue with your Fatwas in “al-Majmû’ ath-Thamîn” and that this deed is clear disbelief since it is about Tabdîl, replacement. This opinion is also attributed to Shaykh Muhammad bin Ibrâhîm [Âl ash-Shaykh] (rahimahullâh). In order for the answer to be explicit and clear, the question goes as follows; does one take into consideration the factors that hinder from Takfîr or the Iqâmat-ul-Hujjah which Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamâ’ah put as a condition for the one who rules by a general legislation rather than the law of Allâh?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymîn:</strong> A factor that hinders from Takfîr shouldn’t exist when a person performs a disbelieving deed [I.e. if we are to do Takfîr]. It is therefore mentioned in the authentic Hadîth when the prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) was asked if they should fight against the rulers that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Except if you see clear and explicit disbelief of which you have proof from Allâh.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The disbelief has to be clear and known and it shouldn’t be possible to misunderstand it. If one can misunderstand it, then one doesn’t do Takfîr on the person who falls into it (this deed) EVEN IF THE DEED IS DISBELIEF. There is a difference between the speech and the speaker and (between) the deed and the doer. The deed can be a defiant sin without the person (whom performs it) being a defiant sinner because there is an obstacle that hinders him from being it. It can also be disbelief without the person being a disbeliever because there is an obstacle that hinders him from being is (I.e. a disbeliever).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was nothing other than this unsound misinterpretation that made the rebellion of the Khawârij harm the Islâmic Ummah. Khawârij get the idea that the deed is disbelief and (thusly) they revolt, which they said to ‘Alî bin Abî Tâlib. They were together with ‘Alî bin Abî Tâlib against the army of Shâm. After the peace treaty between ‘Alî bin Abî Tâlib and Shâm, Khawârij revolted against him after having been with him. He fought against them and killed them and all praise is due to Allâh. The point lies in the fact that they revolted against him and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“You have judged by something other than the law of Allâh. You have let the human judge.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a result thereof, they revolted against him. Thus, the catastrophe of the Ummah is because of this misinterpretation. A person can mistakenly get the idea that something is clear and explicit disbelief and revolt (due to it). It is possible that the deed really is disbelief without its doer being a disbeliever because of an obstacle (I.e. ignorance, compulsion etc). The rebel believes that this person is free from excuses and (thus) does the likes of these revolts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, a person has to make sure not to be in a hurry with making Takfîr or Tafsîq upon the humans. There is a risk that a person falls into a clear, defiant sin without knowing about it. When he finds out that it is forbidden, he thanks you (Jazâk Allâhu khayr) and leaves it. Does this exist? Yes, beyond the shadow of a doubt [it does]. How can I then judge a person to be a defiant sinner while he hasn’t received the truth?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those you accuse among the Arab and Muslim rulers can be excused. They have perhaps not received the truth. They maybe have received it while at the same time somebody made them misunderstand the matter. Thus, one has to be sensible when it comes to this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let us say that all of the conditions have been met for us to be allowed to revolt in the way that we have seen clear and explicit disbelief of which we have proof from Allâh. It is a condition to have seen it. The disbelief is a condition. That it is clear and explicit is a condition. That we have proof of it from Allâh is a condition. These are four conditions. His (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) words “except if you see…” are there so that one doesn’t fall victim to baseless rumours. It means that one should be convinced. The word “disbelief” (Kufr) is there so that one doesn’t get hung up on a defiant sin. If the ruler is a sinning alcoholic without having fallen into disbelief, then it is not allowed to revolt against him. The words “clear and explicit” mean that it is definite and that it (the Kufr) can’t be misinterpreted. The fourth is “of which you have proof from Allâh”. It should thusly not only be definite according to us. Rather, we should base ourselves on clear and definite evidence. These four conditions are the conditions for it to be allowed to revolt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there is a fifth condition for the revolt to be obligatory. Is it obligatory for us to revolt against the ruler just because it is allowed? One has to consider the advantage. Are we able to overthrow him? [If yes] then in this case we revolt. If we are unable, then we do not revolt. All religious duties are only [duties] if they are doable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, if we are able to revolt, then there is a risk that the disadvantage is greater and worse than if this leader were to keep his (position as a) leader. If we revolt against him and he wins, we become more humiliated while he becomes even worse in his transgression and disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These matters require common sense and that it is tethered with the Sharî’ah and that it isn’t led by emotions. We are in need of emotions in order to have enthusiasm and we are in need of the Sharî’ah to curb us. We have to have brakes. A car without brakes will crash and a car without power doesn’t drive.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Does it belong to the methodology of the Salaf to condemn the leaders, mention their errors and backbite them from the pulpits? How does one advise the rulers according to the methodology of the Salaf? How should it occur?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn Bâz</strong>: This question has been posed several times. It does not belong to the methodology of the Salaf to mention the shortcomings of the rulers from the pulpits. It leads to revolts and that people refrain from hearing and obeying in that which is allowed. It leads to something that only harms and benefits nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Salaf&#8217;s followed methodology is to advise him in seclusion, write to him and let the scholars contact him so that they can lead him to that which is good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sins should be mentioned without the mentioning of the sinner. Fornication, spirits and interest [all of these] should be condemned without condemning the one who falls into them. It is enough that one condemns the sins and warns against them without mentioning the sinner, regardless if he is the ruler or anybody else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the tribulation of &#8216;Uthmân&#8217;s (radhiya Allâhu &#8216;anh) time broke out, some people said to Usâmah bin Zayd (radhiya Allâhu &#8216;anh):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Will you not condemn &#8216;Uthmân?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Should I condemn him amongst the people? I will condemn him in seclusion without opening the gate of evil to the people.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When they initiated the evilness in the time of &#8216;Uthmân (radhiya Allâhu &#8216;anh) and condemned him publicly, the tribulation, battles and corruption became a fact. To this day one finds traces of all that. It led to the Fitnah between &#8216;Alî and Mu&#8217;âwiyah. &#8216;Uthmân and &#8216;Alî were killed because of it. Many companions and others were killed because of the public condemnation. As a result, the people started hating their ruler and killed him.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">Scholar: Allamah Imam Muhammad bin Salih bin Uthaymin</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"> Source: ibnothaimeen.com/all/noor/article_6493.shtml</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"> Video by: aFatwa.com (site is down)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible for the virgin woman who has no wali (guardian) or without his presence to marry herself off or not? And is there in this ruling a difference between a virgin or a previously married whether divorced or widowed?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn &#8216;Uthaymin</strong>: It is not permissible for the woman to marry herself off or others whether she is a virgin or previously married.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that is because Allâh, Glorified and Exalted, has made the contract of marriage in the hands of other than the woman as He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{<span style="color:#008000;">And do not marry polytheistic women</span>}<br />
(The Qur&#8217;ân, interpretation of the meaning 2:221)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In men He said</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{<span style="color:#008000;">And do not let marry polytheistic men</span>}<br />
(The Qur&#8217;ân, interpretation of the meaning 2:221)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and He added that the marriage is for the husband himself but with the women He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{<span style="color:#008000;">And do not let marry polytheistic men [to your women] until they believe</span>.}<br />
(The Qur&#8217;ân, interpretation of the meaning 2:221)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He made the marriage in the hands of other than the woman and He, Glorified and Exalted, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{<span style="color:#008000;">Do not prevent them from remarrying their [former] husbands if they agree among themselves on an acceptable basis</span>.}<br />
(The Qur&#8217;ân, interpretation of the meaning 2:232)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the narration of the Prophet, peace &amp; blessings of Allâh be upon him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There&#8217;s no marriage without a wali (guardian).</strong></span>&#8221; (Bukhâri)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So that is the proof of the narration that there&#8217;s no other option for the woman than with a guardian marrying her off.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As from the point of view then the woman is deficient in intellect and religion as she is limited in thinking and she is also weak in religion and I say this from the narration of the Messenger of Allâh, peace &amp; blessings of Allâh be upon him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">I have not seen anyone more deficient in intellect and religion than you. A cautious sensible man can be led astray by some of you</span>.&#8221; (Bukhâri)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the saying of Allâh Almighty:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{<span style="color:#008000;">Men are in charge of women by [right of] what Allâh has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth</span>.}<br />
(The Qur&#8217;ân, interpretation of the meaning 4:34)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if it wasn&#8217;t for the deficiency of the woman then a man would not be in charge of her but rather in the âyah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{<span style="color:#008000;">by [right of] what Allâh has given one over the other</span>}<br />
(The Qur&#8217;ân, interpretation of the meaning 4:34)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the woman was in such description, as the Qur&#8217;ân and Sunnah indicated, from deficiency of intellect and religion then she is in need of a guiding guardian who knows the appropriate/capable and knows the interests of marriage and knows who the woman is for him until he decides to marry her off or refrain (from such). This is why there should be a guardian for the woman to marry her off within the known requirements to the people of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the woman shall not marry herself off whether she is a virgin or previously married. However, there is an issue that should be noted/addressed which is that a woman must be asked for permission and consent whether she was a virgin or previously married and whether the one who marries her off is her father or anyone else. And the most correct saying is that it is not permissible for the man to marry his daughter off or anyone else until she agrees upon that husband and gives permission.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if she is a virgin then her permission is enough by being silence and if she stated/uttered to agree then that is better/complete however being silent is enough. And if she is previously married then she must state (speak) to agree and says &#8216;Yes&#8217; that she agrees to marry this man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the guardian whether it is the father or anyone else, he must describe the suitor to the woman with a description that will take her to know him (suitor). So he does not say &#8216;do you want me to marry you to such&#8217; until he clarifies to her the situation of this man and his description because as much as the man wants in a woman in beauty and righteousness, a woman wants this too in a man in beauty and righteousness. Therefore the man must clarify to the woman whose permission is sought (for marriage) in a way which takes her to know him but vagueness will not lead to the goal. Of course if the woman trusts fully her guardian and will suffice with what her guardian sees and she asked for example &#8216;are you happy/convinced with him (the suitor)&#8217; in regards to his religion and to his manners then this would suffice if she trusts him and she is pleased with what he (guardian) is pleased with.</p>

<p><strong>Shaykh Ibn &#8216;Uthaymîn:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for this government, you know that the country rules by Islâmic Sharî&#8217;ah. The judges only judge by Islâmic Sharî&#8217;ah. The fast is maintained. The pilgrimage is maintained. The lectures in the mosques are maintained. As for the one who errs or is liable to fall into a tribulation (fitnah), then both the evil and that which leads to the evil has to be prevented.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we (take a) look at our country, we neither see buildings upon the graves, Tawâf around the graves or Sûfiyyah&#8217;s and others innovations publicly. However, it is possible that some [people] possess the innovations of Sûfiyyah and the like that they keep for themselves. On the other hand, all societies have some form of corruption.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">If we consider this and compare it with other adjacent countries outside of Saudi Arabia, we see a very big difference. Alcoholic drinks (Khamr) are sold openly in the stores in some adjacent countries. The restaurants are open in daytime during Ramadhân so that one can eat and drink as much as one wants. There are prostitutes in public. Some who travel to these countries as tourists told me that one is asked as soon as one arrives at the airport:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">&#8220;There are boys and girls. What do you want?&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">This is taking place publicly.</span> One has to face the facts concerning one&#8217;s government and one&#8217;s country. He should not disseminate the bad sides that the ruler might be excused for and completely ignore the good sides. It is as if there is nothing good at all in the government. It is not fair. Allâh (ta&#8217;âlâ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ كُونُواْ قَوَّامِينَ لِلّهِ شُهَدَاء بِالْقِسْطِ وَلاَ يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شَنَآنُ قَوْمٍ عَلَى أَلاَّ تَعْدِلُواْ اعْدِلُواْ هُوَ أَقْرَبُ لِلتَّقْوَى</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; O you who believe! Stand out firmly for Allâh and be just witnesses and let not the enmity and hatred of others make you avoid justice. Be just: that is nearer to piety, and fear Allâh.&#8221; (5:8, interpretation of the meanings)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone were to ask why something like this happens, then the answer is primarily an unrestrained vigilance. It is neither curbed by the Sharî&#8217;ah nor the common sense, which is due to ignorance. Secondly, it is due to the desire. Thus, all of it is due to two things: Ignorance about the Sharî&#8217;ah or the wisdom or also the desire. Although he knows that it is wrong he (still) disseminates these things that entice the people away from the rulers and fills them with hate towards them. He does it only because he has something against the rulers and wants to vent his anger on them.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Scholar</strong>: ´Allâmah Sâlih bin Fawzân al-Fawzân<br />
<strong>Source:</strong> Cassette tape ”Aqwâl-ul-´Ulamâ’ fîl-Jihâd”<br />
<strong>Reference</strong>: Darulhadith, Sweden<br />
Translation and Video by aFatwa.com (site is down)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">After the reckless attacks, the scholars that follow the methodology of the Salaf have been slandered a lot. They are accused of coaxing the disbelievers and of being to their satisfaction. How do you advise these people who say this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân</strong>: What has this person, who slanders the scholars and accuses them of this and that, done himself? What has he done himself? What has he himself done? What has he done against the disbelievers? Or is he only talking without doing anything?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly, he is asked the question: Do you know what is means to coax? Do you know what it means to be to someone&#8217;s satisfaction? There is a difference between coaxing and pleasing someone. Does he know the difference? Or is he talking without knowledge?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thirdly, one should during these circumstances keep one&#8217;s mouth closed. One should keep the mouth closed in order not to fall into gossiping, backbiting, and splitting the Muslims. The human is obliged to keep the mouth closed. These issues have their men who take care of them; the scholars and the rulers. They are the ones who treat these issues. It is namely not these people&#8217;s concern. There are correct people who take care of them. Allâh says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;When there comes to them some matter touching (public) safety or fear, they make it known (among the people), if only they had referred it to the Messenger or to those charged with authority among them, the proper investigators would have understood it from them (directly).&#8221; </span>(The Qur&#8217;ân 4:83, interpretation of the meanings)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Not everyone is able to delve into these matters. These matters are for those charged with authority and they are the scholars and the rulers. This is their responsibility and we are obliged to advise them and pray for them that they get success in what they are doing and that they firmly remain established upon the truth. We have nevertheless no right to sit in our meetings and backbite this one, slander that one and insult the third. This is pure evil. There is no good in it. It is pure evil. All it leads to is the splitting of the Muslims and that one gets evil thoughts about the scholars and the rulers. And in the end, there&#8217;s just more tribulations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory to understand these matters. These issues are not a big mess. Religious issues have rules and principles. They have their sources. If you have some knowledge or something to clarify, then you should go to those responsible or write them a letter. However, that you should speak in sittings, this is considered to be disallowed. It leads to tribulations and evilness. You are talking with ignorant people who do not understand anything. You thereafter incite them against their brothers and rulers. Where is the benefit in this? If you have some knowledge or something to say, then you should go to the rulers. The prophet (sallâ Allâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The religion is an advice.&#8221; They (the companions) said: &#8220;To whom, O messenger of Allâh?&#8221; He said: &#8220;To Allâh, His book, His messenger, the leaders and laymen of the Muslims.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Nasîhah means that you advise, not that you disparage people and accuse them of coaxing and that they are to other&#8217;s satisfaction. It is worse than what you are afraid of.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='500' height='333' src='https://video.wordpress.com/embed/YQ1z4tUG?hd=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;loop=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata&amp;muted=0&amp;playsinline=0&amp;controls=1&amp;cover=1' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen  allow='clipboard-write' ></iframe><script src='https://v0.wordpress.com/js/next/videopress-iframe.js?m=1739540970'></script></p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">People who subscribe to knowledge and especially young students look down upon Fiqh-matters and especially the books of the Madhâhib. Their argument is that they do not consist of evidence. They even look down upon the Ijtihâd of the Imams in this matter. What do you advise in terms of this and the respect for the Imams of the Madhâhib and the importance of the Madhâhib. There are people today who look down upon them, criticize them and say that they are freed from the Madhâhib and that they take directly from the Qur’ân and Sunnah.</span></p>
<p><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a deviation. We have said that and clarified it. We said that the one who fulfils the conditions of Ijtihâd does Ijtihâd. He is not allowed to follow blindly. THESE ARE HOWEVER FEW TODAY, IF THEY EVEN EXIST. The more time passes, the more the knowledge disappears. The prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allâh does not seize this knowledge by pulling it out from the chests of men. It is seized by the death of the scholars. When there then are no scholar left, the people take the ignorant as leaders who in turn will answer without knowledge and go astray and lead others astray.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The more time passes, the more the knowledge disappears. It has also been reported that by the end of time, few scholars will exist and many readers [will exist]. Many readers who lack understanding will exist.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is wrong to ignore the Fiqh-books. Fiqh is the richness of this Ummah. It is a great richness. However, that does not mean that we take everything that is in them to heart. We filter (I.e. right from mistakes). The one who has the capacity filters. He takes that which is strongest according to the evidence. We said that there are four types of people; an absolute Mujtahid, a Mujtahid within his Madhhab who considers what opinion is the correct one, one who follows blindly and a layman. This fiqh is, as said, a great richness in the hands of the scholars. They study it and take help from it in order to understand the Qur’ân and Sunnah. They take its verdicts and the statements of the Imams that agree with the evidence and leave that which contradicts the evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who ignores it and says that they shall do a new Ijtihâd… Who is the one who is to make a new Ijtihâd? There is none! It is a deviation. Are you who say that you shall make a new Ijtihâd as the four Imams? Such as Imâm Ahmad and Imâm Mâlik? What does this mean? I wish that they existed. But you don’t have more than the smallest who follows blindly. You have nothing to come with. Don’t destroy yourself. Don’t destroy others. Fear Allâh! It is allowed to blindly follow in necessity. Allâh (ta’âlâ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">فَاسْأَلُواْ أَهْلَ الذِّكْرِ إِن كُنتُمْ لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">“So ask the people of the message if you do not know.” (16:43)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a blind following in necessity. It is OBLIGATORY to blindly follow in necessity. It is prohibited to blindly follow in the case of capability. <strong>It is forbidden for the one who is able to make Ijtihâd to blindly follow.</strong> In necessity, it is obligatory to blindly follow. It is not fully prohibited to blindly follow and neither is it fully allowed to blindly follow. The matter is thusly detailed. We do not say that you should take to heart everything that exists in Fiqh. We say that you should filter and follow that which is based on evidence. They are after all more knowledgeable than you about proving and the extraction of rulings. You have nothing to come with. You should rely on them and the words of the Fuqahâ’ and look to their evidence. If you are able to consider, do so. If you are not able to, you follow that which is (written) there even if you do not know of the evidence. For this is a necessity. This has to be understood. There are people who fight the Madhâhib today. Where should the people go? Should they deviate? There is one who has authored a book by the name “Islâm without Madhâhib”. What without Madhâhib? Where should the people go then? Should they go to the ignoramuses? This is a great problem.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Scholar:</strong> ´Allâmah Sâlih bin Fawzân al-Fawzân<br />
<strong>Lecture:</strong> Ta’sîl-ul-Intimâ’ wal-Muwâtanah ash-Shar´iyyah<br />
<strong>Source:</strong> alfawzan.ws/allmohadrat?page=1<br />
<strong>Reference:</strong> Darulhadith.com<br />
<strong>Translation &amp; video:</strong> aFatwa.com (site is down)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân:</strong> It is obligatory upon the Muslims to respect the governmental facilities and to take care of them and make sure that they develop. What should then be said about devastating facilities and to blow them up and the likes? Not even the mosques are safe from them anymore. They blow them up and throw bombs into them. They kill the people in their mosques. They blow up their buildings and facilities. In addition, they claim that it is from Jihâd for Allâh’s sake and that they are Mujâhidûn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One has to be aware of this and alert those who are deceived by these and think that this really is from Jihâd and that the deed is noble [while it absolutely is not]. The deed is in fact a destruction and Allâh does not love those who spread corruption. This is from spreading corruption upon the earth and Allâh does not love those who spread corruption.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Morover, innocent people are killed. People whom Allâh has forbidden to kill without due right. They commit sins and they may even kill themselves. They blow themselves up and say that it is martyrdom. How can a self-killer be a martyr when the messenger (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said that he is in the Fire? Allâh (jalla wa ‘alâ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Do not kill yourselves [or one another]. Indeed, Allah is to you ever Merciful. And whoever does that in aggression and injustice – then We will drive him into a Fire. And that, for Allah , is [always] easy.”</span> (4:29-30)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said in the authentic Hadîth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“The one who kills himself with poison will have it in his hand and drink it slowly and swallow it in hell. The one who kills himself with an iron will have the iron in the hand and stab himself with it in hell. The one who kills himself by throwing himself down a mountain will be thrown down into hell.”</span> (Muslim 175)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A self-killer has done a Kabîrah (great sin). How can he be a martyr? How can one say that he is going to paradise when the prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said that he is going to the Fire? Allâh allowed martyrdom to be reached if one dies for His sake. THEY (MARTYRS) ARE KILLED. They were killed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And never think of those who have been killed in the cause of Allah as dead.”</span> (3:169)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And do not say about those who are killed in the way of Allah , “They are dead.” Rather, they are alive”</span> (2:154)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the one who dies in Jihâd under the banner of the Muslims who is a martyr. The one who is killed by the enemy. As for the person who takes his own life, he has done a great sin and risks ending up in the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) was asked about the person who fights with vigilance, courage and so on and who from among them fights for Allah’s sake, he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“The one who fights so that the word of Allâh shall be the highest fights for Allâh’s sake.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The matter should be referred to the word of Allâh and His messenger (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and not to deviant destroyers who brainwash people and give them these foul opinions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That they destroy the administrations and facilities of the country and even the mosques goes to show that they have nothing to do with Jihâd for Allâh’s sake.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one risks being cursed for having urinated on the road or in the shadow of a tree, one may ask how the matter is if one blows up buildings with people in them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These people are obliged to repent before Allâh (‘azza wa jall) and to see the difference between friend and enemy and to learn beneficial knowledge by which Allâh guides them with to the straight way. They should not take knowledge from misleading people.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Some brothers limit their speech by; ‘good morning…good evening’ instead of ‘assalâmu alaykum wa rahmatu Allâh wa barakâtuh’ ie the greeting of Islâm. So is there any advice concerning this?</span></p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Ibn Bâz:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yes, that is not permitted. What is obligatory is to start with the ‘Salâm’. ‘Assalâmu alaykum. You do not say ‘good morning’ and ‘good evening’ but rather say: ‘Assalâmu alaykum. And if he said; ‘wa rahmatu Allâh wa barakatuh’ is better and perfect/complete.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Thereafter (after starting with the Salaam) he may says; ‘Good morning’, ‘may Allâh give you a good morning’, ‘may Allâh give you a good evening’, ‘how are you’, ‘how are your children’, ‘how is your family’, (this is) a good added greeting. However he starts by saying; ‘Assalâmu alaykum and that is the minimum. And if he added ‘wa rahmatu Allâh wa barakâtuh’ then that is better.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is how the Prophet (peace &amp; blessings of Allâh be upon him) was with his companions. One time a man came in (joined them) and said: “Assalâmu ‘alaykum (peace be upon you).” The Prophet said, “[He will have] ten hasanât (rewards).” Another man passed by and said “Assalâmu ‘alaykum wa rahmatu Allâh.” The Prophet, “[He will have] twenty hasanât.” Another man passed by and said “Assalâmu ‘alaykum wa rahmatu Allâhi wa barakâtuh.” The Prophet, “[He will have] thirty hasanât.” [Bukhâri]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is the virtue of that point of view.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Scholar</strong>: Imâm Muhammad bin Sâlih bin ´Uthaymîn<br />
<strong>Source</strong>: Liqâ’ al-Bâb al-Maftûh (212 B)<br />
<strong>Date:</strong> 1420-03-24/1999-07-07<br />
<strong>Reference:</strong> Darulhadith.com<br />
<strong>Translation &amp; video:</strong> aFatwa.com (site is down)</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling on Jihâd today? Is it obligatory for some Muslims or for all? When is it obligatory for the entire Ummah if it only is obligatory for some Muslims?</span></p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymîn:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Firstly, you have to know that Jihâd is <strong>not</strong> obligatory for all Muslims. This is impossible. Allâh (ta’âlâ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“And it is not for the believers to go forth [to battle] all at once. For there should separate from every division of them a group [remaining] to obtain understanding in the religion and warn their people when they return to them that they might be cautious.”</em></span> (9:122)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If all were to have gone out in Jihâd, the rest of the prescriptions and rituals would have ended. However, it can become Fardh ‘Ayn (obligatory for all Muslims) in the following cases:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1 &#8211;</strong> On the frontline. If one comes here, one should accomplish the war.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh (ta’âlâ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who have believed, when you meet those who disbelieve advancing [for battle], do not turn to them your backs [in flight]. And whoever turns his back to them on such a day, unless swerving [as a strategy] for war or joining [another] company, has certainly returned with anger [upon him] from Allah , and his refuge is Hell – and wretched is the destination.”</span></em> (8:15-16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2 &#8211;</strong> When the enemy attacks one’s country. Here it becomes obligatory to fight to defend oneself and one’s Islamic country.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3 &#8211;</strong> When the <strong>LEADER</strong> orders him to go out in Jihâd. Write the word “<strong>LEADER</strong>” with capital letters. It means that one has to have a leader who leads the Islamic army. When the <strong>LEADER</strong> orders him to go out in Jihâd, he has to go out. When he orders a country’s population to go out in Jihâd, they have to do it. For it is forbidden to be disobedient towards the rulers. When they are told to do it, they become obliged to fulfill it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4 &#8211;</strong> When there is a need of the person. An example of that is that a person is a loner in knowing how a specific weapon is to be managed. In this case, it becomes obligatory for him to fight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for what is beyond these four situations, it is not obligatory for all Muslims to fight. Thereto, JIHÂD MUST BE UNDER THE LEAD OF A LEADER. OTHERWISE, A GUERRILLA WAR WOULD HAPPEN. THERE HAS TO BE A LEADER WHO IS LEADING THE ISLAMIC UMMAH. YOU THEREFORE SEE THAT IT DOES NOT GO WELL FOR THOSE WHO GO OUT IN JIHÂD WITHOUT THE LEADERSHIP OF A LEADER. There is a risk that they even attack each other. If they were to triumph, they begin to fight each other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allâh that He helps us strive against ourselves. We have to strive against ourselves at the moment. Hearts are sick. The limbs are deficient. Hearts fight against each other. It is firstly this that is in need of Jihâd.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Scholar</strong>: Imâm Muhammad bin Sâlih bin ´Uthaymîn<br />
<strong>Source</strong>: islamcast.wordpress.com/2009/03/29<br />
<strong>Reference</strong>: Darulhadith.com<br />
<strong>Translation &amp; video:</strong> aFatwa.com</p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymîn:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I warn my Muslim brothers against what some stupid people do when they narrate april jokes. This lie have they taken from the jews, the christians, fire-worshipers (Majûs) and other disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Not only is this act a lie, which is in itself forbidden according to the Sharî’ah, it also involves imitating the disbelievers, which is forbidden. The prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whoever imitates a people belongs to them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh-ul-Islâm Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullâh) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“Its chain of narration is good.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The least one could say is that it is forbidden, even if it seemingly entails disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Together with these two sins, the Muslim becomes humiliated before his enemy. It is generally known that the one who is imitated boasts before the imitator and sees himself as being in front of him. The imitator thus becomes weak so that he imitates him. The believer thusly becomes degraded since he subjugates himself and follows the disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth sin is that this filthy lie is often about taking someone else’s money unjustly and scaring the Muslims. They maybe lie and tell the family that they will be having guests. As a result thereof they prepare a great meal and meat and the like. They might also lie and tell them horrifying news of a relative being run over by a car or the like. This is not allowed.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: &#8220;Is the earth round or flat?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albaani</strong>: It is round,[1] and the issue of the earth being round or flat is not an affair related to actions nor faith, such that it is obligatory for the Muslim to know the Islamically legislated ruling about it if it is related to actions in order to worship Allaah by it like the rest of the acts of worship, or for him to believe in it in the depth of his heart and soul if it is a belief that every Muslim is commanded to believe in. Rather, it is an issue that can be understood upon two (different) ways from the explanation of some aayaat in the noble Qur&#8217;aan. And no doubt &#8212; as is the case with most issues &#8212; one of the views will be correct and the other will be wrong. Thus, whoever makes ijtihaad[2] while he is qualified to do so &#8212; and the first condition for this qualification is knowledge of the Arabic language &#8212; then whether he is right or wrong, as (the questioner) himself knows, whoever is right has two rewards and whoever errs has one reward.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And these aayaat that have come with regard to the earth, about whether it is moving, round or whether it is stationary &#8212; there isn&#8217;t a decisive text that would support either of the two different views. Therefore, we said that this is not an affair related to belief about which there must be a united opinion as we believe to the case with the &#8216;aqeedah (belief) of the salaf (righteous predecessors). It could be understood from some of the aayaat from the noble Qur&#8217;aan related to this subject that the earth is stationary and flat, and it could be understood from some other (aayaat) that it is moving and orbiting. And this (latter) opinion is that which carries more weight in our view and agrees with the natural reality which every individual from the people perceives (to be true), whether he is a Muslim or a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is sufficient for us to know that there isn&#8217;t a decisive proof about this issue with those who insist on opposing that which is established scientifically today: that the earth moves and that it orbits around the sun. It is sufficient, for knowing that there isn&#8217;t a clear text contradicting this idea or this astronomical view, that many of the Muslim scholars whose knowledge and excellence all of the Muslims acknowledge &#8212; especially us Salafis[4] who believe in the leadership of Shaykh ul-Islaam ibn Taimiyyah in knowledge of the Book and the Sunnah, and Ibn Qayyim az-Jawziyyah, let alone other than them &#8212; used to believe the opposite of what is being spread now based on some apparent indications of the Qur&#8217;aan, such as the aayah {And the mountains He has fixed firmly}[5] for example, {And after that He spread the earth}[6] and similar aayaat. They did not understand (and deduce) this opposing rigid opinion from (these aayaat), firstly due to the apparent indications of other (Qur&#8217;aanic) texts, and secondly due to astronomical, scientific fact. And the like of the aayah that describes the mountains with respect to the earth to be like anchors with respect to ships does not necessitate linguistically that the earth does not move at all, but rather it negates a disordered movement.[7] And similar to this aayah is the aayah: {And the mountains [We have made] as pegs},[8] because we know by observation that the peg with respect to the animal does not prevent it from moving [i.e, when you tie the animal to the peg], but rather the peg prevents it from moving chaotically such that it would flee and go off however it wants &#8212; no, our Lord has arranged the orbiting of the earth like the circulating of the horse around the peg. Hence, Him making the mountains as pegs is contrary to what they claim; it (actually) confirms the movement of the earth, but it confirms a scientific movement that is well-known today to be organized and very precise throughout the year such that it does not change by a single second. Likewise, the anchors don&#8217;t prevent the ship from moving.</p>

Scholar: Imâm Muhammad bin Sâlih bin ´Uthaymîn<br />
Source: Liqâ&#8217; al-Bâb al-Maftûh (66 A)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn &#8216;Uthaymîn:</strong> From the fear of Allâh (subhânahu wa ta&#8217;âlâ) is that one puts great importance on guiding the creation by spreading true knowledge from the Book of Allâh and the Sunnah of His messenger (sallâ Allâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and to explain for them the way of the companions and their righteous followers and instruct them to what the prophet (sallâ Allâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) instructed to when he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;From the good Islam of a person is leaving alone that which does not concern him&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(at-Tirmidhî (2318).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you see a person returning [heading] towards Allâh (&#8216;azza wa jall) and busying himself with that which concerns him and only cares about coming closer to Allâh, then you should know that it is from his good islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you see a person caring about insignificant matters of no concern to him and that his time often goes to gossip and a lot of questions, then you should know that it is from his deficient islam. Thus, the prophet (sallâ Allâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) forbade gossip and a lot of questions. It is time wasting. It is wastage of time. If a person becomes inflicted by this disease, he will waste his time. He first asks a person regarding what has happened and what this and that one has said. He thereafter goes to the next person and asks the same thing and so on and so forth. That is how he wastes his time and other&#8217;s time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, were he only to care about that which concerns him&#8230; It is okay to ask about what has happened and what is happening in the society if there is a need to ask and if the purpose is to treat and eradicate the problem. The purpose should not be to slander others and cause splitting. There are people who are like that today. Some people have a good intention. But this impoverished person (Miskîn) got this disease, namely to only care about gossip and what this and that individual has said and what this and that group has said. He does not ask in order to treat the disease and eradicate the splitting. He asks in order to slander or to be as the children who say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;You are either with these or with those!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We only know of this grouping and this partisanship from the children. That is why I advise you to entirely avoid this matter. It entails no benefit. It only wastes time. The messenger (sallâ Allâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) forbade that money and time should be wasted with gossip and a lot of questions.</p>

<strong>Date:</strong> 1427-11-19/2006-12-10<br />
<strong>Reference</strong>: Darulhadith.com<br />
<strong>Translation &amp; video</strong>: aFatwa.com (site no more exists)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Reciter: </strong>Imâm al-Barbahârî said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Bear in mind that all whims are evil. They all call to the sword.” </span><em>(Sharh-us-Sunnah 147)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân:</strong> They call to the sword, that is, to the tribulation. The civil wars and splitting has only been caused by Ahl-ul-Ahwâ’ such as Mu’tazilah, Khawârij and others from among Ahl-ul-Ahwâ’. They are the ones who are responsible for the tribulations; Mu’tazilah, Khawârij, Rawâfidh and others. The tribulations have only been caused by them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who killed ‘Uthmân (radhiya Allâhu ‘anh)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who killed ‘Alî bin Abî Tâlib (radhiya Allâhu ‘anh)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who caused the tribulations between the Muslims after that if not these Ahl-ul-Ahwâ’?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who was it that got al-Ma’mûn and his successors to put Ahl-us-Sunmnah on trial so that they even dragged their Imâm Ahmad bin Hanbal (rahimahullâh), beat him and imprisoned him if not Ahl-ul-Ahwâ’?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who was it that imprisoned Shaykh-ul-Islâm Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullâh) so that he died in the prison if not these Ahl-ul-Ahwâ’?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are obliged to beware of these people. Their evil leads to the splitting of the Muslims, rebellion against the Muslim ruler and that the Muslims scatter into sects and groups instead of being one single nation (Ummah).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzaan (hafidahullâh) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is due to Allâh and may the blessings and peace be upon our prophet Muhammad and all of his family and companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In these two blessed Friday sermons, we have heard a lot of good by our preacher (Khatîb) –may Allâh grant him success. He spoke on one of the most serious issues, namely the issue of women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers! Allâh (subhânahu wa ta’âlâ) created the woman, just as the man, for a great duty in this life. Each got their (own) task. The men got their tasks and the women got their tasks. If each stick to their own task and fulfill it, the society would attain a great deal of good. If this order were to be shaken, a great deficiency would occur, just as you heard about the role of the woman in the pre-Islamic time of ignorance, as well as her role in the disbelieving countries of today and her role with the religious Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The woman is very important and that is why the prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) ordered that she is well taken care of. He said in his Kutbah (sermon) on ‘Arafah in connection to his farewell pilgrimage:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Treat your women well, for they are captives with you.”</span></em> (Ibn Mâjah 1851)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) ordered us to take good care of the women because they play an important role in the society. It’s not only about taking good care of them and giving them their due rights… this is obligatory, what is more important is to protect them from indecencies – the woman is weak as you know – and [to protect them from] trying appearances [i.e. fitnah] and letting them do whatever they want to do. This is the most important thing the prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) ordered [in regards to women], namely that we protect them. Allâh (jalla wa ‘alâ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">الرِّجَالُ قَوَّامُونَ عَلَى النِّسَاء بِمَا فَضَّلَ اللّهُ بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ وَبِمَا أَنفَقُواْ مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ فَالصَّالِحَاتُ قَانِتَاتٌ حَافِظَاتٌ لِّلْغَيْبِ بِمَا حَفِظَ اللّهُ</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Men are in charge of women, because Allâh has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to Allâh and to their husbands), and guard in the husband’s absence what Allâh orders them to guard (e.g. their chastity, their husband’s property, etc.).”</span> </em>(The Qur’ân 4:34)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What does it mean that the man is in charge of the woman? Is it only about providing (for her) and justice? It is not only about that. His responsibility is (also) about something that is more important. He should namely protect this woman so that she doesn’t lose it, frees herself and [begins to] take shyness and chastity lightly. This is the greatest responsibility of the man in regards to the woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The “man” in the verse is not only referring to the husband. The man, whether it be her father, brother or some other guardian, is responsible for her and protects her. If it were to go to the length of him having to punish her, he then does it<strong><sup>1</sup>:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">وَاللاَّتِي تَخَافُونَ نُشُوزَهُنَّ فَعِظُوهُنَّ وَاهْجُرُوهُنَّ فِي الْمَضَاجِعِ وَاضْرِبُوهُنَّ</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance – [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them.”</span></em> (The Qur’ân 4:34, interpretation of the meanings)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The woman is thus in need of being under observation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The enemies of Islam of these days concentrate on the issue of women. They know that she is the most serious matter in the society. They focus on her. They wage war against the chastity and honour and consider it to be oppression against women. If the woman sticks to chastity and honour, they say that she is deprived of liberty. The fact of the matter is that it is just at that time her freedom (liberty) is preserved (i.e. when she sticks to chastity and honour). She can feely obey Allâh, raise her children and fulfill that which Allâh has given her as a responsibility. She is as a shepherdess in the home of her husband and (is) responsible for her flock. This is her true freedom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for her freedom in nudity, indecencies in front of other people, flirtatious gait in the stores/shops and the ability to go wherever she wants to, then this is a type of slavery and not a freedom. It’s slavery to temptation and satan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O servants of Allâh! Freedom lies in obeying and worshiping Allâh. Therein lies the glory of the soul and the honour of the human and their happiness in this life and the next one. The one who acts disobediently towards Allâh and his commands, whether it is about women or anything else, is one of the degraded slaves of the devils among the humans and the Jinns. It is slavery and not freedom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have to know this! We have to preserve our women among the wives, daughters and relatives. We have to cooperate in protecting them and to refrain from listening to this propaganda [by the Kuffâr in west]. The Kuffâr (disbelievers) are trying to eradicate Islam by all possible means. The greatest ways of destruction is to destroy the woman. Because the woman is the basis of the family and the home. If she is destroyed, the home and the family is destroyed as well. The daughters will be destroyed after having copied their destroyed mothers and relatives. Thus, we have to safeguard our women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even If the Kuffâr have been successful in degrading some Islamic countries, they will never – by the will and motion of Allâh – succeed in doing the same thing with this county, which is the country of the two holy mosques in which the revelation was sent down to and in which the messenger (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) was sent. Herein are men who take care of her honour, even if some deluded men and women take this issue lightly. This country has men who safeguard their honour and the honour of their female relatives. You belong to them – in sha’ Allâh – and (those) who will initiate it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have to fear Allâh (subhânahu wa ta’âlâ) and live up to this great responsibility. If we do it, we’ll protect our homes, children, families and societies. She is thusly the basis. Thus, the enemy focuses on her. They are focused on the woman. They got her in a specific focus you are familiar with; in books, papers, magazines, newspapers, media, internet, and all other (possible) fields. They want this country to end up as the other countries so that the manners disappear and the honour gets lost. It will then become easy for the Kuffar (disbelievers) to eradicate Islam from its basis. The poet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">‘The nations exist as long as their manners exist, when their manners vanish, so do they.’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the manners disappear, then there is nothing left. The purpose of the manners is the honour, behavior, shyness and dignity. This is what the manners are (ahlâq). Another poet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>‘I do not say that one should allow the women to show their faces as the men and to walk around in the shops, they have a lot of duties in their homes as the man who is the possessor of the sword and the spear.’</em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The woman has her line of work and the man has his. If each of them does their suitable works, the society will then be good and the welfare will be complete. But if this order were to be shaken, the society would then become deficient. That is why the prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) <strong>cursed the masculine women and the feminine men</strong>. All of this just to preserve the woman and allow her to stay in her natural nature, religion, character and honour. The glory and honour should be protected and preserved. Read the chapter “an-Nûr” (of the Qur’ân). You will find therein how greatly and notably the women are protected with covering and permission before one enters into the homes. The same goes for the Sunnah. The prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) forbade the woman from travelling alone without a Mahram and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“It is not allowed for a woman who believes in Allâh and the Last day to travel without a Mahram.” </span></em><br />
(al-Bukhari [3006] and Muslim [1341])</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He forbade that she is alone in private with a man who’s not her Mahram and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“A man is not alone with a woman but that the Shaytân makes a third.” </span></em>(at-Tirmidhi 1171)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He forbade the women from mixing with the men. That is why the women prayed with the Muslims behind the messenger of Allâh (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and behind the men in the mosque of the messenger of Allâh (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam). They were so covered that no one could recognize them. They prayed behind the men. Herein is a proof that mixing is prohibited between both of the sexes. <span style="color:#ff0000;">If a woman is not allowed to mix with men in the mosque, which is a place of worship and piousness, one can then ask how she would be allowed to mix with them in offices, amusement parks, parties, and markets</span>. This matter is very serious. We’re surrounded by the enemy now and an <strong>ideological warfare</strong>. You are well aware of the ideological warfare that is taking place now. The Kuffar (disbelievers) are waging war against the Muslim countries with weapons, ideologies and all other means. We are, as I said before, surrounded by the enemy. We have to be observant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we are with Allâh, Allâh is with us. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">لَا تَخَافَا إِنَّنِي مَعَكُمَا أَسْمَعُ وَأَرَى</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“He (Allâh) said: “Fear not, verily! I am with you both, hearing and seeing.”</em></span> (The Qur’ân 20:46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we are with Allâh, Allâh is then with us. And if Allâh is with us, nobody can hurt us:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">لاَ تَحْزَنْ إِنَّ اللّهَ مَعَنَا</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Be not sad (or afraid), surely Allâh is with us.”</span></em> (The Qur’ân 9:40, interpretation of the meanings)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But who is Allâh with? Allâh is especially with the pious, those who do the right and the believers. We thusly have to be with Allâh (subhânahu wa ta’âlâ). The prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said to Ibn ‘Abbâs [what means]:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Boy! Take care of Allâh and He will take care of you. Take care of Allâh and you will find Him in front of you.”</span></em><br />
(at-Tirmidhî 2516)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have to, as I said before, be with Allâh, obey Him and follow His commands and avoid His prohibitions for Him (subhânahu wa ta’âlâ) to be with us with His victory, His support and His help.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allâh for forgiveness and I repent before Him. And I ask Allâh to preserve us and you with His preservation and that He looks after us and you with His victory and help. And may the blessings and peace be upon our prophet Muhammad and all of his family and companions</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The wife hates that her husband should marry with another woman even though she knows that Allâh has prescribed it and allowed it. Is she now considered to hate something Allâh has prescribed?</span></p>
<p><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This question has been posed several times. It is a natural hate, not a religious such. She is not hating that which Allâh has revealed. She is a believer and a Muslim. This is part of the female jealousy. This is the jealousy among the women. It is only part of the natural hate. It is not a hate towards that which Allâh has prescribed. It is only a hate towards the co-wife.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">When a person makes ablution after having answered the call of nature, he feels a drop leave his private-part. What should he do?</span></p>
<p><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those are obsessive thoughts. After having answered the call of nature, he washes or dries and washes himself. He thereafter makes ablution and prays without paying attention to the obsessive thoughts and whether a drop has come out or not. Those are obsessive thoughts one should not care about.</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Question</strong></span>:<strong> Does the one who says that the Qur&#8217;ân is created apostate?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Shaykh al-Khudhayr</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Salaf did Takfîr upon the one who says that the speech of Allâh is created. This however, is Takfîr upon a kind and not upon an individual. It is for example not said that az-Zamakhsharî was a disbeliever because of him being a Mu&#8217;tazilî and Mu&#8217;tazilah say that the Qur&#8217;ân is created. The opinion [that it is created] is nevertheless disbelief. There is a difference between Takfîr upon a kind and attribute and [the Takfîr] upon an individual. To make Takfîr upon an individual, it is required that the conditions are met while the obstacles are removed.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: What is the ruling regarding women&#8217;s sports?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn Bâz</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It varies. It is permissible if it occurs only among women in a way that does not contradict the Sharî&#8217;ah. An example of it is running in a place that is separate for women and [a place] that men can&#8217;t visit. Another example is swimming in their houses or in swimming pools where no men can visit. If the men neither can see them or come in contact with them, the deed [would then be] allowed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if the deed is practiced by both men and women together or that the men see the women or that there are factors that harm the Muslims, the deed would then not be considered as allowed. Thus, this matter is detailed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is namely allowed if the deed is specific for women and no sins occur while it does not occur mixedly with men such that the place is hidden and distant from the men. This is concerning running, swimming and other competitions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p style="text-align:center;">(<strong>Continuation on Wiswas</strong>, obsessive thoughts, whispers of satan)</p>
</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Salamu &#8216;alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh. I decided to continue on the issue of <strong>Wiswas</strong> and I hope you have benefited as I have benefited. Barak Allahu fikum, if you know someone who&#8217;s affected by this, then please forward it to him/her, let the present convey to the absent. I decided to pick out benefits that are very interesting from a book that was written by Ibn-ul-Qayyim (rahimahullâh) so enjoy, benefit and forward to others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit 1: <em>They rejected the Sunnah of the prophet</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn Qayyim:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;They rejected the Sunnah of the prophet (salla Allahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), to the extent that someone thought that if he performed ablution in the manner of the prophet (salla Allahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and washed like him, he would still not be able to cleanse himself properly. The prophet (salla Allahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) used to perform Wudhu&#8217; (ablution) with a quarter of Syrian Ratl (I.e. Syrian measure equal to 3.202kh [3.202 litres of water]), and washed his body with one ratl and a quarter. A person who is under the influence of the devil&#8217;s inspiration would see that measure as not even enough to wash his hands.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Waswasah: The whispering of the Shaitan, english, p. 18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit 2: &#8220;This is not enough for two people to wash properly!&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn Qayyim:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It was also reported that the prophet (salla Allahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) used to perform Ghusl (the major ritual ablution of the whole body) with &#8216;Aishah (radhiya Allahu &#8216;anha) using just one large bowl, in which some traces of dough remained. If the person, under the influence of Satan, heard of someone doing likewise, he would object to him, saying &#8220;This is not enough for two people to wash properly!&#8221;.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Ibid, p. 19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit 3: A knowledgeable person</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imâm Ahmad (may Allah bless him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;A knowledgeable person should only use a small quantity of water.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Ibid, p. 20)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit 4: The person under the influence of Satan&#8217;s whisperings would not agree</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn Qayyim:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When the prophet (salla Allahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) performed ablution or washed all his body, he used to put his hand inside the container to get water; he would rinse his mouth and wash his nose. The person under the influence of Satan&#8217;s whisperings would not agree; he would most likely consider that water as impure, and would never share one container with his wife! He would feel disgust at the thought of it, the way the disbeliever feels when Allah&#8217;s Name is mentioned.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Ibid, p. 20)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit 5: Excessiveness in religion (Beware!)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbas (radhiya Allahu anh) said &#8220;In the morning of al-Aqabah, the prophet (salla Allahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said to me, while he (salla Allahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) was mounting his camel: &#8216;Pick up some stones for me&#8217;. So I collected seven stones for him. He then started shaking them in his hand and said: &#8216;Such people (who exceed the boundaries of Allah), you should aim at.&#8217; Then he (salla Allahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8216;O people, beware of excessiveness in religion; for people before you were destroyed by their excesses in religion.&#8221; (Recorded by Ahmad and an-Nassai.) (Ibid, p. 26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Barak Allahu fikum, that&#8217;s it for now, to be continued.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Did you break wind or was it Shaytân pulling a hair?<br />
Also, how to prevent any waswasah in regards to urine-drops</span></strong></span></p>
</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Gasses during prayer or Shaytan pulling a hair from your back?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sa&#8217;id al-Khudri (radhiya Allahu &#8216;anh) reported that the prophet (salla Allahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8220;The devil may approach one of you during Salah, and pull a hair from your back. <strong>If the man were to imagine that his ablution had been broken</strong>, <span style="color:#ff6600;"><strong>he should not leave his prayer</strong></span>, unless he should hear a sound or perceive a smell.&#8221; (Recorded by Abu Dawud)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Waswasah: The whispering of the Shaitan, p. 44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What to do in order to prevent any Waswasah in regards to urine drops after answering the call of nature?:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Abu Muhammad bin Qudamah al-Maqdisi said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It is recommended to sprinkle one&#8217;s private part and trousers with water after urinating (in the toilet), in order to prevent any waswasah. And so, if one finds any wetness in his clothing, he would say: &#8220;This is the water that I sprinkled there.&#8221; al-Hakam bin Sufyan at-Thaqafi (radhiya Allahu &#8216;anh) reported that when the prophet (salla Allahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) urinated, he performed ablution and sprinkled water on his private parts.&#8221; (Recorded by Abu Dawud)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Ibid, p. 44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These two gems are great reliefs for those who are affected by the whispers of Shaytân. You will see them remaking Wudhu&#8217; and prayers for several hours and in the end they even imagine that they have the disease of a 60 year old man, while just a month or two ago before they started to pray, they were totally healthy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh-ul-Islâm Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullâh, d. 728) wrote in “Kitâb-ul-Îmân”:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The believer is put to trial by the whisperings of the Devil and disbelieving thoughts that makes him feel bad/distress. The companions used to say: &#8220;Oh Messenger of Allâh! o­ne of us feels something of such a nature that he would rather fall down from the heaven than to utter it.&#8221; He (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam): &#8220;That is true faith&#8221; (Ahmad 2/397 and Muslim 1/83)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that these whispers and thoughts one feels, while one hates them and repels them from the heart, is part of true faith. This can be likened to the warrior who fights his enemy until he overpowers him. <strong>This is the greatest type of Jihâd and a faith that is as pure as pure milk</strong>. And the reason as to why it is pure, is that one hates and fights the devilish thoughts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All creatures are subjected to these thoughts and whisperings. There are those humans that answer them and they then become disbelievers or hypocrites. And there are those whom have fallen so deeply into sins and desires, that they are first affected by these thoughts when they start to seek the religion. So the person either becomes a believer or a hypocrite. Thus, the humans often tend to get these whispers when they perform the prayer. The Devil will most often come when the servant wants to turn to his Lord and come closer to Him and have contact with Him. That is why the praying ones get thoughts that the non-praying ones do not.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">Here are some Fawa&#8217;id about the obsessive thoughts that some brothers/sisters might get when trying to perform acts of worship. I hope they make things easier for you in Shâ&#8217; Allâh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>1.</strong><strong>The intention:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn-ul-Qayyim:</strong> The one who sits down in order to make ablution, has intended the ablution (!!!). The one who arises in order to pray, has intended the prayer. The sensible one hardly performs an act of worship but that he has already intended it. The fact is that if Allah had obliged us an act without intention, then it would have been impossible. (al-Islah, p. 67)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn-ul-Qayyim</strong>: To doubt the intention of one’s action is a type of madness. (Ibid, p.67)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>2. The verbal intention.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn-ul-Qayyim:</strong> The devil has made the verbal intention into a battlefield for those with whispters (wiswas). He imprisons them by it and punishes them with it. You see how they strive in order to utter it correctly – and it has nothing to do with the prayer. (Ibid, p.67)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>3. Where do they come from?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn-ul-Qayyim:</strong> al-Ghazali said that whispers (waswasah) either spring from ignorance about the religion or also from a madness and both belong to the greatest deficiencies (Ibid, p.69)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>4. Free time and work:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen:</strong> Free time is deadly. The one who is not busied by knowledge or work gets these obsessive thoughts. (al-Liqa ash-Shahri 45)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>5. Perhaps a drop of urine exited?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen:</strong> There are those who, after having urinated, feel something down there and (they) drop the pants in order to look. Do not do that. Ignore it. (al-Liqa ash-Shahri 46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Shaykh al-Fawzân also said in one of his tapes that this (these obsessive thoughts regarding drops etc) should be ignored)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen:</strong> After urinating and that the last drop has went out, one should just wash the glans and nothing more. (al-Liqa ash-Shahri 46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>6. Shaking it and pressing from&#8230;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen:</strong> There are people who, after having urinated, press their penises from the anal to the glans and some shake them. This is an <strong>INNOVATION.</strong> (al-Liqa ash-Shahri 46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>7. Two doubt their Wudhu</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen:</strong> Two kinds of persons always doubt their ablution: the one with obsessive thouhts and the one with constant gases. The person with the obsessive thoughts should wean himself from it and ignore them and the person with the gases goes with that which is convincing until he hears or feels something. (al-Liqa ash-Shahri 61)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>8. Jumping into a river for Ghusl and then doubting it?!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen:</strong> Obsessive thoughts (Wiswas) are dangerous. A man came to a Shaykh<strong>1</strong> and said: I bath in the flood Tigris after orgasm. I then pray and persuade myself to [think that] I am not clean. The Shaykh then said: Do not pray. The prophet said that the mad one is not responsible for his deeds until he becomes normal and you are mad. (al-Liqa ash-Shahri 23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1.</strong> (The shaykh mentions in his FHM tape 5 that the shaykh was Ibn &#8216;aqil al-Hanbali)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>9. To BREAK the wudhu in order to be sure of one&#8217;s next wudhu?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen:</strong> An example of these obsessive thoughts is to doubt whether one is clean or not and in order to be sure, one BREAKS THE ABLUTION. (al-Liqa ash-Shahri 23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Please note:</strong> Some people who know that they are clean, but to be “<em>sure</em>”, they break the wudhu by touching the penis or farting etc, look at this stupidness, they BREAK THE WUDHU to be sure? And then they remake the wudhu not realising that they were already convinced of the former wudhu, they would otherwise not BREAK IT, you can&#8217;t break something that is not there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>10. What do they lead to?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen:</strong> Obsessive thoughts lead to madness. (FHM 5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>11. The preseminal fluid issue</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn ‘Uthaymeen:</strong> There are people who imagine that they they got preseminal fluid as soon as they think. These are the whispers of the devil and should be ignored. (Sharh-ul-Bulugh 1/421)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>12. Why do jews not get whispers when they pray?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn-ul-Qayyim:</strong> Ibn ‘Abbas was asked why the jews not get whispers when they pray. He said: What should the devil do with a ruined heart? (al-Wabil, p.52)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just a quick note: I will in Shâ&#8217; Allâh gather some Fawâ&#8217;id in regards to other kinds of Wiswas (such as &#8216;Aqîdah, belief etc). These were more leaning towards Taharah and the intention. Bârak Allâhu fîkum.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling regarding women cutting their hair? Some women beautify themselves in this way even if they are single. Where is the limit? What is the ruling on side parting?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn Bâz</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not allowed for the women to cut the hair. Their hair is their beauty. When they cut it, they subject the hair to disfigurement and an uneven hair.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the hair were to be really long, it is then allowed to cut the ends. It has been confirmed that the prophet’s (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) wives did it after his death. If the hair gets really long, she then may do so since she experiences difficulties with the washing and combing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for side parting, it is not allowed. It is an imitation of women that are Mumîlât Mâmilât.</p>

<p><strong>The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Question 3: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling on a woman parting her hair on the side, making only one braid, or wearing it in a bun, with the intention of making herself beautiful for her husband or to look good because it suits her?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to <strong>parting the hair on the side</strong>, this involves imitating the Kafir (disbelieving) women, and it is proven that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said it is Haram (prohibited) to imitate the Kafirs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to <strong>gathering the hair and letting it hang down on the back</strong>, either braided or not, there is nothing wrong with that so long as it is covered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, <strong>making it into a bun (on top of the head)</strong> is not permitted, because that is an imitation of Kafir women and it is Haram to imitate them. The Prophet (peace be upon him) warned against that when he said: &#8220;<span style="color:#666699;">There are two types amongst the denizens of the Fire whom I have not seen yet: Men having whips like the tails of cows with which they flog people, and women who would be naked in spite of their being dressed, who seduce others (to wrong paths) and are being seduced; their heads will appear like the humps of the Bactrian camels inclined to one side. These (women) would not enter Jannah (Paradise) nor perceive its odor, even though its odor can be perceived at such and such (very remote) distance.</span>&#8221; (Related by Ahmad and Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">That which I know about this group via some of our brothers who have been with them on their trips and outings, is that they do not accept their call towards the Qur’ân and the Sunnah. They are just as all other groups in this matter, as I have earlier indicated. They say, and awful is what they say:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><em>“Your Da’wah splits the people.”</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We agree. Our call is a true call and it differentiates between truth, falsehood, the one who is right and the one who is wrong. That is why it is no wonder that one of the names of the prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) is “al-Mufarriq” (the divider). This is something these so-called Islamic ‘callers’ are ignorant about. If these people (were to) hear this name, they would be confused. This is because they do not understand Islâm. The only purpose of the prophets and messengers and scriptures is to distinguish the truth from falsehood so that the Muslims are with the truth against the falsehood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a result thereof it is completely natural that the various Da’wahs (calls) today, which do not agree with this true methodology, do not accept an individual’s call since it will mislead them from their methodology and call that are based upon something other than the Qur’ân, Sunnah and the methodology of the Salaf as-Sâlih (pious predecessors). This is what we know of them or at least knew of them. It is possible that they have progressed a bit, which was implied in the question, when they realised that they go out for Allâh’s sake entirely confused. They are as the jews and christians who merely understand a little bit of their religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If these people are aware of their ignorance in the religion and that there is a group of Muslims who are called as Salafiyyûn, Ansâr-us-Sunnah, or Ahl-ul-Hadîth, depending upon the country even if they all have the same belief, who can teach them, then it is possible [I.e. to go out with them]. If they agree to discard their former negative methodology and accept that some Salafiyyûn participate in their trips and outings and allow them to call these confused people to the Qur’ân and Sunnah, then I deem it to be obligatory upon individual Salafiyyûn to go out with them. This however, provided that they are the ones who maintain the call and that it is a Salafî-Islâmic call and not a Salafî-Sûfî-Tablîghî-call, which has been mentioned earlier. It should namely be pure Salafiyyah. If then Jamâ’at-ut-Tablîgh, al-Ikhwân al-Muslimûn, Hizb-ut-Tahrîr and any other group accepts that Salafiyyûn call to their methodology in a clear and explicit way without any limitations or conditions, then I deem it to be obligatory upon individual Salafiyyûn to mingle with them. However, they should first remind them that they will not agree to go out with them for three days, forty days or in accordance with some other arrangement they have invented and which lacks basis in the Qur’ân and Sunnah.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">Why are all of those who call towards Tawhîd called as “Wahhâbiyyah” ever since Shaykh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhâb (rahimahullâh)? This word scares off many people from those who call towards Tawhîd.</span></p>
<p><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No, it doesn’t scare off at all. We are proud of the fact that the one who calls towards Tawhîd is called as “Wahhâbî” and all praise is due to Allâh. What is the one who calls towards Shirk (idolatry, polytheism) called then? What is he called? Jâhilî!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are proud of it. Let them then say “Wahhâbî”. They are thusly themselves witnessing that the call of Wahhâbiyyah is a call towards Tawhîd. The author of “al-Lanjah” (rahimahullâh) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“If the one who follows Ahmad is a Wahhâbî, then let the humans and Jinns witness that I am a Wahhâbî.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad here is the messenger (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam);</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“If the one who follows Ahmad is a Wahhâbî, then let the humans and Jinns witness that I am a Wahhâbî.”</em></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Scholar</strong>: Imâm Muhammad Nâsir-ud-Dîn al-Albânî<br />
<strong>Source</strong>: Silsilat-ul-Hudâ wan-Nûr (320)<br />
<strong>Reference</strong>: Darulhadith.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">They say that the call of Salafiyyah is based upon speech about the creed and Tawhîd and (it) forgets, or ignores, theoretically or practically, governance (Hâkimiyyah) and human Tawâghît who constitute their own laws next to Allâh. What do you say about this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albânî</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We agree with this to some extent. However, we do not agree with them on removing the Tawâghît, as they call them, without first having removed the Tawâghît of their souls.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This type of speech springs from the methodology of this group. They accuse us with this accusation. We deem that it is not time for this action (I.e. to overthrow rulers). We do not deny that it is obligatory to condemn each and every one who rules by something other than that which Allâh revealed. Is there some Islâmic group today that is ready to confront the rulers who do not rule by that which Allâh revealed without having prepared with the preparation we always speak about, namely spiritual and material preparation? They are in a hurry. They think that raising the voice against these rulers is enough in order to support Islâm. However, true victory is to make them understand true Islâm and practice it as good as they can.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I consider that history repeats itself. The first Muslims only cared about understanding the call of Islâm from its source, namely Allah’s messenger (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam). They didn’t care about confronting the disbelievers and polytheists. The only exception is perhaps occasional, individual cases. But collectively, it first took place after the emigration of the prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) from Makah to al-Madînah. This type of speech is thusly known to us from far back. We have experienced this in several Islâmic countries when they declared war against the disbelieving leader who does not rule by that which Allâh revealed. This was done without the spiritual and material preparation. It only ended with setbacks in the Islâmic call in several Islâmic countries.</p>

<strong>Source</strong>: Fatâwâ al-Haram al-Madanî (53)<br />

<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling on ascribing to the Salaf as-Sâlih and saying that one is Salafî in ‘Aqîdah (creed)?</span></p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymîn:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory to subscribe to the Salaf since they followed that which the prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) followed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for calling oneself “Salafî” intending to establish a sect or subscribe to a sect, then we fight against the sects. We deem that the Islâmic Ummah should be one single group in accordance with the way of the prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and his companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if he means by the word “Salafi” that he is following the Salaf without intending to establish a sect that accuses dissidents to be deviant, <strong>then this is correct</strong>. We’re all Salafiyyûn! We all ask Allâh to allow us to die upon the way of the Salaf. We ask Allâh for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To establish <strong>a sect</strong> by the name “Salafî”, or some other by the name “Ikhwânî”, or a third by the name “Tablîghî” and so on is not something I deem to be allowed. Did the companions divide in this way? No. The one who says the opposite has to prove it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>A message to the woman &#8211;  Lecture by Shaykh Sâlih al-Fawzân (Must see)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzaan (hafidahullâh) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is due to Allâh and may the blessings and peace be upon our prophet Muhammad and all of his family and companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In these two blessed Friday sermons, we have heard a lot of good by our preacher (Khatîb) –may Allâh grant him success. He spoke on one of the most serious issues, namely the issue of women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers! Allâh (subhânahu wa ta’âlâ) created the woman, just as the man, for a great duty in this life. Each got their (own) task. The men got their tasks and the women got their tasks. If each stick to their own task and fulfill it, the society would attain a great deal of good. If this order were to be shaken, a great deficiency would occur, just as you heard about the role of the woman in the pre-Islamic time of ignorance, as well as her role in the disbelieving countries of today and her role with the religious Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The woman is very important and that is why the prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) ordered that she is well taken care of. He said in his Kutbah (sermon) on ‘Arafah in connection to his farewell pilgrimage:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Treat your women well, for they are captives with you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Ibn Mâjah 1851)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) ordered us to take good care of the women because they play an important role in the society. It’s not only about taking good care of them and giving them their due rights… this is obligatory, what is more important is to protect them from indecencies – the woman is weak as you know – and [to protect them from] trying appearances [i.e. fitnah] and letting them do whatever they want to do. This is the most important thing the prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) ordered [in regards to women], namely that we protect them. Allâh (jalla wa ‘alâ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">الرِّجَالُ قَوَّامُونَ عَلَى النِّسَاء بِمَا فَضَّلَ اللّهُ بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ وَبِمَا أَنفَقُواْ مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ فَالصَّالِحَاتُ قَانِتَاتٌ حَافِظَاتٌ لِّلْغَيْبِ بِمَا حَفِظَ اللّهُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Men are in charge of women, because Allâh has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to Allâh and to their husbands), and guard in the husband’s absence what Allâh orders them to guard (e.g. their chastity, their husband’s property, etc.).” (The Qur’ân 4:34)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What does it mean that the man is in charge of the woman? Is it only about providing (for her) and justice? It is not only about that. His responsibility is (also) about something that is more important. He should namely protect this woman so that she doesn’t lose it, frees herself and [begins to] take shyness and chastity lightly. This is the greatest responsibility of the man in regards to the woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The “man” in the verse is not only referring to the husband. The man, whether it be her father, brother or some other guardian, is responsible for her and protects her. If it were to go to the length of him having to punish her, he then does it<strong><sup>1</sup>:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَاللاَّتِي تَخَافُونَ نُشُوزَهُنَّ فَعِظُوهُنَّ وَاهْجُرُوهُنَّ فِي الْمَضَاجِعِ وَاضْرِبُوهُنَّ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“But those [wives] form whom you fear arrogance – [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them.” (The Qur’ân 4:34, interpretation of the meanings)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The woman is thus in need of being under observation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The enemies of Islam of these days concentrate on the issue of women. They know that she is the most serious matter in the society. They focus on her. They wage war against the chastity and honour and consider it to be oppression against women. If the woman sticks to chastity and honour, they say that she is deprived of liberty. The fact of the matter is that it is just at that time her freedom (liberty) is preserved (i.e. when she sticks to chastity and honour). She can feely obey Allâh, raise her children and fulfill that which Allâh has given her as a responsibility. She is as a shepherdess in the home of her husband and (is) responsible for her flock. This is her true freedom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for her freedom in nudity, indecencies in front of other people, flirtatious gait in the stores/shops and the ability to go wherever she wants to, then this is a type of slavery and not a freedom. It’s slavery to temptation and satan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O servants of Allâh! Freedom lies in obeying and worshiping Allâh. Therein lies the glory of the soul and the honour of the human and their happiness in this life and the next one. The one who acts disobediently towards Allâh and his commands, whether it is about women or anything else, is one of the degraded slaves of the devils among the humans and the Jinns. It is slavery and not freedom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have to know this! We have to preserve our women among the wives, daughters and relatives. We have to cooperate in protecting them and to refrain from listening to this propaganda [by the Kuffâr in west]. The Kuffâr (disbelievers) are trying to eradicate Islam by all possible means. The greatest ways of destruction is to destroy the woman. Because the woman is the basis of the family and the home. If she is destroyed, the home and the family is destroyed as well. The daughters will be destroyed after having copied their destroyed mothers and relatives. Thus, we have to safeguard our women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even If the Kuffâr have been successful in degrading some Islamic countries, they will never – by the will and motion of Allâh – succeed in doing the same thing with this county, which is the country of the two holy mosques in which the revelation was sent down to and in which the messenger (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) was sent. Herein are men who take care of her honour, even if some deluded men and women take this issue lightly. This country has men who safeguard their honour and the honour of their female relatives. You belong to them – in sha’ Allâh – and (those) who will initiate it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have to fear Allâh (subhânahu wa ta’âlâ) and live up to this great responsibility. If we do it, we’ll protect our homes, children, families and societies. She is thusly the basis. Thus, the enemy focuses on her. They are focused on the woman. They got her in a specific focus you are familiar with; in books, papers, magazines, newspapers, media, internet, and all other (possible) fields. They want this country to end up as the other countries so that the manners disappear and the honour gets lost. It will then become easy for the Kuffar (disbelievers) to eradicate Islam from its basis. The poet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>‘The nations exist as long as their manners exist, when their manners vanish, so do they.’</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the manners disappear, then there is nothing left. The purpose of the manners is the honour, behavior, shyness and dignity. This is what the manners are (ahlâq). Another poet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>‘I do not say that one should allow the women to show their faces as the men and to walk around in the shops, they have a lot of duties in their homes as the man who is the possessor of the sword and the spear.’</em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The woman has her line of work and the man has his. If each of them does their suitable works, the society will then be good and the welfare will be complete. But if this order were to be shaken, the society would then become deficient. That is why the prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) cursed the masculine women and the feminine men. All of this just to preserve the woman and allow her to stay in her natural nature, religion, character and honour. The glory and honour should be protected and preserved. Read the chapter “an-Nûr” (of the Qur’ân). You will find therein how greatly and notably the women are protected with covering and permission before one enters into the homes. The same goes for the Sunnah. The prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) forbade the woman from travelling alone without a Mahram and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is not allowed for a woman who believes in Allâh and the Last day to travel without a Mahram.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(al-Bukhari [3006] and Muslim [1341])</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He forbade that she is alone in private with a man who’s not her Mahram and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“A man is not alone with a woman but that the Shaytân makes a third.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(at-Tirmidhi 1171)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He forbade the women from mixing with the men. That is why the women prayed with the Muslims behind the messenger of Allâh (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and behind the men in the mosque of the messenger of Allâh (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam). They were so covered that no one could recognize them. They prayed behind the men. Herein is a proof that mixing is prohibited between both of the sexes. If a woman is not allowed to mix with men in the mosque, which is a place of worship and piousness, one can then ask how she would be allowed to mix with them in offices, amusement parks, parties, and markets. This matter is very serious. We’re surrounded by the enemy now and an ideological warfare. You are well aware of the ideological warfare that is taking place now. The Kuffar (disbelievers) are waging war against the Muslim countries with weapons, ideologies and all other means. We are, as I said before, surrounded by the enemy. We have to be observant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we are with Allâh, Allâh is with us. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">لَا تَخَافَا إِنَّنِي مَعَكُمَا أَسْمَعُ وَأَرَى</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He (Allâh) said: “Fear not, verily! I am with you both, hearing and seeing.” (The Qur’ân 20:46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we are with Allâh, Allâh is then with us. And if Allâh is with us, nobody can hurt us:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">لاَ تَحْزَنْ إِنَّ اللّهَ مَعَنَا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Be not sad (or afraid), surely Allâh is with us.” (The Qur’ân 9:40, interpretation of the meanings)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But who is Allâh with? Allâh is especially with the pious, those who do the right and the believers. We thusly have to be with Allâh (subhânahu wa ta’âlâ). The prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said to Ibn ‘Abbâs [what means]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Boy! Take care of Allâh and He will take care of you. Take care of Allâh and you will find Him in front of you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(at-Tirmidhî 2516)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have to, as I said before, be with Allâh, obey Him and follow His commands and avoid His prohibitions for Him (subhânahu wa ta’âlâ) to be with us with His victory, His support and His help.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allâh for forgiveness and I repent before Him. And I ask Allâh to preserve us and you with His preservation and that He looks after us and you with His victory and help. And may the blessings and peace be upon our prophet Muhammad and all of his family and companions</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Scholar: Imâm Muhammad Nâsir-ud-Dîn al-Albânî<br />
Source: Silsilat-ul-Hudâ wan-Nûr (233), Reference: Maktabah Darulhadith.com<br />
Audio and translation courtesy of aFatwa.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">The Palestinian Intifada has now been going on for 1 ½ years. We throw stones at the jews that either hits them on the head or not. What do you say about throwing stones at the jews or continuing the Intifada in this way at all?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albânî</strong>: We have honored the intifada from the entire beginning. It deserves to be honored given its courage and heroism. However, it goes about the wrong way. If we firstly consider the Sharî&#8217;ah-based texts and thereafter the biography of the prophet (sallâ Allâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), we see that this matter is in need of preparation. This preparation addresses two matters;</p>
<p>1. the spiritual<br />
2. and the militaristic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We already know that the prophet (sallâ Allâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and his companions were subjected to hardships by the polytheists in Makkah until Allâh (tabârak wa ta&#8217;âlâ) allowed some of them to emigrate even if it be to Abyssinia. Allâh thereafter allowed the prophet (sallâ Allâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) to emigrate from Makkah to al-Madînah. He was followed by those who were able to follow, and others stayed. The believers are up until today subjected to the worst punishments [by the Kuffâr etc], which history is a witness to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What I want to say is, the Muslims of the world (should not) rush it. They should rather prepare themselves to fight against the disbelievers (Kuffâr) and expel them from the Muslim countries to the disbelieving countries. That is why Allâh (ta&#8217;âlâ) said in the Qur&#8217;ân:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And make ready against them all you can of power, including steeds of war (tanks, planes, missiles, artillery, etc.) to threaten the enemy of Allâh and your enemy&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(8:60, interpretation of the meanings)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The intifada is undoubtedly just as (it was) before though even more evident. It has not been prepared at all in order to be able to fight against the disbelievers who have occupied this country (I.e. Palestine). Both spiritual and militaristic preparations are missing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly, we see that it is useless and worthless to confront various types of machine guns by way of stones. That is why I do not see any results from this intifada. It has now been going on for two entire years and they still stand on the same spot. Especially since the Arabic countries, who after all have a fairly [acceptable] military force, doesn&#8217;t help our brothers militaristically.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Scholar:</strong> ´Allâmah Sâlih bin Fawzân al-Fawzân<br />
<strong>Source</strong>: alfawzan.ws/node/5412<br />
<strong>Reference</strong>: Darulhadith.com<br />
aFatwa.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân:</strong> The scholars are known. Not all who got diplomas, graduate, memorise Hadîths and verses and read books are scholars with understanding. The scholars with understanding are known amongst the people. But many people only want that which suits them. He looks for that which suits him even if he were to get an answer from the most ignorant or most deviant people. What is most important is that he gets what suits him and his desire. It is a great error and especially today. The scholars are few. There are few scholars with understanding unlike those who read who are many. There are many who read but the scholars with understanding are few. The prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said [what means]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allâh does not seize this knowledge by pulling it out from the chests of men. It is seized by the death of the scholars. When there then are no scholar left, the people take the ignorant as leaders who in turn will answer without knowledge and go astray and lead others astray.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We fear that this has started today. We therefore have to be vigilant, apprehensive and observant. We have to choose the scholars and trustworthy who live today as good as we can. As for the early scholars, then they have past away. But one should stick to the best of those (who are) alive:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>فَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ مَا اسْتَطَعْتُمْ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">“So fear Allah as much as you are able”<br />
<strong>(64:16, interpretation of the meaning)</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q: What is the ruling on reading the Bible?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The Divine Books revealed before the Qur&#8217;an now include many distortions, alterations, and omissions, as Allah says in the Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is not permissible for Muslims to read any of these Books, unless they have deep-rooted knowledge of the Din (religion) and want to explain the distortions and inconsistencies in these books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is not permissible for a Muslim to read the Bible as it has almost entirely undergone interpolation. Even the parts of the Bible that have undergone no interpolation are needless as the Qur&#8217;an replaces them. This ruling is not applicable to scholars who need to read it in order to refute the claims of the People of the Book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible either to swear by the Bible in its present form as it has undergone partial interpolation and distortion, and thus cannot be the words of Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Excerpt from <a href="http://www.alifta.com/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Page&amp;PageID=9911&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.alifta.com/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Page&amp;PageID=9911&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=7</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ruling on Reading the Tawrah and the Injil by Shaykh Ibn Baz rahimahullah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q &#8211; Is it permissible for me as a Muslim to leaf through the Injil (Gospel) and read in it, just to have a look, and not for any other purpose? Does believing in the Divine Books mean believing in their being revealed by Allah or believing in their content? Please enlighten me, may Allah enlighten you!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Every Muslim should believe that these books: the Tawrah (Torah), the Injil (Gospel), and the Zabur (Psalms), were revealed by Allah, and that Allah revealed them to His Prophets. Included in these Books were: commands, prohibitions, admonitions, warnings, stories of ancient events, information on Paradise and Hell, and other matters. However, Muslims should not use these books as they have been distorted and altered, and they should not own copies of them, or read in them. They pose a danger in that they may lead Muslims to deny a truth or believe in a falsehood, because they have been distorted, altered, and falsified by the Jews, the Christians and others; whereas Allah has made us stand in no need of them, by the great Book He revealed: the Noble Qurýan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) saw a portion of the Tawrah in the hands of &#8220;Umar, so he became angry and said: Are you confused about it, O Ibn Al-Khattab? By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, I brought it to you white and pure. And he added, &#8221;By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, if Musa (Moses) were alive, he could not but follow me. &#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We just want to advise you, and others, not to take anything from the Tawrah, the Injil, and the Zabur, not to acquire copies of them, and not to read in them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, if you have any of them, bury or burn it, because the truth that was in them has been given, instead, in the Qurýan; they are now so mixed with changes and distortions, which are all condemned and false. Therefore, the believer must be on his guard against this, and beware of reading these books for they may lead to belief in a falsehood or denial of a truth. To be safe, it is better to just dispose of these books, either by burying or burning them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowledgeable Muslim scholars are permitted to look at these books to refute the allegations of the opponents of Islam from among the Jews and the Christians. This was what the Prophet (peace be upon him) did when the Jews denied that stoning of adulterers was the punishment prescribed in the Tawrah, so he asked for a copy of the Tawrah until they finally acknowledged it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason for this is that the scholars, who are knowledgeable about the Shariýah (Islamic law), may need to read the Tawrah, the Injil, and the Zabur for the sake of Islam, to refute allegations from the opponents of Allah and show the merits of the Qurýan and the truth and guidance it contains. As for ordinary people, they do not need to do this. So, if they have any of these books, they should bury them in a pure place or burn them to avoid misleading anyone through them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q: Is it permissible for Muslims to  read the Injil (Gospel) to know how far it is distorted?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is not permissible for a believer to read the Tawrah (Torah) and Injil, even though they were distorted and changed and Allah (may He be Glorified) has given Muslims what is best, which is the Noble Qur&#8217;an that has been preserved from any change or distortion. Moreover, the Shari`ah (Islamic law) has abrogated all other earlier laws, and it is the perfect, the greatest, and the most useful to the Servants of Allah. Allah (may He be Exalted) states:Surah Al-Ma&#8217;idah, 5: 3 This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islým as your religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (may He be Glorified) addressed His Prophet (peace be upon him) stating:Surah Al-Jathiyah, 45: 18 Then We have put you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) on a (plain) way of (Our) commandment [like the one which We commanded Our Messengers before you (i.e. legal ways and laws of the Islýmic Monotheism)]. So follow you that (Islýmic Monotheism and its laws), and follow not the desires of those who know not. (Tafsir At-Tabarý). It was authentically reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he saw `Umar ibn Al-Khattab holding some pages of the Tawrah. He, thus, became angry and said: Are you doubtful regarding it (Islam) O Ibn Al-Khattab? By Him in Whose Hand is my life, I have brought it to you plain and pure&#8230; By Him in Whose Hand is my life, if Musa (Moses) was alive he would have followed me. (Related by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad (Hadith compilation)).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We, thus, advise you to increase your recitation of the Qur&#8217;an, take care of it, and act according to its teachings, for it will definitely suffice you from reading the earlier books revealed by Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>
