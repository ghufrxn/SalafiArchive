										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">This lecture of Shaykh Falaah Ismaeel (حفظه الله) was recorded on Tuesday, February 08, 2011.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this lecture the Shaykh covered everything in regards with following the Salaf. He mentioned that we should follow the Salaf in their Aqeedah (creed), Ibadaat (acts of worship), Ikhlaaq (good manners), Mua’mulaat, and in everything. He mentioned many stories and one of the stories was about one of the Student of Knowledge (حفظه الله).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh said &#8211; &#8220;I met one Student of Knowledge about 30 years ago when he was studying in Madinah (Saudi Arabia). We used to live together and sit with Ulemah. He was a very good student, he was excellent in the first year, excellent in the second, and in the third year but when the forth year started, he came to me and told me that he would like to go back to his home country (United Kingdom). Everybody asked him that why you want to leave, you are almost there, finish your education, get your degree, and then leave. He began to cry and said that he got a phone call from his family member and they told him that his father is very sick and he is in the hospital and the family is afraid that he may die (upon kufr). We told him that your father may not die, a lot of people go to the hospital but not everyone dies immediately. But he said that something in my heart telling me to leave. So he got on the plane and went back and didn’t finish the forth and last year of the University&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh said that he didn’t care about the degree. He was truthful with Allah as related to guiding his father to Al-Islam and Allah was truthful with him as well. He went back and after a couple of days, we talked to him and he said alhamdulillah my father has accepted Islam. He said that alhamdulillah my father died upon Islam in the same hospital. The Shaykh said I visited him after many years and he said that now my mother is Muslim and my whole family is Muslim. <strong>The Shaykh said what we learn from this story that if you really care about your family and they are non Muslims, then focus your time and do what you can, the success is with Allah </strong><strong>(سبحانه وتعالى). </strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allaah, The Most Gracious, The Most Merciful<br />
All Praise is due to Allaah, Lord of everything that exists</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:large;"><strong><span style="color:green;">The Importance of Being Truthful</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Falaah Isma&#8217;eel recently relayed a heart-melting story that may interest you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Shaikh visited Holland, he was of course met by Muslims from Holland and they told him, &#8220;If you had come two weeks earlier you would have seen it yourself. We prayed over this man.&#8221; Then they told him the following story.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[What follows is not verbatim, but a summary, with some explanations so as to clarify some terms that may be new to non-Muslims.]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was a 26-year-old Christian from Holland. One day, he changed his dress to thobes, a burnoose, grew a beard, and the people started calling him &#8220;the one who looks like Jesus.&#8221;One day, he met some Muslims, and he said to them, &#8220;I love Jesus.&#8221; And the Muslims told him, &#8220;We also love Jesus, and it is even a condition of Islam. We love Jesus and Moses.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this man tried imitating Jesus, helping others when he could, cutting their lawns and the like. After two years, he entered the mosque [the Muslims&#8217; place of worship] for the first time, and he was greeted with &#8220;ahlan&#8221; [which means welcome, and thus was not greeted with the greeting reserved for Muslims &#8220;as-salaamu &#8216;alaykum&#8221; (which means: may peace and safety be upon you on the Day of Judgement)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;no; I want to be a Muslim.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, the Muslims witnessed his testimony (pronounced &#8220;shahada&#8221;) &#8211; there is none deserving of worship except Allaah, and Muhammad is His servant and Messenger, and Jesus is His servant and Messenger &#8211; taught him the basics, and taught him how to pray. He began praying in congregation with them, not missing a single congregation. Then one day, he noticed that the other Muslims were arriving at the mosque after him, so he asked for a key to the mosque. And he was given one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims then observed that not only was he opening the mosque, but additionally he was routinely found in optional prayer whenever they entered the mosque for the dawn prayer. [They would enter and find him already engaged in the worship of Allaah.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then one day, he told the Muslims how he decided to become Muslim. He said he had a dream about Jesus (the son of Mary), and Jesus said to him, &#8220;Be Muslim. Be Muslim. Be Muslim.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I woke up, and a few days later, I had the same dream. This happened three times.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[The shaikh interjected and said, this is success from Allaah.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after having prayed for 20 days with the other Muslims, he died.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the mercy of Allaah, and Allaah saved him [from dying upon other than Islam].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is Sidq (truthfulness); he truthfully loved Jesus, so he became Muslim. Allaah guided him to become Muslim, because he was truthful in his love for Jesus.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;">If one is truthful in his love for Jesus and his following Jesus, then this should lead him to the true religion of Jesus (Islam) and should lead him to following whom Jesus commanded to be followed after him &#8211; Muhammad, the seal of all Prophets.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;">After all, the religion of all the Prophets was Islam, and their creed was the same, and their message was the same, and they confirmed each other.</span><span style="font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;"> It is only the deviant who have distorted the message of the previous Prophets, and thus Allaah promised to preserve His last revelation (the Qur`an) from corruption.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the Ruling on Listing to Unknown Speakers and Taking Knowledge from them?</strong></p>
<p>ما حكم سماع أشرطة المجاهيل وأخذ العلم عنهم؟</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillah al-hamdulillaah wa salaatu wa salaam ‘alaa rasoolillaah wa ‘alaa aalihi wa sahbihi wa man tabi’a hudaahu wa bad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The trials of today are very many. Innovations and mixing up innovators with the people of the sunnah and their outward call to the sunnah and salafiyyah is wide spread, for this reason one should be cautious. ‘Abdullaah ibn ‘Abbaas used to say, if a man said ‘I heard the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) or the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said, we (used to) rush to him and went out to seek him, listening to him, but when the fitnah occurred they began asking about the men (who were narrating the knowledge) like how Ibn Seereen mentioned “we said: name to us your men” meaning they were known by whom they narrated from. So from there they would know if they would listen and accept or refuse and not listen. If that was the case in that time, then our time has more priority. It is a must that one determines and limits those whom he listens to, and from whom he reads from, and who he takes from, and (the works he) issues, and also who he sits with, this is very important. As for being a haatib layl (one who gathers wood at nigh i.e. blindly, heedlessly), listing to everyone and those who are unknown. No, it is feared that a trial will befall this one. Surely from the signs of success from Allaah and wanting good for his slave, it is uprightness and guidance that he helps him to sit, mix with and take from the people of the Sunnah. It is obligatory to have seriousness and diligence towards seeking out that which brings about success and guidance from Allaah, and Allah is the one who grants success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">بسم الله والحمدلله والصلاة والسلام على رسول الله وعلى آله وصحبه ومن تبع هداه وبعد ، الفتن اليوم كثيرة جدا, والبدع كثيرة جدا, وتلبس المبتدعة بأهل السنة وإعلانهم للسنة والسلفية كثير جدا؛ لذلك ينبغي الحذر. وإذا كان عبدالله بن عباس يذكر أنهم كانوا إذا قال رجل : سمعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم, أو قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم , ابتدرناه ،يبادرونه, يشرئبون إليه, يسمعون منه ، لكن لما وقعت الفتنة صاروا يسألون عن الرجال كما ذكر ابن سيرين: (قلنا : سموا لنا رجالكم). أي يعرفون عمن ينقلون, ومن ثم من خلال النقلة يعرفون هل يسمعون ويقبلون,أم يرفضون ولا يسمعون. فهذا إذا كان في ذلك الزمان, ففي زماننا أولى,لابد أن يحدد الإنسان لمن يسمع, ولمن يقرأ, وعمن يأخذ ويصدر, وعند من يجلس, هذا مهم جدا, أما أن يكون حاطب ليل يسمع للجميع وللمجاهيل ,لا,هذا تخشى عليه الفتنة ، وإن من علامات وصور توفيق الله وإرادته بعبده الخير والصلاح والهداية أن يوفقه إلى مجالسة ومخالطة والأخذ عن أهل السنة ، فالواجب الجد والاجتهاد والتحري استجلابا لتوفيق الله وهدايته ، والله الموفق</p>
