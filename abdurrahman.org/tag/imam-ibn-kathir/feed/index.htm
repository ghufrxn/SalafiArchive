<h2></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قُل لَّوْ كَانَ الْبَحْرُ مِدَاداً لِّكَلِمَـتِ رَبِّى لَنَفِدَ الْبَحْرُ قَبْلَ أَن تَنفَدَ كَلِمَـتُ رَبِّى وَلَوْ جِئْنَا بِمِثْلِهِ مَدَداً </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: &#8220;If the sea were ink for the Words of my Lord, surely, the sea would be exhausted before the Words of my Lord would be finished, even if We brought like it for its aid.</strong></span>&#8221; [Surah Kahf 18:109]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#003300;"><strong>[Tafseer Ibn Kathir]</strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Words of the Lord can never be finished</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says: `<strong>Say, O Muhammad, if the water of the sea were ink for a pen to write down the words, wisdom and signs of Allah, the sea would run dry before it all could be written down.</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَوْ جِئْنَا بِمِثْلِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(even if We brought like it)</strong> means, another sea, then another, and so on, additional seas to be used for writing. The Words of Allah would still never run out. As Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَوْ أَنَّمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ مِن شَجَرَةٍ أَقْلَامٌ وَالْبَحْرُ يَمُدُّهُ مِن بَعْدِهِ سَبْعَةُ أَبْحُرٍ مَّا نَفِدَتْ كَلِمَاتُ اللَّهِ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if all the trees on the earth were pens and the sea </strong>(were ink)<strong>, with seven seas behind it to increase it, yet the Words of Allah would not be exhausted. Verily, Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.</strong></span>) (31:27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said, &#8220;<strong>The parable of the knowledge of all of mankind, in comparison to the knowledge of Allah, is that of a drop of water in comparison to all of the oceans</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah revealed that:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قُل لَّوْ كَانَ الْبَحْرُ مِدَاداً لِّكَلِمَـتِ رَبِّى لَنَفِدَ الْبَحْرُ قَبْلَ أَن تَنفَدَ كَلِمَـتُ رَبِّى</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: &#8220;If the sea were ink for the Words of my Lord, surely, the sea would be exhausted before the Words of my Lord would be finished,</strong></span>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says that even if those oceans were ink for the Words of Allah, and all the trees were pens, the pens would be broken and the water of the sea would run dry, and the Words of Allah would remain, for nothing can outlast them. For no one can comprehend the greatness of Allah or praise Him as He deserves to be praised, except the One Who praises Himself. Our Lord is as He says He is and He is beyond what we can say. The blessings of this world, the beginning and end of it, in comparison to the blessings of the Hereafter, are like a mustard seed compared to the entire world.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">(<span style="color:#993300;">وَاعْبُدْ رَبَّكَ حَتَّى يَأْتِيَكَ الْيَقِينُ</span> )</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">(<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And worship your Lord until the certainty comes to you</strong></span>) (15: 99)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari said: &#8220;Salim said, (This means) death.&#8221;&#8217; This Salim is Salim bin Abdullah bin Umar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jarir also recorded from Salim bin Abdullah, (وَاعْبُدْ رَبَّكَ حَتَّى يَأْتِيَكَ الْيَقِينُ ) (And worship your Lord until the Yaqin comes to you.) He said, &#8220;Death.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in the Sahih from Umm Al-Ala&#8217;- one of the women of the Ansar &#8211; that when the Messenger of Allah entered upon Uthman bin Mazun after he had died, Umm Al-Ala&#8217; said, &#8220;<em>May the mercy of Allah be upon you, Abu As-Saib. My testimony over you is that Allah has honored you</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>«وَمَا يُدْرِيكَ أَنَّ اللهَ أَكْرَمَهُ؟»</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(How do you know that Allah has honored him)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8220;<em>May my father and mother be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of Allah! If not him, then who else</em>&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said,</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">«أَمَّا هُوَ فَقَدْ جَاءَهُ الْيَقِينُ، وَإِنِّي لَأَرْجُو لَهُ الْخَيْر»</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(As far as he is concerned, the death has come to him, and I hope for good for him.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is evidence that the meaning of this Ayah, (وَاعْبُدْ رَبَّكَ حَتَّى يَأْتِيَكَ الْيَقِينُ ) (And worship your Lord until the certainty comes to you.) is that acts of worship, such as prayer and the like, are obligatory on man so long as his mind is sound, so he should pray according to his best ability.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was reported in Sahih Al-Bukhari from Imran bin Husayn that the Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#000000;">صَلِّ قَائِمًا، فَإِنْ لَمْ تَسْتَطِعْ فَقَاعِدًا، فَإِنْ لَمْ تَسْتَطِعْ فَعَلَى جَنْب</span>»</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>Pray standing, and if you cannot, then sitting, and if you cannot, then on your side</strong>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">From this we may understand that it is a mistake to interpret <em>Yaqin</em> (the certainty) as <em>Marifah</em> (&#8220;spiritual knowing&#8221;) as some of the <strong>Sufis</strong> do. According to them, when one of them attains the level of <em>Marifah</em>, they consider him to be free of these obligations. This is disbelief, misguidance and ignorance. The Prophets &#8211; peace be upon them &#8211; and their companions, were the most knowledgeable of people about Allah, about His rights, His attributes, and the glorification that He deserves. But at the same time, they were the people who worshipped Him the most, continuing in good deeds until the time they died. Therefore, what is meant by <em>Yaqin</em> here is death, as we have stated above. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To Allah be praise and thanks. Praise be to Allah for His guidance. It is to Him that we turn for help and it is in Him that we put our trust. He is the One Whom we ask to help us to reach the best of circumstances, for He is the Most Generous and Kind.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>The Command to call upon Allah By His grace and kindness</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>وَقَالَ رَبُّكُمُ ادْعُونِي أَسْتَجِبْ لَكُمْ ۚ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِي سَيَدْخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَاخِرِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And your Lord said: &#8220;Call upon Me, I will answer you. Verily, those who scorn My worship they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!</strong></span><br />
( Soorah Ghafir 40:60)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah encourages His servants to call upon Him, and He guarantees to respond.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyan Ath-Thawri used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O You Who love most those who ask of You, and O You Who hate most those who do not ask of You, and there is no one like that apart from You, O Lord.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly; the poet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Allah hates not to be asked, and the son of Adam hates to be asked.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qatadah said that Ka`b Al-Ahbar said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This Ummah has been given three things which were not given to any nation before, only to Prophets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) When Allah sent a Prophet, He said to him, `<em>You are a witness over your nation</em>.&#8217; But you have been made witnesses over mankind;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) It was said to the Prophets individually, `<em>Allah has not laid upon you any hardship in religion</em>,&#8217; but He said to this entire Ummah: <em>(and﴿ Allah</em> ﴾<em>has not laid upon you in religion any hardship</em>) (22:78) and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) It was said to the Prophets individually; `<em>Call upon Me, I will answer you</em>,&#8217; but it was said to this Ummah, (<em><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Call upon Me, I will answer you</span></strong></em>).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Nu`man bin Bashir, may Allah be pleased with him, said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong><span style="color:#808000;">Indeed the supplication is the worship</span>.</strong> )&#8221; Then he recited,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And your Lord said: &#8220;Call upon Me, I will answer you. Verily, those who scorn My worship they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!&#8221;</strong></span>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was also recorded by the Sunan compilers; At-Tirmdhi, An-Nasa&#8217;i, Ibn Majah, and Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, &#8220;Hasan Sahih.&#8221; It was also recorded by Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa&#8217;i, and Ibn Jarir with a different chain of narration. Allah&#8217;s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Verily, those who scorn My worship</strong></span>) means, `those who are too proud to call on Me and single Me out,&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong><span style="color:#008000;">they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!</span></strong>) means, in disgrace and insignificance. Imam Ahmad recorded from `Amr bin Shu`ayb from his father, from his grandfather that the Prophet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The proud will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection like ants in the image of people, and everything will be stepping on them, humiliating them, until they enter a prison in Hell called <em>Bulas</em>. They will be fed flames of fire, and given for drink a paste of insanity dripping from the people the Fire</strong></span>.)&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِن تَتَّقُوا اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّكُمْ فُرْقَانًا وَيُكَفِّرْ عَنكُمْ سَيِّئَاتِكُمْ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ ذُو الْفَضْلِ الْعَظِيمِ</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who believe! If you obey and fear Allaah, He will grant you <em>Furqan</em>, and will expiate for you your sins, and forgive you; and Allah is the Owner of the great bounty.</strong></span> (Al-Anfal 8:29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Abbas, As-Suddi, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, Muqatil bin Hayyan and several others said that,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<em>Furqan</em>), means, <strong>`a way out&#8217;</strong>;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujahid added, <strong>&#8220;In this life and the Hereafter.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration, Ibn `Abbas is reported to have said, `<em>Furqan</em>&#8216; means `<strong>salvation</strong>&#8216; or &#8212; according to another narration &#8212; <strong>`aid&#8217;.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad bin Ishaq said that `<em>Furqan</em>&#8216; means `<strong>criterion between truth and falsehood</strong>&#8216;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This last explanation from Ibn Ishaq is more general than the rest that we mentioned, and it also includes the other meanings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Certainly, those who have <em>Taqwa</em> of Allah by obeying what He ordained and abstaining from what he forbade, will be guided to differentiate between the truth and the falsehood. This will be a triumph, safety and a way out for them from the affairs of this life, all the while acquiring happiness in the Hereafter. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will also gain forgiveness, thus having their sins erased, and pardon, thus having their sins covered from other people, as well as, being directed to a way to gain Allah&#8217;s tremendous rewards,</p>
<p><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَآمِنُوا بِرَسُولِهِ يُؤْتِكُمْ كِفْلَيْنِ مِن رَّحْمَتِهِ وَيَجْعَل لَّكُمْ نُورًا تَمْشُونَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ۚ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Have <em>Taqwa</em> of Allah, and believe in His Messenger, He will give you a double portion of His mercy, and He will give you a light by which you shall walk </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(straight)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">. And He will forgive you. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful</span> </strong>(57:28)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Surely! Allah wrongs not even of the weight of a speck of dust, but if there is any good (done), He doubles it, and gives from Him a great reward. </strong></span>(Surah An-Nisa , aayah 40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah states that He does not treat any of His servants with injustice on the Day of Resurrection, be it the weight of a mustard seed or a speck of dust. Rather, Allah shall reward them for this action and multiply it, if it were a good deed. For instance, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(And We shall set up balances of justice)</strong></span> Allah said that Luqman said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(O my son! If it be (anything) equal to the weight of a mustard seed, and though it be in a rock, or in the heavens or in the earth, Allah will bring it forth)</span></strong>. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(That Day mankind will proceed in scattered groups that they may be shown their deeds. So whosoever does good equal to the weight of a speck of dust shall see it. And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of a speck of dust shall see it.)</span> </strong>The Two Sahihs recorded the long Hadith about the intercession that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri narrated, and in which the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">(Allah then says, &#8220;Go back, and take out of the Fire everyone in whose heart you find the weight of a mustard seed of faith&#8221;)</span></strong> In another narration, Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">(&#8220;Whosoever had the least, least, least speck of faith, take him out of the Fire,&#8221; and they will take out many people.)</span></strong> Abu Sa`id then said, &#8220;Read, if you will,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Surely! Allah wrongs not even of the weight of a speck of dust).&#8221;</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And recite to them the story of him to whom We gave Our Ayat, but he threw them away; so Shaytan followed him up, and he became of those who went astray.And had We willed, We would surely have elevated him therewith, but he clung to the earth and followed his own vain desires. So his parable is the parable of a dog: if you drive him away, he pants, or if you leave him alone, he </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(still) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">pants. Such is the parable of the people who reject Our Ayat. So relate the stories, perhaps they may reflect.Evil is the parable of the people who rejected Our Ayat, and used to wrong themselves.</span></strong> (Qur&#8217;an Al-A&#8217;raf 07, Verses 175-177)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdur-Razzaq recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said that Allah&#8217;s statement,<strong>(And recite to them the story of him to whom We gave Our Ayat, but he threw them away</strong>) <span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;Is about Bal`am bin Ba`ura&#8217; a man from the Children of Israel.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shu`bah and several other narrators narrated this statement from Mansur who got it from Ibn Mas`ud. Sa`id bin Abi `Arubah narrated that Qatadah said that Ibn `Abbas said,<span style="color:#993300;"> &#8220;He is Sayfi, son of Ar-Rahib.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qatadah commented that Ka`b said, <span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;He was a man from Al-Balqla&#8217; (a province of Jordan) who knew Allah&#8217;s Greatest Name. He used to live in Bayt Al-Maqdis with the tyrants.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said, <span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;He is Bal`am bin Ba`ura&#8217;, a man from Yemen whom Allah had given the knowledge of His Ayat, but he abandoned them.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Malik bin Dinar said, <span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;He was one of the scholars of the Children of Israel whose supplication was acceptable. They used to seek his lead in suplication in times of difficulty. Allah&#8217;s Prophet Musa sent him to the King of Madyan to call him to Allah. That king appeased him and gave him land and gifts, and he reverted from the religion of Musa and followed the king&#8217;s religion.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Imran bin `Uyaynah narrated that `Husayn said that `Imran bin Al-Harith said that Ibn `Abbas said, <span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;He is Bal`am son of Ba`ura&#8217;.&#8221;</span> Similar was said by Mujahid and `Ikrimah. Therefore, it is well-known that this honorable Ayah was revealed about a man from the Children of Israel in ancient times, according to Ibn Mas`ud and several others among the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;He is a man from the city of the tyrants (Jerusalem) whose name was Bal`am and who knew Allah&#8217;s Greatest Name.&#8221; `Ali bin Abi Talhah also reported that Ibn `Abbas that he said, &#8220;When Musa and those with him went to the city of the tyrants (Jerusalem), the cousins of Bal`am and his people came to him and said, `Musa is a strong man, and he has many soldiers. If he gains the upper hand over us, we will be destroyed. Therefore, supplicate to Allah that He prevents Musa and those with him from prevailing over us.&#8217; Bal`am said, `If I supplicate to Allah that He turns back Musa and those with him, I will lose in this life and the Hereafter.&#8217; They kept luring him until he supplicated against Musa and his people, and Allah took away what he bestowed on him (of knowledge). Hence Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(but he threw them away; so Shaytan followed him up).&#8221;</strong>&#8216; Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And had We willed, We would surely have elevated him therewith but he clung to the earth and followed his own vain desires.)</strong> Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And had We willed, We would surely have elevated him therewith)</strong> from the filth of this earthly life through the Ayat that We gave him knowledge of,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(but he clung to the earth)</strong>, he became interested in the adornment of this life and its delights. He indulged in the lusts of life and its joys and was deceived by it, just as life deceived others like him, without sound comprehension or a good mind. Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar narrated from Salim, from Abu An-Nadr that when Musa entered the land of Bani Canaan in the area of Ash-Sham (Greater Syria), the people of Bal`am came to him, saying, &#8220;This is Musa, son of `Imran with the Children of Israel. He wants to drive us out from our land, kill us and replace us with the Children of Israel. We are your people and have no other dwelling area. You are a person whose supplication is acceptable (to Allah), so go out and supplicate to Allah against them.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Woe to you! Here is Allah&#8217;s Prophet (Musa) with whom the angels and believers are! How can I supplicate against them when I know from Allah what I know&#8221; They said, &#8220;We have no other dwelling area.&#8221; So they kept luring and begging him until he was tempted by the trial and went on his donkey towards Mount Husban, which was behind the Israelite military barracks. When he proceeded on the Mount for a while, the donkey sat down and refused to proceed. He got off the donkey and struck it until it stood up again and he rode it. The donkey did the same after a little while, and he struck it again until it stood up&#8230; So he proceeded and tried to supplicate against Musa and his people. However, Allah made his tongue mention his people with evil and the Children of Israel with good instead of his people, who protested, &#8220;O Bal`am! What are you doing You are supplicating for them and against us!&#8221; He said, &#8220;It is against my will. This is a matter that Allah has decided.&#8221; He then said to them, as his tongue was made to loll out of his mouth, &#8220;Now I have lost this life and the Hereafter.&#8221; This Ayah was revealed about the story of Bal`am son of Ba`ura&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And recite to them the story of him to whom We gave Our Ayat, but he threw them away.)</strong>, until,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(perhaps they may reflect.)</strong> Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(So his parable is the parable of a dog: if you drive him away, he pants, or if you leave him alone, he (still) pants.)</strong> Scholars of Tafsir have conflicting opinions regarding the meaning of this Ayah. Some scholars said that it refers to the end of Bal`am&#8217;s tongue which flickered out of his mouth, as in the story narrated from Ibn Ishaq, from Salim, from Abu An-Nadr. Therefore, his example is the example of the dog, its tongue pants regardless of whether it is driven away or not. It was also said that the meaning here is a parable of this man &#8212; and his like &#8212; concerning their misguidance, persisting the wrong path and not being able to benefit from faith or comprehend what they are being called to. So his example is that of a dog which pants whether it was driven away or left alone. The person described here does not benefit from the advice or the call to faith, just as if the advice and call never occurred. Allah said in another Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(It is the same to them (disbelievers) whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe.)</strong></span>(2:6) and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Whether you ask forgiveness for them (hypocrites) or ask not forgiveness for them &#8212; (and even) if you ask seventy times for their forgiveness &#8212; Allah will not forgive them.)</span> </strong>(9:80) and similar Ayat. It was also said that the meaning here, is that the heart of the disbeliever, the hypocrite and the wicked is weak and devoid of guidance. Therefore, it keeps faltering. Similar was narrated from Al-Hasan Al-Basri.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(So relate the stories, perhaps they may reflect)</strong> Allah said next to His Prophet Muhammad ﷺ ,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(So relate the stories, perhaps they may)</strong> the Children of Israel, who have knowledge ot the story of Bal`am and what happened to him when Allah allowed him to stray and expelled him from His mercy. Allah favored him by teaching him His Greatest Name, by which, if He is asked, He will grant, and if He is called upon, He answers. But Bal`am used it in disobedience to Allah and invoked Him against His own party of the people of faith, followers of His servant and Messenger during that time, Musa, the son of `Imran, peace be upon him, whom Allah spoke to directly,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(perhaps they may reflect.)</strong> and avoid Bal`am&#8217;s behavior, for Allah has given the Jews knowledge and made them superior to the bedouins surrounding them. He gave them the description of Muhammad ﷺ which would allow them to recognize him, as they recognize their own children. They, among people, have the most right to follow, aid and support Muhammad ﷺ , in obedience to their Prophets who informed them of him and commanded them to follow him. Therefore, whoever among them defies the knowledge in their Books or hides it from the servants, Allah will place disgrace on him in this life, followed by humiliation in the Hereafter. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Evil is the parable of the people who rejected Our Ayat.)</strong> Allah says, evil is the example of the people who deny Our Ayat in that they are equated with dogs that have no interest but to collect food and satisfy lusts.&#8217; Therefore, whoever goes out of the area of knowledge and guidance, and seeks satisfaction for his lusts and vain desires, is just like a dog; what an evil example. The Sahih recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(The evil example is not suitable for us: he who goes back on his gift is just like the dog that eats its vomit.)</strong> Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(and they used to wrong themselves.)</strong> means, Allah did not wrong them, but they wronged themselves by rejecting guidance, not obeying the Lord, being content with this life that will soon end, all the while seeking to fulfill desires and obey lusts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(178. Whomsoever Allah guides, he is the guided one, and whomsoever He sends astray, &#8212; then those! They are the losers.) </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says, whomever He leads aright, then none can lead him to misguidance, and whomever He leads astray, will have acquired failure, loss and sure misguidance. Verily, whatever Allah wills occurs; and whatever He does not will, does not occur. A Hadith narrated from `Abdullah bin Mas`ud reads,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">(All praise is due to Allah, Whom we praise and seek help, guidance and forgiveness from. We seek refuge with Allah from the evils within ourselves and from the burden of our evil deeds. He whom Allah guides, will never be misled; and he whom He misguides, will never have one who will guide him. I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah without partners and that Muhammad ﷺ is His servant and Messenger.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The complete Hadith was collected by Imam Ahmad and the collectors of Sunan and others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Come not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is Fahishah (immoral sin) and an evil way.&#8221;</strong></span> &#8211;  Surah No.17 Al-Isra , Aaayat 32</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says, forbidding His servants to commit Zina or to approach it or to do anything that may lead to it:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And come not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is a Fahishah (immoral sin)) meaning a major sin,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(and an evil way.)</strong> meaning, a terrible way to behave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded Abu Umamah saying that a young man came to the Prophet ﷺ and said, <strong>&#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Give me permission to commit Zina (unlawful sex).&#8221;</strong> The people surrounded him and rebuked him, saying, &#8220;Stop! Stop!&#8221; But the Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Come close)</strong> The young man came to him, and he ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Sit down)</strong> so he sat down. The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Would you like it (unlawful sex) for your mother)</strong> He said, &#8220;No, by Allah, may I be ransomed for you.&#8221; The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Neither do the people like it for their mothers.)</strong> The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Would you like it for your daughter)</strong> He said, &#8220;No, by Allah, may I be ransomed for you.&#8221; The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Neither do the people like it for their daughters. )</strong> The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Would you like it for your sister)</strong> He said, &#8220;No, by Allah, may I be ransomed for you.&#8221; The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Neither do the people like it for their sisters.)</strong> The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Would you like it for your paternal aunt)</strong> He said, &#8220;No, by Allah, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! may I be ransomed for you.&#8221; The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Neither do the people like it for their paternal aunts.)</strong> The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Would you like it for your maternal aunt)</strong> He said, &#8220;No, by Allah, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! may I be ransomed for you.&#8221; The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Neither do the people like it for their maternal aunts.)</strong> Then the Prophet ﷺ put his hand on him and said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(O Allah, forgive his sin, purify his heart and guard his chastity.)</strong> After that the young man never paid attention to anything of that nature.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Or like the one who passed by a town in ruin up to its roofs. He said: &#8220;How will Allah ever bring it to life after its death&#8221; So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up (again). He said: &#8220;How long did you remain (dead)&#8221; He (the man) said: &#8220;(Perhaps) I remained (dead) a day or part of a day.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Nay, you have remained (dead) for a hundred years, look at your food and your drink, they show no change; and look at your donkey! And thus We have made of you a sign for the people. Look at the bones, how We bring them together and clothe them with flesh.&#8221; When this was clearly shown to him, he said, &#8220;I know (now) that Allah is able to do all things.&#8221;</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 2.259)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(Have you not looked at him who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord)</span> means, &#8220;Have you seen anyone like the person who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord&#8221; Then, Allah connected the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(Or like the one who passed by a town in ruin up to its roofs)</span> to the Ayah above by using `or&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Ali bin Abi Talib said that the Ayah (2:259) meant `Uzayr. Ibn Jarir also reported it, and this explanation was also reported by Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim from Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Sulayman bin Buraydah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujahid bin Jabr said that the Ayah refers to a man from the Children of Israel, and the village was Jerusalem, after Nebuchadnezzar destroyed it and killed its people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(in ruin)</span> means, it became empty of people. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(up to its roofs)</span> indicates that the roofs and walls (of the village) fell to the ground. `Uzayr stood contemplating about what had happened to that city, after a great civilization used to inhabit it. He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(Oh! How will Allah ever bring it to life after its death)</span> because of the utter destruction he saw and the implausibility of its returning to what it used to be. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up (again).)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The city was rebuilt seventy years after the man (`Uzayr) died, and its inhabitants increased and the Children of Israel moved back to it. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>When Allah resurrected `Uzayr after he died, the first organ that He resurrected were his eyes, so that he could witness what Allah does with him, how He brings life back to his body.</strong></span> When his resurrection was complete, Allah said to him, meaning through the angel,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(&#8220;How long did you remain (dead)&#8221; He (the man) said: &#8220;(Perhaps) I remained (dead) a day or part of a day.&#8221;)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars said that since the man died in the early part of the day and Allah resurrected him in the latter part of the day, when he saw that the sun was still apparent, he thought that it was the sun of that very day. He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(&#8220;Or part of a day. &#8221; He said: &#8220;Nay, you have remained (dead) for a hundred years, look at your food and your drink, they show no change.&#8221;)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He had grapes, figs and juice, and he found them as he left them; neither did the juice spoil nor the figs become bitter nor the grapes rot.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(And look at your donkey!),</span> &#8220;How Allah brings it back to life while you are watching.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(And thus We have made of you a sign for the people)</span> that Resurrection occurs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(Look at the bones, how We Nunshizuha)</span> meaning, collect them and put them back together. In his Mustadrak, Al-Hakim, recorded that Kharijah bin Zayd bin Thabit said that his father said that the Messenger of Allah read this Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(how We Nunshizuha.)</span> Al-Hakim said; &#8220;Its chain is Sahih and they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not record it.&#8221; The Ayah was also read,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(نُنْشِرُهَا)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Nunshiruha&#8221; meaning, bring them back to life, as Mujahid stated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(And clothe them with flesh. )</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Suddi said, &#8221; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>`Uzayr observed the bones of his donkey, which were scattered all around him to his right and left, and Allah sent a wind that collected the bones from all over the area. Allah then brought every bone to its place, until they formed a full donkey made of fleshless bones. Allah then covered these bones with flesh, nerves, veins and skin. Allah sent an angel who blew life in the donkeys&#8217; nostrils, and the donkey started to bray by Allah&#8217;s leave.&#8221; All this occurred while `Uzayr was watching</strong></span>, and this is when he proclaimed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(He said, &#8220;I know (now) that Allah is able to do all things,&#8221;)</span> meaning, &#8220;I know that, and I did witness it with my own eyes. Therefore, I am the most knowledgeable in this matter among the people of my time.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THE BIOGRAPHY OF AL-HAAFIZ IBN KATHEER</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is: the Imaam, the Haafiz, the Shaikh of the Muhadditheen, the Historian, the Explainer of the Qur·aan, `Imaaduddeen Abul-Fidaa· Ismaa`eel ibn `Umar ibn Katheer ibn Daw· ibn Katheer ibn Zar`, al-Qurashee; al-Busrawee, then ad-Dimashqee, the jurist, ash-Shaafi`ee. [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was born in Mijdal, a village to the east of Busraa-which is a town in the province of Damascus, in the year 701 H, where his father was a Khateeb.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the death of his father he moved, along with his brother Kamaaluddeen `AbdulWahhaab, to Damascus, in the year 707 H. He memorized the whole of the Qur·aan at the age of ten, and he read the different recitations,<br />
and he excelled in tafseer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He married Zaynab the daughter of al-Haafiz Abul-Hajjaaj al-Mizzee, and he closely accompanied him and learned from him. He gave great attention to the science of hadeeth, and qualified under him in it. He also accompanied Shaikhul-Islaam Taqiyyuddeen Ibn Taimiyyah and was a special student of his and defended him, and he followed him upon many of his opinions. He used to deliver verdicts in accordance with his view concerning the question of the three simultaneous divorces, that they count as a single divorce, and he was put to trial on account of this and suffered harm.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He gave attention to memorising the texts; and to awareness of the chains of narration, the hidden defects in narrations, the narrators, and to history, to the extent that he excelled in all of that whilst he was still a youth. He delivered verdicts, taught and debated. He excelled in Fiqh, Tafseer, and Arabic Grammar. He closely studied the narrators and the hidden defects in narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He became the Shaikh of the Saalihiyyah School, after the death of adh-Dhahabee; and the Shaikh of Daarul-Hadeeth al-Ashrafiyyah for a short while after the death of as-Subkee. Then this was taken from him after it was seized by Kamaaluddeen al-Ma`arree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">HIS SCHOLARLY STATUS:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer had prominent status as is clear from the institutions of knowledge he headed; and the mosques in which he taught; and the works of Tafseer, History, and Hadeeth that he authored.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the schools that he took charge of, then they were: The Ashrafiyyah School of Hadeeth, the school of as-Saalihiyyah, the school of an-Najeebiyyah, the school of at-Tankaziyyah, and the school of an-Nooriyyah al-Kubraa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These were schools sought after by the students of knowledge from the east and the west, and their Shaikhs and teachers had high status. None were allowed to teach in them except those who were firmly grounded in knowledge and whose position amongst the scholars was established. Therefore, the scholars respected him and the hearts of the students of knowledge were attentive to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the mosques in which he delivered his lessons, then the most famous of them were &#8220;alJaami` al-Amawee&#8221;, the mosque of Ibn Hishaam, the Jaami` of Tankaz, the Jaami` of alFooqaanee-and he used to deliver the Khutbah in it also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This being in addition to his writings which have filled the earth with knowledge, and from which people have benefitted in his lifetime and after his death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE SCHOLARS PRAISE OF HIM:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">adh-Dhahabee said: “The jurist, the muftee, the muhaddith&#8230; he gave special attention to the narrators, to the texts, and to acquiring knowledge of Fiqh. He elucidated, wrote works, debated, authored, explained (the Qur·aan), and attained precedence&#8230;” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said: “The imaam, the jurist, the muhaddith, the singular and outstanding scholar&#8230; He was a jurist knowledgeable in various fields, a precise muhaddith, a critical and verifying explainer (of the Qur·aan). He produced beneficial works. He was well aware of Fiqh, and had good understanding of Arabic and the Fundamentals (of Fiqh). He memorized a good portion of the texts, of tafseer, and the narrators. He heard (narrations) from me, and had good memorisation.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hajjee said: “I never came to him except that I benefitted from him, and I was his constant companion for six years.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Habeeb said, as quoted from him by Imaam Ibn Hajr:[4] “He was an imaam, frequent upon tasbeeh [5] and tahleel [6], and he was at the head of the scholars of explanation (of the Qur·aan). He heard, gathered, and authored. People strove to listen to his sayings. He spoke in a manner that delighted, he narrated, and he brought benefit. The pages of his verdicts were sent to the lands, and he became famous for precision and verification. He attained leadership in knowledge in History, Hadeeth, and Tafseer.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul-Mahaasin ad-Dimashqee said: “He delivered verdicts and taught. He debated and excelled in Fiqh, Tafseer, and Grammar. He carefully studied the narrators and the hidden defects of narrations.” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Haafiz Ibn Hajr said: “He could bring a great deal to mind, and he joked in a fine manner. His works spread throughout the lands within his life-time, and the people derived benefit through him after his death.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-`Aynee said, as quoted from him by Ibn Taghreebardee: “He was the example amongst the scholars and the great memorizers, and the reference point for the people of meanings and wordings. He heard, gathered, compiled, taught, narrated, and wrote works. He had an abundance of knowledge and awareness of Hadeeth, Tafseer, and History. He became famous for precision and verification. He attained the limit in knowledge of History, Hadeeth, and Tafseer; and he wrote many beneficial works.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>HIS `AQEEDAH (CREED AND BELIEF):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He -rahimahullaahu ta`aalaa- was upon the `Aqeedah of the Salafus-Saalih (the Pious Predecessors). This is proven by his tremendous Tafseer, which is the most excellent tafseer that has made the `Aqeedah of the Salaf manifest. An example of that is his saying, in his explanation of His Saying -He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: Then He ascended over the Throne]]:<br />
[Sooratul-A`raaf (7): 54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Regarding this we follow the position of the Salafus-Saalih: Maalik, al-Awzaa`ee, athThawree, al-Layth ibn Sa`d, ash-Shaafi`ee, Ahmad, Ishaaq ibn Raahawaih, and others from the imaams of the Muslims, in the earlier and the later times: (and it is to let them pass)10 without saying how (takyeef),without declaring resemblance to the creation (tashbeeh), and without negating the attributes (ta`teel). Furthermore, what is immediately apparent to the minds of those who hold that the Creator resembles the creation is something negated for Allaah-the Most High, since nothing from the creation resembles Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing]].” [Sooratush-Shooraa (42): 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>HIS MOST PROMINENT TEACHERS:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer studied under many famous major Shaikhs, and the most important of them are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) Shaikhul-Islaam Taqiyyuddeen Ahmad ibn `Abdil-`Azeem ibn `Abdil-Haleem ibn `AbdisSalaam ibn Taimiyyah, who died in 728 H. al-`Iraaqee said within his biography of Ibn Katheer: “He was an especially close student of Shaikh Taqiyyuddeen Ibn Taimiyyah, and he defended him, and he followed him upon many of his views.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) The Imaam, al-Haafiz, the Muhaddith of Shaam, Jamaaluddeen, Abul-Hajjaaj Yoosuf ibn az-Zakee `Abdir-Rahmaan al-Mizzee, who died in 742 H. Ibn Katheer closely accompanied him, and married his daughter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3) The Imaam, al-Haafiz, the Muhaddith, the Historian of Islaam, Shamsuddeen, Aboo `Abdillaah Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn`Uthmaan adh-Dhahabee, at-Turkumaanee in his origin, ad-Dimashqee. The author of beneficial works such as &#8220;Siyar A`laamin-Nubalaa·&#8221;, &#8220;Taareekhul-Islaam&#8221;, and &#8220;Meezaanul-I`tidaal&#8221;. He died in 748 H.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And it is Allah Who sends the winds, so that they raise up the clouds, and We drive them to a dead land, and revive therewith the earth after its death. As such (will be) the Resurrection!</strong> <span style="color:#999999;">( Surah Faatir 35:09)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Evidence of Life after Death</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Often Allah refers to the Resurrection by using the analogy of the earth coming back to life after it has died, as in the beginning of Surat Al-Hajj, where He urges His servants to draw the lesson of the former from the latter. For the earth is dead and lifeless, with nothing growing in it, then He sends to it clouds which bring water, which He sends down upon it,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#339966;"><span style="color:#ff9900;"><span style="color:#339966;">(it is stirred (to life), and it swells and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth))</span> </span></span></strong>(22:5). So too, when Allah wishes to resurrect the bodies, He will send rain from beneath the Throne which will cover the whole earth, and the bodies will grow in their graves like seeds grow in the earth. It says in the Sahih:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>Every part of the son of Adam will disintegrate apart from the coccyx, from which he was created and from him he will be made anew</strong>.) Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#339966;"><strong>As such (will be) the Resurrection!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">According to the Hadith of Abu Raz0n: I said, O Messenger of Allah, how will Allah bring the dead back to life? What is the sign of that in His creation? He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Abu Razin, do you not pass through the valley of your people (and see it) arid and barren, then you pass through it (and see it) stirred (to life) and green) I said, `Yes.&#8217; He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Thus will Allah bring the dead back to life.)&#8221;</p>

(darussalam english publication)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Righteous Deeds ascend to Allah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(To Him ascend the good words,)</span> means, words of remembrance, recitation of Qur&#8217;an, and supplications. This was the view of more than one of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jarir recorded that Al-Mukhariq bin Sulaym said that &#8220;`Abdullah bin Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, said to them, &#8220;If we tell you a Hadith, we will bring you proof of it from the Book of Allah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>When the Muslim servants says, `Glory and praise be to Allah, there is no god worthy of worship except Allah, Allah is Most Great and blessed be Allah,&#8217; an angel takes these words and puts them under his wing, then he ascends with them to the heaven. He does not take them past any group of angels but they seek forgiveness for the one who said them, until he brings them before Allah, may He be glorified.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, recited:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">(To Him ascend the good words, and the righteous deeds exalt it).&#8221;</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that An-Nu`man bin Bashir, may Allah be pleased with him, said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>(Those who remember Allah and glory Allah by saying, `Glory be to Allah, Allah is most Great, all praise is due to Allah and La ilaha illallah, these words go around the Throne buzzing like bees, mentioning those who said them. Would one of you not like to have something with Allah mentioning him)&#8221;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was also recorded by Ibn Majah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(and the righteous deeds exalt it).</span> Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The good word is the remembrance of Allah, may He be exalted, which is taken up to Allah, and the righteous deed is the performance of obligatory duties. Whoever remembers Allah when doing an obligatory duty, his deed carries his remembrance of Allah and takes it up to Allah, may He be exalted. Whoever remembers Allah and does not perform the obligatory duties, his words will be rejected, as will his deed.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(36. Verily, the number of months with Allah is twelve months (in a year), so was it ordained by Allah on the Day when He created the heavens and the earth; <strong>of them four are sacred</strong>. That is the right religion, so <strong>wrong not yourselves therein</strong>, and fight against the Mushrikin idolaters collectively as they fight against you collectively. But know that Allah is with those who have Taqwa.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Soorat at-Tawbah 9:36</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Year consists of Twelve Months</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Bakrah said that the Prophet said in a speech during his Hajj,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The division of time has turned to its original form which was current when Allah created the heavens and the earth. The year is of twelve months, out of which four months are sacred: Three are in succession Dhul-Qa`dah, Dhul-Hijjah and Muharram, and (the fourth is) Rajab of (the tribe of) Mudar which comes between Jumada (Ath-Thaniyah) and Sha`ban.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet then asked, (What is the day today&#8217;) We said, &#8220;Allah and His Messenger know better. He kept quiet until we thought that he might give that day another name. He said (Isn&#8217;t it the day of Nahr) We replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He further asked, (Which month is this) We again said, &#8220;Allah and His Messenger know better,&#8221; and he kept quiet and made us think that he might give it another name. Then he said,(Isn&#8217;t it the month of Dhul-Hijjah) We replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He asked, (What town is this) We said, &#8220;Allah and His Messenger know better,&#8221; and he kept quiet until we thought that he might change its name. He asked, (Isn&#8217;t this the (Sacred) Town) We said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Verily! Your blood, property and honor are sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of yours, in this month of yours and in this city of yours. Verily, you will meet your Lord and He will question you about your actions. Behold! Do not revert to misguidance after me by striking the necks of one another. Have I conveyed It is incumbent upon those who are present to inform those who are absent, because those who are absent might comprehend (what I have said) better than some who are present.)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari and Muslim collected this Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a small book collected by Shaykh `Alam ad-Din As-Sakhawi, entitled, Al-Mashhur fi Asma&#8217; Al-Ayam wash-Shuhur, he mentioned that <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Muharram is so named because it is a sacred month. To me, it was so named to emphasize its sacredness.</strong></span> This is because the Arabs would switch it around. One year they would say it was a sacred month, the following year they would say that it was not. The author said, &#8220;&#8230;and <strong>Safar</strong> is so named because they used to leave their homes during that month for fighting and traveling. When saying `Safir&#8217; a place, it means to leave it&#8230; <strong>Rabi` Al-Awwal</strong> is called that because they used to do Irtiba` in it, that is to maintain one&#8217;s property&#8230; and <strong>Rabi` Al-Akhir</strong>, was so named for the same reasons. <strong>Jumada</strong> is called that because the water would dry up (Jamud) then&#8230;.They say <strong>Jumada Al-Uwla</strong> and <strong>Al-Awwal</strong>, or Jumada Al-Akhar or Al-Akhirah. <strong>Rajab</strong> comes from Tarjib, meaning to honor. <strong>Sha`ban</strong> because the tribes would separate and return to their homes. <strong>Ramadan</strong> was so named because of the severity of the Ramda&#8217; &#8211; that is &#8211; the heat, and they say that the branch Ramadat when it is thirsty&#8230;And the saying that it is a Name of Allah is a mistake, for there is no proof or support for that&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">The Sacred Months</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(of them four are sacred).</strong></span> The Arabs used to consider these months sacred during the time of Jahiliyyah, except for a group of them called Al-Basl, who held eight months of the year to be sacred as way of exaggeration in religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(Three are in succession; Dhul-Qa`dah, Dhul-Hijjah and Muharram, and (the fourth is) Rajab of (the tribe of) Mudar which comes between Jumada (Ath-Thani) and Sha`ban).</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said &#8220;Rajab of Mudar&#8221; to attest to the custom of Mudar, in saying that Rajab is the month that is between Jumada and Sha`ban, not as the tribe of Rabi`ah thought, that it is between Sha`ban and Shawwal, which is Ramadan in the present calendar. The four Sacred Months were made four, three in succession and one alone, so that the Hajj and `Umrah are performed with ease. Dhul-Qa`dah, the month before the Hajj month, was made sacred because they refrained from fighting during that month. Dhul-Hijjah, the next month, was made sacred because it is the month of Hajj, during which they performed Hajj rituals. <strong>Muharram, which comes next, was made sacred so that they are able to go back to their areas in safety after performing Hajj</strong>. Rajab, in the middle of the lunar year, was made sacred so that those coming from the farthest areas of Arabia are able to perform `Umrah and visit the House and then go back to their areas safely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(That is the right religion),</span> that is the Straight Law, requiring implementing Allah&#8217;s order concerning the months that He made sacred and their true count as it was originally written by Allah. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(so wrong not yourselves therein)</span> during these Sacred Months, for sin in them is worse than sin in other months. Likewise, sins in the Sacred City are written multiplied,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;and whoever inclines to evil actions therein (in Makkah) or to do wrong, him We shall cause to taste from a painful torment) 22:25. <strong>Similarly, sin in general is worse during the Sacred Months</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali bin Abi Talhah narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Verily, the number of months with Allah&#8230;),</span> is connected to</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(so wrong not yourselves therein),</span> &#8220;In all (twelve) months. Allah then chose four out of these months and made them sacred, emphasizing their sanctity, making sinning in them greater, in addition to, multiplying rewards of righteous deeds during them.&#8221; Qatadah said about Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(so wrong not yourselves therein)</span>, <strong>&#8220;Injustice during the Sacred Months is worse and graver than injustice in other months. Verily, injustice is always wrong, but Allah makes things graver than others as He will.&#8221;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Allah has chosen some of His creation above others. He chose Messengers from angels and from men. He also chose His Speech above all speech, the Masajid above other areas of the earth, Ramadan and the Sacred Months above all months, Friday above the other days and Laylatul-Qadr (The Night of Decree) above all nights. Therefore, sanctify what Allah has sanctified, for doing so is the practice of people of understanding and comprehension.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Fighting in the Sacred Months</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(and fight against the idolators collectively),</span> all of you,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(as they fight against you collectively.)</span>, all of them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(But know that Allah is with those who have Taqwa)</span>, and know that initiating battle during the Sacred Months is forbidden. Allah said in other Ayat,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(O you who believe! Violate not the sanctity of the symbols of Allah, nor of the sacred month.)</span> 5:2,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(The Sacred Month is for the Sacred Month, and for the prohibited things, there is the law of equality (Qisas). Then whoever transgresses the prohibition against you, you transgress likewise against him)</span> 2:194, and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Then when the Sacred Months have passed, kill the idolators&#8230;)</span> 9:5. As for Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(And fight against the idolators collectively as they fight against you collectively)</span>, it includes permission for the believers to fight the idolators in the Sacred Month, if the idolators initiate hostilities therein. Allah said in other Ayat,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(The Sacred Month is for the Sacred Month, and for the prohibited things, there is the law of equality (Qisas))</span> 2:194, and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(And fight not with them at Al-Masjid Al-Haram, unless they (first) fight you there. But if they attack you, then kill them.)</span> 2:191.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Messenger of Allah laying siege to At-Ta&#8217;if until the Sacred Month started, it was a continuation of the battle against Hawazin and their allies from Thaqif. They started the fighting and gathered their men for the purpose of conducting war. The Messenger of Allah marched to meet them and when they took refuge in At-Ta&#8217;if, the Prophet laid siege to them so that they descend from their forts, but they inflicted casualties on Muslims. The siege continued for about forty days, during which a Sacred Month began, and the siege continued for several days in that month. The Messenger broke the siege and went back (to Makkah). So fighting that carries over into it the Sacred Month is not the same as initiating warfare during it, Allah knows best.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Source for the Below</strong>: Tafseer ibn Kathir , Surah Al Imran , Darussalam eng Publication</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">It is He Who has sent down to you the Book. In it are verses that are entirely clear, they are the foundations of the Book; and others not entirely clear. So as for those in whose hearts there is a deviation (from the truth) they follow (only) that which is not entirely clear thereof, seeking Al-Fitnah, and seeking its Ta&#8217;wil, but none knows its Ta&#8217;wil except Allah. And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge say: &#8220;We believe in it; all of it is from our Lord.&#8221; And none receive admonition except men of understanding.)  (They say): &#8220;Our Lord! Let not our hearts deviate (from the truth) after You have guided us, and grant us mercy from You. Truly, You are the Bestower.&#8221; </span></em>(Surah Al Imran Verse 7-8)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Mutashabihat and Muhkamat Ayat </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah states that in the Qur&#8217;an, there are Ayat that are Muhkamat, entirely clear and plain, and these are the foundations of the Book which are plain for everyone. And there are Ayat in the Qur&#8217;an that are Mutashabihat not entirely clear for many, or some people. So those who refer to the Muhkam Ayat to understand the Mutashabih Ayat, will have acquired the correct guidance, and vice versa. This is why Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(They are the foundations of the Book),</strong> meaning, they are the basis of the Qur&#8217;an, and should be referred to for clarification, when warranted,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And others not entirely clear)</strong> as they have several meanings, some that agree with the Muhkam and some that carry other literal indications, although these meaning might not be desired.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muhkamat are the Ayat that explain the abrogating rulings, the allowed, prohibited, laws, limits, obligations and rulings that should be believed in and implemented. As for the Mutashabihat Ayat, they include the abrogated Ayat, parables, oaths, and what should be believed in, but not implemented.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar commented on,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(In it are verses that are entirely clear)</strong> as &#8220;Containing proof of the Lord, immunity for the servants and a refutation of opponents and of falsehood. They cannot be changed or altered from what they were meant for.&#8221; He also said, &#8220;As for the unclear Ayat, they can (but must not) be altered and changed, and this is a test from Allah to the servants, just as He tested them with the allowed and prohibited things. So these Ayat must not be altered to imply a false meaning or be distorted from the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(So as for those in whose hearts there is a deviation)</strong> meaning, those who are misguided and deviate from truth to falsehood,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(they follow that which is not entirely clear thereof)</strong> meaning, they refer to the Mutashabih, because they are able to alter its meanings to conform with their false interpretation since the wordings of the Mutashabihat encompass such a wide area of meanings. As for the Muhkam Ayat, they cannot be altered because they are clear and, thus, constitute unequivocal proof against the misguided people. This is why Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(seeking Al-Fitnah)</strong> meaning, they seek to misguide their following by pretending to prove their innovation by relying on the Qur&#8217;an &#8212; the Mutashabih of it &#8212; but, this is proof against and not for them. For instance, Christians might claim that ﴿`Isa is divine because﴾ the Qur&#8217;an states that he is Ruhullah and His Word, which He gave to Mary, all the while ignoring Allah&#8217;s statements,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">(He ﴿`Isa﴾ was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him.)</span></em> ﴿43:59﴾, and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">(Verily, the likeness of `Isa before Allah is the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust, then (He) said to him: &#8220;Be!&#8221; and he was.)</span></em> ﴿3:59﴾.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are other Ayat that clearly assert that `Isa is but one of Allah&#8217;s creatures and that he is the servant and Messenger of Allah, among other Messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And seeking for its Ta&#8217;wil,)</strong> to alter them as they desire. Imam Ahmad recorded that `A&#8217;ishah said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah recited,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(It is He Who has sent down to you the Book. In it are verses that are entirely clear, they are the foundations of the Book; and others not entirely clear,)</strong>, until,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Men of understanding)</strong> and he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(When you see those who argue in it (using the Mutashabihat), then they are those whom Allah meant. Therefore, beware of them.)&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari recorded a similar Hadith in the Tafsir of this Ayah ﴿3:7﴾, as did Muslim in the book of Qadar (the Divine Will) in his Sahih, and Abu Dawud in the Sunnah section of his Sunan, from `A&#8217;ishah; &#8220;The Messenger of Allah recited this Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(It is He Who has sent down to you the Book. In it are verses that are entirely clear,)</strong> until,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And none receive admonition except men of understanding.)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(When you see those who follow what is not so clear of the Qur&#8217;an, then they are those whom Allah described, so beware of them.)&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the wording recorded by Al-Bukhari.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Only Allah Knows the True Ta&#8217;wil (Interpretation) of the Mutashabihat </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(But none knows its Ta&#8217;wil except Allah.)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, as preceded in what has been reported from Ibn `Abbas, &#8220;Tafsir is of four types: Tafsir that the Arabs know in their language; Tafsir that no one is excused of being ignorant of; Tafsir that the scholars know; and Tafsir that only Allah knows.&#8221; Scholars of Qur&#8217;an recitation have different opinions about pausing at Allah&#8217;s Name in this Ayah. This stop was reported from `A&#8217;ishah, `Urwah, Abu Ash-Sha`tha&#8217; and Abu Nahik.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some pause after reciting,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge)</strong> saying that the Qur&#8217;an does not address the people with what they cannot understand. Ibn Abi Najih said that Mujahid said that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;I am among those who are firmly grounded in its Ta&#8217;wil interpretation.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah supplicated for the benefit of Ibn `Abbas,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Allah! Bestow on him knowledge in the religion and teach him the Ta&#8217;wil (interpretation).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ta&#8217;wil has two meanings in the Qur&#8217;an, the true reality of things, and what they will turn out to be. For instance, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And he said: &#8220;O my father! This is the Ta&#8217;wil of my dream aforetime!&#8221;.) ﴿12:100﴾, and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Await they just for it&#8217;s Ta&#8217;wil On the Day (Day of Resurrection) it&#8217;s Ta&#8217;wil is finally fulfillled.)(7:53) refers to the true reality of Resurrection that they were told about. If this is the meaning desired in the Ayah above ﴿3:7﴾, then pausing after reciting Allah&#8217;s Name is warranted, because only Allah knows the true reality of things. In this case, Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge)</strong> is connected to His statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(say: &#8220;We believe in it&#8221;)</strong> If the word Ta&#8217;wil means the second meaning, that is, explaining and describing, such as what Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>((They said): &#8220;Inform us of the Ta&#8217;wil of this&#8221;)</strong> meaning its explanation, then pausing after reciting,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge)</strong> is warranted. This is because the scholars have general knowledge in, and understand what they were addressed with, even though they do not have knowledge of the true reality of things. Therefore, Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(say: &#8220;We believe in it&#8221;)</strong> describes the conduct of the scholars. Similarly, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">(And your Lord comes, and the angels, in rows.)</span></em> ﴿89:22﴾ means, your Lord will come, and the angels will come in rows.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement that the knowledgeable people proclaim,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(We believe in it)</strong> means, they believe in the Mutashabih.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(all of it is from our Lord)</strong> meaning, both the Muhkam and the Mutashabih are true and authentic, and each one of them testifies to the truth of the other. This is because they both are from Allah and nothing that comes from Allah is ever met by contradiction or discrepancy. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">(Do they not then consider the Qur&#8217;an carefully Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein many a contradiction.)</span></em> ﴿4:82﴾.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said in his Ayah ﴿3:7﴾,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And none receive admonition except men of understanding. )</strong> meaning, those who have good minds and sound comprehension, understand, contemplate and comprehend the meaning in the correct manner. Further, Ibn Al-Mundhir recorded in his Tafsir that Nafi` bin Yazid said, &#8220;Those firmly grounded in knowledge are those who are modest for Allah&#8217;s sake, humbly seek His pleasure, and do not exaggerate regarding those above them, or belittle those below them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said that they supplicate to their Lord,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Our Lord! Let not our hearts deviate (from the truth) after You have guided us.)</strong> meaning, &#8220;Do not deviate our hearts from the guidance after You allowed them to acquire it. Do not make us like those who have wickedness in their hearts, those who follow the Mutashabih in the Qur&#8217;an. Rather, make us remain firmly on Your straight path and true religion.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And grant us from Ladunka)</strong> meaning, from You,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Mercy)</strong> with which You make our hearts firm, and increase in our Faith and certainty,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Truly, You are the Bestower)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir recorded that Umm Salamah said that the Prophet used to supplicate,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O You Who changes the hearts, make my heart firm on Your religion.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then recited,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(&#8220;Our Lord! Let not our hearts deviate (from the truth) after You have guided us, and grant us mercy from You. Truly, You are the Bestower.&#8221;)</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">These audio lessons are a translation of the above book by the famous scholar Ibn Katheer, along with side points discussing the authenticity of the narrations mentioned, as well as other beneficial narrations. An extremely valuable resource given the lack of authentic material on the subject of the life of our beloved Prophet (sallAllaahu&#8217;alaihiwasallam).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">[From &#8220;<em>Saheehus-Seeratin-Nabawiyyah</em>&#8216; (pp.80-81), Shaikh al-Albaanee &#8211; <em>rahimahullaah&#8217;s</em>&#8211; verified edition of al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer &#8211;<em>rahimahullaah&#8217;s</em>&#8211; &#8220;<em>as-Seeratun-Nabawiyyah</em>&#8216;.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Awf ibn Maalik al-Ashja`ee, who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) went off one day, and I was with him, until we entered a synagogue of the Jews (in al-Madeenah, on a festival day of theirs, and they disliked our entering upon them), and he said (to them):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">O assembly of Jews! Show me twelve men who will bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and Allaah will remove from every Jew beneath the sky the Anger which He has upon them</span></strong>.&gt;&gt; He said: So they remained silent; no one responded to him. Then he repeated it, but no one responded to him. So he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>You have refused, but, by Allaah ! I am indeed ‘al-Haashir’</strong> (the Prophet after whom the people will be gathered), and I am <strong>‘al-`Aaqib’</strong> (the final Prophet), and I am<strong> ‘an-Nabiyyul-Mustafaa’</strong> (the chosen Prophet): whether you believe or reject the truth</span>.</span>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he departed, and I was with him, until (when) we had almost left, a man behind us said: &#8220;Stay as you are, O Muhammad!&#8217; Then that man said: &#8221; What sort of man do you people know me to be amongst you, O company of Jews?&#8217; They said: &#8220;By Allaah! We do not know there to be any man amongst us who knows Allaah&#8217;s Scripture better than you; nor who has better understanding of the religion than you; nor than your father before you; nor than your grandfather before your father.&#8217; He said: &#8220;Then I testify for him, by Allaah, that he is indeed the Prophet of Allaah, whom you find in the Tawraat [Torah].” They said: &#8220;You have lied!&#8217; Then they rebutted his saying, and they said evil things about him, so Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>You people have lied. Your saying will never be accepted. Just now you were praising him with the good that you were praising him with; but when he believed you called him a liar, and said what you have said. Your saying will never be accepted</strong></span>.</span> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: So we departed, and we were three: Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), myself, and `Abdullaah ibn Salaam; and Allaah -the Most High- sent down regarding him:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِن كَانَ مِنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ وَكَفَرْتُم بِهِ وَشَهِدَ شَاهِدٌ مِّن بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ عَلَىٰ مِثْلِهِ فَآمَنَ وَاسْتَكْبَرْتُمْ ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الظَّالِمِينَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Say: Do you see: if this Qur·aan is from Allaah, and you reject it, and a witness from the children of Israa&#8217;eel testifies to its like, and believes in it; and you haughtily reject it; then Allaah does not guide the wrongdoing Disbelievers&#8221;</span></strong>  [ Sooratul-Ahqaaf (46): 10] [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[1] Shaikh al-Albaanee said: &#8220;Reported by Ahmad (6/25), and the additions are his; and by al-Haakim (3/415-416), and he said: &#8220;Saheeh to the standard of the two Shaikhs&#8217;! And adhDhahabee agreed with him! But it is only to the standard of Muslim, since al-Bukhaaree did not report the narrations of Safwaan ibn `Amr except in his &#8220;al-Adabul-Mufrad&#8217;.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>IMAAM AL-BUKHAAREE’S -rahimahullaah- NARRATION:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Bukhaaree narrated (no.3329): from Anas &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Abdullaah ibn Salaam heard of the arrival of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) at AlMadeenah, so he came to him and said: &#8220;I am going to ask you about three things which nobody but a Prophet will know.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8220;What is the first of the signs of the Hour? And what will be the first food, which the people of Paradise will eat? And on account of what does a child resemble its father; and on account of what does a child resemble its maternal uncles?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: «Jibreel has just informed me of them.» He said: `Abdullaah said: &#8220;He is the enemy to the Jews from amongst the Angels.&#8217; Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>«As for the first of the signs of the Hour, then it will be a fire, which gathers the people from the east to the west. As for the first food which the people of Paradise will eat, then it will be the extra lobe of the liver of the fish. As for the resemblance of the child, then when the man has intercourse with the woman and his semen outstrips the fluid of the woman, then the child will resemble him; and if her fluid outstrips, then the resemblance will be towards her.» </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8220;I testify that you are the Messenger of Allaah.&#8217; Then he said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah! The Jews are a people who are great liars: if they know about my Islaam before you ask them, then they will lie about me to you.&#8217; So the Jews came, and `Abdullaah ibn Salaam entered the house.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: «What sort of a man is `Abdullaah ibn Salaam amongst you?» They said: &#8220;He is the most knowledgeable one of us, and the son of the most knowledgeable one from amongst us; and he is the best one of us, and the son of the best one of us.&#8217; So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: «What would you think if `Abdullaah were to accept Islaam?» They said: &#8220;May Allaah preserve him from that.&#8217; So `Abdullaah came out to them and said: &#8220;I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah.&#8217; So they said: &#8220;He is the most evil one of us, and the son of the most evil one of us&#8217;, and they spoke against him&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>A BRIEF BIOGRAPHY OF `ABDULLAAH IBN SALAAM -radiyallaahu `anhu:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdullaah ibn Salaam ibn al-Haarith, al-Israa·eelee, Aboo Yoosuf. He was previously a confederate of Banoo `Awf ibn al-Khazraj. He accepted Islaam when Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) came to al-Madeenah. He was present at the battle of the Trench (al-Khandaq), and the battles after it. He was present with `Umar at the conquest of Jerusalem, and at alJaabiyah. He died in al-Madeenah in 43 H. <span style="color:#999999;">[[ ref. &#8220;Tahdheebut-Tahdheeb&#8217; of al-Haafiz Ibn Hajr]]</span> Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) bore witness that he will be a person of Paradise, as reported by al-Bukhaaree (no. 3812) and Muslim (no. 2483) from Sa`d ibn Abee Waqqaas &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em>&#8211; who said: &#8220;I never heard Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) say about anyone who still walked upon the earth that he was a person of Paradise, except `Abdullaah ibn Salaam. He said: And this Aayah came down concerning him:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَشَهِدَ شَاهِدٌ مِّن بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ عَلَىٰ مِثْلِهِ </strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">And a witness from the children of Israa·eel testifies to its like</span>&#8220;</strong> [Sooratul-Ahqaaf (46): 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And at-Tirmidhee reported (no. 3804) from Mu`aadh ibn Jabal -radiyallaahu `anhu- who said: I heard Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) say: &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He will be the tenth of ten in Paradise</strong></span>.&gt;&gt; [ Declared &#8220;Saheeh&#8217; by Shaikh al-Albaanee.]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(37. It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah, but it is <em><strong>Taqwa</strong> </em>from you that reaches Him. Thus have We made them subject to you that you may proclaim Allah&#8217;s greatness for His guidance to you. And give glad tidings to the doers of good.) </span>&#8211; Suratul Baqarah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says: this sacrifice is prescribed for you so that you will remember Him at the time of slaughter, for He is the Creator and Provider. Nothing of its flesh or blood reaches Him, for He has no need of anything other than Himself. During the time of Jahiliyyah, when they offered sacrifices to their gods, they would put some of the meat of their sacrifices on their idols, and sprinkle the blood over them. But Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah,)</strong> Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn Jurayj said, &#8220;The people of the Jahiliyyah used to put the meat of their sacrifices and sprinkle the blood on the House, and the Companions of the Messenger of Allah said, &#8220;<strong>We have more right to do that</strong>.&#8221; Then Allah revealed the words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah, but it is Taqwa from you that reaches Him.)</strong> That is what He will accept and reward for, as mentioned in the Sahih,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Allah does not look to your appearance or your colors, but He looks to your hearts and deeds.)</strong> And in the Hadith; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(Indeed charity falls in the Hand of Ar-Rahman before it falls in the hand of the one asking.)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Thus have We made them subject to you)</strong> meaning, `for this purpose We have subjugated the Budn for you,&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(that you may proclaim Allah&#8217;s greatness for His guidance to you.)</strong> means, that you may glorify Him for guiding you to His religion and His way which He loves and is pleased with, and has forbidden you to do all that He hates and rejects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And give glad tidings to the doers of good.)</strong> means, `give good news, O Muhammad, to those who do good,&#8217; i.e., whose deeds are good and who remain within the limits prescribed by Allah, who follow that which has been prescribed for them, who believe in the Messenger and follow that which he has conveyed from his Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Note) The Udhiyyah is Sunnah Mustahabbah One animal is sufficient on behalf of all the members of one household. Ibn `Umar said, &#8220;<strong>The Messenger of Allah continued to offer sacrifice for ten years</strong>.&#8221; This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi. Abu Ayyub said: &#8220;At the time of the Messenger of Allah , a man would sacrifice a sheep on behalf of himself and all the members of his household, and they would eat from it and feed others, until the people started boasting ﴿by sacrificing more than one﴾ and things reached the stage that you see now.&#8221; This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, who graded it Sahih, and by Ibn Majah. `Abdullah bin Hisham used to sacrifice one sheep on behalf of his entire family; this was recorded by Al-Bukhari. Concerning how old the sacrificial animal should be, Muslim recorded from Jabir that the Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Do not sacrifice any but mature animals, and if that is not possible, then sacrifice a young sheep.)</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>`Yes, there is no one who does not have a gate in the heavens through which his provision comes down and his good deeds ascend.

</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But the people of Fir`awn left no trace of righteousness on the earth and they had no good deeds that ascended to Allah, so the heavens and the earth did not weep for them</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"> <b>The Tafsir Ibn Kathir of </b><b>Surat</b><b> Al-Qiyamah (Chapter &#8211; 75)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Which was revealed in Makkah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ أُقْسِمُ بِيَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ &#8211; وَلاَ أُقْسِمُ بِالنَّفْسِ اللَّوَّامَةِ &#8211; أَيَحْسَبُ الإِنسَـنُ أَلَّن نَّجْمَعَ عِظَامَهُ &#8211; بَلَى قَـدِرِينَ عَلَى أَن نُّسَوِّىَ بَنَانَهُ &#8211; بَلْ يُرِيدُ الإِنسَـنُ لِيَفْجُرَ أَمَامَهُ &#8211; يَسْـَلُ أَيَّانَ يَوْمُ الْقِيَـمَةِ &#8211; فَإِذَا بَرِقَ الْبَصَرُ &#8211; وَخَسَفَ الْقَمَرُ &#8211; وَجُمِعَ الشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ &#8211; يَقُولُ الإِنسَـنُ يَوْمَئِذٍ أَيْنَ الْمَفَرُّ &#8211; كَلاَّ لاَ وَزَرَ &#8211; إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمُسْتَقَرُّ &#8211; يُنَبَّأُ الإِنسَـنُ يَوْمَئِذِ بِمَا قَدَّمَ وَأَخَّرَ &#8211; بَلِ الإِنسَـنُ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ بَصِيرَةٌ &#8211; وَلَوْ أَلْقَى مَعَاذِيرَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1. Nay! I swear by the Day of Resurrection.) (2. And nay! I swear by An-Nafs Al-Lawwamah.) (3. Does man think that We shall not assemble his bones) (4. Yes, We are able to put together in perfect order the tips of his fingers.) (5. Nay! Man desires to break out ahead of himself.) (6. He asks: &#8220;When will be this Day of Resurrection&#8221;) (7. So, when Bariqa the sight.) (8. And the moon will be eclipsed.) (9. And the sun and moon will be joined together.) (10. On that Day man will say: &#8220;Where (is the refuge) to flee&#8221;) (11. No! There is no refuge!) (12. Unto your Lord will be the place of rest that Day.) (13. On that Day man will be informed of what he sent forward, and what he left behind.) (14. Nay! Man will be well informed about himself,) (15. Though he may put forth his excuses.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Oath about the Final Return on the Day of Resurrection and the Refutation against the Plots of the Thinkers</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been mentioned previously on more than one occasion that if the thing that is being sworn about is something that is being negated, then it is permissible to use the word &#8220;La&#8221; (Nay) before the oath to emphasize the negation. Here, what is being sworn about is the affirmation of the final abode and the refutation against the claim of the ignorant that the resurrection of bodies will not occur. This is why Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ أُقْسِمُ بِيَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ &#8211; وَلاَ أُقْسِمُ بِالنَّفْسِ اللَّوَّامَةِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay! I swear by the Day of Resurrection. And nay! I swear by An-Nafs Al-Lawwamah.) Qatadah said, &#8220;This means, I swear by both of these things.&#8221; This has also been reported from Ibn `Abbas and Sa`id bin Jubayr. Concerning the Day of Judgement, it is well known what it is. In reference to An-Nafs Al-Lawwamah, Qurrah bin Khalid reported from Al-Hasan Al-Basri that he said about this Ayah, &#8220;Verily, by Allah, we think that every believer blames himself. He says (questioning himself), `What did I intend by my statement What did I intend by my eating What did I intend in what I said to myself&#8217; However, the sinner proceeds ahead and he does not blame himself.&#8221; Ibn Jarir recorded from Sa`id bin Jubayr that he said concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلاَ أُقْسِمُ بِالنَّفْسِ اللَّوَّامَةِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And nay! I swear by An-Nafs Al-Lawwamah) &#8220;He criticizes himself in good and bad.&#8221; Similar has been reported from `Ikrimah. Ibn Abi Najih reported from Mujahid: &#8220;He is sorry for what he missed (of good deeds) and he blames himself for it.&#8221; Allah said;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَيَحْسَبُ الإِنسَـنُ أَلَّن نَّجْمَعَ عِظَامَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Does man think that We shall not assemble his bones) meaning, `on the Day of Judgement does he think that We are not able to return his bones and gather them from their various places&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[بَلَى قَـدِرِينَ عَلَى أَن نُّسَوِّىَ بَنَانَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Yes, We are able to put together in perfect order the tips of his fingers.) meaning, `does man think that We will not gather his bones Surely, We will gather them and We are quite able to put together his fingertips. This means Our power is suitable to gather (and recreate) them, and if We wished We could surely resurrect him with more than what he originally had. We could make his Banan, which are the tips of his fingers, all equal (in length).&#8217; Concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[بَلْ يُرِيدُ الإِنسَـنُ لِيَفْجُرَ أَمَامَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay! Man desires to break out ahead of himself.) Sa`id reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, &#8220;This means to proceed forward.&#8221; Mujahid said about,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لِيَفْجُرَ أَمَامَهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(to break out ahead of himself.) &#8220;This means that he wants to proceed ahead following his own whims.&#8221; `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, &#8220;This refers to the disbeliever who denies the Day of Reckoning.&#8221; Ibn Zayd said the same thing. Thus, Allah says after this,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[يَسْـَلُ أَيَّانَ يَوْمُ الْقِيَـمَةِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He asks: &#8220;When will be this Day of Resurrection&#8221;) meaning, he says when will the Day of Judgement be His question is only a question of denying its occurrence, and rejecting its existence. This is as Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَى هَـذَا الْوَعْدُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ قُل لَّكُم مِّيعَادُ يَوْمٍ لاَّ تَسْتَـَخِرُونَ عَنْهُ سَاعَةً وَلاَ تَسْتَقْدِمُونَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And they say: &#8220;When is this promise if you are truthful&#8221; Say: &#8220;The appointment to you is for a Day, which you cannot put back for an hour nor put forward.&#8221;) (34:29-30) Here Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَإِذَا بَرِقَ الْبَصَرُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So, when Bariqa the sight.) Abu `Amr bin Al-`Ala&#8217; recited this Ayah as Bariqa with a Kasrah under the letter Ra, which means to be diminished. That which he (Abu `Amr) has said resembles the statement of Allah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ يَرْتَدُّ إِلَيْهِمْ طَرْفُهُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Their gaze returning not towards them.) (14:43) meaning, they will be looking this way and that way in horror. Their gaze will not be able to rest upon anything due to the severity of the terror on that Day. Others recited it as Baraqa with a Fathah over the letter Ra, and its meaning is close to the first recitation (Bariqa). The intent here is that the eyes will be dazzled, humbled, diminished, and humiliated on the Day of Judgement due to the severity of the horrors and the greatness of the matters that they will witness on that Day. Concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَخَسَفَ الْقَمَرُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And the moon will be eclipsed.) meaning, its light will go away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَجُمِعَ الشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And the sun and moon will be joined together.) Mujahid said, &#8220;They will be rolled up.&#8221; In explaining this Ayah, Ibn Zayd recited the following Ayat,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِذَا الشَّمْسُ كُوِّرَتْ &#8211; وَإِذَا النُّجُومُ انكَدَرَتْ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When the sun is wound round and its light is lost and is overthrown, and when the stars fall.) (81:1,2) It has been reported from Ibn Mas`ud that he recited the Ayah as, (وَجُمِعَ بَيْنَ الشَّمْسِ وَالْقَمَرِ) (and the sun and the moon will be joined between each other.) Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[يَقُولُ الإِنسَـنُ يَوْمَئِذٍ أَيْنَ الْمَفَرُّ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(On that Day man will say:&#8221;Where (is the refuge) to flee&#8221;) meaning, the human will see these horrors on the Day of Judgement and he will want to flee. He will say, &#8220;Where (is the place) to flee to&#8221; This means, where is the escape or refuge Allah then says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[كَلاَّ لاَ وَزَرَ &#8211; إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمُسْتَقَرُّ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(No! There is no refuge! Unto your Lord will be the place of rest that Day.) Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Sa`id bin Jubayr and several others of the Salaf said, &#8220;There will be no salvation.&#8221; This Ayah is similar to Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[مَا لَكُمْ مِّن مَّلْجَأٍ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّكِيرٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(You will have no refuge on that Day nor there will be for you any denying.) (42:47) meaning, `there will be no place for you to hide.&#8217; This is like what Allah says here,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ وَزَرَ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(There is no refuge.) meaning, `there will be no place for you to seek shelter.&#8217; Thus, Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمُسْتَقَرُّ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Unto your Lord will be the place of rest that Day.) meaning, the place of return and the final destination. The Deeds of Man will be placed before Him on the Day of Judgement Then Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[يُنَبَّأُ الإِنسَـنُ يَوْمَئِذِ بِمَا قَدَّمَ وَأَخَّرَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(On that Day man will be informed of what he sent forward, and what he left behind.) meaning, he will be informed of all of his deeds, the old of them and the recent of them, the first of them and the last of them, the small of them and the large of them. This is as Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَوَجَدُواْ مَا عَمِلُواْ حَاضِرًا وَلاَ يَظْلِمُ رَبُّكَ أَحَدًا]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And they will find all that they did, placed before them, and your Lord treats no one with injustice.) (18:49) Likewise, Allah says here,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[بَلِ الإِنسَـنُ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ بَصِيرَةٌ &#8211; وَلَوْ أَلْقَى مَعَاذِيرَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay! Man will be well informed about himself, though he may put forth his excuses.) meaning, he will be a witness against himself, knowing full well what he did, even though he will try to make excuses and deny it. This is as Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[اقْرَأْ كَتَـبَكَ كَفَى بِنَفْسِكَ الْيَوْمَ عَلَيْكَ حَسِيبًا ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((It will be said to him): &#8220;Read your book. You are sufficient as a reckoner against yourself this Day.&#8221;) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[بَلِ الإِنسَـنُ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ بَصِيرَةٌ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay! Man will be well informed about himself.) &#8220;His hearing, his sight, his two hands, his two legs and his limbs.&#8221; Qatadah said, &#8220;This means he is a witness against himself.&#8221; In another narration from Qatadah he said, &#8220;By Allah! If you wish to see him, you would see him as someone who sees the shortcomings of the people and their sins, yet he is heedless of his own sins.&#8221; It used to be said, &#8220;Verily, it is written in the Injil: `O Son of Adam, do you see the small splinters in the eye of your brother and disregard the tree stump that is in your eye, so you do not see it&#8221;&#8217; Mujahid said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلَوْ أَلْقَى مَعَاذِيرَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Though he may put forth his excuses.) &#8220;This means, even though he argues in defense of it, he is a witness against it.&#8221; Qatadah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلَوْ أَلْقَى مَعَاذِيرَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Though he may put forth his excuses.) &#8220;Even though he will try to make false excuses on that Day, they will not be accepted from him.&#8221; As-Suddi said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلَوْ أَلْقَى مَعَاذِيرَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Though he may put forth his excuses.) &#8220;This means his argument.&#8221; This is as Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ثُمَّ لَمْ تَكُنْ فِتْنَتُهُمْ إِلاَّ أَن قَالُواْ وَاللَّهِ رَبِّنَا مَا كُنَّا مُشْرِكِينَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(There will then be no Fitnah for them but to say: &#8220;By Allah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allah.&#8221;) (6:23) Allah also says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[يَوْمَ يَبْعَثُهُمُ اللَّهِ جَمِيعاً فَيَحْلِفُونَ لَهُ كَمَا يَحْلِفُونَ لَكُمْ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُمْ عَلَى شَىْءٍ أَلاَ إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ الْكَـذِبُونَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(On the Day when Allah will resurrect them all together; then they will swear to Him as they swear to you (O Muslims). And they think that they have something. Verily, they are liars!) (58:18) Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلَوْ أَلْقَى مَعَاذِيرَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Though he may put forth his excuses.) &#8220;This is apologizing. Haven&#8217;t you heard that Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ يَنفَعُ الظَّـلِمِينَ مَعْذِرَتُهُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Day when their excuses will be of no profit to wrongdoers.) (40:52) and He says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأَلْقَوْاْ إِلَى اللَّهِ يَوْمَئِذٍ السَّلَمَ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And they will offer submision to Allah on that Day.) (16:87) and He says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَأَلْقَوُاْ السَّلَمَ مَا كُنَّا نَعْمَلُ مِن سُوءٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then they will (falsely) submit: &#8220;We used not to do any evil.&#8221;) (16:28) and their statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَاللَّهِ رَبِّنَا مَا كُنَّا مُشْرِكِينَ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(By Allah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allah.) (6:23)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ تُحَرِّكْ بِهِ لِسَانَكَ لِتَعْجَلَ بِهِ &#8211; إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا جَمْعَهُ وَقُرْءَانَهُ &#8211; فَإِذَا قَرَأْنَـهُ فَاتَّبِعْ قُرْءَانَهُ &#8211; ثُمَّ إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا بَيَانَهُ &#8211; كَلاَّ بَلْ تُحِبُّونَ الْعَاجِلَةَ &#8211; وَتَذَرُونَ الاٌّخِرَةَ &#8211; وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ نَّاضِرَةٌ &#8211; إِلَى رَبِّهَا نَاظِرَةٌ &#8211; وَوُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ بَاسِرَةٌ &#8211; تَظُنُّ أَن يُفْعَلَ بِهَا فَاقِرَةٌ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(16. Move not your tongue concerning to make haste therewith.) (17. It is for Us to collect it and that it be recited.) (18. And when We have recited it to you, then follow its recitation.) (19. Then it is for Us to make it clear.) (20. But no! Rather you love the present life of this world,) (21. And neglect the Hereafter.) (22. Some faces that Day shall be Nadirah.) (23. Looking at their Lord.) (24. And some faces that Day will be Basirah,) (25. Thinking that some calamity is about to fall on them.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>How the Prophet received the Revelation</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is Allah teaching His Messenger how to receive the revelation from the angel. For verily, he (the Prophet ) was rushing in his attempts to grasp the revelation and he would be reciting the revelation with the angel while he was reciting it. Therefore, Allah commanded him that when the angel brings some revelation to him he should just listen. Allah would make sure to collect it in his chest, and He would make it easy for him to recite it in the same way that it was revealed to him. Allah would explain it, interpret it and clarify it for him. So the first phase was gathering it in his chest, the second phase was recitation and the third phase was its explanation and clarification of its meaning. Thus, Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ تُحَرِّكْ بِهِ لِسَانَكَ لِتَعْجَلَ بِهِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Move not your tongue concerning to make haste therewith.) meaning, with the Qur&#8217;an. This is as Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلاَ تَعْجَلْ بِالْقُرْءانِ مِن قَبْلِ إَن يُقْضَى إِلَيْكَ وَحْيُهُ وَقُل رَّبِّ زِدْنِى عِلْماً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And be not in haste with the Qur&#8217;an before its revelation is completed to you, and say: &#8220;My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.&#8221;) (20:114) Then Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا جَمْعَهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(It is for Us to collect it) meaning, `in your chest.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَقُرْءَانَهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and that it be recited.) meaning, `that you recite it.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَإِذَا قَرَأْنَـهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And when We have recited it to you,) meaning, `when the angel has recited it to you from Allah,&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَاتَّبِعْ قُرْءَانَهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(then follow its recitation.) meaning, `listen to it then recite it as he taught you to recite it.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ثُمَّ إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا بَيَانَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then it is for Us to make it clear.) meaning, `after memorizing it and reciting it, We will explain it to you, clarify it and inspire you with its meaning according to what We intended and legislated.&#8217; Imam Ahmad recorded from Ibn `Abbas that he said that the Messenger of Allah used to struggle very hard to grasp the revelation and he used to move his lips (rapidly with the recitation). The narrator, Sa`id, then said, &#8220;Ibn `Abbas said to me, `I will move my lips like the Messenger of Allah used to move his lips (in order to show you).&#8221;&#8217; Then, the subnarrator said, &#8220;And Sa`id said to me, `I will move my lips like I saw Ibn `Abbas moving his lips (in order to show you).&#8221;&#8217; Then Allah revealed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ تُحَرِّكْ بِهِ لِسَانَكَ لِتَعْجَلَ بِهِ &#8211; إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا جَمْعَهُ وَقُرْءَانَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Move not your tongue concerning to make haste therewith. It is for Us to collect it and that it be recited.) Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;This means He will collect it in his chest to recite it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَإِذَا قَرَأْنَـهُ فَاتَّبِعْ قُرْءَانَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And when We have recited it to you, then follow its recitation.) meaning, listen to it and pay attention.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ثُمَّ إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا بَيَانَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then it is for Us to make it clear (to you).) So after this, when Jibril would leave, he would recite it as Jibril had taught him to recite it.&#8221; This has also been recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. Al-Bukhari&#8217;s wording says, &#8220;So whenever Jibril would come to him he would be silent, and when Jibril had left he would recite it just as Allah, the Mighty and Sublime had promised him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Cause of rejecting the Day of Judgement is Love of the World and Heedlessness of the Hereafter</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[كَلاَّ بَلْ تُحِبُّونَ الْعَاجِلَةَ &#8211; وَتَذَرُونَ الاٌّخِرَةَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(But no! Rather you love the present life of this world. And neglect the Hereafter.) meaning, the only thing that has caused them to reject the Day of Judgement and oppose the true revelation and the Mighty Qur&#8217;an Allah revealed to His Messenger is that their only concern is the present worldly life. They are preoccupied and distracted from the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Seeing Allah in the Hereafter</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ نَّاضِرَةٌ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Some faces that Day shall be Nadirah.) which comes from the word Nadarah, which means splendid, radiant, glowing, delighted with goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِلَى رَبِّهَا نَاظِرَةٌ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Looking at their Lord.) meaning, they will see Him with their very eyes. This is just as was recorded by Al-Bukhari in his Sahih,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«إِنَّكُمْ سَتَرَوْنَ رَبَّكُمْ عِيَانًا»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, you all will see your Lord with your own eyes.) The believers seeing Allah in the abode of the Hereafter has been confirmed in the authentic Hadiths from numerous routes of transmission with the scholars of Hadith. It is not possible to deny this or refuse it. Examples would be the Hadiths of Abu Sa`id and Abu Hurayrah, and they are both recorded in the Two Sahihs. They both mentioned that some people said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Will we see our Lord on the Day of Judgement&#8221; The Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«هَلْ تُضَارُّونَ فِي رُؤْيَةِ الشَّمْسِ وَالْقَمَرِ لَيْسَ دُونَهُمَا سَحَابٌ؟»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Are you harmed by seeing the sun and the moon when there are no clouds beneath them) They replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«فَإِنَّكُمْ تَرَوْنَ رَبَّكُمْ كَذَلِك»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then you will surely see your Lord like that.) In the Two Sahihs it is recorded from Jabir that he said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah looked at the moon on a night when it was full, and he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«إِنَّكُمْ تَرَوْنَ رَبَّكُمْ كَمَا تَرَوْنَ هَذَا الْقَمَرَ، فَإِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ أَنْ لَا تُغْلَبُوا عَلَى صَلَاةٍ قَبْلَ طُلُوعِ الشَّمْسِ وَلَا قَبْلَ غُرُوبِهَا، فَافْعَلُوا»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, you will see your Lord just as you see this moon! So if you are able to avoid missing a prayer before the rising of the sun (Fajr prayer) or before its setting (`Asr prayer) then do so.)&#8221; Among the Hadiths, which Muslim was alone in recording, is a narration from Suhayb that the Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«إِذَا دَخَلَ أَهْلُ الْجَنَّةِ الْجَنَّةَ قَالَ يَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالى: تُرِيدُونَ شَيْئًا أَزِيدُكُمْ؟ فَيَقُولُونَ: أَلَمْ تُبَيِّضْ وُجُوهَنَا؟ أَلَمْ تُدْخِلْنَا الْجَنَّةَ وَتُنَجِّنَا مِنَ النَّارِ؟ قَالَ: فَيَكْشِفُ الْحِجَابَ، فَمَا أُعْطُوا شَيْئًا أَحَبَّ إِلَيْهِمْ مِنَ النَّظَرِ إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ، وَهِيَ الزِّيَادَة»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When the people of Paradise enter the Paradise, Allah will say, `Do you want me to give you anything extra&#8217; They will say, `Haven&#8217;t you whitened our faces Haven&#8217;t you entered us into Paradise and saved us from the Fire&#8217; Then He will remove the veil and they will not be given anything more beloved to them than looking at their Lord, and that will be the extra (Ziyadah).) Then he recited this Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ الْحُسْنَى وَزِيَادَةٌ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(For those who have done good is the best and extra (Ziyadah).) (10:26) Also among the Hadiths, which Muslim was alone in recording, is the Hadith of Jabir in which the Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«إِنَّ اللهَ يَتَجَلَّى لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ يَضْحَك»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, Allah will appear before the believers while He is laughing.) This will take place on the open plains of the Resurrection place. In some of these Hadiths, it mentions that the believers will be looking at their Lord on the open plains and some mention that this will occur in the Gardens of Paradise. If it were not due to fear of taking up a lot of space, we would present all of these Hadiths with their routes of transmission and wordings from those that are in the Sahih collections, the collections of good narrations, the Musnad collections and the Sunan collections. However, we have mentioned this in separate places in this Tafsir, and Allah is the Giver of success. This issue is something that the Companions, the Successors and the Salaf of this nation have agreed upon, and all praise is due to Allah. It is something that is agreed upon between the Imams of Islam and the guides of all mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Blackening of the Faces of the Disobedient People on the Day of Judgement</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَوُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ بَاسِرَةٌ &#8211; تَظُنُّ أَن يُفْعَلَ بِهَا فَاقِرَةٌ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And some faces that Day will be Basirah. Thinking that some calamity is about to fall on them.) These are the faces of the sinners that will be Basirah on the Day of Judgement. Qatadah said, &#8220;This means gloomy.&#8221; As-Suddi said, &#8220;Their (the faces) color will change.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[تَظُنُّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Thinking) meaning, they will be certain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَن يُفْعَلَ بِهَا فَاقِرَةٌ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(that some calamity is about to fall on them.) Mujahid said, &#8220;A disaster.&#8221; Qatadah said, &#8220;An evil.&#8221; As-Suddi said, &#8220;They will be certain that they are going to be destroyed.&#8221; Ibn Zayd said, &#8220;They will think that they are going to enter into the Hellfire.&#8221; This situation is similar to Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[يَوْمَ تَبْيَضُّ وُجُوهٌ وَتَسْوَدُّ وُجُوهٌ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(On the Day when some faces will become white and some faces will become black.) (3:106) Similarly Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ مُّسْفِرَةٌ &#8211; ضَـحِكَةٌ مُّسْتَبْشِرَةٌ &#8211; وَوُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ عَلَيْهَا غَبَرَةٌ &#8211; تَرْهَقُهَا قَتَرَةٌ &#8211; أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْكَفَرَةُ الْفَجَرَةُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Some faces that Day will be bright. Laughing, rejoicing at the good news. And other faces, that Day will be dust-stained; darkness will cover them, such will be the disbelieving, wicked.) (80:38-42) Allah also says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ خَـشِعَةٌ &#8211; عَامِلَةٌ نَّاصِبَةٌ &#8211; تَصْلَى نَاراً حَامِيَةً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Some faces, that Day will be humiliated. Laboring, weary. They will enter in the hot blazing Fire.) (88:2-4) until Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ نَّاعِمَةٌ &#8211; لِّسَعْيِهَا رَاضِيَةٌ فِى جَنَّةٍ عَالِيَةٍ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((Other) faces that Day will be joyful. Happy with their endeavor. In a lofty Paradise.) (88:8-10) And there are other similar Ayat and discussions (in the Qur&#8217;an).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[كَلاَّ إِذَا بَلَغَتِ التَّرَاقِىَ &#8211; وَقِيلَ مَنْ رَاقٍ &#8211; وَظَنَّ أَنَّهُ الْفِرَاقُ &#8211; وَالْتَفَّتِ السَّاقُ بِالسَّاقِ &#8211; إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمَسَاقُ &#8211; فَلاَ صَدَّقَ وَلاَ صَلَّى &#8211; وَلَـكِن كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّى &#8211; ثُمَّ ذَهَبَ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ يَتَمَطَّى &#8211; أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى &#8211; ثُمَّ أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى &#8211; أَيَحْسَبُ الإِنسَـنُ أَن يُتْرَكَ سُدًى &#8211; أَلَمْ يَكُ نُطْفَةً مِّن مَّنِىٍّ يُمْنَى &#8211; ثُمَّ كَانَ عَلَقَةً فَخَلَقَ فَسَوَّى &#8211; فَجَعَلَ مِنْهُ الزَّوْجَيْنِ الذَّكَرَ وَالاٍّنثَى &#8211; أَلَيْسَ ذَلِكَ بِقَـدِرٍ عَلَى أَن يُحْيِىَ الْمَوْتَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(26. Nay, when it reaches to the collarbones.) (27. And it will be said: &#8220;Who can cure him&#8221;) (28. And he will think that it was the parting;) (29. And one shank will be joined with another shank.) (30. The drive will be on that Day to your Lord!) (31. So, he neither believed nor prayed!) (32. But on the contrary, he denied and turned away!) (33. Then he walked in conceit to his family admiring himself!) (34. Woe to you! And then woe to you!) (35. Again, woe to you! And then woe to you!) (36. Does man think that he will be left neglected) (37. Was he not a Nutfah of semen emitted) (38. Then he became an `Alaqah; then shaped and fashioned in due proportion.) (39. And made of him two sexes, male and female.) (40. Is it not so then, that He would be able to give life to the dead)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Certainty will occur at the Time of Death Allah informs of the condition at the time of death and what terrors it contains.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah make us firm at that time with the Firm Statement. Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[كَلاَّ إِذَا بَلَغَتِ التَّرَاقِىَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay, when it reaches to the collarbones.) If we make the word &#8220;Kalla&#8221; negative, then this Ayah means, `O son of Adam! You are not able to deny that which I informed you of at that time (death). This will become something witnessed by you with your own eyes.&#8217; If we consider the word &#8220;Kalla&#8221; to be a word of affirmation, then this would be the most obvious meaning. In this case it would mean that it is certainly true when the soul reaches the collarbones &#8211; meaning, `your soul will be pulled out of your body and it will reach your collarbones.&#8217; This is similar to Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَلَوْلاَ إِذَا بَلَغَتِ الْحُلْقُومَ &#8211; وَأَنتُمْ حِينَئِذٍ تَنظُرُونَ &#8211; وَنَحْنُ أَقْرَبُ إِلَيْهِ مِنكُمْ وَلَـكِن لاَّ تُبْصِرُونَ &#8211; فَلَوْلاَ إِن كُنتُمْ غَيْرَ مَدِينِينَ &#8211; تَرْجِعُونَهَآ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then why do you not (intervene) when (the soul of the dying person) reaches the throat And you at the moment are looking on, but We are nearer to him than you, but you see not, then why do you not if you are exempt from the reckoning and recompense, bring back the soul, if your are truthful) (56:83-87) Thus, Allah similarly says here,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[كَلاَّ إِذَا بَلَغَتِ التَّرَاقِىَ &#8211; وَقِيلَ مَنْ رَاقٍ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay, when it reaches to the collarbones. And it will be said: &#8220;Who can cure him) `Ikrimah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, &#8220;Meaning, who is the person who recites divine prayers of healing so that he may come and cure him&#8221; Abu Qilabah made a similar statement when he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَقِيلَ مَنْ رَاقٍ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And it will be said: &#8220;Who can cure him) &#8220;This means who is the doctor that can cure him&#8221; Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and Ibn Zayd all have similar statements. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said concerning the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَالْتَفَّتِ السَّاقُ بِالسَّاقِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And one shank will be joined with another shank.) &#8220;This is the last day of the days of this world and the first day of the days of the Hereafter. So there will be hardships that will meet (more) hardships, except for he whom Allah has mercy upon.&#8221; `Ikrimah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَالْتَفَّتِ السَّاقُ بِالسَّاقِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And one shank will be joined with another shank.) &#8220;The great matter (will be joined) with the great matter.&#8221; Mujahid said, &#8220;A test (will be joined) with a test.&#8221; Al-Hasan Al-Basri said concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَالْتَفَّتِ السَّاقُ بِالسَّاقِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And one shank will be joined with another shank. ) &#8220;These are your two shins when they are bound together.&#8221; In another narration from him (Al-Hasan) he said, &#8220;His two legs have died and they will not carry him while he used to walk around on them.&#8221; Concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمَسَاقُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The drive will be on that Day to your Lord!) meaning, the place of return and the destination. This is that the soul ascends into the heavens and Allah says, &#8220;Return my servant to the earth, for verily, I have created them from it, I return them into it, and from it I will bring them out at another time.&#8221; This has been reported in the lengthy Hadith of Al-Bara&#8217;. Verily, Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَهُوَ الْقَاهِرُ فَوْقَ عِبَادِهِ وَيُرْسِلُ عَلَيْكُم حَفَظَةً حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَ أَحَدَكُمُ الْمَوْتُ تَوَفَّتْهُ رُسُلُنَا وَهُمْ لاَ يُفَرِّطُونَ &#8211; ثُمَّ رُدُّواْ إِلَى اللَّهِ مَوْلَـهُمُ الْحَقِّ أَلاَ لَهُ الْحُكْمُ وَهُوَ أَسْرَعُ الْحَـسِبِينَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He is the Irresistible (Supreme), over His servants, and He sends guardians over you, until when death approaches one of you, Our messengers take his soul, and they never neglect their duty. Then they are returned to Allah, their True Master. Surely, for Him is the judgement and He is the swiftest in taking account.) (6:61,62)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Mentioning the Case of the Denier</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَلاَ صَدَّقَ وَلاَ صَلَّى &#8211; وَلَـكِن كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So, he neither believed nor prayed! But on the contrary, he denied and turned away!) This is to inform about the disbeliever who used to deny the truth in his heart in the abode of this worldly life, and he used to turn away from acting according to its way. Thus, there is no good in him, internally or externally. Therefore, Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَلاَ صَدَّقَ وَلاَ صَلَّى &#8211; وَلَـكِن كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّى &#8211; ثُمَّ ذَهَبَ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ يَتَمَطَّى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So he neither believed nor prayed! But on the contrary, he denied and turned away! Then he walked in conceit (full pride) to his family admiring himself!)(75:31-33) meaning, stubborn, cruel, obstinate, wanton, lazy, having no concern and doing no deeds. This is similar to Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَإِذَا انقَلَبُواْ إِلَى أَهْلِهِمْ انقَلَبُواْ فَكِهِينَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And when they returned to their own people, they would return jesting.) (83:31) Allah also says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِنَّهُ كَانَ فِى أَهْلِهِ مَسْرُوراً &#8211; إِنَّهُ ظَنَّ أَن لَّن يَحُورَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, he was among his people in joy! Verily, he thought that he would never come back (to Us)!) (84:13,14) meaning, return.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[بَلَى إِنَّ رَبَّهُ كَانَ بِهِ بَصِيراً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Yes! Verily, his Lord has been ever beholding him!) (84:15) Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ثُمَّ ذَهَبَ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ يَتَمَطَّى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then he walked in conceit to his family admiring himself!) &#8220;This means arrogantly.&#8221; Qatadah and Zayd bin Aslam both said, &#8220;Strutting.&#8221; Allah then says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى &#8211; ثُمَّ أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Woe to you! And then woe to you! Again, woe to you! And then woe to you!) This is a definite warning and threat from Allah to those who disbelieve in Him and strut about when walking. This means, `you deserve to strut like this while you have disbelieved in your Creator and Maker.&#8217; This is what is commonly said in this type of situation in order to mock and intimidate (someone). This is as Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ذُقْ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْعَزِيزُ الْكَرِيمُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Taste you (this)! Verily you were (pretending to be) the mighty, the generous!) (44:49) Similarly, Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[كُلُواْ وَتَمَتَّعُواْ قَلِيلاً إِنَّكُمْ مُّجْرِمُونَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Eat and enjoy yourselves for a little. Verily, you are criminals.) (77:46) Allah also says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَاعْبُدُواْ مَا شِئْتُمْ مِّن دُونِهِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So worship what you like besides Him.) (39:15) And like Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[اعْمَلُواْ مَا شِئْتُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Do what you will.) (41:40) There are other examples of this as well. Abu `Abdur-Rahman An-Nasa&#8217;i recorded from Sa`id bin Jubayr that he said, &#8220;I mentioned to Ibn `Abbas,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى &#8211; ثُمَّ أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Woe to you! And then woe to you! Again, woe to you! And then woe to you!) He (Ibn `Abbas) replied, `The Messenger of Allah said this to Abu Jahl, then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed this Ayah.&#8221;&#8217; Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from Qatadah that he said concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى &#8211; ثُمَّ أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Woe to you! And then woe to you! Again, woe to you! And then woe to you!) &#8220;It is a threat followed by a threat, just as you hear it. They claim that the Prophet of Allah grabbed the clothes of the enemy of Allah, Abu Jahl. The Prophet then said to him, `Woe to you! And then (again) woe to you! Again woe to you! And then (again) woe to you!&#8217; At this the enemy of Allah, Abu Jahl, said, `Are you threatening me, O Muhammad By Allah! Neither you nor your Lord are able to do anything, and verily, I am the mightiest person walking between its (Makkah&#8217;s) two mountains.&#8221;&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Man will not be left neglected</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَيَحْسَبُ الإِنسَـنُ أَن يُتْرَكَ سُدًى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Does man think that he will be left neglected) As-Suddi said, &#8220;Meaning not resurrected.&#8221; Mujahid, Ash-Shafi`i and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, all said, &#8220;Meaning, he will not be commanded and prohibited.&#8221; Apparently the Ayah includes both meanings. This means that he will not be left neglected in this worldly life, without being commanded and prohibited. He also will not be left neglected in his grave unattended to without being resurrected. Rather he will be commanded and prohibited in this life, and gathered back to Allah in the abode of the Hereafter. The intent here is to affirm the existence of the abode of the final return and to refute whoever rejects it from the people of deviance, ignorance and stubbornness. Thus, Allah uses the beginning of creation as a proof for the repetition of the creation in His saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَلَمْ يَكُ نُطْفَةً مِّن مَّنِىٍّ يُمْنَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Was he not a Nutfah of semen emitted) meaning, was not man a weak drop of sperm from a despised fluid known as semen, that is emitted from the loins into the wombs</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ثُمَّ كَانَ عَلَقَةً فَخَلَقَ فَسَوَّى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then he became an `Alaqah; then shaped and fashioned in due proportion.) meaning, he became a clot, then a lump of flesh, then he was formed and the soul was blown into him. Then he became a perfect creation with healthy limbs, as either a male or a female by the permission and decree of Allah. Thus, Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَجَعَلَ مِنْهُ الزَّوْجَيْنِ الذَّكَرَ وَالاٍّنثَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And made of him two sexes, male and female.) Then Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَلَيْسَ ذَلِكَ بِقَـدِرٍ عَلَى أَن يُحْيِىَ الْمَوْتَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Is it not so then, that He would be able to give life to the dead) meaning, is not He Who made this perfect creation from this weak drop of sperm able to repeat that as He did originally And &#8220;the ability to repeat that&#8221; either refers to the origination only, or to both that and the process of perfecting it, according to two different views, as in Allah&#8217;s saying;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَهُوَ الَّذِى يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ وَهُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it; this is easier for Him.) (30:27) The first view is more popular, and Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Supplication upon completing this Surah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dawud recorded from Musa bin Abi `A&#8217;ishah that he said, &#8220;A man used to pray on top of his house and whenever he recited,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَلَيْسَ ذَلِكَ بِقَـدِرٍ عَلَى أَن يُحْيِىَ الْمَوْتَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Is it not so then, that He would be able to give life to the dead) he would say, `Glory to You, of course.&#8217; So the people asked him about that and he said, `I heard it from the Messenger of Allah .&#8221;&#8217; Abu Dawud was alone in transmitting this Hadith and he did not mention who this Companion was, but there is no harm in that.

<td>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Last two Ayah of Surat ul Baqarah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (Muhammad ) believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allâh, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. They say, &#8220;We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers&#8221; &#8211; and they say, &#8220;We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your Forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all).&#8221; (Al-Baqarah 2:285)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has earned. &#8220;Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error, our Lord! Lay not on us a burden like that which You did lay on those before us (Jews and Christians); our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear. Pardon us and grant us Forgiveness. Have mercy on us. You are our Maulâ (Patron, Suppor-ter and Protector, etc.) and give us victory over the disbelieving people.&#8221; (Al-Baqarah 2:286)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Virtue of These Ayah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn &#8216;Abbas &#8221; who said:<br />
&#8220;While Jibra&#8217;eel (Gibrael) &#8221; `May Peace be upon him&#8217; was sitting with the Prophet !, he heard the opening of a gate above him. So he raised his head and said: `This is a gate from the shies that has opened today, which has never opened before this day.&#8217; So an angel descended from it (the gate). So he Jibra&#8217;eel &#8221; said: &#8220;This is an angel that has descended to the earth, which has never descended except today. He gave Salam and said: &#8216;Receive glad tidings [Oh Muhammad ! with two lights which have been given to you, that have never been given to a Prophet before you: The Opening of the Book (i.e. Surat Al- Fatihah) and the end of Surat Al-Baqarah. Never do you read a letter from either of the two (Surahs) except that you are given it.( Which means that you are given its reward (i.e. the reward of recitation)) (Reported by Muslim) (Taken from Mukhtasar Sahih Muslim with Shaykh AI-Albani&#8217;s editing, p.553, Hadith no. 2094.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tafsir Ibn Kathir</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Each one believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. (They say,) &#8220;We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, each of the believers believes that Allah is the One and Only and the Sustainer, there is no deity worthy of worship except Him and there is no Lord except Him. The believers also believe in all Allah&#8217;s Prophets and Messengers, in the Books that were revealed from heaven to the Messengers and Prophets, who are indeed the servants of Allah. Further, the believers do not differentiate between any of the Prophets, such as, believing in some of them and rejecting others. Rather, all of Allah&#8217;s Prophets and Messengers are, to the believers, truthful, righteous, and they were each guided to the path of righteousness, even when some of them bring what abrogates the Law of some others by Allah&#8217;s leave. Later on, the Law of Muhammad, the Final Prophet and Messenger from Allah, abrogated all the laws of the Prophets before him. So the Last Hour will commence while Muhammad&#8217;s Law remains the only valid Law, and all the while a group of his Ummah will always be on the path of truth, apparent and dominant. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And they say, &#8220;We hear, and we obey&#8221;) means, we heard Your statement, O our Lord, comprehended and implemented it, and adhered to its implications.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((We seek) Your forgiveness, our Lord) contains a plea and supplication for Allah&#8217;s forgiveness, mercy and kindness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope) means, Allah does not ask a soul what is beyond its ability. This only demonstrates Allah&#8217;s kindness, compassion and generosity towards His creation. This Ayah is the Ayah that abrogated the Ayah that worried the Companions, that is, Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whether you disclose what is in yourselves or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that although Allah will question His servants and judge them, He will only punish for what one is able to protect himself from. As for what one cannot protect himself from, such as what one says to himself &#8211; or passing thoughts &#8211; they will not be punished for that. We should state here that to dislike the evil thoughts that cross one&#8217;s mind is a part of faith. Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He gets reward for that which he has earned) of good,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And he is punished for that which he has earned) of evil, that is, concerning the acts that one is responsible for.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then said, [mentioning what the believers said] while directing His servants to supplicate to Him, all the while promising them that He will answer their supplication:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;Our Lord! Push us not if we forget or fall into error,&#8221;) meaning, &#8220;If we forgot an obligation or fell into a prohibition, or made an error while ignorant of its ruling.&#8221; We mentioned the Hadith by Abu Hurayrah, that Muslim collected, wherein Allah said, &#8220;I shall (accept your supplication).&#8221; There is also the Hadith by Ibn `Abbas that Allah said, &#8220;I did (accept your supplication).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Our Lord! Lay not on us a burden like that which You did lay on those before us (Jews and Christians),) means, &#8220;Even if we were able to perform them, do not require us to perform the difficult deeds as You required the previous nations before us, such as the burdens that were placed on them. You sent Your Prophet Muhammad , the Prophet of mercy, to abrogate these burdens through the Law that You revealed to him, the Hanifi (Islamic Monotheism), easy religion.&#8221; Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said that Allah said, &#8220;I shall (accept your supplication).&#8221; Ibn `Abbas narrated that the Messenger of Allah said that Allah said, &#8220;I did (accept your supplication).&#8221; There is the Hadith recorded through various chains of narration that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I was sent with the easy Hanifiyyah way.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear) </strong>of obligations, hardships and afflictions, do not make us bear what we cannot bear of this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We mentioned that Allah said, &#8220;I shall (accept your supplication)&#8221; in one narration, and, &#8220;I did (accept your supplication),&#8221; in another narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Pardon us) meaning, between us and You regarding what You know of our shortcomings and errors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And grant us forgiveness) concerning what is between us and Your servants. So do not expose our errors and evil deeds to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Have mercy on us) in what will come thereafter. Therefore, do not allow us to fall into another error. They say that those who commit error need three things: Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for what is between Him and them, that He conceals these errors from His other servants, and thus does not expose them before the servants, and that He grants them immunity from further error.&#8221; We mentioned before that Allah answered these pleas, &#8220;I shall,&#8221; in one narration and, &#8220;I did,&#8221; in another narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(You are our Mawla) meaning, You are our supporter and helper, our trust is in You, You are sought for each and every type of help and our total reliance is on You. There is no power or strength except from You.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And give us victory over the disbelieving people) those who rejected Your religion, denied Your Oneness, refused the Message of Your Prophet , worshipped other than You and associated others in Your worship. Give us victory and make us prevail above them in this and the Hereafter. Allah said, &#8220;I shall,&#8221; in one narration, and, &#8220;I did,&#8221; in the Hadith that Muslim collected from Ibn `Abbas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further, Ibn Jarir recorded that Abu Ishaq said that whenever Mu`adh would finish reciting this Surah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And give us victory over the disbelieving people), he would say &#8220;Amin.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded from Suhayb that the Messenger of Allah said:Among the people who came before you, there was a king who had a sorcerer, and when that sorcerer became old, he said to the king, &#8220;I have become old and my time is nearly over, so please send me a boy whom I can teach magic.&#8221; So, he sent him a boy and the sorcerer taught him magic. Whenever the boy went to the sorcerer, he sat with a monk who was on the way and listened to his speech and admired them. So, when he went to the sorcerer, he passed by the monk and sat there with him; and on visiting the sorcerer the latter would thrash him. So, the boy complained about this to the monk. The monk said to him, &#8220;Whenever you are afraid of the sorcerer, say to him: `My people kept me busy.&#8217; And whenever you are afraid of your people, say to them: `The sorcerer kept me busy.&#8221;&#8217; So the boy carried on like that (for some time). Then a huge terrible creature appeared on the road and the people were unable to pass by. The boy said, &#8220;Today I shall know whether the sorcerer is better or the monk is better.&#8221; So, he took a stone and said, &#8220;O Allah! If the deeds and actions of the monk are liked by You better than those of the sorcerer, then kill this creature so that the people can cross (the road).&#8221; Then he struck it with a stone killing it and the people passed by on the road.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The boy came to the monk and informed him about it. The monk said to him, &#8220;O my son! Today you are better than I, and you have achieved what I see! You will be put to trial. And in case you are put to trial, do not inform (them) about me.&#8221;The boy used to treat the people suffering from congenital blindness, leprosy, and other diseases. There was a courtier of the king who had become blind and he heard about the boy. He came and brought a number of gifts for the boy and said, &#8220;All these gifts are for you on the condition that you cure me.&#8221; The boy said, &#8220;I do not cure anybody; it is only Allah who cures people. So, if you believe in Allah and supplicate to Him, He will cure you.&#8221; So, he believed in and supplicated to Allah, and Allah cured him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Later, the courtier came to the king and sat at the place where he used to sit before. The king said, &#8220;Who gave you back your sight&#8221;The courtier replied, &#8220;My Lord.&#8221; The king then said, &#8220;I did&#8221; The courtier said, &#8220;No, my Lord and your Lord &#8211; Allah&#8221; The king said, &#8220;Do you have another Lord beside me&#8221; The courtier said, &#8220;Yes, your Lord and my Lord is Allah.&#8221; The king tortured him and did not stop until he told him about the boy. So, the boy was brought to the king and he said to him, &#8220;O boy! Has your magic reached to the extent that you cure congenital blindness, leprosy and other diseases&#8221;He said, &#8221; I do not cure anyone. Only Allah can cure.&#8221; The king said, &#8220;Me&#8221; The boy replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; The king asked, &#8220;Do you have another Lord besides me&#8221;The boy answered, &#8221; My Lord and your Lord is Allah.&#8221; So, he tortured him also until he told about the monk. Then the monk was brought to him and the king said to him, &#8220;Abandon your religion.&#8221; The monk refused and so the king ordered a saw to be brought which was placed in the middle of his head and he fell, sawn in two. Then it was said to the man who used to be blind, &#8220;Abandon your religion.&#8221; He refused to do so, and so a saw was brought and placed in the middle of his head and he fell, sawn in two. Then the boy was brought and it was said to him, &#8220;Abandon your religion.&#8221; He refused and so the king sent him to the top of such and such mountain with some people. He told the people, &#8220;Ascend up the mountain with him till you reach its peak, then see if he abandons his religion; otherwise throw him from the top.&#8221; They took him and when they ascended to the top, he said, &#8221; O Allah! Save me from them by any means that You wish.&#8221; So, the mountain shook and they all fell down and the boy came back walking to the king. The king said, &#8221; What did your companions (the people I sent with you) do&#8221; The boy said, &#8220;Allah saved me from them.&#8221; So, the king ordered some people to take the boy on a boat to the middle of the sea, saying, &#8220;If he renounces his religion (well and good), but if he refuses, drown him.&#8221; So, they took him out to sea and he said, &#8220;O Allah! Save me from them by any means that you wish.&#8221; So they were all drowned in the sea.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the boy returned to the king and the king said, &#8220;What did your companions do&#8221; The boy replied, &#8220;Allah, saved me from them.&#8221; Then he said to the king, &#8220;You will not be able to kill me until you do as I order you. And if you do as I order you, you will be able to kill me.&#8221; The king asked, &#8220;And what is that&#8221; The boy said, &#8220;Gather the people in one elevated place and tie me to the trunk of a tree; then take an arrow from my quiver and say: `In the Name of Allah, the Lord of the boy.&#8217; If you do this, you will be able to kill me.&#8221; So he did this, and placing an arrow in the bow, he shot it, saying, &#8220;In the Name of Allah, the Lord of the boy.&#8221; The arrow hit the boy in the temple, and the boy placed his hand over the arrow wound and died. The people proclaimed, &#8220;We believe in the Lord of the boy!&#8217;’ Then it was said to the king, &#8220;Do you see what has happened That which you feared has taken place. By Allah, all the people have believed (in the Lord of the boy).&#8221;So he ordered that ditches be dug at the entrances to the roads and it was done, and fires were kindled in them. Then the king said, &#8220;Whoever abandons his religion, let him go, and whoever does not, throw him into the fire.&#8221; They were struggling and scuffling in the fire, until a woman and her baby whom she was breast feeding came and it was as if she was being somewhat hesitant of falling into the fire, so her baby said to her,&#8221;Be patient mother! For verily, you are following the truth!&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim also recorded this Hadith at the end of the Sahih. Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar related this story in his book of Sirah in another way that has some differences from that which has just been related. Then, after Ibn Ishaq explained that the people of Najran began following the religion of the boy after his murder, which was the religion of Christianity, he said, &#8220;Then (the king) Dhu Nuwas came to them with his army and called them to Judaism. He gave them a choice to either accept Judaism or be killed, so they chose death. Thus, he had a ditch dug and burned (some of them) in the fire (in the ditch), while others he killed with the sword. He made an example of them (by slaughtering them) until he had killed almost twenty thousand of them. It was about Dhu Nuwas and his army that Allah revealed to His Messenger :</p>

<td>(Cursed were the People of the Ditch. Of fire fed with fuel. When they sat by it. And they witnessed what they were doing against the believers. And they had no fault except that they believed in Allah, the Almighty, Worthy of all praise! To Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth! And Allah is Witness over everything.) (85:4-9)</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what Muhammad bin Ishaq said in his book of Sirah &#8212; that the one who killed the People of the Ditch was Dhu Nuwas, and his name was Zur`ah. In the time of his kingdom he was called Yusuf. He was the son of Tuban As`ad Abi Karib, who was the Tubba` who invaded Al-Madinah and put the covering over the Ka`bah. He kept two rabbis with him from the Jews of Al-Madinah. After this some of the people of Yemen accepted Judaism at the hands of these two rabbis, as Ibn Ishaq mentions at length. So Dhu Nuwas killed twenty thousand people in one morning in the Ditch. Only one man among them escaped. He was known as Daws Dhu Tha`laban. He escaped on a horse and they set out after him, but they were unable to catch him. He went to Caesar, the emperor of Ash-Sham. So, Caesar wrote to An-Najashi, the King of Abyssinia. So, he sent with him an army of Abyssinian Christians, who were lead by Aryat and Abrahah. They rescued Yemen from the hands of the Jews. Dhu Nuwas tried to flee but eventually fell into the sea and drowned. After this, the kingdom of Abyssinia remained under Christian power for seventy years. Then the power was divested from the Christians by Sayf bin Dhi Yazin Al-Himyari when Kisra, the king of Persia sent an army there (to Yemen). He (the king) sent with him (Sayf Al-Himyari) those people who were in the prisons, and they were close to seven hundred in number. So, he (Sayf Al-Himyari) conquered Yemen with them and returned the kingdom back to the people of Himyar (Yemenis).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Al Hamdulillah<br />
</strong><strong>(All Praise and Thanks be to Allah)</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Meaning of Al-Hamd</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Ja`far bin Jarir said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>The meaning of (Al-Hamdu Lillah) (all praise and thanks be to Allah)</strong> is: all thanks are due purely to Allah, alone, not any of the objects that are being worshipped instead of Him, nor any of His creation. These thanks are due to Allah&#8217;s innumerable favors and bounties, that only He knows the amount of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s bounties include creating the tools that help the creation worship Him, the physical bodies with which they are able to implement His commands, the sustenance that He provides them in this life, and the comfortable life He has granted them, without anything or anyone compelling Him to do so. Allah also warned His creation and alerted them about the means and methods with which they can earn eternal dwelling in the residence of everlasting happiness. All thanks and praise are due to Allah for these favors from beginning to end.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further, Ibn Jarir commented on the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Al-Hamdu Lillah)</strong>, that it means, &#8220;A praise that Allah praised Himself with, indicating to His servants that they too should praise Him, as if Allah had said, `Say: All thanks and praise is due to Allah.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was said that the statement, <strong>(All praise and thanks be to Allah)</strong>, entails praising Allah by mentioning His most beautiful Names and most honorable Attributes. When one proclaims, `All thanks are due to Allah,&#8217; he will be thanking Him for His favors and bounties.&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Difference between Praise and Thanks</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hamd is more general, in that it is a statement of praise for one&#8217;s characteristics, or for what he has done. Thanks are given for what was done, not merely for characteristics.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Statements of the Salaf about Al-Hamd</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hafs mentioned that `Umar said to `Ali, &#8220;We know La ilaha illallah, Subhan Allah and Allahu Akbar. What about Al-Hamdu Lillah&#8221; `Ali said, &#8220;<strong>A statement that Allah liked for Himself, was pleased with for Himself and He likes that it be repeated</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Ibn `Abbas said, <strong>&#8220;Al-Hamdu Lillah is the statement of appreciation. When the servant says Al-Hamdu Lillah, Allah says, `My servant has praised Me.&#8221;</strong> Ibn Abi Hatim recorded this Hadith.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Virtues of Al-Hamd</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal recorded that Al-Aswad bin Sari` said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I said, `O Messenger of Allah! Should I recite to you words of praise for My Lord, the Exalted, that I have collected&#8217; He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Verily, your Lord likes Al-Hamd.)</strong>&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nasa&#8217;i also recorded this Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, Abu `Isa At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa&#8217;i and Ibn Majah recorded that Musa bin Ibrahim bin Kathir related that Talhah bin Khirash said that Jabir bin `Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(The best Dhikr (remembering Allah) is La ilaha illallah and the best supplication is Al-Hamdu Lillah.)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At-Tirmidhi said that this Hadith is Hasan Gharib.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Ibn Majah recorded that Anas bin Malik said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(No servant is blessed by Allah and says,`Al-Hamdu Lillah&#8217;, except that what he was given is better than that which he has himself acquired.)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further, in his Sunan, Ibn Majah recorded that Ibn `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(A servant of Allah once said, `O Allah! Yours is the Hamd that is suitable for the grace of Your Face and the greatness of Your Supreme Authority.&#8217; The two angels were confused as to how to write these words. They ascended to Allah and said, `O our Lord! A servant has just uttered a statement and we are unsure how to record it for him.&#8217; Allah said while having more knowledge in what His servant has said, &#8216;What did My servant say&#8217; They said, `He said, `<strong>O Allah! Yours is the Hamd that is suitable for the grace of Your Face and the greatness of Your Supreme Authority</strong>.&#8217; Allah said to them, <strong>`Write it as My servant has said it, until he meets Me and then I shall reward him for it</strong>.)</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Al before Hamd encompasses all Types of Thanks and Appreciation for Allah</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The letters Alif and Lam before the word Hamd serve to encompass all types of thanks and appreciation for Allah, the Exalted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Hadith stated,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(O Allah! All of Al-Hamd is due to You, You own all the ownership, all types of good are in Your Hand and all affairs belong to You.)</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Tafsir Ibn Kathir of </b><b>Surat</b><b> At-Talaq</b></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>(Chapter &#8211; 65)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b><b>Which was revealed in Al-Madinah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[يأيُّهَا النَّبِىُّ إِذَا طَلَّقْتُمُ النِّسَآءَ فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ لِعِدَّتِهِنَّ وَأَحْصُواْ الْعِدَّةَ وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ رَبَّكُمْ لاَ تُخْرِجُوهُنَّ مِن بُيُوتِهِنَّ وَلاَ يَخْرُجْنَ إِلاَّ أَن يَأْتِينَ بِفَـحِشَةٍ مُّبَيِّنَةٍ وَتِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ وَمَن يَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَ اللَّهِ فَقَدْ ظَلَمَ نَفْسَهُ لاَ تَدْرِى لَعَلَّ اللَّهَ يُحْدِثُ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ أَمْراً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1. O Prophet! When you divorce women, divorce them at their `Iddah and count their `Iddah. And have Taqwa of Allah, your Lord. And turn them not out of their homes nor shall they leave, except in case they are guilty of Fahishah Mubayyinah. And those are the set limits of Allah. And whosoever transgresses the set limits of Allah, then indeed he has wronged himself. You know not, it may be that Allah will afterward bring some new thing to pass.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>There is a Period during which Divorced Women remain in Their Homes</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet was addressed first in this Ayah, to honor him, even though his Ummah is also being addressed in Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[يأيُّهَا النَّبِىُّ إِذَا طَلَّقْتُمُ النِّسَآءَ فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ لِعِدَّتِهِنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Prophet! When you divorce women, divorce them at their `Iddah) Al-Bukhari recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar divorced his wife, during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Messenger , while she was menstruating. `Umar bin Al-Khattab mentioned that to Allah&#8217;s Messenger . Allah&#8217;s Messenger became angry and said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«لِيُرَاجِعْهَا ثُمَّ يُمْسِكْهَا حَتْى تَطْهُرَ، ثُمَّ تَحِيضَ فَتَطْهُرَ، فَإِنْ بَدَا لَهُ أَنْ يُطَلِّقَهَا، فَلْيُطَلِّقْهَا طَاهِرًا قَبْلَ أَنْ يَمَسَّهَا، فَتِلْكَ الْعِدَّةُ الَّتِي أَمَرَ بِهَا اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَل»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Order him to take her back and keep her until she is clean from her menses, and then to wait until she gets her next period and becomes clean again. Then, if he wishes to divorce her, he can divorce her when she is clean from her menses, before he has sexual intercourse with her. This is the `Iddah which Allah the Exalted and Most Honored has fixed.) Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith in several parts of his Sahih. Muslim collected this Hadith and his narration uses these words,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«فَتِلْكَ الْعِدَّةُ الَّتِي أَمَرَ اللهُ أَنْ يُطَلَّقَ لَهَا النِّسَاء»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(This is the `Iddah which Allah has fixed for the women being divorced.) In his Sahih, Muslim has recorded a Hadith which is a more appropriate version from a narration of Ibn Jurayj who said that Abu Az-Zubayr informed him that he heard `Abdur-Rahman bin Ayman, the freed slave of `Azzah, questioning `Abdullah bin `Umar. And Abu Az-Zubayr heard the question, &#8220;What about a man who divorces his wife while she is still on her menses&#8221; `Abdullah answered, &#8220;During the time of Allah&#8217;s Messenger , `Abdullah bin `Umar divorced his wife who was menstruating in the life time of Allah&#8217;s Messenger . So Allah&#8217;s Messenger said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«لِيُرَاجِعْهَا»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Let him take her back.) so she returned and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«إِذَا طَهُرَتْ فَلْيُطَلِّقْ أَوْ يُمْسِك»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When she is pure, then either divorce or keep her.) `Abdullah bin `Umar said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Messenger recited this Ayah: (ياأَيُّها النَّبِيُّ إِذا طَلَّقْتُمُ النِّساءَ فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ فِي قُبُلِ عِدَّتِهِنَّ) (O Prophet! When you divorce women, divorce them at their `Iddah) And `Abdullah (Ibn Mas`ud) commented on Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ لِعِدَّتِهِنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(divorce them at their `Iddah) He said, &#8220;Purity without intercourse.&#8221; Similar was reported from Ibn `Umar, `Ata&#8217;, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Ibn Sirin, Qatadah, Maymun bin Mihran and Muqatil bin Hayyan. It is also reported from `Ikrimah and Ad-Dahhak.`Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas about the Ayah;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ لِعِدَّتِهِنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(divorce them at their `Iddah), &#8220;He does not divorce her while she is on her menses nor while she is pure if he has had intercourse during that (purity). Rather, he leaves her until she has her menses and after the menses ends, then he divorces her once.&#8221; And `Ikrimah said about</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ لِعِدَّتِهِنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(divorce them at their `Iddah), &#8220;The `Iddah is made up of clean- liness and the menstrual period.&#8221; So he divorces her while it is clear that she is pregnant, or he does not due to having sex, or since he does not know if she is pregnant or not. This is why the scholars said that there are two types of divorce, one that conforms to the Sunnah and another innovated. The divorce that conforms to the Sunnah is one where the husband pronounces one divorce to his wife when she is not having her menses and without having had sexual intercourse with her after the menses ended. One could divorce his wife when it is clear that she is pregnant. As for the innovated divorce, it occurs when one divorces his wife when she is having her menses, or after the menses ends, has sexual intercourse with her and then divorces her, even though he does not know if she became pregnant or not. There is a third type of divorce, which is neither a Sunnah nor an innovation where one divorces a young wife who has not begun to have menses, the wife who is beyond the age of having menses, and divorcing one&#8217;s wife before the marriage was consummated. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأَحْصُواْ الْعِدَّةَ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and count their `Iddah.) meaning, count for it and know its beginning and end, so that the `Iddah does not become prolonged for the woman and she cannot get married again,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ رَبَّكُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And have Taqwa of Allah, your Lord.) in this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Spending and Housing is up to the Husband during the Revocable `Iddah Period</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ تُخْرِجُوهُنَّ مِن بُيُوتِهِنَّ وَلاَ يَخْرُجْنَ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And turn them not out of their homes nor shall they leave,) meaning, during the duration of the `Iddah, she has the right to housing from her husband, as long as the `Iddah period continues. Therefore, the husband does not have the right to force her out of her house, nor is she allowed to leave his house, because she is still tied to the marriage contract. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِلاَّ أَن يَأْتِينَ بِفَاحِشَةٍ مُّبَيِّنَةٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(except in case they are guilty of Fahishah Mubayyinah.) meaning that the divorced wife is not to abandon her husband&#8217;s house unless she commits Fahishah Mubayyinah, in which case, she vacates her husband&#8217;s house. For example, Fahishah Mubayyinah implies adultery, according to `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, Ash-Sha`bi, Al-Hasan, Ibn Sirin, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Qilabah, Abu Salih, Ad-Dahhak, Zayd bin Aslam, `Ata&#8217; Al-Khurasani, As-Suddi, Sa`id bin Hilal and others. Fahishah Mubayyinah implies disobeying her husband openly or when she abuses her husband&#8217;s family in words and actions, according to Ubay bin Ka`b, Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah and others. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَتِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And those are the set limits of Allah.) means, these are from His legislation and prohibitions,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَ اللَّهِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whosoever transgresses the set limits of Allah,) meaning, whoever violates these limits, transgresses them and implements anything else besides them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَقَدْ ظَلَمَ نَفْسَهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(then indeed he has wronged himself.) by doing so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Wisdom of `Iddah at the Husband&#8217;s House</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ تَدْرِى لَعَلَّ اللَّهَ يُحْدِثُ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ أَمْراً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(You know not, it may be that Allah will afterward bring some new thing to pass.) meaning, `We commanded that the divorced wife remains in her husband&#8217;s house during the `Iddah period, so that the husband might regret his action and Allah decides that the husband feels in his heart for the marriage to continue.&#8217; This way, returning to his wife will be easier for him. Az-Zuhri said that `Ubaydullah bin `Abdullah said that Fatimah bint Qays said about Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ تَدْرِى لَعَلَّ اللَّهَ يُحْدِثُ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ أَمْراً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(You know not, it may be that Allah will afterward bring some new thing to pass.) &#8220;Taking her back.&#8221; Similar was said by Ash-Sha`bi, `Ata&#8217;, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Muqatil bin Hayyan and Ath-Thawri.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Irrevocably Divorced Woman does not have a Right to Provisions and Accommodations from the Husband</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here the view of the scholars of the Salaf and those who follow them is that housing is not obligatory in the case of the irrevocably divorced woman. They also relied on the Hadith of Fatimah bint Qays Al-Fihriyah when her husband Abu `Amr bin Hafs divorced her the third and final time. He was away from her in Yemen at the time, and he sent her his decision to divorce her. He also sent some barley with his messenger, but she did not like the amount or method of compensation. He said, &#8220;By Allah I am not obligated to spend upon you.&#8221; So, she went to Allah&#8217;s Messenger , who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«لَيْسَ لَكِ عَلَيْهِ نَفَقَة»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(There is no obligation on him to spend on you.) Muslim added in his narration,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«وَلَا سُكْنَى»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(nor housing.) And he ordered her to finish her `Iddah period in the house of Umm Sharik. He then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«تِلْكَ امْرَأَةٌ يَغْشَاهَا أَصْحَابِي، اعْتَدِّي عِنْدَ ابْنِ أُمِّ مَكْتُومٍ، فَإِنَّهُ رَجُلٌ أَعْمَى تَضَعِينَ ثِيَابَك»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(She is a woman my Companions visit. Spend this period in the house of Ibn Umm Maktum, for he is a blind man; [he cannot see you if] you take off your garments.) Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith using another chain of narration. In his narration, the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«انْظُرِي يَا بِنْتَ آلِ قَيْسٍ إِنَّمَا النَّفَقَةُ وَالسُّكْنَى لِلْمَرْأَةِ عَلَى زَوْجِهَا، مَا كَانَتْ لَهُ عَلَيْهَا رَجْعَةٌ، فَإِذَا لَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ عَلَيْهَا رَجْعَةٌ فَلَا نَفَقَةَ وَلَا سُكْنَى،اخْرُجِي فَانْزِلِي عَلَى فُلَانَة»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Look O daughter of the family of Qays! Spending and housing are required from the husband who can return to his wife. So if he does not have the right to return to her, then she does not have the right to spending and housing. So leave his house and go to so-and-so woman.) He then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«إِنَّهُ يُتَحَدَّثُ إِلَيْهَا، انْزِلِي عَلَى ابْنِ أُمِّ مَكْتُومٍ فَإِنَّهُ أَعْمَى لَا يَرَاك»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(They speak to her. Therefore, go to Ibn Umm Maktum, for he is a blind man and cannot see you.) Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that `Amir Ash-Sha`bi went to Fatimah bint Qays, sister of Ad-Dahhak bin Qays, from the tribe of Quraysh. Fatimah was married to Abu `Amr bin Hafs bin Al-Mughirah, from Bani Makhzum. She said, &#8220;Abu `Amr bin Hafs sent me his decision to divorce me while he was in an army that had gone to Yemen. I asked his friends to provide me with financial provisions and housing. They said, `He did not send us anything for that, nor did he request it from us.&#8217; I went to Allah&#8217;s Messenger and said to him, `O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! Abu `Amr bin Hafs divorced me, and I asked his friends to provide me with spending and housing and they said that he did not send them anything for that.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Messenger said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«إِنَّمَا السُّكْنَى وَالنَّفَقَةُ لِلْمَرْأَةِ إِذَا كَانَ لِزَوْجِهَا عَلَيْهَا رَجْعَةٌ، فَإِذَا كَانَتْ لَا تَحِلُّ لَهُ حَتْى تَنْكِحَ زَوْجًا غَيْرَهُ:فَلَا نَفَقَةَ لَهَا وَلَا سُكْنَى»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Spending and housing are required from the husband for his divorced wife if he can return to her. If she is not permitted for him anymore, until she marries another husband, then he does not have to provide her with spending and housing.)&#8221; An-Nasa&#8217;i also recorded this narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ فَارِقُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَأَشْهِدُواْ ذَوَى عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ وَأَقِيمُواْ الشَّهَـدَةَ لِلَّهِ ذَلِكُمْ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَن كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً &#8211; وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَـلِغُ أَمْرِهِ قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدْراً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2. Then when they are about to attain their term appointed, either take them back in a good manner or part with them in a good manner. And take as witness two just persons from among you. And establish the testimony for Allah. That will be an admonition given to him who believes in Allah and the Last Day. And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out.) (3. And He will provide him from where he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Ordaining Kindness towards Divorced Women</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted says that when the woman who is in her `Iddah nears the end of the `Iddah term, the husband must decide to reconcile with her, thus keeping their marriage together,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[بِمَعْرُوفٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(in a good manner) while being kind to her in their companionship. Otherwise, he must decide to divorce her on good terms, without abusing, cursing, or admonishing her. To the contrary, he should divorce her on good terms, observing kindness and good manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Command to have Witnesses for the Return</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأَشْهِدُواْ ذَوَى عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take as witness two just persons from among you.) meaning when taking her back, if this is your decision. Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah recorded that `Imran bin Husayn was asked about a man who divorced his wife and then had sexual intercourse with her, without notifying witnesses of when he divorced her and when he took her back. `Imran said, &#8220;His divorce and taking her back was in contradiction to the Sunnah. Incorporate the presence of witnesses for divorcing her and taking her back, and do not repeat your conduct.&#8221; Ibn Jurayj said that `Ata&#8217; commented on the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأَشْهِدُواْ ذَوَى عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take as witness two just persons from among you.) &#8220;It is not permissible to marry, divorce or take back the divorced wife except with two just witnesses, just as Allah the Exalted has said, except when there is a valid excuse.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ذَلِكُمْ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَن كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(That will be an admonition given to him who believes in Allah and the Last Day.) means, `this, Our command to you to have witnesses in such cases and to establish the witness, is implemented by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day.&#8217; This legislation is meant to benefit those who fear Allah&#8217;s punishment in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Allah provides, suffices, and makes a Way out of Every Hardship for Those Who have Taqwa</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاًوَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out. And He will provide him from where he never could imagine.) meaning, whoever has Taqwa of Allah in what He has commanded and avoids what He has forbidden, then Allah will make a way out for him from every difficulty and will provide for him from resources he never anticipated or thought about. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, &#8220;The most comprehensive Ayah in the Qur&#8217;an is,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَأْمُرُ بِالْعَدْلِ وَالإْحْسَانِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, Allah enjoins Al-`Adl (justice) and Al-Ihsan (doing good) (16:90). The greatest Ayah in the Qur&#8217;an that contains relief is,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out.)&#8221; `Ikrimah also commented on the Ayah, &#8220;Whoever divorces as Allah commanded him, then Allah will make a way out for him.&#8221; Similar was reported from Ibn `Abbas and Ad-Dahhak.`Abdullah bin Mas`ud and Masruq commented on the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out.) &#8220;It pertains to when one knows that if Allah wills He gives, and if He wills He deprives,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(from where he never could imagine.) from resources he did not anticipate&#8221; Qatadah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out.) &#8220;meaning, from every doubt and the horrors experienced at the time of death,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And He will provide him from where he never could imagine) from where he never thought of or anticipated.&#8221; Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that he rode the Prophet&#8217;s camel while sitting behind the Prophet , and the Messenger of Allah said to him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«يَا غُلَامُ إِنِّي مُعَلِّمُكَ كَلِمَاتٍ: احْفَظِ اللهَ يَحْفَظْكَ، احْفَظِ اللهَ تَجِدْهُ تُجَاهَكَ، وَإِذَا سَأَلْتَ فَاسْأَلِ اللهَ، وَإِذَا اسْتَعَنْتَ فَاسْتَعِنْ بِاللهِ، وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ الْأُمَّةَ لَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَنْفَعُوكَ لَمْ يَنْفَعُوكَ إِلَّا بِشَيْءٍ قَدْ كَتَبَهُ اللهُ لَكَ، وَلَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَضُرُّوكَ لَمْ يَضُرُّوكَ إِلَّا بِشَيْءٍ قَدْ كَتَبَهُ اللهُ عَلَيْكَ، رُفِعَتِ الْأَقْلَامُ وَجَفَّتِ الصُّحُف»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O boy! I will teach you words [so learn them]. Be mindful of Allah and He will protect you, be mindful of Allah and He will be on your side. If you ask, ask Allah, and if you seek help, seek it from Allah.

Know that if they gather their strength to harm you, they will never harm you, except with that which Allah has decreed against you. The pens have been raised and the pages are dry.) At-Tirmidhi collected this Hadith and said: &#8220;Hasan Sahih.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَـلِغُ أَمْرِهِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose.) meaning, Allah will execute His decisions and judgement that He made for him, in whatever way He wills and chooses,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدْراً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things.) This is like His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَكُلُّ شَىْءٍ عِندَهُ بِمِقْدَارٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Everything with Him is in (due) proportion.) (13:8)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(4. Those in menopause among your women, for them the `Iddah, if you have doubt, is three months; and for those who have no courses. And for those who are pregnant, their `Iddah is until they lay down their burden; and whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make his matter easy for him.) (5. That is the command of Allah, which He has sent down to you; and whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will expiate from him his sins, and will increase his reward.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The `Iddah of Those in Menopause and Those Who do not have Menses</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted clarifies the waiting period of the woman in menopause. And that is the one whose menstruation has stopped due to her older age. Her `Iddah is three months instead of the three monthly cycles for those who menstruate, which is based upon the Ayah in (Surat) Al-Baqarah. [see 2:228] The same for the young, who have not reached the years of menstruation. Their `Iddah is three months like those in menopause. This is the meaning of His saying;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَاللَّـتِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and for those who have no courses&#8230;) as for His saying;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِنِ ارْتَبْتُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(if you have doubt&#8230;) There are two opinions: First, is the saying of a group of the Salaf, like Mujahid, Az-Zuhri and Ibn Zayd. That is, if they see blood and there is doubt if it was menstrual blood or not. The second, is that if you do not know the ruling in this case, then know that their `Iddah is three months. This has been reported from Sa`id bin Jubayr and it is the view preferred by Ibn Jarir. And this is the more obvious meaning. Supporting this view is what is reported from Ubay bin Ka`b that he said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! Some women were not mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an, the young, the old and the pregnant.&#8221; Allah the Exalted and Most Honored sent down this Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَاللاَّئِى يَئِسْنَ مِنَ الْمَحِيضِ مِن نِّسَآئِكُمْ إِنِ ارْتَبْتُمْ فَعِدَّتُهُنَّ ثَلَـثَةُ أَشْهُرٍ وَاللَّـتِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ وَأُوْلَـتُ الاٌّحْمَالِ أَجَلُهُنَّ أَن يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Those in menopause among your women, for them the `Iddah, if you have doubt, is three months; and for those who have no courses. And for those who are pregnant, their `Iddah is until they lay down their burden.) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded a simpler narration than this one from Ubay bin Ka`b who said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! When the Ayah in Surat Al-Baqarah was revealed prescribing the `Iddah of divorce, some people in Al-Madinah said, `There are still some women whose `Iddah has not been mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an. There are the young, the old whose menstruation is discontinued, and the pregnant.&#8217; Later on, this Ayah was revealed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَاللاَّئِى يَئِسْنَ مِنَ الْمَحِيضِ مِن نِّسَآئِكُمْ إِنِ ارْتَبْتُمْ فَعِدَّتُهُنَّ ثَلَـثَةُ أَشْهُرٍ وَاللَّـتِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Those in menopause among your women, for them the `Iddah, if you have doubt, is three months; and for those who have no courses.)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>`Iddah of Pregnant Women</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأُوْلَـتُ الاٌّحْمَالِ أَجَلُهُنَّ أَن يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And for those who are pregnant, their `Iddah is until they lay down their burden;) Allah says: the pregnant woman&#8217;s `Iddah ends when she gives birth, whether in the case of divorce or death of the husband, according to the agreement of the majority of scholars of the Salaf and later generations. This is based upon this honorable Ayah and what is mentioned in the Prophetic Sunnah. Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Salamah said, &#8220;A man came to Ibn `Abbas while Abu Hurayrah was sitting with him and said, `Give me your verdict regarding a lady who delivered a baby forty days after the death of her husband.&#8217; Ibn `Abbas said,` [Her `Iddah period lasts until] the end of the longest among the two prescribed periods.&#8217; I recited,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأُوْلَـتُ الاٌّحْمَالِ أَجَلُهُنَّ أَن يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(For those who are pregnant, their prescribed period is until they deliver their burdens;) Abu Hurayrah said, `I agree with my cousin (Abu Salamah).&#8217; Then Ibn `Abbas sent his slave Kurayb to Umm Salamah to ask her. She replied, `The husband of Subay`ah Al-Aslamiyyah was killed while she was pregnant, and she delivered a baby forty days after his death. Then she received a marriage proposal and Allah&#8217;s Messenger married her to somebody. Abu As-Sanabil was one of those who proposed to her.&#8221; Al-Bukhari collected this short form of the Hadith, which Muslim and other scholars of Hadith collected using its longer form. Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Miswar bin Makhramah said, &#8220;Subay`ah Al-Aslamiyyah gave birth to a child a few days after the death of her husband. When she finished the postdelivery term, she was proposed to. So she sought the permission of Allah&#8217;s Messenger for the marriage, and he permitted her to marry, so she got married.&#8221; Al-Bukhari collected this narration, as did Muslim, Abu Dawud, An-Nasa&#8217;i and Ibn Majah with a different chain of narration from the Hadith of Subay`ah. Muslim bin Al-Hajjaj recorded that `Ubaydullah bin `Abdullah bin `Utbah said that his father wrote to `Umar bin `Abdullah bin Al-Arqam Az-Zuhri, requesting that he go to Subay`ah bint Al-Harith Al-Aslamiyyah to ask her about the matter in question, and about what Allah&#8217;s Messenger said to her when she sought his verdict. `Umar bin `Abdullah wrote to `Ubaydullah bin `Abdullah bin `Utbah informing him that Subay`ah told him that she had been married to Sa`d bin Khawlah, and he was one of those who participated in the battle of Badr. He died during the Farewell Pilgrimage, while she was pregnant. Soon after his death, she gave birth. When she passed the postnatal term, she beautified herself for those who might propose to her. Abu As-Sanabil bin Ba`kak came to her and said, `Why do I see you have beautified yourself Do you wish to remarry By Allah, you cannot marry unless four months and ten days have passed.&#8221; Subay`ah said, &#8220;When he said that, I dressed myself in the evening and went to Allah&#8217;s Messenger and asked him about his verdict. He gave me a religious verdict that I was allowed to marry after I had given birth to my child, saying I could marry if I wish.&#8221; This is the narration that Muslim collected. Al-Bukhari collected this Hadith in a shorter form. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ يُسْراً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make his matter easy for him.) means, Allah will make his matters lenient for him and will soon bring forth relief and a quick way out,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ذَلِكَ أَمْرُ اللَّهِ أَنزَلَهُ إِلَيْكُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(That is the command of Allah, which He has sent down to you;) meaning, this is His commandment and legislation that He sent down to you through His Messenger ,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يُكَفِّرْ عَنْهُ سَيِّئَـتِهِ وَيُعْظِمْ لَهُ أَجْراً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will expiate from him his sins, and will increase his reward.) means, Allah will prevent what he fears and multiply his reward even for the little good he does.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَسْكِنُوهُنَّ مِنْ حَيْثُ سَكَنتُم مِّن وُجْدِكُمْ وَلاَ تُضَآرُّوهُنَّ لِتُضَيِّقُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ وَإِن كُنَّ أُوْلَـتِ حَمْلٍ فَأَنفِقُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ حَتَّى يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ فَإِنْ أَرْضَعْنَ لَكُمْ فَـَاتُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ وَأْتَمِرُواْ بَيْنَكُمْ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَإِن تَعَاسَرْتُمْ فَسَتُرْضِعُ لَهُ أُخْرَى &#8211; لِيُنفِقْ ذُو سَعَةٍ مِّن سَعَتِهِ وَمَن قُدِرَ عَلَيْهِ رِزْقُهُ فَلْيُنفِقْ مِمَّآ ءَاتَاهُ اللَّهُ لاَ يُكَلِّفُ اللَّهُ نَفْساً إِلاَّ مَآ ءَاتَاهَا سَيَجْعَلُ اللَّهُ بَعْدَ عُسْرٍ يُسْراً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(6. Lodge them where you dwell, according to what you have, and do not harm them so as to suppress them. And if they are pregnant, then spend on them till they lay down their burden. Then if they suckle the children for you, give them their due payment, and let each of you deal with each other in a mannerly way. But if you make difficulties for one another, then some other woman may suckle for him.) (7. Let the rich man spend according to his means; and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allah has given him. Allah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him. Allah will grant after hardship, ease.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Divorced Woman has the Right to Decent Accommodations, and what is Reasonable</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted orders His faithful servants that when one of them divorces his wife, he should provide housing for her until the end of her `Iddah period,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَسْكِنُوهُنَّ مِنْ حَيْثُ سَكَنتُم]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Lodge them where you dwell,) means, with you,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[مِّن وُجْدِكُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(according to what you have,) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and several others said, it refers to &#8220;Your ability.&#8221; Qatadah said, &#8220;If you can only afford to accommodate her in a corner of your house, then do so.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Forbidding Ill-Treatment of Divorced Women</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلاَ تُضَآرُّوهُنَّ لِتُضَيِّقُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and do not harm them in order to suppress them.) Muqatil bin Hayyan said, &#8220;meaning, do not annoy her to force her to pay her way out nor expel her from your house.&#8221; Ath-Thawri said from Mansur, from Abu Ad-Duha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلاَ تُضَآرُّوهُنَّ لِتُضَيِّقُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and do not harm them in order to suppress them) &#8220;He divorces her, and when a few days remain, he takes her back.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Irrevocable Divorced Pregnant Woman has the Right of Support (Maintenance) from Her Husband until She gives Birth</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَإِن كُنَّ أُوْلَـتِ حَمْلٍ فَأَنفِقُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ حَتَّى يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And if they are pregnant, then spend on them till they lay down their burden.) This is about the woman who is irrevocably divorced. If she is pregnant, then she is to be spent on her until she lays down her burden. This is supported due to the fact that if she is revocably divorced, the she has then right to receive her support (maintenance) whether she is pregnant or not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Divorced Mother may take Compensation for suckling Her Child</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَإِنْ أَرْضَعْنَ لَكُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then if they suckle them for you,) meaning, when pregnant women give birth and they are irrevocably divorced by the expiration of the `Iddah, then at that time they may either suckle the child or not. But that is only after she nourishes him with the milk, that is the early on milk which the infant&#8217;s well-being depends upon. Then, if she suckles, she has the right to compensation for it. She is allowed to enter into a contract with the father or his representative in return for whatever payment they agree to. This is why Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَإِنْ أَرْضَعْنَ لَكُمْ فَـَاتُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then if they suckle the children for you, give them their due payment,) Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأْتَمِرُواْ بَيْنَكُمْ بِمَعْرُوفٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and let each of you deal with each other in a mannerly way.) meaning, the affairs of the divorced couple should be managed in a just way without causing harm to either one of them, just as Allah the Exalted said in Surat Al-Baqarah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ تُضَآرَّ وَلِدَةٌ بِوَلَدِهَا وَلاَ مَوْلُودٌ لَّهُ بِوَلَدِهِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(No mother shall be treated unfairly on account of her child, nor father on account of child.) (2:233) Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَإِن تَعَاسَرْتُمْ فَسَتُرْضِعُ لَهُ أُخْرَى]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(But if you make difficulties for one another, then some other woman may suckle for him.) meaning, if the divorced couple disagrees, because the woman asks for an unreasonable fee for suckling their child, and the father refuses to pay the amount or offers an unreasonable amount, he may find another woman to suckle his child. If the mother agrees to accept the amount that was to be paid to the woman who agreed to suckle the child, then she has more right to suckle her own child. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لِيُنفِقْ ذُو سَعَةٍ مِّن سَعَتِهِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Let the rich man spend according to his means;) means, the wealthy father or his representative should spend on the child according to his means,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن قُدِرَ عَلَيْهِ رِزْقُهُ فَلْيُنفِقْ مِمَّآ ءَاتَاهُ اللَّهُ لاَ يُكَلِّفُ اللَّهُ نَفْساً إِلاَّ مَآ ءَاتَاهَا]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allah has given him. Allah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him.) This is as Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ يُكَلِّفُ اللَّهُ نَفْسًا إِلاَّ وُسْعَهَا]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[سَيَجْعَلُ اللَّهُ بَعْدَ عُسْرٍ يُسْراً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah will grant after hardship, ease.) This is a sure promise from Him, and indeed, Allah&#8217;s promises are true and He never breaks them, This is an Allah&#8217;s saying;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَإِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْراً &#8211; إِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْراً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, along with every hardship is relief. Verily, along with every hardship is relief.) [94:5-6] There is a relevant Hadith that we should mention here. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, &#8220;A man and his wife from an earlier generation were poor. Once when the man came back from a journey, he went to his wife saying to her, while feeling hunger and fatigued, `Do you have anything to eat&#8217; She said, `Yes, receive the good news of Allah&#8217;s provisions.&#8217; He again said to her, `If you have anything to eat, bring it to me.&#8217; She said, `Wait a little longer.&#8217; She was awaiting Allah&#8217;s mercy. When the matter was prolonged, he said to her, `Get up and bring me whatever you have to eat, because I am real hungry and fatigued.&#8217; She said, `I will. Soon I will open the oven&#8217;s cover, so do not be hasty.&#8217; When he was busy and refrained from insisting for a while, she said to herself, `I should look in my oven.&#8217; So she got up and looked in her oven and found it full of the meat of a lamb, and her mortar and pestle was full of seed grains; it was crushing the seeds on its own. So, she took out what was in the mortar and pestle, after shaking it to remove everything from inside, and also took the meat out that she found in the oven.&#8221; Abu Hurayrah added, &#8220;By He in Whose Hand is the life of Abu Al-Qasim (Prophet Muhammad )! This is the same statement that Muhammad said,</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(Had she taken out what was in her mortar and not emptied it fully by shaking it, it would have continued crushing the seeds until the Day of Resurrection.)&#8221;</p>

(9. So it tasted the evil result of its affair, and the consequence of its affair was loss.) (10. Allah has prepared for them a severe torment. So have Taqwa of Allah, O men of understanding, those who believe! Allah has indeed sent down to you a Reminder.) (11. A Messenger, who recites to you the Ayat of Allah containing clear explanations, that He may take out those who believe and do righteous good deeds, from the darkness to the light. And whosoever believes in Allah and performs righteous deeds, He will admit him into Gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. Allah has indeed granted for him an excellent provision.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Punishment for defying Allah&#8217;s Commandments</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted threatens those who defy His commands, deny His Messengers and contradict His legislation, by informing them of the end that earlier nations met who did the same,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَكَأِيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ عَتَتْ عَنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّهَا وَرُسُلِهِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And many a town revolted against the command of its Lord and His Messengers;) meaning, they rebelled, rejected and arrogantly refused to obey Allah and they would not follow His Messengers,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَحَاسَبْنَـهَا حِسَاباً شَدِيداً وَعَذَّبْنَـهَا عَذَاباً نُّكْراً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and We called it to a severe account, and We shall punish it with a horrible torment.) meaning, horrendous and terrifying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَذَاقَتْ وَبَالَ أَمْرِهَا]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So it tasted the evil result of its affair,) meaning, they tasted the evil consequences of defiance and they regretted their actions when regret does not avail,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَكَانَ عَـقِبَةُ أَمْرِهَا خُسْراًأَعَدَّ اللَّهُ لَهُمْ عَذَاباً شَدِيداً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and the consequence of its affair was loss. And Allah has prepared for them a severe torment.) means, in the Hereafter, added to the torment that was sent down on them in this life. Allah the Exalted said, after mentioning what happened to the disbelieving nations,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ يأُوْلِى الأَلْبَـبِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So have Taqwa of Allah, O men of understanding,) meaning, `O you who have sound understanding, do not be like them because if you do, you will suffer what they suffered, O people of comprehension,&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(who believe) meaning, in Allah and His Messengers,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[قَدْ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ إِلَيْكُمْ ذِكْراً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah has indeed sent down to you a Reminder.) meaning, this Qur&#8217;an. Allah also said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِنَّا نَحْنُ نَزَّلْنَا الذِّكْرَ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَـفِظُونَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr and surely, We will preserve it.) (15:9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Qualities of the Messenger</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[رَّسُولاً يَتْلُو عَلَيْكُمْ ءَايَـتِ اللَّهِ مُبَيِّنَـتٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(A Messenger, who recites to you the Ayat of Allah containing clear explanations,) Some said that the Messenger is the subject of what is being sent [as a reminder] because the Messenger is the one that conveys the Dhikr. Ibn Jarir said that what is correct is that the Messenger explains the Dhikr. This is why Allah the Exalted said here,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[رَّسُولاً يَتْلُو عَلَيْكُمْ ءَايَـتِ اللَّهِ مُبَيِّنَـتٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(A Messenger, who recites to you the Ayat of Allah containing clear explanations,) meaning, plain and apparent. The statement of Allah;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لِّيُخْرِجَ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ مِنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(that He may take out those who believe and do righteous good deeds, from the darkness to the light.) Allah&#8217;s is like saying;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[كِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَـهُ إِلَيْكَ لِتُخْرِجَ النَّاسَ مِنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(A Book which We have revealed unto you in order that you might lead mankind out of darkness) (14:1), and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[اللَّهُ وَلِيُّ الَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ يُخْرِجُهُم مِّنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah is the Guardian of those who believe. He brings them out from darkness into light.) (2:257) meaning, out of the darkness of disbelief and ignorance into the light of faith and knowledge. Allah the Exalted called the revelation that He has sent down, light, on account of the guidance that it brings. Allah also called it Ruh, in that, it brings life to the hearts,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَكَذَلِكَ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ رُوحاً مِّنْ أَمْرِنَا مَا كُنتَ تَدْرِى مَا الْكِتَـبُ وَلاَ الإِيمَـنُ وَلَـكِن جَعَلْنَـهُ نُوراً نَّهْدِى بِهِ مَن نَّشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا وَإِنَّكَ لَتَهْدِى إِلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And thus We have sent to you Ruh of our command. You knew not what is the book, nor what is faith But We have made it a light wherewith we guide whosoever of Our servants We will. And verily, you are indeed guiding to the straight path.) (42:52) Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ وَيَعْمَلْ صَـلِحاً يُدْخِلْهُ جَنَّـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَداً قَدْ أَحْسَنَ اللَّهُ لَهُ رِزْقاً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whosoever believes in Allah and performs righteous good deeds, He will admit him into Gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. Allah has indeed granted for him an excellent provision.) was explained several times before, and therefore, we do not need to repeat its explanation here. All the thanks and praises are due to Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[اللَّهُ الَّذِى خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَـوَتٍ وَمِنَ الاٌّرْضِ مِثْلَهُنَّ يَتَنَزَّلُ الاٌّمْرُ بَيْنَهُنَّ لِّتَعْلَمُواْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ قَدْ أَحَاطَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عِلْمَا ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(12. It is Allah Who has created seven heavens and of the earth the like thereof. His command descends between them, that you may know that Allah has power over all things, and that Allah surrounds all things with (His) knowledge.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Allah&#8217;s Perfect Power</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted asserts His perfect power and infinite greatness, so that the great religion that He has legislated is honored and implemented,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[اللَّهُ الَّذِى خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَـوَتٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(It is Allah Who has created seven heavens) Allah said in similar Ayat, like what Prophet Nuh said to his people,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَلَمْ تَرَوْاْ كَيْفَ خَلَقَ اللَّهُ سَبْعَ سَمَـوَتٍ طِبَاقاً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(See you not how Allah has created the seven heavens one above another) (71:15), and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[تُسَبِّحُ لَهُ السَّمَـوَتُ السَّبْعُ وَالاٌّرْضُ وَمَن فِيهِنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify him.) (17:44) Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمِنَ الاٌّرْضِ مِثْلَهُنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and of the earth the like thereof.) means, He created seven earths. In the Two Sahihs, there is a Hadith that states,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«مَنْ ظَلَمَ قِيدَ شِبْرٍ مِنَ الْأَرْضِ طُوِّقَهُ مِنْ سَبْعِ أَرَضِين»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Whoever usurps the land of somebody unjustly, even if it was a mere hand span, then his neck will be encircled with it down to the seven earths.) And in Sahih Al-Bukhari the wording is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«خُسِفَ بِهِ إِلَى سَبْعِ أَرَضِين»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;he will sink down to the seven earths.) In the beginning of my book, Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah, I mentioned the various narrations for this Hadith when I narrated the story of the creation of the earth. All the thanks and praise is due to Allah. Those who explained this Hadith to mean the seven continents have brought an implausible explanation that contradicts the letter of the Qur&#8217;an and the Hadith without having proof. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat At-Talaq, all the thanks and praise is due to Allah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement; (Allah will grant after hardship, ease.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a sure promise from Him, and indeed, Allah&#8217;s promises are true and He never breaks them, This is an Allah&#8217;s saying; (Verily, along with every hardship is relief. Verily, along with every hardship is relief.) [94:5-6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a relevant Hadith that we should mention here. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;A man and his wife from an earlier generation were poor. Once when the man came back from a journey, he went to his wife saying to her, while feeling hunger and fatigued, `Do you have anything to eat&#8217; She said, `Yes, receive the good news of Allah&#8217;s provisions.&#8217; He again said to her, `If you have anything to eat, bring it to me.&#8217; She said, `Wait a little longer.&#8217; She was awaiting Allah&#8217;s mercy. When the matter was prolonged, he said to her, `Get up and bring me whatever you have to eat, because I am real hungry and fatigued.&#8217; She said, `I will. Soon I will open the oven&#8217;s cover, so do not be hasty.&#8217; When he was busy and refrained from insisting for a while, she said to herself, `I should look in my oven.&#8217; So she got up and looked in her oven and found it full of the meat of a lamb, and her mortar and pestle was full of seed grains; it was crushing the seeds on its own. So, she took out what was in the mortar and pestle, after shaking it to remove everything from inside, and also took the meat out that she found in the oven.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah added, &#8220;By He in Whose Hand is the life of Abu Al-Qasim (Prophet Muhammad )! This is the same statement that Muhammad said, (Had she taken out what was in her mortar and not emptied it fully by shaking it, it would have continued crushing the seeds until the Day of Resurrection.)&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Enjoining certain Manners so that the Mothers of the Believers may be an Example; and the Prohibition of Tabarruj</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tafsir Ibn Kathir</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the good manners which Allah enjoined upon the wives of the Prophet so that they would be an example for the women of the Ummah to follow. Allah said, addressing the wives of the Prophet that they should fear Allah as He commanded them, and that no other woman is like them or can be their equal in virtue and status. Then Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَلاَ تَخْضَعْنَ بِالْقَوْلِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(then be not soft in speech,) As-Suddi and others said, this means, do not be gentle in speech when addressing men. Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَيَطْمَعَ الَّذِى فِى قَلْبِهِ مَرَضٌ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(lest he in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire,) means, something unclean.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَقُلْنَ قَوْلاً مَّعْرُوفاً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(but speak in an honorable manner.) Ibn Zayd said: &#8220;Decent and honorable talk that is known to be good.&#8221; This means that she should address non-Mahram men in a manner in which there is no softness, i.e., a woman should not address a non-Mahram man in the same way that she addresses her husband.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَقَرْنَ فِى بُيُوتِكُنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And stay in your houses,) means, stay in your houses and do not come out except for a purpose. One of the purposes mentioned in Shari`ah is prayer in the Masjid, so long as the conditions are fulfilled, as the Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«لَا تَمْنَعُوا إِمَاءَ اللهِ مَسَاجِدَ اللهِ وَلْيَخْرُجْنَ وَهُنَّ تَفِلَات»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Do not prevent the female servants of Allah from the Masjids of Allah, but have them go out without wearing fragrance.) According to another report:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«وَبُيُوتُهُنَّ خَيْرٌ لَهُن»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(even though their houses are better for them.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلاَ تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَـهِلِيَّةِ الاٍّولَى]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and do not Tabarruj yourselves like the Tabarruj of the times of ignorance,) Mujahid said: &#8220;Women used to go out walking in front of men, and this was the Tabarruj of Jahiliyyah.&#8221; Qatadah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلاَ تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَـهِلِيَّةِ الاٍّولَى]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and do not Tabarruj yourselves like the Taburruj of the times of ignorance,) &#8220;When they go out of their homes walking in a shameless and flirtatious manner, and Allah, may He be exalted, forbade that.&#8221; Muqatil bin Hayyan said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلاَ تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَـهِلِيَّةِ الاٍّولَى]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and do not Tabarruj yourselves like the Tabarruj of the times of ignorance,) &#8220;Tabarruj is when a woman puts a Khimar on her head but does not tie it properly.&#8221; So her necklaces, earrings and neck, and all of that can be seen. This is Tabarruj, and Allah addresses all the women of the believers with regard to Tabarruj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأَقِمْنَ الصَّلَوةَ وَءَاتِينَ الزَّكَـوةَ وَأَطِعْنَ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and perform the Salah, and give Zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger.) Allah first forbids them from evil, then He enjoins them to do good by establishing regular prayer, which means worshipping Allah alone with no partner or associate, and paying Zakah, which means doing good to other people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأَطِعْنَ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and obey Allah and His Messenger.) This is an instance of something specific being followed by something general.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s saying: (And let them not stamp their feet&#8230;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During Jahiliyyah, when women walked in the street wearing anklets and no one could hear them, they would stamp their feet so that men could hear their anklets ringing. Allah forbade the believing women to do this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By the same token, if there is any other kind of adornment that is hidden, women are forbidden to make any movements that would reveal what is hidden, because Allah says: (And let them not stamp their feet&#8230;) to the end of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From that, women are also prohibited from wearing scent and perfume when they are going outside the home, lest men should smell their perfume. Abu `Isa At-Tirmidhi recorded that Abu Musa, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Prophet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Every eye commits fornication and adultery, and when a woman puts on perfume and passes through a gathering, she is such and such) &#8212; meaning an adulteress.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;And there is a similar report from Abu Hurayrah, and this is Hasan Sahih.&#8221; It was also recorded by Abu Dawud and An-Nasa&#8217;i.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By the same token, women are also forbidden to walk in the middle of the street, because of what this involves of wanton display.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dawud recorded that Abu Usayd Al-Ansari said that he heard the Messenger of Allah , as he was coming out of the Masjid and men and women were mixing in the street, telling the women:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Keep back, for you have no right to walk in the middle of the street. You should keep to the sides of the road.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The women used to cling to the walls so much that their clothes would catch on the walls.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And all of you beg Allah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful.) means, practice what you are commanded in these beautiful manners and praiseworthy characteristics, and give up the evil ways of the people of Jahiliyyah, for the greatest success is to be found in doing what Allah and His Messenger command and avoiding what He forbids.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah is the source of strength.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَـهُ فِى لَيْلَةِ الْقَدْرِ </span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"> وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ</span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ أَلْفِ شَهْرٍ</span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">تَنَزَّلُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ وَالرُّوحُ فِيهَا بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِم مِّن كُلِّ أَمْرٍ</span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">سَلَـمٌ هِىَ حَتَّى مَطْلَعِ الْفَجْرِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(1. Verily, We have sent it down in the Night of Al-Qadr.) (2. And what will make you know what the Night of Al-Qadr is) (3. The Night of Al-Qadr is better than a thousand months.) (4. Therein descend the angels and the Ruh by their Lord&#8217;s permission with every matter.) (5. There is peace until the appearance of dawn.)</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>The Virtues of the Night of Al-Qadr(the Decree)</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah informs that He sent the Qur&#8217;an down during the Night of Al-Qadr, and it is a blessed night about which Allah says,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَاهُ فِي لَيْلَةٍ مُّبَارَكَةٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(We sent it down on a blessed night.)</span> (44:3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Night of Al-Qadr and it occurs during the month of Ramadan. This is as Allah says,</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ الَّذِي أُنزِلَ فِيهِ الْقُرْآنُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Qur&#8217;an.)</span> (2:185)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Abbas and others have said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Allah sent the Qur&#8217;an down all at one time from the Preserved Tablet (<em>Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz</em>) to the House of Might (<em>Baytul-`Izzah</em>), which is in the heaven of this world. Then it came down in parts to the Messenger of Allah based upon the incidents that occurred over a period of twenty-three years.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah magnified the status of the Night of Al-Qadr, which He chose for the revelation of the Mighty Qur&#8217;an, by His saying,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ &#8211; لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ أَلْفِ شَهْرٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(And what will make you know what the Night of Al-Qadr is The Night of Al-Qadr is better than a thousand months.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah &#8220;When Ramadan would come, the Messenger of Allah would say,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قَدْ جَاءَكُمْ شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ، شَهْرٌ مُبَارَكٌ، افْتَرَضَ اللهُ عَلَيْكُمْ صِيَامَهُ، تُفْتَحُ فِيهِ أَبْوَابُ الْجَنَّةِ، وَتُغْلَقُ فِيهِ أَبْوَابُ الْجَحِيمِ، وَتُغَلُّ فِيهِ الشَّيَاطِينُ، فِيهِ لَيْلَةٌ خَيْرٌ مِنْ أَلْفِ شَهْرٍ، مَنْ حُرِمَ خَيْرَهَا فَقَدْ حُرِم</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">(Verily, the month of Ramadan has come to you all. It is a blessed month, which Allah has obligated you all to fast. During it the gates of Paradise are opened, the gates of Hell are closed and the devils are shackled. In it there is a night that is better than one thousand months. Whoever is deprived of its good, then he has truly been deprived.)&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nasa&#8217;i recorded this same Hadith. Aside from the fact that worship during the Night of Al-Qadr is equivalent to worship performed for a period of one thousand months, it is also confirmed in the Two Sahihs from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ قَامَ لَيْلَةَ الْقَدْرِ إِيمَانًا وَاحْتِسَابًا غُفِرَ لَهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِنْ ذَنْبِه</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">(Whoever stands (in prayer) during the Night of Al-Qadr with faith and expecting reward (from Allah), he will be forgiven for his previous sins.)</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>The Descent of the Angels and the Decree for Every Good during the Night of Al-Qadr</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">تَنَزَّلُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ وَالرُّوحُ فِيهَا بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِم مِّن كُلِّ أَمْرٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Therein descend the angels and the Ruh by their Lord&#8217;s permission with every matter.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">meaning, the angels descend in abundance during the Night of Al-Qadr due to its abundant blessings. The angels descend with the descending of blessings and mercy, just as they descend when the Qur&#8217;an is recited, they surround the circles of Dhikr (remembrance of Allah) and they lower their wings with true respect for the student of knowledge. In reference to Ar-Ruh, it is said that here it means the angel Jibril. Therefore, the wording of the Ayah is a method of adding the name of the distinct object (in this case Jibril) separate from the general group (in this case the angels). Concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">مِّن كُلِّ أَمْرٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(with every matter.)</span> Mujahid said, &#8220;Peace concerning every matter.&#8221; Sa`id bin Mansur said, `Isa bin Yunus told us that Al-A`mash narrated to them that Mujahid said concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">سَلَـمٌ هِىَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(There is peace)</span> &#8220;It is security in which Shaytan cannot do any evil or any harm.&#8221; Qatadah and others have said, <strong>&#8220;The matters are determined during it, and the times of death and provisions are measured out (i.e., decided) during it.&#8221;</strong> Allah says,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">فِيهَا يُفْرَقُ كُلُّ أَمْرٍ حَكِيمٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Therein is decreed every matter of decree.)</span> (44:4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah says,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">سَلَـمٌ هِىَ حَتَّى مَطْلَعِ الْفَجْرِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(There is peace until the appearance of dawn.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa`id bin Mansur said, &#8220;Hushaym narrated to us on the authority of Abu Ishaq, who narrated that Ash-Sha`bi said concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">تَنَزَّلُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ وَالرُّوحُ فِيهَا بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِم مِّن كُلِّ أَمْرٍ &#8211; سَلَـمٌ هِىَ حَتَّى مَطْلَعِ الْفَجْرِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(With every matter, there is a peace until the appearance of dawn.)</span> `<strong>The angels giving the greetings of peace during the Night of Al-Qadr to the people in the Masjids until the coming of Fajr (dawn)</strong>.&#8221;&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qatadah and Ibn Zayd both said concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">سَلَـمٌ هِىَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(There is peace.)</span> &#8220;This means all of it is good and there is no evil in it until the coming of Fajr (dawn).&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Specifying the Night of Decree and its Signs</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is supported by what Imam Ahmad recorded from `Ubadah bin As-Samit that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ فِي الْعَشْرِ الْبَوَاقِي، مَنْ قَامَهُنَّ ابْتِغَاءَ حِسْبَتِهِنَّ فَإِنَّ اللهَ يَغْفِرُ لَهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِنْ ذَنْبِهِ وَمَا تَأَخَّرَ، وَهِيَ لَيْلَةُ وِتْرٍ: تِسْعٍ أَوْ سَبْعٍ أَوْ خَامِسَةٍ أَوْ ثَالِثَةٍ أَوْ آخِرِ لَيْلَة</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">(The Night of Al-Qadr occurs during the last ten (nights). Whoever stands for them (in prayer) seeking their reward, then indeed Allah will forgive his previous sins and his latter sins. It is an odd night: the ninth, or the seventh, or the fifth, or the third or the last night (of Ramadan).) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah also said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ أَمَارَةَ لَيْلَةِ الْقَدْرِ أَنَّهَا صَافِيَةٌ بَلْجَةٌ، كَأَنَّ فِيهَا قَمَرًا سَاطِعًا، سَاكِنَةٌ سَاجِيَةٌ، لَا بَرْدَ فِيهَا وَلَا حَرَّ، وَلَا يَحِلُّ لِكَوْكَبٍ يُرْمَى بِهِ فِيهَا حَتْى يُصْبِحَ، وَإِنَّ أَمَارَتَهَا أَنَّ الشَّمْسَ صَبِيحَتَهَا تَخْرُجُ مُسْتَوِيَةً لَيْسَ لَهَا شُعَاعٌ، مِثْلَ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَلَا يَحِلُّ لِلشَّيْطَانِ أَنْ يَخْرُجَ مَعَهَا يَوْمَئِذ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">(Verily, the sign of the Night of Al-Qadr is that it is pure and glowing as if there were a bright, tranquil, calm moon during it. It is not cold, nor is it hot, and no shooting star is permitted until morning. Its sign is that the sun appears on the morning following it smooth having no rays on it, just like the moon on a full moon night. Shaytan is not allowed to come out with it (the sun) on that day.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This chain of narration is good. In its text there is some oddities and in some of its wordings there are things that are objectionable. Abu Dawud mentioned a section in his Sunan that he titled, &#8220;Chapter: Clarification that the Night of Al-Qadr occurs during every Ramadan.&#8221; Then he recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah was asked about the Night of Al-Qadr while I was listening and he said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">هِيَ فِي كُلِّ رَمَضَان</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(It occurs during every Ramadan.)&#8221; The men of this chain of narration are all reliable, but Abu Dawud said that Shu`bah and Sufyan both narrated it from Ishaq and they both considered it to be a statement of the Companion (Ibn `Umar, and thus not the statement of the Prophet ).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been reported that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Messenger of Allah performed I`tikaf during the first ten nights of Ramadan and we performed I`tikaf with him. Then Jibril came to him and said, `That which you are seeking is in front of you.&#8217; So the Prophet performed I`tikaf during the middle ten days of Ramadan and we also performed I`tikaf with him. Then Jibril came to him and said; `That which you are seeking is ahead of you.&#8217; So the Prophet stood up and gave a sermon on the morning of the twentieth of Ramadan and he said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ كَانَ اعْتَكَفَ مَعِيَ فَلْيَرْجِعْ فَإِنِّي رَأَيْتُ لَيْلَةَ الْقَدْرِ، وَإِنِّي أُنْسِيتُهَا، وَإِنَّهَا فِي الْعَشْرِ الْأَوَاخِرِ فِي وِتْرٍ، وَإِنِّي رَأَيْتُ كَأَنِّي أَسْجُدُ فِي طِينٍ وَمَاء</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#808000;">(Whoever performed I`tikaf with me, let him come back (for I`tikaf again), for verily I saw the Night of Al-Qadr, and I was caused to forget it, and indeed it is during the last ten (nights). It is during an odd night and I saw myself as if I were prostrating in mud and water.)</span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The roof of the Masjid was made of dried palm-tree leaves and we did not see anything (i.e., clouds) in the sky. But then a patch of wind-driven clouds came and it rained. So the Prophet lead us in prayer until we saw the traces of mud and water on the forehead of the Messenger of Allah , which confirmed his dream.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one narration it adds that this occurred on the morning of the twenty-first night (meaning the next morning). They both (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) recorded it in the Two Sahihs. Ash-Shafi`i said, &#8220;This Hadith is the most authentic of what has been reported.&#8221; It has also been said that it is on the twenty-third night due to a Hadith narrated from `Abdullah bin Unays in Sahih Muslim. It has also been said that it is on the twenty-fifth night due to what Al-Bukhari recorded from Ibn `Abbas that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الْتَمِسُوهَا فِي الْعَشْرِ الْأَوَاخِرِ مِنْ رَمَضَانَ فِي تَاسِعَةٍ تَبْقَى، فِي سَابِعَةٍ تَبْقَى، فِي خَامِسَةٍ تَبْقَى</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#808000;">(Seek it in the last ten (nights) of Ramadan. In the ninth it still remains, in the seventh it still remains, in the fifth it still remains.)</span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many have explained this Hadith to refer to the odd nights, and this is the most apparent and most popular explanation. It has also been said that it occurs on the twenty-seventh night because of what Muslim recorded in his Sahih from Ubay bin Ka`b that the Messenger of Allah mentioned that it was on the twenty-seventh night. Imam Ahmad recorded from Zirr that he asked Ubayy bin Ka`b, &#8220;O Abu Al-Mundhir! Verily, your brother Ibn Mas`ud says whoever stands for prayer (at night) the entire year, will catch the Night of Al-Qadr.&#8221; He (Ubayy) said, &#8220;May Allah have mercy upon him. Indeed he knows that it is during the month of Ramadan and that it is the twenty-seventh night.&#8221; Then he swore by Allah. Zirr then said, &#8220;How do you know that&#8221; Ubayy replied, &#8220;By a sign or an indication that he (the Prophet ) informed us of. It rises that next day having no rays on it &#8212; meaning the sun.&#8221; Muslim has also recorded it. It has been said that it is the night of the twenty-ninth. Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal recorded from `Ubadah bin As-Samit that he asked the Messenger of Allah about the Night of Decree and he replied,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فِي رَمَضَانَ فَالْتَمِسُوهَا فِي الْعَشْرِ الْأَوَاخِرِ، فَإِنَّهَا فِي وِتْرٍ إِحْدَى وَعِشْرِينَ، أَوْ ثَلَاثٍ وَعِشْرِينَ، أَوْ خَمْسٍ وَعِشْرِينَ، أَوْ سَبْعٍ وَعِشْرِينَ، أَوْ تِسْعٍ وَعِشْرِينَ، أَوْ فِي آخِرِ لَيْلَة</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">(Seek it in Ramadan in the last ten nights. For verily, it is during the odd nights, the twenty-first, or the twenty-third, or the twenty-fifth, or the twenty-seventh, or the twenty-ninth, or during the last night.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad also recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said about the Night of Al-Qadr,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهَا لَيْلَةُ سَابِعَةٍ أَوْ تَاسِعَةٍ وَعِشْرِينَ، وَإِنَّ الْمَلَائِكَةَ تِلْكَ اللَّيْلَةَ فِي الْأَرْضِ أَكْثَرُ مِنْ عَدَدِ الْحَصَى</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">(Verily, it is during the twenty-seventh or the twenty-ninth night. And verily, the angels who are on the earth during that night are more numerous than the number of pebbles.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad was alone in recording this Hadith and there is nothing wrong with its chain of narration. At-Tirmidhi recorded from Abu Qilabah that he said, &#8220;<strong>The Night of Al-Qadr moves around (i.e., from year to year) throughout the last ten nights.</strong>&#8221; This view that At-Tirmidhi mentions from Abu Qilabah has also been recorded by Malik, Ath-Thawri, Ahmad bin Hanbal, Ishaq bin Rahuyah, Abu Thawr, Al-Muzani, Abu Bakr bin Khuzaymah and others. It has also been related from Ash-Shafi`i, and Al-Qadi reported it from him, and this is most likely. And Allah knows best.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Supplication during the Night of Decree</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is recommended to supplicate often during all times, especially during the month of Ramadan, in the last ten nights, and during the odd nights of it even more so. It is recommended that one say the following supplication a lot: &#8220;O Allah! Verily, You are the Oft-Pardoning, You love to pardon, so pardon me.&#8221; This is due to what Imam Ahmad recorded from `A&#8217;ishah, that she said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! If I find the Night of Al-Qadr what should I say&#8221; He replied,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>قُولِي: اللْهُمَّ إِنَّكَ عَفُوٌّ تُحِبُّ الْعَفْوَ فَاعْفُ عَنِّي</strong></span></h2>

<p style="text-align:justify;">At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa&#8217;i and Ibn Majah have all recorded this Hadith.

An-Nasa&#8217;i also recorded it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah Laylat Al-Qadr, and all praise and blessings are due to Allah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Two Episodes of Jewish Mischief [From Tafsir Soorah al-`Isra]<br />
Imam Ibn Kathir<br />
Tafsir Ibn Kathir (Abridged), Volume 5<br />
© Darussalam 2000</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Surah 17. Al-Isra&#8217; (4-8)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. And We decreed for the Children of Israel in the Scripture:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed you would do mischief in the land twice and you will become tyrants and extremely arrogant!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. So, when the promise came for the first of the two, We sent against you servants of Ours given to terrible warfare. They entered the very innermost parts of your homes. And it was a promise (completely) fulfilled. 6. <i>Then We gave you a return of victory over them. And We helped you with wealth and children and made you more numerous in manpower.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>7. (And We said): &#8220;If you do good, you do good for your own selves, and if you do evil (you do it) against yourselves.&#8221; Then, when the second promise came to pass, (We permitted your enemies) to disgrace your faces and to enter the Masjid as they had entered it before, and to destroy with utter destruction all that fell in their hands.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>8. It may be that your Lord may show mercy unto you, but if you return (to sins). We shall return (to Our punishment). And We have made Hell a prison for the disbelievers.</i></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">It was mentioned in the Tawrah that the Jews would spread Mischief twice</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah tells us that He made a declaration to the Children of Israel in the Scripture, meaning that He had already told them in the Book which He revealed to them, that they would cause mischief on the earth twice, and would become tyrants and extremely arrogant, meaning they would become shameless oppressors of people, Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And We made known this decree to him, that the root of those (sinners) was to be cut off in the early morning. </strong>(15:66),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">meaning, We already told him about that and informed him of it.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">The First Episode of Mischief caused by the Jews, and their Punishment for it</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So, when the promise came for the first of the two</strong>, meaning the first of the two episodes of mischief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>We sent against you servants of Ours given to terrible warfare.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">means, &#8216;We unleashed soldiers against you from among Our creatures who were given to terrible warfare,&#8217; i.e., they had great strength and weapons and power. They entered the very innermost parts of your homes, meaning they took possession of your land and invaded the very innermost parts of your homes, going between and through your houses, coming and going freely with no fear of anyone. This was the promise (completely) fulfilled.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The earlier and later commentators differed over the identity of these invaders. Many <i>Isra`iliyyat</i> (reports from Jewish sources) were narrated about this, but I did not want to make this book too long by mentioning them, because some of them are fabricated, concocted by their heretics, and others may be true, but we have no need of them, praise be to Allah. What Allah has told us in His Book (the Qur&#8217;an) is sufficient and we have no need of what is in the other books that came before. Neither Allah nor His Messenger required us to refer to them. Allah told His Messenger sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam that when (the Jews) committed transgression and aggression, Allah gave their enemies power over them to destroy their country and enter the innermost parts of their homes. Their humiliation and subjugation was a befitting punishment, and your Lord is never unfair or unjust to His servants. They had rebelled and killed many of the Prophets and scholars. Ibn Jarir recorded that Yahya bin Satd said: &#8220;I heard Sa&#8217;id bin Al-Musayyib saying: &#8216;Nebuchadnezzar conquered Ash-Sham (Greater Syria, including Palestine), destroying Jerusalem and killing them, then he came to Damascus and found blood boiling in a censer. He asked them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is this blood? They said: We found our forefathers doing this. Because of that blood, he killed seventy thousand of the believers and others, then the blood stoppedboiling.&#8221;[At-Tabari 17:369.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This report is <i>Sahih</i> from Said bin Al-Musayyib, and this event is well-known, as he (Nebuchadnezzar) killed their nobles and scholars, and did not leave alive anyone who knew the Tawrah by heart. He took many prisoners from the sons of the Prophets and others, and did many other things that would take too long to mention here. If we had found anything that was correct or close enough, we could have written it and reported it here. And Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And We said): &#8220;If you do good, you do good for your own selves, and if you do evil (you do it) against yourselves.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allah says elsewhere:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Whosoever does a righteous good deed, it is for (the benefit of) himself; and whosoever does evil, it is against himself. </strong>[45:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Second Episode of Mischief</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Then, when the second promise came to pass</strong>, meaning, the second episode of mischief, when your enemies came again,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(We permitted your enemies) to disgrace your faces</strong>, meaning, to humiliate you and subdue you,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>and to enter the Masjid</strong>, meaning, Bayt Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>as they had entered it before</strong>, when they entered the very innermost parts of your homes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and to destroy wrecking and inflicting ruin upon it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>all that fell in their hands</strong>, everything they could get their hands on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>with utter destruction. It may be that your Lord may show mercy unto you</strong> , meaning that He may rid you of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>but if you return (to sins). We shall return (to Our punishment)</strong>,  meaning, if you return to causing mischief,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>We shall return </strong>means We will once again punish you in this world, along with the punishment and torment We save for you in the Hereafter.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And We have made Hell a prison [Hasir] for the disbelievers</strong>, meaning, a place of permanent detention, a prison which cannot be avoided or escaped. Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;<i>Hasiir </i>here means a jail.&#8221; [At-Tabari 17:390] Mujahid said, &#8220;They will be detained in it.&#8221; [At-Tabari 17:390] Others said likewise. Al-Hasan said, &#8220;<i>Hasir </i>means a bed of Fire.&#8221; [At-Tabari 17:390] Qatadah said: &#8220;The Children of Israel returned to aggression, so Allah sent this group against them, Muhammad sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam and his companions, who made them pay the <i>Jizyah</i>, [a tax levied from People of the Book (Jews and Christians) who are under the protection of a Muslim government] with willing submission, and feeling themselves subdued.&#8221; [At-Tabari 17:389]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Source: Tafseer Ibn Katheer</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2.246. Have you not thought about the group of the Children of Israel after (the time of) Musa When they said to a Prophet of theirs, &#8220;Appoint for us a king and we will fight in Allah&#8217;s way.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Would you then refrain from fighting, if fighting was prescribed for you&#8221; They said, &#8220;Why should we not fight in Allah&#8217;s way while we have been driven out of our homes and our children (families have been taken as captives)&#8221; But when fighting was ordered for them, they turned away, all except a few of them. And Allah is All-Aware of the wrongdoers.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujahid said that the Prophet (mentioned in the Ayah 2:246 above) is Shamwil (Samuel). Wahb bin Munabbih said: The Children of Israel remained on the straight path for a period of time after Moses. They then innovated in the religion and some of them even worshipped the idols. Yet, there were always Prophets sent among them who would command them to work righteous deeds, refrain from doing evil and who would rule them according to the commands of the Torah. When they (Israelites) committed the evil that they committed, Allah caused their enemies to overwhelm them, and many fatalities fell among them as a consequence. Their enemies also captured a great number of them, and took over large areas of their land. Earlier, anyone who would fight the Israelites would lose, because they had the Torah and the Tabut, which they inherited generation after generation ever since the time of Moses, who spoke to Allah directly. Yet, the Israelites kept indulging in misguidance until some king took the Tabut from them during a battle. That king also took possession of the Torah, and only a few of the Israelites who memorized it remained. The prophethood halted among their various tribes and only a pregnant woman remained of the offspring of Lavi (Levi), in whom the prophethood still appeared. Her husband had been killed, so the Israelites kept her in a house so that Allah may give her a boy, who would be their Prophet. The woman also kept invoking Allah to grant her a boy. Allah heard her pleas and gave her a boy whom she called `Shamwil&#8217; meaning `Allah has heard my pleas.&#8217; Some people said that the boy&#8217;s name was Sham`un (Simeon), which also has a similar meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As that boy grew, Allah raised him to be a righteous person. When he reached the age of prophethood, Allah revealed to him and commanded him to call (his people) to Him and to His Tawhid (Oneness). Shamwil called the Children of Israel (to Allah) and they asked him to appoint a king over them so that they could fight their enemies under his command. The kingship had also ended among them. Their Prophet said to them, &#8220;What if Allah appoints a king over you, would you fulfill your vow to fight under his command&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(They said, &#8220;Why should we not fight in Allah&#8217;s way while we have been driven out of our homes and our children&#8221;) meaning, `After our land had been confiscated and our children had been taken from us&#8217; Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(But when fighting was ordered for them, they turned away, all except a few of them. And Allah is All-Aware of the wrongdoers) meaning, only a few of them kept their promise, but the majority abandoned Jihad and Allah has full knowledge of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(247. And their Prophet said to them, &#8220;Indeed Allah has appointed Talut (Saul) as a king over you.&#8221; They said, &#8220;How can he be a king over us when we are fitter than him for the kingdom, and he has not been given enough wealth.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Verily, Allah has chosen him above you and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature. And Allah grants His kingdom to whom He wills. And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures&#8217; needs, All-Knower.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Israelites asked their Prophet to appoint a king over them, he appointed Talut (Saul), who was then a soldier. But, Talut was not a descendant of the house of kings among them, which was exclusively in the offspring of Yahudha (Judah). This is why they said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(How can he be a king over us) meaning, how can he be the king for us,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(when we are fitter than him for the kingdom, and he has not been given enough wealth) They said that Talut was also poor and did not have the wealth that justifies him being king. Some people stated that Talut used to bring water to the people, while others stated that his profession was dyeing skins. The Jews, thus, disputed with their Prophet while they were supposed to obey him and to say good words to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their Prophet answered them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, Allah has chosen him above you) meaning, `Allah chose Talut from amongst you while having better knowledge about him.&#8217; Their Prophet stated, &#8220;I did not choose Talut to be your king on my own. Rather, Allah has commanded that upon your request.&#8221; Further:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature.) meaning, `Talut is more knowledgeable and honorable than you, and stronger and more patient during combat, and has more knowledge of warfare. In short, he has more knowledge and is stronger than you are. The king should have sufficient knowledge, be fair looking and should have a strong soul and body.&#8217; He then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And Allah grants His kingdom to whom He wills.) meaning, Allah Alone is the Supreme Authority Who does what He wills and no one can ask Him about His actions, while they will be asked (about their actions by Him). This is because Allah has perfect knowledge, wisdom and kindness with His creation. Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures&#8217; needs, All-Knower.) meaning, His favor is encompassing and He grants His mercy to whom He wills. He also knows those who deserve to be kings and those who do not deserve it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(248. And their Prophet said to them: &#8220;Verily! The sign of His kingdom is that there shall come to you At-Tabut, wherein is Sakinah (peace and reassurance) from your Lord and a remnant of that which Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron) left behind, carried by the angels. Verily, in this is a sign for you if you are indeed believers.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their Prophet then proclaimed, &#8220;The sign of the blessings of Talut&#8217;s kingship over you is that Allah will give you back the Tabut (wooden box) that has been taken from you.&#8221; Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(wherein is Sakinah from your Lord) meaning, peace (or grace) and reassurance. `Abdur-Razzaq stated that Qatadah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(wherein is Sakinah) means grace. In addition, Ar-Rabi` said that Sakinah means mercy. This is also the meaning given by Ibn `Abbas, as Al-`Awfi narrated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;and a remnant of that which Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron) left behind,)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jarir related that Ibn `Abbas said about this Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;and a remnant of that which Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron) left behind, ) Meaning, Moses&#8217; staff and the remnants of the Tablets. This is the same Tafsir of Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and `Ikrimah, who added, &#8220;And also the Torah.&#8221; `Abdur-Razzaq said that he asked Ath-Thawri about the meaning of,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;and a remnant of that which Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron) left behind,)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ath-Thawri said, &#8220;Some said that it contained a pot of manna and the remnants of the Tablets, while some others said that it contained (Moses&#8217;) staff and two shoes (and refer to 20:12).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;carried by the angels.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jurayj stated that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;The angels came down while carrying the Tabut between the sky and the earth, until they placed it before Talut while the people were watching.&#8221; As-Suddi said, &#8220;The Tabut was brought to Talut&#8217;s house, so the people believed in the prophethood of Sham`un (Simeon) and obeyed Talut&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, in this is a sign for you) testifying to my truth in what I was sent with, my prophethood, and my command to you to obey Talut,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(if you are indeed believers. ) in Allah and the Hereafter.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(249. Then when Talut set out with the army, he said: &#8220;Verily, Allah will try you by a river. So whoever drinks thereof, he is not of me; and whoever tastes it not, he is of me, except him who takes (thereof) in the hollow of his hand.&#8221; Yet, they drank thereof, all, except a few of them. So when he had crossed it (the river), he and those who believed with him, they said: &#8220;We have no power this day against Jalut (Goliath) and his hosts.&#8221; But those who knew with certainty that they were going to meet Allah, said: &#8220;How often has a small group overcome a mighty host by Allah&#8217;s leave&#8221; And Allah is with As-Sabirin (the patient).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah states that Talut, the king of the Children of Israel, marched forth with his soldiers and the Israelites who obeyed him. His army was of eighty thousand then, according to As-Suddi, but Allah knows best. Talut said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, Allah will try you) meaning, He will test you with a river, which flowed between Jordan and Palestine, i.e. , the Shari`ah river, according to Ibn `Abbas and others. He continued,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So whoever drinks thereof, he is not of me;) meaning, shall not accompany me today,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and whoever tastes it not, he is of me, except him who takes (thereof) in the hollow of his hand.) meaning, there is no harm in this case. Allah then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Yet, they drank thereof, all, except a few of them.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jurayj stated that Ibn `Abbas commented, &#8220;Whoever took some of it (the river&#8217;s water) in the hollow of his hand, quenched his thirst; as for those who drank freely from it, their thirst was not quenched.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jarir reported that Al-Bara&#8217; bin `Azib said, &#8220;We used to say that the Companions of Muhammad who accompanied him on the battle of Badr were more than three hundred and ten, just as many as the soldiers who crossed the river with Talut. Only those who believed crossed the river with him.&#8221; Al-Bukhari also reported this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So when he had crossed it (the river), he and those who believed with him, they said: &#8220;We have no power this day against Jalut (Goliath) and his hosts.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah indicates that the Israelites (who remained with Saul) thought that they were few in the face of their enemy who were many then. So, their knowledgeable scholars strengthened their resolve by stating that Allah&#8217;s promise is true and that triumph comes from Allah Alone, not from the large numbers or the adequacy of the supplies. They said to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;How often has a small group overcome a mighty host by Allah&#8217;s leave&#8221; And Allah is with As-Sabirin (the patient).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(250. And when they advanced to meet Jalut (Goliath) and his forces, they invoked: &#8220;Our Lord! Pour forth on us patience, and set firm our feet and make us victorious over the disbelieving people.&#8221;) (251. So they routed them by Allah&#8217;s leave and Dawud (David) killed Jalut (Goliath), and Allah gave him (Dawud) the kingdom ﴿after the death of Talut and Samuel﴾ and Al-Hikmah (prophethood), and taught him of that which He willed. And if Allah did not check one set of people by means of another, the earth would indeed be full of mischief. But Allah is full of bounty to the `Alamin (mankind, Jinn and all that exists).) (252. These are the verses of Allah, We recite them to you (O Muhammad ) in truth, and surely, you are one of the Messengers (of Allah.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the faithful party, who were few under the command of Talut, faced their enemy, who were many under the command of Jalut,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(they invoked: &#8220;Our Lord! Pour forth on us patience&#8230;&#8221;) meaning, send down patience on us from You.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and set firm our feet) meaning, against the enemy and save us from running away and from feebleness,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and make us victorious over the disbelieving people.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So they routed them by Allah&#8217;s leave) meaning, they defeated and overwhelmed them by Allah&#8217;s aid and support. Then,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and Dawud killed Jalut)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Israelite accounts claimed that (Prophet) David killed Goliath with a slingshot that he had, which he launched at Goliath causing his death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Talut promised that whoever killed Jalut, would marry his daughter and would share his kingship and authority. He kept his promise. Later, the kingship was transferred to Prophet Dawud in addition to being granted Prophethood by Allah. So, Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;and Allah gave him (Dawud) the kingdom) that Talut had and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and Al-Hikmah) that comes with the prophethood, meaning, after Shamwil. ﴿Allah then said:﴾</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and taught him of that which He willed.) meaning, what He willed of the knowledge that He bestowed on (Prophet) Dawud.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Next, Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And if Allah did not check one set of people by means of another, the earth would indeed be full of mischief.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah indicates that if it were not for the fact that Allah checks one set of people with another, such as when Talut and the bravery of Dawud helped the Children of Israel (against Goliath), then people would have perished. Similarly, Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(For had it not been that Allah checks one set of people by means of another, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and Masjids, wherein the Name of Allah is mentioned much, would surely, have been pulled down.) (22:40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(But Allah is full of bounty to the `Alamin (mankind, Jinn and all that exists)) meaning, by His mercy and favor He fixes some of them by some others. Surely, Allah has the wisdom, the supreme authority and the clear proof against His creation in all of His actions and statements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(These are the verses of Allah, We recite them to you (O Muhammad ) in truth, and surely, you are one of the Messengers (of Allah).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah states, `These Ayat (verses) of Allah that We have narrated for you in truth conform to the exact manner that these stories have occurred and to the truth that still remain in the (Divine) Books that the scholars of the Children of Israel have and know. Allah said: O Muhammad,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(you are)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(one of the Messengers (of Allah)) emphatically stating the truth of his prophet hood</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Tafsir Ibn Kathir (Abridged) &#8211; Al-Ma&#8217;idah surah 5© Darussalam 2000</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(64. The Jews say: &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Hand is tied up.&#8221; Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for what they uttered. Nay, both His Hands are widely outstretched. He spends as He wills. Verily, the revelation that has come to you from your Lord makes many of them increase in rebellion and disbelief. We have put enmity and hatred among them till the Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindled the fire of war, Allah extinguished it; and they (ever) strive to make mischief on the earth. And Allah does not like the mischief-makers.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(65. And if only the People of the Scripture had believed and had Taqwa, We would indeed have expiated for them their sins and admitted them to Gardens of pleasure (in Paradise).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(66. And if only they had acted according to the Tawrah, the Injil, and what has (now) been sent down to them from their Lord (the Qur&#8217;an), they would surely have gotten provision from above them and from underneath their feet. And among them is a Muqtasid Ummah, but for most of them; evil is their work.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah states that the Jews, may Allah&#8217;s continuous curses descend on them until the Day of Resurrection, describe Him as a miser. Allah is far holier than what they attribute to Him. The Jews also claim that Allah is poor, while they are rich. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Jews say, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Hand is tied up.&#8221;) &#8220;They do not mean that Allah&#8217;s Hand is literally tied up. Rather, they mean that He is a miser and does not spend from what He has. Allah is far holier than what they attribute to Him.&#8221; Similar was reported from Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak. Allah said in another Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck, nor stretch it forth to its utmost reach (like a spendthrift), so that you become blameworthy and in severe poverty.) In this Ayah, Allah prohibits stinginess and extravagance, which includes unnecessary and improper expenditures. Allah describes stinginess by saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck. ) Therefore, this is the meaning that the Jews meant, may Allah&#8217;s curses be on them. `Ikrimah said that this Ayah was revealed about Finhas, one of the Jews, may Allah curse him. We mentioned before that Finhas said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;Truly, Allah is poor and we are rich!&#8221;) and that Abu Bakr smacked him. Allah has refuted what the Jews attribute to Him and cursed them in retaliation for their lies and fabrications about Him. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for what they uttered.) What Allah said occurred, for the Jews are indeed miserly, envious, cowards and tremendously humiliated. Allah said in other Ayat,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Or have they a share in the dominion Then in that case they would not give mankind even a Naqir. Or do they envy men for what Allah has given them of His bounty Then, We had already given the family of Ibrahim the Book and the Hikmah, and conferred upon them a great kingdom.) and, n</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Indignity is put over them.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Hands are Widely Outstretched</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay, both His Hands are widely outstretched. He spends (of His bounty) as He wills.) Allah&#8217;s favors are ample, His bounty unlimited, as He owns the treasures of everything. Any good that reaches His servants is from Him alone, without partners. He has created everything that we need by night or by day, while traveling or at home and in all situations and conditions. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And He gave you of all that you asked for, and if you count the blessings of Allah, never will you be able to count them. Verily, man is indeed an extreme wrongdoer, an extreme ingrate.) There are many other Ayat on this subject. Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal said that `Abdur-Razzaq narrated to him that Ma`mar said that Hammam bin Munabbih said, &#8220;This is what Abu Hurayrah narrated to us that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah&#8217;s Right Hand is perfectly full, and no amount of spending can decrease what He has, even though He spends by night and by day. Do you see how much Allah has spent since He created the heavens and earth Yet surely it has not decreased what He has in His Right Hand. His Throne is over the water and in His Other Hand is the hold by which He raises and lowers.) He also said, قُولُ اللهُ تَعَالى:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah said, `Spend and I will spend on you.&#8217;)&#8221; This Hadith was recorded in the Two Sahihs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Tafseer Ibn Katheer from SuratAl Baqara</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2.80. And they (Jews) say, &#8220;The Fire shall not touch us but for a few numbered days.&#8221; Say (O Muhammad to them): &#8220;Have you taken a covenant from Allah, so that Allah will not break His covenant Or is it that you say of Allah what you know not&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah mentioned the claim of the Jews, that the Fire will only touch them for a few days, and then they will be saved from it. Allah refuted this claim by saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say (O Muhammad to them): &#8220;Have you taken a covenant from Allah&#8217;). Hence, the Ayah proclaims, `if you had a promise from Allah for that, then Allah will never break His promise. However, such promise never existed. Rather, what you say, about Allah, you have no knowledge of and you thus utter a lie about Him.&#8217; Al-`Awfi said that Ibn `Abbas said about the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And they (Jews) say, &#8220;The Fire shall not touch us but for a few numbered days.&#8221;). &#8220;The Jews said, `The Fire will only touch us for forty days.&#8221;&#8217; Others added that this was the period during which the Jews worshipped the calf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr bin Marduwyah reported Abu Hurayrah saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When Khaybar was conquered, a roasted poisoned sheep was presented to the Prophet as a gift (by the Jews). The Messenger of Allah ordered, `Assemble before me all the Jews who were here.&#8217; The Jews were summoned and the Prophet said (to them), `Who is your father&#8217; They replied, `So-and-so.&#8217; He said, `You have lied; your father is so-and-so.&#8217; They said, `You have uttered the truth.&#8217; He said, `Will you now tell me the truth, if I ask you about something&#8217; They replied, `Yes, O Abul-Qasim; and if we should tell a lie, you will know our lie as you have about our fathers.&#8217; On that he asked, `Who are the people of the (Hell) Fire&#8217; They said, `We shall remain in the (Hell) Fire for a short period, and after that you will replace us in it.&#8217; The Prophet said, `May you be cursed and humiliated in it! By Allah, we shall never replace you in it.&#8217; Then he asked, `Will you tell me the truth if I ask you a question&#8217; They said, `Yes, O Abul-Qasim.&#8217; He asked, `Have you poisoned this sheep&#8217; They said, `Yes.&#8217; He asked, `What made you do so&#8217; They said, `We wanted to know if you were a liar, in which case we would get rid of you, and if you were a Prophet then the poison would not harm you.&#8217;) Imam Ahmad, Al-Bukhari and An-Nasa&#8217;i recorded similarly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.5em;">Source: Tafseer Ibn Katheer (Dar-us-salam), Surah Ale-Imran , after the verses 93 to 95</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(93. All food was lawful to the Children of Israel, except what Isra&#8217;il made unlawful for himself before the Tawrah was revealed. Say: &#8220;Bring here the Tawrah and recite it, if you are truthful. &#8221;) (94. Then after that, whosoever shall invent a lie against Allah, then it is these that are the wrongdoers.) (95. Say:&#8221;Allah has spoken the truth; follow the religion of Ibrahim the Hanif (monotheist), and he was not of the Mushrikin (idolators).&#8221;)</span></p>
<p><strong>The Questions that the Jews Asked Our Prophet</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;A group of Jews came to Allah&#8217;s Prophet and said, `Talk to us about some things we will ask you and which only a Prophet would know.&#8217; He said, `Ask me about whatever you wish. However, give your pledge to Allah, similar to the pledge that Ya`qub took from his children, that if I tell you something and you recognize its truth, you will follow me in Islam.&#8217; They said, `Agreed.&#8217; The Prophet said, `Ask me about whatever you wish.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said, `Tell us about four matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. What kinds of food did Isra&#8217;il prohibit for himself</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. What about the sexual discharge of the woman and the man, and what role does each play in producing male or female offspring</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Tell us about the condition of the unlettered Prophet during sleep,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. And who is his Wali (supporter) among the angels&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet took their covenant that they will follow him if he answers these questions, and they agreed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, `I ask you by He Who sent down the Tawrah to Musa, do you not know that Isra&#8217;il once became very ill When his illness was prolonged, he vowed to Allah that if He cures His illness, he would prohibit the best types of drink and food for himself. Was not the best food to him camel meat and the best drink camel milk&#8217; They said, `Yes, by Allah.&#8217; The Messenger said, `O Allah, be Witness against them.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet then said, `I ask you by Allah, other than Whom there is no deity (worthy of worship), Who sent down the Tawrah to Musa, do you not know that man&#8217;s discharge is thick and white and woman&#8217;s is yellow and thin If any of these fluids becomes dominant, the offspring will take its sex and resemblance by Allah&#8217;s leave. Hence, if the man&#8217;s is more than the woman&#8217;s, the child will be male, by Allah&#8217;s leave. If the woman&#8217;s discharge is more than the man&#8217;s, then the child will be female, by Allah&#8217;s leave.&#8217; They said, `Yes.&#8217; He said, `O Allah, be Witness against them.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then said, `I ask you by He Who sent down the Tawrah to Musa, do you not know that the eyes of this unlettered Prophet sleep, but his heart does not sleep&#8217; They said, `Yes, by Allah!&#8217; He said, `O Allah, be Witness.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said, `Tell us now about your Wali among the angels, for this is when we either follow or shun you.&#8217; He said, `My Wali (who brings down the revelation from Allah) is Jibril, and Allah never sent a Prophet, but Jibril is his Wali.&#8217; They said, `We then shun you. Had you a Wali other than Jibril, we would have followed you.&#8217; On that, Allah, the Exalted revealed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say: &#8220;Whoever is an enemy to Jibril&#8230;&#8221;) ﴿2:97﴾.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(before the Tawrah was revealed) ﴿3:93﴾, means, Isra&#8217;il forbade that for himself before the Tawrah was revealed. There are two objectives behind revealing this segment of the Ayah. First, he forbade himself the most delightful things for Allah&#8217;s sake. This practice was allowed during his period of Law, and is, thus, suitable that it is mentioned after Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(By no means shall you attain Al-Birr, unless you spend of that which you love) ﴿3: 92﴾.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What we are allowed in our Law is to spend in Allah&#8217;s obedience from what we like and covet ﴿but not to prohibit what Allah has allowed﴾. Allah said in other Ayat;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And gives his wealth, in spite of love for it,) ﴿2:177﴾, and;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And they give food, in spite of their love for it,) ﴿76:8﴾.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second reason is that after Allah refuted the false Christian beliefs and allegations about `Isa and his mother. Allah started refuting the Jews here, may Allah curse them, by stating that the abrogation of the Law, that they denied occurs, already occurred in their Law. For instance, Allah has stated in their Book, the Tawrah, that when Nuh departed from the ark, Allah allowed him to eat the meat of all types of animals. Afterwards, Isra&#8217;il forbade the meat and milk of camels for himself, and his children imitated this practice after him. The Tawrah later on prohibited this type of food, and added several more types of prohibitions. Allah allowed Adam to marry his daughters to his sons, and this practice was later forbidden. The Law of Ibrahim allowed the man to take female servants as companions along with his wife, as Ibrahim did when he took Hajar, while he was married to Sarah. Later on, the Tawrah prohibited this practice. It was previously allowed to take two sisters as wives at the same time, as Ya`qub married two sisters at the same time. Later on, this practice was prohibited in the Tawrah. All these examples are in the Tawrah and constitute a Naskh (abrogation) of the Law. Therefore, let the Jews consider what Allah legislated for `Isa and if such legislation falls under the category of abrogation or not. Why do they not then follow `Isa in this regard Rather, the Jews defied and rebelled against `Isa and against the correct religion that Allah sent Muhammad with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(All food was lawful to the Children of Israel, except what Isra&#8217;il made unlawful for himself before the Tawrah was revealed) ﴿3:93﴾ meaning, before the Tawrah was revealed, all types of foods were allowed, except what Isra&#8217;il prohibited for himself. Allah then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say: &#8220;Bring here the Tawrah and recite it, if you are truthful.&#8221;),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">for the Tawrah affirms what we are stating here. Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then after that, whosoever shall invent a lie against Allah, then these it is that are the wrongdoers.) ﴿3:94﴾, in reference to those who lie about Allah and claim that He made the Sabbath and the Tawrah eternal. They are those who claim that Allah did not send another Prophet calling to Allah with the proofs and evidences, although evidence indicates that abrogation, as we have described, occurred before in the Tawrah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(then these it is that are the wrongdoers.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say, &#8220;Allah has spoken the truth;&#8221;) ﴿3:95﴾ meaning, O Muhammad, say that Allah has said the truth in what He conveyed and legislated in the Qur&#8217;an,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(follow the religion of Ibrahim the Hanif, and he was not of the idolators.&#8221;) ﴿3:95﴾.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, follow the religion of Ibrahim that Allah legislated in the Qur&#8217;an. Indeed, this is the truth, there is no doubt in it, and the perfect way, and no Prophet has brought a more complete, clear, plain and perfect way than he did. Allah said in other Ayat,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say: &#8220;Truly, my Lord has guided me to a straight path, a right religion, the religion of Ibrahim, the Hanif, and he was not of the idolators.&#8221;) ﴿6:161﴾</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then, We have sent the revelation to you (saying): &#8220;Follow the religion of Ibrahim, the Hanif, and he was not of the idolaters.) ﴿16:123﴾.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews are the Enemies of Jibril</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Al Baqara 2.97). Say (O Muhammad ): &#8220;Whoever is an enemy to Jibril (Gabriel) (let him die in his fury), for indeed he has brought it (this Qur&#8217;an) down to your heart by Allah&#8217;s permission, confirming what came before it (i.e. the Tawrah and the Injil) and guidance and glad tidings for the believers).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(98. &#8220;Whoever is an enemy to Allah, His Angels, His Messengers, Jibril and Mika&#8217;il, then verily, Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews are the Enemies of Jibril</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Abu Ja`far bin Jarir At-Tabari said, &#8220;The scholars of Tafsir agree that this Ayah (2: 97-98) was revealed in response to the Jews who claimed that Jibril (Gabriel) is an enemy of the Jews and that Mika&#8217;il (Michael) is their friend.&#8221; Al-Bukhari said, &#8220;Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Whoever is an enemy of Jibril (let him die in his fury)). `Ikrimah said, &#8220;Jibr, Mik and Israf all mean, worshipper, while il means, Allah&#8221;. Anas bin Malik said, &#8220;When `Abdullah bin Salam heard of the arrival of the Prophet in Al-Madinah, he was working on his land. He came to the Prophet and said, `I am going to ask you about three things which nobody knows except a Prophet. What will be the first portent of the Hour What will be the first meal taken by the people of Paradise Why does a child resemble its father, and why does it resemble its maternal uncle&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Messenger said, (Jibril has just told me the answers.) `Abdullah said, `He (i.e. Jibril), among all the angels, is the enemy of the Jews.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Messenger recited the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Whoever is an enemy to Jibril (Gabriel) (let him die in his fury), for indeed he has brought it (this Qur&#8217;an) down to your heart). Allah&#8217;s Messenger then said, (The first portent of the Hour will be a fire that will bring together the people from the east to the west; the first meal of the people of Paradise will be the caudate lobe of the liver of fish. As for the child resembling his parents: If a man has sexual intercourse with his wife and his discharge is first, the child will resemble the father. If the woman has a discharge first, the child will resemble her side of the family.) On that `Abdullah bin Salam said, `I testify that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and you are the Messenger of Allah.&#8217; `Abdullah bin Salam further said, `O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! The Jews are liars, and if they should come to know about my conversion to Islam before you ask them (about me), they will tell a lie about me.&#8217; The Jews came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger , and `Abdullah went inside the house. Allah&#8217;s Messenger asked (the Jews), (`What kind of man is `Abdullah bin Salam&#8217;) They replied, `He is the best among us, the son of the best among us, our master and the son of our master.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Messenger said, (What do you think if he would embrace Islam) The Jews said, `May Allah save him from it.&#8217; Then `Abdullah bin Salam came out in front of them saying, `I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.&#8217; Thereupon they said, `He is the evilest among us, and the son of the evilest among us.&#8217; And they continued talking badly about him. Ibn Salam said, `This is what I feared, O Messenger of Allah!.&#8221;&#8217; Only Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith with this chain of narration. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this Hadith from Anas using another chain of narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people say that `il&#8217; means worshipper while whatever word that is added to it becomes Allah&#8217;s Name, because `il&#8217; is a constant in such conjunction. This is similar to the names `Abdullah, `Abdur-Rahman, `Abdul-Malik, `Abdul-Quddus, `Abdus-Salam, `Abdul-Kafi, `Abdul-Jalil, and so forth. Hence, `Abd&#8217; is constant in these compound names, while the remainder differs from name to name. This is the same case with Jibril, Mika&#8217;il, `Azra&#8217;il, Israfil, and so forth. Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Choosing Some Angels to believe in over Others is Disbelief like choosing Some Prophets over Others</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Whoever is an enemy to Jibril (Gabriel) (let him die in his fury), for indeed he has brought it (this Qur&#8217;an) down to your heart by Allah&#8217;s permission,) meaning, whoever becomes an enemy of Jibril, let him know that he is Ruh Al-Qudus who brought down the Glorious Dhikr (Qur&#8217;an) to your heart from Allah by His leave. Hence, he is a messenger from Allah. Whoever takes a messenger as an enemy, will have taken all the messengers as enemies. Further, whoever believes in one messenger, is required to believe in all of the messengers. Whoever rejects one messenger, he has rejected all of the messengers. Similarly, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, those who disbelieve in Allah and His Messengers and wish to make distinction between Allah and His Messengers (by believing in Allah and disbelieving in His Messengers) saying, &#8220;We believe in some but reject others.&#8221;) (4:150)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah decreed that they are disbelievers, because they believe in some Prophets and reject others. This is the same with those who take Jibril as an enemy, because Jibril did not choose missions on his own, but by the command of his Lord,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And we (angels) descend not except by the command of your Lord) (19: 64), and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And truly, this (the Qur&#8217;an) is a revelation from the Lord of all that exists. Which the trustworthy Ruh (Jibril) has brought down. Upon your heart (O Muhammad ) that you may be (one) of the warners) (26:192-194).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari reported that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah said, `Whoever takes a friend of Mine as an enemy, will have started a war with Me.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Allah became angry with those who took Jibril as an enemy. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Whoever is an enemy to Jibril (Gabriel) (let him die in his fury), for indeed he has brought it (this Qur&#8217;an) down to your heart by Allah&#8217;s permission, confirming what came before it) meaning, the previous Books,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and guidance and glad tidings for the believers) meaning, as guidance to their hearts and bringer of the good news of Paradise, which is exclusively for the believers. Similarly, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say: &#8220;It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing.&#8221;) (41:44), and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And We send down of the Qur&#8217;an that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe) (17:82).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Whoever is an enemy to Allah, His Angels, His Messengers, Jibril and Mika&#8217;il (Michael), then verily, Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah stated that whoever takes Him, His angels and messengers as enemies, then&#8230;Allah&#8217;s messengers include angels and men, for Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah chooses Messengers from angels and from men) (22:75). Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Jibril (Gabriel) and Mika&#8217;il (Michael)). Allah mentioned Jibril and Mika&#8217;il specifically &#8211; although they are included among the angels who were messengers &#8211; only because this Ayah was meant to support Jibril the emissary between Allah and His Prophets. Allah also mentioned Mika&#8217;il here, because the Jews claimed that Jibril was their enemy and Mika&#8217;il was their friend. Allah informed them that whoever is an enemy of either of them, then he is also an enemy of the other as well as Allah. We should state here that Mika&#8217;il sometimes descended to some of Allah&#8217;s Prophets, although to a lesser extent than Jibril, because this was primarily Jibril&#8217;s task, and Israfil is entrusted with the job of blowing the Trumpet for the commencement of Resurrection on the Day of Judgment. It is recorded in the Sahih that whenever the Messenger of Allah would wake up at night, he would supplicate,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Allah, Lord of Jibril, Mika&#8217;il and Israfil, Creator of the heavens and earth and Knower of the seen and the unseen! You judge between Your servants regarding what they differ in, so direct me to the truth which they differ on, by Your leave. Verily, You guide whom You will to the straight path.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(then verily, Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers) informed the disbelievers that whoever takes a friend of Allah as an enemy, then he has taken Allah as an enemy, and whoever treats Allah as an enemy, then he shall be Allah&#8217;s enemy. Indeed, whoever is an enemy of Allah then he will lose in this life and the Hereafter, as stated earlier;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Whoever takes a friend of Mine as an enemy, I shall wage war on him.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Tafseer Ibn Katheer : Al-Ma&#8217;idah surah 5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(They change the words from their places:) by altering their meanings and knowingly distorting them after they comprehended them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(they say, &#8220;If you are given this, take it, but if you are not given this, then beware!&#8221;) It was reported that this part of the Ayah was revealed about some Jews who committed murder and who said to each other, &#8220;Let us ask Muhammad to judge between us, and if he decides that we pay the Diyah, accept his judgement. If he decides on capital punishment, do not accept his judgement.&#8221; The correct opinion is that this Ayah was revealed about the two Jews who committed adultery. The Jews changed the law they had in their Book from Allah on the matter of punishment for adultery, from stoning to death, to a hundred flogs and making the offenders ride a donkey facing the back of the donkey. When this incident of adultery occurred after the Hijrah, they said to each other, &#8220;Let us go to Muhammad and seek his judgement. If he gives a ruling of flogging, then implement his decision and make it a proof for you with Allah. This way, one of Allah&#8217;s Prophets will have upheld this ruling amongst you. But if he decides that the punishment should be stoning to death, then do not accept his decision.&#8221; There are several Hadiths mentioning this story. Malik reported that Nafi` said that `Abdullah bin `Umar said, &#8220;The Jews came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger and mentioned that a man and a woman from them committed adultery. Allah&#8217;s Messenger said to them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(What do find of the ruling about stoning in the Tawrah) They said, `We only find that they should be exposed and flogged.&#8217; `Abdullah bin Salam said, `You lie. The Tawrah mentions stoning, so bring the Tawrah.&#8217; They brought the Tawrah and opened it but one of them hid the verse about stoning with his hand and recited what is before and after that verse. `Abdullah bin Salam said to him, `Remove your hand,&#8217; and he removed it, thus uncovering the verse about stoning. So they said, He (`Abdullah bin Salam) has said the truth, O Muhammad! It is the verse about stoning.&#8217; The Messenger of Allah decided that the adulterers be stoned to death and his command was carried out. I saw that man shading the woman from the stones with his body.&#8221; Al-Bukhari and Muslim also collected this Hadith and this is the wording collected by Al-Bukhari. In another narration by Al-Bukhari, the Prophet said to the Jews,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(What would you do in this case) They said, &#8220;We would humiliate and expose them.&#8221; The Prophet recited,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Bring here the Tawrah and recite it, if you are truthful.) So they brought a man who was blind in one eye and who was respected among them and said to him, &#8220;Read (from the Tawrah).&#8221; So he read until he reached a certain verse and then covered it with his hand. He was told, &#8220;Remove your hand,&#8221; and it was the verse about stoning. So that man said, &#8220;O Muhammad! This is the verse about stoning, and we had hid its knowledge among us.&#8221; So the Messenger ordered that the two adulterers be stoned, and they were stoned. Muslim recorded that a Jewish man and a Jewish woman were brought before Allah&#8217;s Messenger because they committed adultery. The Messenger of Allah went to the Jews and asked them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(What is the ruling that you find in the Tawrah for adultery) hThey said, &#8220;We expose them, carry them (on donkeys) backwards and parade them in public.&#8221; The Prophet recited;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Bring here the Tawrah and recite it, if you are truthful.) So they brought the Tawrah and read from it until the reader reached the verse about stoning. Then he placed his hand on that verse and read what was before and after it. `Abdullah bin Salam, who was with the Messenger of Allah , said, &#8220;Order him to remove his hand,&#8221; and he removed his hand and under it was the verse about stoning. So the Messenger of Allah commanded that the adulterers be stoned, and they were stoned. `Abdullah bin `Umar said, &#8220;I was among those who stoned them and I saw the man shading the woman from the stones with his body.&#8221; Abu Dawud recorded that Ibn `Umar said, &#8220;Some Jews came to the Messenger of Allah and invited him to go to the Quff area. So he went to the house of Al-Midras and they said, `O Abu Al-Qasim! A man from us committed adultery with a woman, so decide on their matter.&#8217; They arranged a pillow for the Messenger of Allah and he sat on it and said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Bring the Tawrah to me.) He was brought the Tawrah and he removed the pillow from under him and placed the Tawrah on it, saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I trust you and He Who revealed it to you.) He then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Bring me your most knowledgeable person.) So he was brought a young man&#8230; &#8221; and then he mentioned the rest of the story that Malik narrated from Nafi`. These Hadiths state that the Messenger of Allah issued a decision that conforms with the ruling in the Tawrah, not to honor the Jews in what they believe in, for the Jews were commanded to follow the Law of Muhammad only. Rather, the Prophet did this because Allah commanded him to do so. He asked them about the ruling of stoning in the Tawrah to make them admit to what the Tawrah contains and what they collaborated to hide, deny and exclude from implementing for all that time. They had to admit to what they did, although they did it while having knowledge of the correct ruling. What made them go to the Prophet for judgement in this matter was their lusts and desires, hoping that the Prophet would agree with their opinion, not that they believed in the correctness of his judgment. This is why they said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(If you are given this,) referring to flogging, then take it,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(but if you are not given this, then beware!) and do not accept or implement it. Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whomsoever Allah wants to put in Fitnah, you can do nothing for him against Allah. Those are the ones whose hearts Allah does not want to purify; for them there is a disgrace in this world, and in the Hereafter a great torment. They (like to) listen to falsehood, to devour Suht) `Suht&#8217; refers to bribes, as Ibn Mas`ud and others stated. The Ayah states that if one is like this, how can Allah cleanse his heart and accept his supplication Allah said to His Prophet ,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So if they come to you&#8230;) so that you judge between them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(either judge between them, or turn away from them. If you turn away from them, they cannot hurt you in the least.) meaning, there is no harm if you do not judge between them. This is because when they came to you to judge between them, they did not seek to follow the truth, but only what conformed to their lusts. We should mention here that Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Zayd bin Aslam, `Ata&#8217; Al-Khurasani, and several others said that this part of the Ayah was abrogated by Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And so judge among them by what Allah has revealed.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And if you judge, judge with justice between them.) and with fairness, even if the Jews were unjust and outcasts from the path of fairness,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, Allah loves those who act justly.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source : Tafsir Ibn Kathir (Abridged)<br />
Ale Imraan Verses 3.65 and 3.67 © Darussalam 2000</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(65. O people of the Scripture! Why do you dispute about Ibrahim, while the Tawrah and the Injil were not revealed till after him Have you then no sense) (66. Verily, you are those who have disputed about that of which you have knowledge. Why do you then dispute concerning that of which you have no knowledge It is Allah Who knows, and you know not.) (67. Ibrahim was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a true Muslim Hanifa and he was not of the Mushrikin ) (68. Verily, among mankind who have the best claim to Ibrahim are those who followed him, and this Prophet and those who have believed. And Allah is the Wali (Protector and Helper) of the believers.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah censures the Jews and Christians for their dispute with Muslims over Ibrahim Al-Khalil and the claim each group made that he was one of them. Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar reported that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;The Christians of Najran and Jewish rabbis gathered before the Messenger of Allah and disputed in front of him. The rabbis said, `Ibrahim was certainly Jewish.&#8217; The Christians said, `Certainly, Ibrahim was Christian.&#8217; So Allah sent down,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Why do you dispute about Ibrahim,) meaning, `How is it that you, Jews, claim that Ibrahim was Jew, although he lived before Allah sent down the Tawrah to Musa How is it that you, Christians, claim that Ibrahim was Christian, although Christianity came after his time&#8221; This is why Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Have you then no sense)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, you are those who have disputed about that of which you have knowledge. Why do you then dispute concerning that of which you have no knowledge)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah criticizes those who argue and dispute without knowledge, just as the Jews and Christians did concerning Ibrahim. Had they disputed about their religions, which they had knowledge of, and about the Law that was legislated for them until Muhammad was sent, it would have been better for them. Rather, they disputed about what they had no knowledge of, so Allah criticized them for this behavior. Allah commanded them to refer what they have no knowledge of to He Who knows the seen and unseen matters and Who knows the true reality of all things. This is why Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(It is Allah Who knows, and you know not.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Ibrahim was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a true Muslim Hanifa), shunning Shirk and living in Iman,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and he was not of the Mushrikin.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah is similar to the Ayah in Surat Al-Baqarah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And they say, &#8220;Be Jews or Christians, then you will be guided&#8230;&#8221;) 2:135</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, among mankind who have the best claim to Ibrahim are those who followed him, and this Prophet and those who have believed. And Allah is the Wali (Protector and Helper) of the believers.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah means, &#8220;The people who have the most right to be followers of Ibrahim are those who followed his religion and this Prophet, Muhammad , and his Companions from the Muhajirin, Ansar and those who followed their lead.&#8221; Sa`id bin Mansur recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Every Prophet had a Wali (supporter, best friend) from among the Prophets. My Wali among them is my father Ibrahim, the Khalil (intimate friend) of my Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet then recited,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, among mankind who have the best claim to Ibrahim are those who followed him&#8230;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And Allah is the Wali (Protector and Helper) of the believers.) means, Allah is the Protector of all those who believe in His Messengers.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then refutes the Christians&#8217; and Jews&#8217; false claims and lies,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And the Jews and the Christians say, &#8220;We are the children of Allah and His loved ones.&#8221;) They claim: &#8220;We are the followers of Allah&#8217;s Prophets, who are His children, whom He takes care of. He also loves us.&#8221; The People of the Book claim in their Book that Allah said to His servant Isra&#8217;il, &#8220;You are my firstborn.&#8221; But they explained this statement in an improper manner and altered its meaning. Some of the People of the Book who later became Muslims refuted this false statement saying, &#8220;This statement only indicates honor and respect, as is common in their speech at that time.&#8221; The Christians claim that `Isa said to them, &#8220;I will go back to my father and your father,&#8221; meaning, my Lord and your Lord. It is a fact that the Christians did not claim that they too are Allah&#8217;s sons as they claimed about `Isa. Rather this statement by `Isa only meant to indicate a closeness with Allah. This is why when they said that they are Allah&#8217;s children and loved ones, Allah refuted their claim,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say, &#8220;Why then does He punish you for your sins&#8221;) meaning, if you were truly as you claim, Allah&#8217;s children and loved ones, then why did He prepare the Fire because of your disbelief, lies and false claims</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay, you are but human beings, of those He has created,) Allah states: you are just like the rest of the children of Adam, and Allah is the Lord of all His creation,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills.) Allah does what He wills, there is none who can escape His judgement, and He is swift in reckoning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them;) Therefore, everything is Allah&#8217;s property and under His power and control,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and to Him is the return.) In the end, the return will be to Allah and He will judge between His servants as He will, and He is the Most Just Who is never wrong in His judgment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Tafsir Ibn Kathir (Abridged) &#8211; Al-Nisa surah 4 © Darussalam 2000</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And because of their (Jews) disbelief and uttering against Maryam a grave false charge.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas stated that the Jews accused Maryam of fornication.This is also the saying of As-Suddi, Juwaybir, Muhammad bin Ishaq and several others. This meaning is also apparent in the Ayah, as the Jews accused Maryam and her son of grave accusations: They accused her of fornication and claimed that `Isa was an illegitimate son. Some of them even claimed that she was menstruating while fornicating. May Allah&#8217;s continued curse be upon them until the Day of Resurrection. The Jews also said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;We killed Al-Masih, `Isa, son of Maryam, the Messenger of Allah,&#8221;) meaning, we killed the person who claimed to be the Messenger of Allah. The Jews only uttered these words in jest and mockery, just as the polytheists said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O you to whom the Dhikr (the Qur&#8217;an) has been sent down! Verily, you are a mad man!) When Allah sent `Isa with proofs and guidance, the Jews, may Allah&#8217;s curses, anger, torment and punishment be upon them, envied him because of his prophethood and obvious miracles; curing the blind and leprous and bringing the dead back to life, by Allah&#8217;s leave. He also used to make the shape of a bird from clay and blow in it, and it became a bird by Allah&#8217;s leave and flew. `Isa performed other miracles that Allah honored him with, yet the Jews defied and bellied him and tried their best to harm him. Allah&#8217;s Prophet `Isa could not live in any one city for long and he had to travel often with his mother, peace be upon them. Even so, the Jews were not satisfied, and they went to the king of Damascus at that time, a Greek polytheist who worshipped the stars. They told him that there was a man in Bayt Al-Maqdis misguiding and dividing the people in Jerusalem and stirring unrest among the king&#8217;s subjects. The king became angry and wrote to his deputy in Jerusalem to arrest the rebel leader, stop him from causing unrest, crucify him and make him wear a crown of thorns. When the king&#8217;s deputy in Jerusalem received these orders, he went with some Jews to the house that `Isa was residing in, and he was then with twelve, thirteen or seventeen of his companions. That day was a Friday, in the evening. They surrounded `Isa in the house, and when he felt that they would soon enter the house or that he would sooner or later have to leave it, he said to his companions, &#8220;Who volunteers to be made to look like me, for which he will be my companion in Paradise&#8221; A young man volunteered, but `Isa thought that he was too young. He asked the question a second and third time, each time the young man volunteering, prompting `Isa to say, &#8220;Well then, you will be that man.&#8221; Allah made the young man look exactly like `Isa, while a hole opened in the roof of the house, and `Isa was made to sleep and ascended to heaven while asleep. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And (remember) when Allah said: &#8220;O `Isa! I will take you and raise you to Myself.&#8221;) When `Isa ascended, those who were in the house came out. When those surrounding the house saw the man who looked like `Isa, they thought that he was `Isa. So they took him at night, crucified him and placed a crown of thorns on his head. The Jews then boasted that they killed `Isa and some Christians accepted their false claim, due to their ignorance and lack of reason. As for those who were in the house with `Isa, they witnessed his ascension to heaven, while the rest thought that the Jews killed `Isa by crucifixion. They even said that Maryam sat under the corpse of the crucified man and cried, and they say that the dead man spoke to her. All this was a test from Allah for His servants out of His wisdom. Allah explained this matter in the Glorious Qur&#8217;an which He sent to His honorable Messenger, whom He supported with miracles and clear, unequivocal evidence. Allah is the Most Truthful, and He is the Lord of the worlds Who knows the secrets, what the hearts conceal, the hidden matters in heaven and earth, what has occurred, what will occur, and what would occur if it was decreed. He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but it appeared as that to them,) referring to the person whom the Jews thought was `Isa. This is why Allah said afterwards,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and those who differ therein are full of doubts. They have no (certain) knowledge, they follow nothing but conjecture.) referring to the Jews who claimed to kill `Isa and the ignorant Christians who believed them. Indeed they are all in confusion, misguidance and bewilderment. This is why Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(For surely; they killed him not.) meaning they are not sure that `Isa was the one whom they killed. Rather, they are in doubt and confusion over this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(But Allah raised him up unto Himself. And Allah is Ever All-Powerful,) meaning, He is the Almighty, and He is never weak, nor will those who seek refuge in Him ever be subjected to disgrace,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(All-Wise.) in all that He decides and ordains for His creatures. Indeed, Allah&#8217;s is the clearest wisdom, unequivocal proof and the most glorious authority. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;Just before Allah raised `Isa to the heavens, `Isa went to his companions, who were twelve inside the house. When he arrived, his hair was dripping water and he said, `There are those among you who will disbelieve in me twelve times after he had believed in me.&#8217; He then asked, `Who volunteers that his image appear as mine, and be killed in my place. He will be with me (in Paradise)&#8217; One of the youngest ones among them volunteered and `Isa asked him to sit down. `Isa again asked for a volunteer, and the young man kept volunteering and `Isa asking him to sit down. Then the young man volunteered again and `Isa said, `You will be that man,&#8217; and the resemblance of `Isa was cast over that man while `Isa ascended to heaven from a hole in the house.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Jews came looking for `Isa, they found that young man and crucified him. Some of `Isa&#8217;s followers disbelieved in him twelve times after they had believed in him. They then divided into three groups. One group, Al-Ya`qubiyyah (Jacobites), said, `Allah remained with us as long as He willed and then ascended to heaven.&#8217; Another group, An-Nasturiyyah (Nestorians), said, `The son of Allah was with us as long as he willed and Allah took him to heaven.&#8217; Another group, Muslims, said, `The servant and Messenger of Allah remained with us as long as Allah willed, and Allah then took him to Him.&#8217; The two disbelieving groups cooperated against the Muslim group and they killed them. Ever since that happened, Islam was then veiled until Allah sent Muhammad .&#8221; This statement has an authentic chain of narration leading to Ibn `Abbas, and An-Nasa&#8217;i narrated it through Abu Kurayb who reported it from Abu Mu`awiyah. Many among the Salaf stated that `Isa asked if someone would volunteer for his appearance to be cast over him, and that he will be killed instead of `Isa, for which he would be his companion in Paradise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Source: Tafseer Ibn Katheer</span>. From Surah A Hashr</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The End that Bani An-Nadir suffered</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He it is Who drove out the disbelievers among the People of the Scripture) referring to the Jewish tribe of Bani An-Nadir, according to Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Az-Zuhri and several others. When the Messenger of Allah migrated to Al-Madinah, he made a peace treaty with the Jews stipulating that he would not fight them and they would not fight him. They soon betrayed the treaty that they made with Allah&#8217;s Messenger . Therefore, Allah sent His torment down on them; it can never be averted, and His appointed destiny touched them; it can never be resisted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet forced them to evacuate and abandon their fortified forts that Muslims did not think they would ever control. The Jews thought that their fortifications will save them from Allah&#8217;s torment, but they did not help them against Allah in the least. Then, that which they did not expect came to them from Allah, and Allah&#8217;s Messenger forced them to leave Al-Madinah. Some of them went to Adhri`at in the area of Ash-Sham, which is the area of the grand Gathering and Resurrection, while others went to Khaybar. The Prophet allowed them to evacuate their forts and take whatever their camels could carry. They destroyed the property that they could not carry. This is why Allah the Exalted said, (they demolished their own dwellings with their own hands and the hands of the believers Then take admonition, O you with eyes.) meaning, &#8220;Contemplate the end of those who defied Allah&#8217;s command, contradicted His Messenger and denied His Book. See how Allah&#8217;s humiliating torment struck them in this life, as well as, the painful torment that Allah has reserved for them in the Hereafter.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dawud recorded that `Abdur-Rahman bin Ka`b bin Malik said that one of the Prophet&#8217;s Companions said, &#8220;The Quraysh idolators wrote to `Abdullah bin Ubayy and those who were still worshipping idols among the tribes of Al-Aws and Al-Khazraj. The Messenger of Allah was in Al-Madinah at the time, before the battle of Badr occurred. They wrote: `You have given refuge to our citizen. We swear by Allah, you should fight him, or we will expel you or gather all our forces, until we kill your soldiers and take your women captive.&#8217; When the news of this threat reached `Abdullah bin Ubayy and the idolators of Al-Aws and Al-Khazraj, they prepared to fight the Prophet . The news of this reached the Prophet and he went to them saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The threat of the Quraysh has caused you extreme anxiety! The Quraysh cannot cause you more harm than what you will cause yourselves by your actions. Do you want to fight your children and brethren) When they heard these words from the Prophet , they dis- persed and the news of what happened reached the Quraysh idolators. After the battle of Badr, the Quraysh idolators wrote to the Jews of Al-Madinah, `You have armor and forts! You should fight our citizen or we will do such and such to you, and nothing will prevent us from acquiring your women.&#8217;The news of this letter also reached the Prophet and Bani An-Nadir intended to betray their treaty. Bani An-Nadir sent a message to the Prophet asking him to come with thirty of his Companions to meet thirty of their rabbis half way, from either side. They said that the rabbis would listen to the Prophet and if they believe in him, the rest of Bani An-Nadir would believe. They intended to kill the Messenger , and Allah informed His Messenger of this plot before they could harm him. The next day, the Prophet gathered his forces and laid siege to their area, saying to them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(By Allah ! You will not be safe until and unless you renew your peace treaty with me.) They refused to do so, and the Prophet fought them the rest of that day. The next morning, the Prophet laid siege to the tribe of Bani Qurayzah and left Bani An-Nadir alone that day. The Prophet ordered Bani Qurayzah to sign a new treaty of peace, and they accepted. The Prophet left Bani Qurayzah and went back to Bani An-Nadir with his forces and fought them until they agreed to surrender in return for safe passage out of Al-Madinah. Bani An-Nadir evacuated Al-Madinah and took with them all whatever their camels could carry from their furniture, including even the wood and the doors to their houses. The date trees of Bani An-Nadir were granted to the Messenger by Allah when He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And what Allah gave as booty to His Messenger from them &#8212; for this you made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry) that is, what you earned without a fight. The Prophet divided most of their trees between the emigrants and gave to only two men who were poor from Al-Ansar. He did not give the Ansar any of it, except for these two men. The Prophet kept a part of the war booty for himself and that part of charity of the Prophet was transferred to the administration of his daughter&#8217;s children, i.e., children of Fatimah.&#8221; However, let us summarize the battle of Bani An-Nadir here. From Allah alone we seek help.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Reason behind the Battle of Bani An-Nadir</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the seventy Companions whom the Prophet sent to teach the Qur&#8217;an were killed at the area of Bi&#8217;r Ma`unah, excluding `Amr bin Umayyah Ad-Damri, who killed two men from the tribe of Bani `Amir on his way back to Al-Madinah. He did not know that these two men had a promise of safe passage from Allah&#8217;s Messenger . When he went back to Al-Madinah, he told the Prophet what happened and the Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(You have killed two men, I shall pay the blood money for them.) Bani An-Nadir and Bani `Amir were allies and had treaties. The Prophet asked Bani An-Nadir to help pay the blood money for the two dead men. The area of Bani An-Nadir was in a suburb of Al-Madinah, a few miles to the east. In his book of Sirah, Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar said; &#8220;Then the Messenger of Allah went to Bani An-Nadir to ask them for financial help to pay the blood money of the two men from Bani `Amir, who were killed by `Amr bin Umayyah Ad-Damri. They had a promise of safe passage from the Prophet according to the (subnarrator) Yazid bin Ruman. Bani An-Nadir and Bani `Amir had a treaty and were allies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Messenger went to Bani An-Nadir asking them for help to pay the blood money for the two men, they said, `Yes, O Abu Al-Qasim! We will help you, since you asked us for help.&#8217; Yet, when they met each other in secret, they said, `You will not find a better chance with this man than this,&#8217; while the Messenger of Allah was sitting next to a wall of one of their houses. They said, `Who will ascend this wall and drop a stone on this man and rid us of his trouble&#8217; `Amr bin Jihash bin Ka`b volunteered and ascended the wall of the house to drop a stone on the Messenger .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah was sitting with several of his Companions, such as Abu Bakr, `Umar and `Ali. The news of this plot was conveyed to the Prophet from heaven, and he stood up and went back to Al-Madinah. When the Companions thought that the Messenger was absent for a long time, they went to see where he was and saw a man coming from Al-Madinah. They asked him, and he said that he saw the Prophet enter Al-Madinah. The Messenger&#8217;s Companions went to him, and he told them the news of the betraying plot that the Jews planned against him. He ordered them to prepare for war and to march forth to Bani An-Nadir.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet gathered his forces and marched to the area of Bani An-Nadir, who had taken refuge in their fortified forts. The Messenger ordered their date trees be cut down and burned. The Jews heralded at the Prophet, `O Muhammad! You used to forbid mischief in the earth and blame those who did it. Why is it that you had the date trees cut down and burned&#8217; Meanwhile, `Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul, Wadi`ah, Malik bin Abi Qawqal, Suwayd, Da`is and several other men who all belonged to the tribe of Al-Khazraj bin Bani `Awf, sent a message to Bani An-Nadir saying, `Be firm and strong. We will never abandon you. If you are fought against, we will fight along with you and if you are forced to leave Al-Madinah, we will accompany you.&#8217; The Jews waited for this claim of support, but the hypocrites did not deliver. Allah cast terror in the hearts of the Jews. They asked the Messenger to allow them safe passage out of Al-Madinah and to spare their lives. In return, they would only take what their camels could carry, except for weapons. The Prophet agreed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews collected all the wealth their camels could transport. One of the Jews would demolish his own house around its door, so that he could carry the door on the back of his camel. Bani An-Nadir moved to Khaybar, and some of them went to Ash-Sham. They left all that remained behind for the Messenger of Allah , who had control over how it was to be divided.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet divided it between the emigrants and none of Al-Ansar got a share, except for Sahl bin Hunayf and Abu Dujanah Simak bin Kharashah. They said that they were poor and the Messenger of Allah gave them their share. Only two men from Bani An-Nadir embraced Islam, Yamin bin Umayr bin Ka`b bin `Amr bin Jihash and Abu Sa`d bin Wahb and they saved their wealth due to their acceptance of Islam.&#8221; Ibn Ishaq continued, &#8220;Some of the offspring of Yamin narrated to me that the Messenger of Allah said to Yamin,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Have you not heard what your cousin plotted to do against me) Yamin bin `Umayr promised someone a reward if he killed his cousin `Amr bin Jihash, and someone killed him, according to their claim&#8221; Ibn Ishaq then said, &#8220;All of Surat Al-Hashr was revealed about Bani An-Nadir. &#8221; A similar story was recorded by Yunus bin Bukayr from Ibn Ishaq. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He it is Who drove out the disbelievers among the People of the Scripture) refers to Bani An-Nadir,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(from their homes at the first gathering.) Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(You did not think that they would get out.) i.e., within the few days you laid siege against them. The Companions had surrounded their forts for only six days, and their forts were fortified and formidable. This is why Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And they thought that their fortresses would defend them from Allah! But Allah reached them from a place where they expected it not.) meaning, there came to them from Allah what they did not expect or anticipate. Allah said in another Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Those before them indeed plotted, but Allah struck at the foundation of their building, and then the roof fell down upon them, from above them, and the torment overtook them from directions they did not perceive.)(16:26) Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and He cast terror into their hearts) means, Allah cast fear, terror and fright in their hearts, and why would that not happen to them He who was given victory, by Allah frightening his enemies the distance of a month, laid siege to them. May Allah&#8217;s peace and blessings be on the Prophet. As in Ibn Ishaq&#8217;s explanation &#8212; which preceded;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(that they demolished their own dwellings with their own hands and the hands of the believers.) the Jews brought down what they wanted to transport from their roofs and doors, so that they could carry them on camels. Similar was said by `Urwah bin Az-Zubayr, `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam and several others. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And had it not been that Allah had decreed exile for them, He would certainly have punished them in this world;) meaning, if it was not for the fact that Allah had already decreed that they would evacuate Al-Madinah, leaving behind their homes and wealth, He would have sent another type of punishment upon them, such as being killed and captured. This was said by Az-Zuhri. `Urwah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd said that Allah decreed that the Jews would be punished in the life of this world and face the torment of the fire of Hell He prepared for them in the Hereafter. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and in the Hereafter theirs shall be the torment of the Fire.) meaning, it is a matter ordained that they will surely face,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(That is because they opposed Allah and His Messenger.) means, Allah prepared this specific punishment and sent His Messenger and his Companions against them, because they defied Allah and His Messenger and denied the good news that Allah sent forth in the Books of previous Messengers regarding the coming of Muhammad . The Jews knew these facts about Muhammad just as they knew their own children. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whosoever opposes Allah, then verily, Allah is Severe in punishment.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet Cut down the Date Trees of the Jews by the Leave of Allah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(What you cut down of the Linah, or you left them standing on their stems, it was by leave of Allah, and in order that He might disgrace the rebellious.) Linah is an especially good type of date tree. Abu `Ubaydah said that Linah is a different kind of dates than `Ajwah and Barni. Several others said that Linah refers to every type of date fruits, except for the `Ajwah (ripen dates), while Ibn Jarir said that it refers to all kinds of date trees. Ibn Jarir quoted Mujahid saying that it also includes the Buwayrah type. When the Messenger of Allah laid siege to Bani An-Nadir, to humiliate them and bring fear and terror to their hearts, he ordered their date trees to be cut down. Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated that Yazid bin Ruman, Qatadah and Muqatil bin Hayyan said, &#8220;Bani An-Nadir sent a message to the Messenger , saying that he used to outlaw mischief in the earth, so why did he order that their trees be cut down Allah sent down this honorable Ayah stating that whatever Linah was felled or left intact by the Muslims, has been done by His permission, will, leave and pleasure to humiliate and disgrace the enemy and degrade them.&#8221; Mujahid said, &#8220;Some of the emigrants discouraged others from chopping down the date trees of Jews, saying that they were war spoils for Muslims. The Qur&#8217;an approved of the actions of those who discouraged and those who approved of cutting these trees, stating that those who cut them or did not, did so only by Allah&#8217;s leave.&#8221; There is also a Hadith narrated from the Prophet with this meaning. An-Nasa&#8217;i recorded that Ibn `Abbas said about Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(What you cut down of the Linah, or you left them standing on their stems, it was by leave of Allah, and in order that He might disgrace the rebellious.) &#8220;They forced them to come down from their forts and were ordered to cut their trees cut down. So the Muslims hesitated, and some of them said, `We cut down some and left some. We must ask Allah&#8217;s Messenger if we will earn a reward for what we cut and if we will be burdened for what we left intact.&#8217; Allah sent down this Ayah, t</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(What you cut down of the Linah, or you left them standing on their stems, it was by leave of Allah).&#8221; Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah ordered that the date trees of Bani An-Nadir be cut down and burned. The Two Sahihs collected a similar narration. Al-Bukhari recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said,&#8221;Bani An-Nadir and Bani Qurayzah fought (against the Prophet ), and the Prophet exiled Bani An-Nadir and allowed Bani Qurayzah to remain in their area until later, when the Prophet fought against Qurayzah. Their men were executed and their women, children and wealth were confiscated and divided among Muslims. Some of them, however, were saved because they returned to the Prophet&#8217;s side, who granted them asylum, and they embraced Islam. All of the Jews of Al-Madinah, Bani Qaynuqa`, the tribe of `Abdullah bin Salam, Bani Harithah and the rest of the Jewish tribes in Al-Madinah were exiled.&#8221; The Two Sahihs also recorded from Ibn `Umar that the Messenger of Allah burned down the date trees of Bani An-Nadir and had them cut down the date palms of Al-Buwayrah. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored revealed this Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(What you cut down of the Linah, or you left them standing on their stems, it was by leave of Allah, and in order that He might disgrace the rebellious.)&#8221; Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that the battle of Bani An-Nadir occurred after the battles of Uhud and Bi&#8217;r Ma`unah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Source: Tafseer Ibn Katheer . </span><span style="line-height:1.5em;">From 58 Surah Al Mujadlah</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Najih reported from Mujahid,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Have you not seen those who were forbidden to hold secret counsels, and afterwards returned to that which they had been forbidden,) He said, &#8220;The Jews.&#8221; Similar was said by Muqatil bin Hayyan, who added, &#8220;The Prophet had a peace treaty with the Jews. When one of the Prophet&#8217;s Companions would pass by a gathering of Jews, they would speak among themselves in secret, prompting the believer to think that they were plotting to kill or harm him. When the believer saw this, he feared for his safety and changed the route he was taking. The Prophet advised them to abandon their evil secret talks, but they did not listen and kept on holding the Najwa. Allah the Exalted sent down this Ayah in their case,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Have you not seen those who were forbidden to hold secret counsels, and afterwards returned to that which they had been forbidden).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and conspired together for sin and wrongdoing and disobedience to the Messenger.) means, they used to talk to each other,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(for sin) which involves themselves,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and wrongdoing) which effects others. They speak about disobedience and defying of the Messenger , with persistence and recommending each other to follow their way,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And when they come to you, they greet you with a greeting wherewith Allah greets you not,) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `A&#8217;ishah said, &#8220;Some Jews came to the Prophet and greeted him by saying, `As-Sam `Alayka, O Abul-Qasim.&#8217; So I said to them, `wa `Alaykum As-Sam (the same death be upon you).&#8217; The Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O `A&#8217;ishah, Allah does not like rudeness and foul speech.) I said, `Didn&#8217;t you hear them say, `As-Sam Alayka&#8217; He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Didn&#8217;t you hear me answering them back by saying, `Wa `Alaykum (And the same upon you)&#8217;) Allah the Exalted then sent down this Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And when they come to you, they greet you with a greeting wherewith Allah greets you not,)&#8221; The narration collected in the Sahih states that `A&#8217;ishah said, &#8220;And be upon you the death, disgrace and curse.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah said to her,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah accepts our supplication against them, but not theirs against us.) Ibn Jarir recorded that Anas bin Malik said, &#8220;A Jew passed by Allah&#8217;s Messenger , who was sitting with his Companions, he greeted them and they greeted him back. Allah&#8217;s Messenger then said to his Companions,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Do you know what he just said) They said, `He said: As-Salam, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger.&#8217; The Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Rather he said, Sam `Alaykum.) meaning, `may you disgrace your religion.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Messenger then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Bring him back,) and when he was brought back, the Prophet asked him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Did you say: Sam `Alaykum) He said, `Yes.&#8217; The Prophet then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When the people of the Book greet you, say, `Wa `Alaykum.&#8217;)&#8221; meaning, `and the same on you too.&#8217; The basis for the Hadith of Anas is in the Sahih and similar to this Hadith of `A&#8217;ishah is in the Sahih. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and say within themselves:&#8221;Why should Allah punish us not for what we say&#8221;) means, the Jews say these words, changing the meaning of the Islamic greeting, into an abusive statement, and then say, `Had he been a Prophet, Allah would have punished us for what we said. Allah knows what we conceal. Therefore, if Muhammad were a Prophet, Allah would have sent His punishment on us sooner, in this life.&#8217; Allah the Exalted replied,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Hell will be sufficient for them;) ell should be sufficient for them in the Hereafter,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(they will enter therein. And worst indeed is that destination!) Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said that the Jews used to say, &#8220;Sam `Alayka,&#8221; to Allah&#8217;s Messenger . They would say then within themselves, &#8220;Why does Allah not punish us for what we say&#8221; This Ayah was later revealed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And when they come to you, they greet you with a greeting wherewith Allah greets you not, and say within themselves: &#8220;Why should Allah punish us not for what we say&#8221; Hell will be sufficient for them; they will enter therein. And worst indeed is that destination!) Its chain of narration is Hasan, but they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not collect it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Manners of the Najwa, (Secret Counsel)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted teaches His believing servants to avoid the ways of the disbelievers and hypocrites,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O you who believe! When you hold secret counsel, do it not for sin and wrongdoing, and disobedience to the Messenger,) meaning, do not hold evil secret counsels like the ignorant disbelieving People of the Scriptures and their allies among the hypocrites, who imitate their ways,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(but do it for Al-Birr and Taqwa; and have Taqwa of Allah unto Whom you shall be gathered.) and He will then inform you of all your deeds and statements; He has counted and recorded them and will justly hold you accountable for them. Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(An-Najwa are only from the Shaytan, in order that he may cause grief to the believers. But he cannot harm them in the least, except as Allah permits. And in Allah let the believers put their trust.) Allah states that secret talks, where the believers feel anxious, are</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(only from Shaytan, in order that he may cause grief to the believers.) meaning, that those who hold such counsels do so because of the lures of the devil,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(in order that he may cause grief to the believers.) The devil seeks to bother the believers, even though his plots will not harm the believers, except if Allah wills it. Those who are the subject of evil Najwa, should seek refuge in Allah and put his trust in Him, for none of it will harm them, Allah willing. The Sunnah also forbids the Najwa so that no Muslim is bothered by it. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(If you were three, then two of you should not hold a secret counsel in the presence of the third person, because that would cause him to be worried.) This Hadith is collected in the Two Sahihs using a chain of narration that contained Al-A`mash. `Abdur-Razzaq narrated that `Abdullah bin `Umar said that Allah&#8217;s Messenger said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(If you were three, then two of you should not hold a secret counsel in the presence of the third person, except with his permission, because that would cause him to be worried.) Muslim collected this Hadith.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Tafseer Ibn Katheer</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Al-Bukhari reported that Al-Bara&#8217; bin `Azib narrated: &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Messenger offered his prayers facing Bayt Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) for sixteen or seventeen months, but he wished that he could pray facing the Ka`bah (at Makkah). The first prayer which he offered (facing the Ka`bah) was the `Asr (Afternoon) prayer in the company of some people. Then one of those who had offered that prayer with him, went out and passed by some people in a mosque who were in the bowing position (in Ruku`) during their prayers (facing Jerusalem). He addressed them saying, `By Allah, I bear witness that I have offered prayer with the Prophet facing Makkah (Ka`bah).&#8217; Hearing that, those people immediately changed their direction towards the House (Ka`bah) while still as they were (i.e., in the same bowing position). Some Muslims who offered prayer towards the previous Qiblah (Jerusalem) before it was changed towards the House (the Ka`bah in Makkah) had died or had been martyred, and we did not know what to say about them (regarding their prayers towards Jerusalem). Allah then revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And Allah would never make your faith (prayers) to be lost (i.e., the prayers of those Muslims were valid)) (2:143).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari collected this narration, while Muslim collected it using another chain of narrators. Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that Al-Bara&#8217; narrated: Allah&#8217;s Messenger used to offer prayers towards Bayt Al-Maqdis (in Jerusalem), but would keep looking at the sky awaiting Allah&#8217;s command (to change the Qiblah). Then Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, We have seen the turning of your (Muhammad&#8217;s) face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a Qiblah (prayer direction) that shall please you, so turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah).) (2:144)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man from among the Muslims then said, &#8220;We wish we could know about those among us who died before the Qiblah was changed (i.e., towards Makkah) and also about our own prayers, that we had performed towards Bayt Al-Maqdis.&#8221; Allah then revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And Allah would never make your faith (prayers) to be lost.) (2:143)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fools among the people, meaning the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), said, &#8220;What made them change the former Qiblah that they used to face&#8221; Allah then revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The fools (idolators, hypocrites, and Jews) among the people will say&#8230;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">until the end of the Ayah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali bin Abu Talhah related that Ibn `Abbas said: When Allah&#8217;s Messenger migrated to Al-Madinah, Allah commanded him to face Bayt Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem). The Jews were delighted then. Allah&#8217;s Messenger faced Jerusalem for over ten months. However, he liked (to offer prayer in the direction of) Prophet Ibrahim&#8217;s Qiblah (the Ka`bah in Makkah) and used to supplicate to Allah and kept looking up to the sky (awaiting Allah&#8217;s command in this regard). Allah then revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(turn your faces (in prayer) in that direction.) meaning, its direction. The Jews did not like this change and said, &#8220;What made them change the Qiblah that they used to face (meaning Jerusalem)&#8221; Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say (O Muhammad ): &#8220;To Allah belong both, east and the west. He guides whom He wills to the straight way.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are several other Ahadith on this subject. In summary, Allah&#8217;s Messenger was commanded to face Bayt Al-Maqdis (during the prayer) and he used to offer prayer towards it in Makkah between the two corners (of Ka`bah), so that the Ka`bah would be between him and Bayt Al-Maqdis8. When the Prophet migrated to Al-Madinah, this practice was no longer possible; then Allah commanded him to offer prayer towards Bayt Al-Maqdis, as Ibn Abbas and the majority of the scholars have stated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari reported in his Sahih that the news (of the change of Qiblah) was conveyed to some of the Ansar while they were performing the `Asr (Afternoon) prayer towards Bayt Al-Maqdis, upon hearing that, they immediately changed their direction and faced the Ka`bah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in the Sahihayn (Al-Bukhari Muslim) that Ibn `Umar narrated: While the people were in Quba&#8217; (Mosque) performing the Fajr (Dawn) prayer, a man came and said, &#8220;A (part of the) Qur&#8217;an was revealed tonight to Allah&#8217;s Messenger and he was commanded to face the Ka`bah. Therefore, face the Ka`bah. They were facing Ash-Sham, so they turned towards the Ka`bah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These Hadiths prove that the Nasikh (a Text that abrogates a previous Text) only applies after one acquires knowledge of it, even if the Nasikh had already been revealed and announced. This is why the Companions mentioned above were not commanded to repeat the previous `Asr, Maghrib and `Isha&#8217; prayers (although they had prayed them towards Jerusalem after Allah had changed the Qiblah). Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the change of Qiblah (to Ka`bah in Makkah) occurred, those inflicted with hypocrisy and mistrust, and the disbelieving Jews, both were led astray from the right guidance and fell into confusion. They said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(What has turned them (Muslims) from their Qiblah to which they used to face in prayer.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They asked, &#8220;What is the matter with these people (Muslims) who one time face this direction (Jerusalem), and then face that direction (Makkah)&#8221; Allah answered their questions when He stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say (O Muhammad ): &#8220;To Allah belong both, east and the west.) meaning, the command, the decision and the authority are for Allah Alone. Hence:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;so wherever you turn (yourselves or your faces) there is the Face of Allah (and He is High above, over His Throne).) (2:115),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">( It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness) that you turn your faces towards east and (or) west (in prayers); but Al-Birr is the one who believes in Allah.) (2:177) This statement means, the best act is to adhere to Allah&#8217;s commands. Hence, wherever He commands us to face, we should face. Also, since obedience requires implementing Allah&#8217;s commands, if He commands us every day to face different places, we are His servants and under His disposal, and we face whatever He orders us to face. Certainly, Allah&#8217;s care and kindness towards His servant and Messenger, Muhammad , and certainly, his Ummah (Muslim nation) is profoundly great. Allah has guided them to the Qiblah of (Prophet) Ibrahim &#8212; Allah&#8217;s Khalil (intimate friend). He has commanded them to face the Ka`bah, the most honorable house (of worship) on the face of the earth, which was built by Ibrahim Al-Khalil in the Name of Allah, the One without a partner. This is why Allah said afterwards:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say (O Muhammad ): &#8220;To Allah belong both, east and the west. He guides whom He wills to the straight way.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad reported that `A&#8217;ishah (the Prophet&#8217;s wife) said that Allah&#8217;s Messenger said about the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(They do not envy us for a matter more than they envy us for Jumu`ah (Friday) to which Allah has guided us and from which they were led astray; for the (true) Qiblah to which Allah has directed us and from which they were led astray; and for our saying `Amin&#8217; behind the Imam (leader of the prayer).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews had Knowledge that the (Muslim) Qiblah would later be changed</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah stated that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Certainly, the people who were given the Scripture (i.e., Jews and the Christians) know well that, that (your turning towards the direction of the Ka`bah at Makkah in prayers) is the truth from their Lord.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah means: The Jews, who did not like that you change your Qiblah from Bayt Al-Maqdis, already knew that Allah will command you (O Muhammad) to face the Ka`bah. The Jews read in their Books their Prophets&#8217; description of Allah&#8217;s Messenger and his Ummah, and that Allah has endowed and honored him with the complete and honorable legislation. Yet, the People of the Book deny these facts because of their envy, disbelief and rebellion. This is why Allah threatened them when He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And Allah is not unaware of what they do.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(145. And even if you were to bring to the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) all the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they would not follow your Qiblah (prayer direction), nor are you going to follow their Qiblah. And they will not follow each other&#8217;s Qiblah. Verily, if you follow their desires after that which you have received of knowledge (from Allah), then indeed you will be one of the wrongdoers.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why was changing the Qiblah mentioned thrice</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a third command from Allah to face Al-Masjid Al-Haram (the Sacred Mosque) from every part of the world (during prayer). It was said that Allah mentioned this ruling again here because it is connected to whatever is before and whatever is after it. Hence, Allah first said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, We have seen the turning of your (Muhammad&#8217;s) face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a Qiblah (prayer direction) that shall please you) (2:144), until:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Certainly, the people who were given the Scripture (i.e., Jews and the Christians) know well that, that (your turning towards the direction of the Ka`bah at Makkah in prayers) is the truth from their Lord. And Allah is not unaware of what they do.) (2:144)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah mentioned in these Ayat His fulfillment of the Prophet&#8217;s wish and ordered him to face the Qiblah that he liked and is pleased with. In the second command, Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And from wheresoever you start forth (for prayers), turn your face in the direction of Al-Masid Al-Haram that is indeed the truth from your Lord. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Allah states here that changing the Qiblah is also the truth from Him, thus upgrading the subject more than in the first Ayah, in which Allah agreed to what His Prophet had wished for. Thus Allah states that this is also the truth from Him that He likes and is pleased with. In the third command, Allah refutes the Jewish assertion that the Prophet faced their Qiblah, as they knew in their Books that the Prophet will later on be commanded to face the Qiblah of Ibrahim, the Ka`bah. The Arab disbelievers had no more argument concerning the Prophet&#8217;s Qiblah after Allah commanded the Prophet to face the Qiblah of Ibrahim, which is more respected and honored, rather than the Qiblah of the Jews. The Arabs used to honor the Ka`bah and liked the fact that the Messenger was commanded to face it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The First Abrogation in the Qur&#8217;an was about the Qiblah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali bin Abu Talhah related that Ibn `Abbas narrated: The first abrogated part in the Qur&#8217;an was about the Qiblah. When Allah&#8217;s Messenger migrated to Al-Madinah, the majority of its people were Jews, and Allah commanded him to face Bayt Al-Maqdis. The Jews were delighted then. Allah&#8217;s Messenger faced it for ten and some months, but he liked to face the Qiblah of Ibrahim (Ka`bah in Makkah). He used to supplicate to Allah and look up to the sky (awaiting Allah&#8217;s command). Allah then revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, We have seen the turning of your (Muhammad&#8217;s) face towards the heaven), until,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(turn your faces (in prayer) in that direction.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews did not like this ruling and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;What has turned them (Muslims) from their Qiblah (prayer direction) to which they used to face in prayer.&#8221; Say (O Muhammad), &#8220;To Allah belong both, east and the west.&#8221;) (2:142)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(. ..so wherever you turn (yourselves or your faces) there is the Face of Allah) (2:115),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And We made the Qiblah (prayer direction towards Jerusalem) which you used to face, only to test those who followed the Messenger (Muhammad ) from those who would turn on their heels (i.e., disobey the Messenger).) (2:143)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Wisdom behind abrogating the Previous Qiblah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;so that men may have no argument against you)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the People of the Book knew from the description of the Muslim Ummah that they would be ordered to face the Ka`bah. If the Muslims did not fit this description, the Jews would have used this fact against the Muslims. If the Muslims had remained on the Qiblah of Bayt Al-Maqdis, which was also the Qiblah of the Jews, this fact could have been used as the basis of argument by the Jews against other people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;except those of them that are wrongdoers,) indicates the Mushrikin (polytheists) of Quraysh. The reasoning of these unjust persons was the unsound statement: &#8220;This man (Muhammad) claims that he follows the religion of Ibrahim! Hence, if his facing Bayt Al-Maqdis was a part of the religion of Ibrahim, why did he change it&#8221; The answer to this question is that Allah has chosen His Prophet to face Bayt Al-Maqdis first for certain wisdom, and he obeyed Allah regarding this command. Then, Allah changed the Qiblah to the Qiblah of Ibrahim, which is the Ka`bah, and he also obeyed Allah in this command. He, obeys Allah in all cases and never engages in the defiance of Allah even for an instant, and his Ummah imitates him in this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(. ..so fear them not, but fear Me!) meaning: `Do not fear the doubts that the unjust, stubborn persons raise and fear Me Alone.&#8217; Indeed, Allah Alone deserves to be feared.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;so that I may complete My blessings on you.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah relates to Allah&#8217;s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;so that men may have no argument against you), meaning: I will perfect My bounty on you by legislating for you to face the Ka`bah, so that the (Islamic) Shari`ah (law) is complete in every respect. Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;that you may be guided.), meaning: `To be directed and guided to what the nations have been led astray from, We have guided you to it and preferred you with it.&#8217; This is why this Ummah is the best and most honored nation ever.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Tafsir Ibn Kathir (Abridged) &#8211; Al Baqarah surah 2 © Darussalam 2000</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Prescription of the Sabbath for the Jews</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that for every nation, Allah prescribed one day of the week for people to gather to worship Him. For this Ummah He prescribed Friday, because it is the sixth day, on which Allah completed and perfected His creation. On this day He gathered and completed His blessings for His servants. It was said that Allah prescribed this day for the Children of Israel through His Prophet Musa, but they changed it and chose Saturday because it was the day on which the Creator did not create anything, as He had completed His creation on Friday. Allah made observance of the Sabbath obligatory for them in the laws of the Tawrah (Torah), telling them to keep the Sabbath. At the same time, He told them to follow Muhammad when he was sent, and took their promises and covenant to that effect. Hence Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sabbath was only prescribed for those who differed concerning it,) Mujahid said: &#8220;They observed the Sabbath (Saturday) and ignored Friday.&#8221; Then they continued to observe Saturday until Allah sent `Isa bin Maryam. It was said that he told them to change it to Sunday, and it was also said that he did not forsake the laws of the Tawrah except for a few rulings which were abrogated, and he continued to observe the Sabbath until he was taken up (into heaven). Afterwards, the Christians at the time of Constantine were the ones who changed it to Sunday in order to be different from the Jews, and they started to pray towards the east instead of facing the Dome (i.e., Jerusalem). And Allah knows best. It was reported in the Two Sahihs that Abu Hurayrah heard the Messenger of Allah say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(We are the last, but we will be the first on the Day of Resurrection, even though they were given the Book before us. This is the day that Allah obligated upon them, but they differed concerning it. Allah guided us to this day, and the people observe their days after us, the Jews on the following day and the Christians on the day after that.) This version was recorded by Al-Bukhari. It was reported that Abu Hurayrah and Hudhayfah said that the Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah let the people who came before us stray from Friday, so the Jews had Saturday and the Christians had Sunday. Then Allah brought us and guided us to Friday. So now there are Friday, Saturday and Sunday, thus they will follow us on the Day of Resurrection. We are the last of the people of this world, but will be the first on the Day of Resurrection, and will be the first to be judged, before all of creation.) It was reported by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Jews breach the Sanctity of the Sabbath</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2.65. And indeed you knew those amongst you who transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath (i.e. Saturday). We said to them: &#8220;Be you monkeys, despised and rejected.&#8221;) (66. So We made this punishment an example for those in front of it and those behind it, and a lesson for Al-Muttaqin (the pious.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And indeed you knew). This Ayah means, O Jews! Remember that Allah sent His torment on the village that disobeyed Him and broke their pledge and their covenant to observe the sanctity of the Sabbath. They began using deceitful means to avoid honoring the Sabbath by placing nets, ropes and artificial pools of water for the purpose of fishing before the Sabbath. When the fish came in abundance on Saturday as usual, they were caught in the ropes and nets for the rest of Saturday. During the night, the Jews collected the fish after the Sabbath ended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When they did that, Allah changed them from humans into monkeys, the animals having the form closest to humans. Their evil deeds and deceit appeared lawful on the surface, but they were in reality wicked. This is why their punishment was compatible with their crime. This story is explained in detail in Surat Al-A`raf, where Allah said (7:163),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And ask them (O Muhammad ) about the town that was by the sea; when they transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath (i.e. Saturday): when their fish came to them openly on the Sabbath day, and did not come to them on the day they had no Sabbath. Thus We made a trial of them, for they used to rebel (disobey Allah).)(7:163)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his Tafsir, Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(We said to them: &#8220;Be you monkeys, despised and rejected&#8221;) means, &#8220;Allah changed their bodies into those of monkeys and swines. The young people turned into monkeys while the old people turned into swine.&#8221; Shayban An-Nahwi reported that Qatadah commented on,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(We said to them: &#8220;Be you monkeys, despised and rejected&#8221;), &#8220;These people were turned into howling monkeys with tails, after being men and women.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Monkeys and Swine that exist now are not the Descendants of Those that were transformed</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;Those who violated the sanctity of the Sabbath were turned into monkeys, then they perished without offspring.&#8221; Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;Allah turned them into monkeys because of their sins. They only lived on the earth for three days, for no transformed person ever lives more than three days. They did not eat, drink or have offspring. Allah transformed their shapes into monkeys, and He does what He wills, with whom He wills and He changes the shape of whomever He wills. On the other hand, Allah created the monkeys, swines and the rest of the creation in the six days (of creation) that He mentioned in His Book.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So We made this punishment an example) means, Allah made the people of this village, who violated the sanctity of the Sabbath,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(an example) via the way they were punished. Similarly, Allah said about Pharaoh,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So Allah, seized him with punishing example for his last and first transgression) (79:25). nAllah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(for those in front of it and those behind it) meaning, for the other villages. Ibn `Abbas commented, &#8220;Meaning, `We made this village an example for the villages around it by the manner in which We punished its people.&#8221;&#8217; Similarly, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And indeed We have destroyed towns (populations) round about you, and We have (repeatedly) shown (them) the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) in various ways that they might return (to the truth and believe in the Oneness of Allah ـ Islamic Monotheism)).(46:27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Allah made them an example for those who lived during their time as well as a reminder for those to come, by preserving their story. This is why Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and a lesson for Al-Muttaqin (the pious)), meaning, a reminder. This Ayah means, &#8220;The torment and punishment that this village suffered was a result of indulging in Allah&#8217;s prohibitions and their deceit. Hence, those who have Taqwa should be aware of their evil behavior, so that what occurred to this village does not befall them as well.&#8221; Also, Imam Abu `Abdullah bin Battah reported that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Do not commit what the Jews committed, breaching what Allah has forbidden, by resorting to the lowest types of deceit.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Hadith has a good (Jayid) chain of narration. Allah knows best.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Light of the heavens and the earth, the One Who illuminates the hearts of the gnostics with knowledge of Him, faith in Him and His guidance. He is the One Who has lighted the heavens and the earth with lights that He has placed therein. His veil is light and were He to uncover it then the Face of the Glorious would burn everything from the creation that His Sight fell upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His Light is as if there were a niche and within it a lamp, the lamp is in a glass, and the glass as if it were a brilliant star, lit from a blessed tree, an olive, neither of the east or of the west, whose oil would almost glow forth (of itself) even though no fire touches it. Light upon light! Allah guides to His Light whom He Wills. Allah sets forth parables for mankind, and Allah Knows everything.&#8221; (24:35)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr. Saleh As-Saleh (rahimahullaah):</p>
<p>Excerpt:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>Those who negate Allaah&#8217;s Attribute of An-Nur erred by thinking that if they would affirm the Attribute of An-Nur, it would mean that Allaah is the light falling upon walls and gardens, etc.!</b> The fact however is that the created light is an effect of the Attribute of An-Nur. We know that Ar-Rahmah (Mercy) is an Attribute of Allaah established with Him. The rahmah (mercy) present on earth is an effect of Allaah&#8217;s Attribute of Ar-Rahmah separted from Him. The knowledge of the creature is a distinct and separate effect of Allaah&#8217;s Attribute of Knowledge. The saying of &#8216;Abdullaah ibn Mas&#8217;oud does not mean or imply that the light on walls and on the surface of the earth is the essence of the Light of Allaah&#8217;s most honourable Face.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;-</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Noorus-Samaawaati Wal-Ardh (Light of the Heavens and the Earth)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says:as-s</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allah is the Light of the Heavens and the Earth. the parable of His light is as if therewere a niche and within it a lamp; the lamp is in a glass, the glass as it were a brilliant star, lit from a blessed tree, an olive, neither of the east nor of the west, whose oil would almost glow forth of itself, though no fire touched it. Light upon Light! Allah guides to His Light whom He wills. And Allah sets forth parables for mankind, and Allah is All-Knower of everything.&#8221; [An-Noor 24:35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet Muhammad sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam (sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh Allah for You is the praise and You are the Light of the Heavens and the Earth and all therein&#8230; [Al-Bukhaari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a great Attribute since it describes the One Possessing Majesty and Honor and deserving of glorification and praise and Who if He were to remove the veil from His Noble Countenance all that would be exposed to it in the creation would be disintegrated and His Light would illuminate all the creation and it is the Light from his Countenance that brings light to all darkness and that lights up the Arsh, the Kursi and the seven levels of heaven, indeed all the universe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His Light is of two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. That which is perceived (hissee) such as the light that emanates from the universe and that would not exist without His light.<br />
2. The spiritual (ma&#8217;nawee) which reaches the hearts and the hearing and the vision and that constitutes the light for the slaves in this life and the next.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allah guides with His Light whom He wills&#8221;. And just as Allah has mentioned, He is the Light of the Heavens and the Earth, He has also called His Book and His Messenger and the Revelation light. &#8211; As-Sadee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What must be avoided are the excesses of the Sufis who went too far and did not distinguish between Light as a description of the self and the light of faith and knowledge. Due to worshipping and deifying without complete knowledge some among them perceived the light that comes to the heart from the sincere worship of Allah meant that the person themselves became a part of Allah or had a part of Allah the Most Holy in them so much incorrect and ugly speech emanated from them due to delusion and ignorance in this regard and Allah is Most High and free from what they wrongly attributed to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of knowledge however distinguished between the Light that is a part of Allah and His Attribute and the light given to the creation both perceived and spiritual. The believer who perfects his faith is given light in his heart from Allah so that he sees the reality of things and he can clearly distinguish between falsehood and truth until it becomes a part of his life and his power toward good in knowledge and action. He is cleared of doubts and confusion and gets knowledge and clarity and is freed from lusts and negligence and darkness. His speech and actions are characterized as light and he is surrounded by it, while the disbeliever or the hypocrite, the rebellious and unmindful wander about confused and in darkness and all this is due to what they have themselves done .</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">The Parable of the Light of Allah</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[The following is from Tafsir Ibn Kathir]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth.) means, the Guide of the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth. Ibn Jurayj said: &#8220;Mujahid and Ibn `Abbas said concerning the Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth.) He is controlling their affairs and their stars and sun and moon.&#8221; As-Suddi said concerning the Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth.) by His Light the heavens and earth are illuminated. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said: &#8220;When the Messenger of Allah got up to pray at night, he would say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Allah, to You be praise, You are the Sustainer of heaven and earth and whoever is in them. To You be praise, You are the Light of the heavens and the earth and whoever is in them. ) It was narrated that Ibn Mas`ud said, &#8220;There is no night or day with your Lord; the Light of the Throne comes from the Light of His Face.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The parable of His Light) There are two views concerning the meaning of the pronoun (His). The first is that it refers to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, meaning that the parable of His guidance in the heart of the believer is</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(as a niche) This was the view of Ibn `Abbas. The second view is that the pronoun refers to the believer, which is indicated by the context of the words and implies that the parable of the light in the heart of the believer is as a niche. So the heart of the believer and what he is naturally inclined to of guidance and what he learns of the Qur&#8217;an which is in accordance with his natural inclinations are, as Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Can they who rely on a clear proof from their Lord, and whom a witness from Him recites it (can they be equal with the disbelievers)) [11:17]. The heart of the believer in its purity and clarity is likened to a lamp in transparent and jewel-like glass, and the Qur&#8217;an and Shari`ah by which it is guided are likened to good, pure, shining oil in which there is no impurity or deviation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(as (if there were) a niche) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Muhammad bin Ka`b and others said, &#8220;This refers to the position of the wick in the lamp.&#8221; This is well-known, and hence Allah then says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and within it a lamp.) This is the flame that burns brightly. Or it was said that the niche is a niche in the house. This is the parable given by Allah of obedience towards Him. Allah calls obedience to Him as light, then He calls it by other numerous names as well. Ubayy bin Ka`b said, &#8220;The lamp is the light, and this refers to the Qur&#8217;an and the faith that is in his heart.&#8221; As-Suddi said, &#8220;It is the lamp.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the lamp is in a glass,) means, this light is shining in a clear glass. Ubayy bin Ka`b and others said, &#8220;This is the likeness of the heart of the believer.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the glass as it were a star Durriyyun,) Some authorities recite the word Durriyyun with a Dammah on the Dal and without a Hamzah, which means pearls, i.e., as if it were a star made of pearls (Durr). Others recite it as Dirri&#8217;un or Durri&#8217;un, with a Kasrah on the Dal, or Dammah on the Dal, and with a Hamzah at the end, which means reflection (Dir&#8217;), because if something is shone on the star it becomes brighter than at any other time. The Arabs call the stars they do not know Darari. Ubayy bin Ka`b said: a shining star. Qatadah said: &#8220;Huge, bright and clear.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(lit from a blessed tree,) means, it is derived from olive oil, from a blessed tree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(an olive,) This refers to the blessed tree mentioned previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(neither of the east nor of the west,) means, it is not in the eastern part of the land so that it does not get any sun in the first part of the day, nor is it in the western part of the land so that it is shaded from the sun before sunset, but it is in a central position where it gets sun from the beginning of the day until the end, so its oil is good and pure and shining. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn `Abbas commented on:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(an olive, neither of the east nor of the west,) &#8220;This is a tree in the desert which is not shaded by any other tree or mountain or cave, nothing covers it, and this is best for its oil.&#8221; Mujahid commented on:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(neither of the east nor of the west, ) saying; &#8220;It is not in the east where it will get no sun when the sun sets, nor is it in the west where it will get no sun when the sun rises, but it is in a position where it will get sun both at sunrise and sunset.&#8221; Sa`id bin Jubayr commented:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(an olive, neither of the east nor of the west, whose oil would almost glow forth (of itself)) &#8220;This is the best kind of oil. When the sun rises it reaches the tree from the east and when it sets it reaches it from the west, so the sun reaches it morning and evening, so it is not counted as being in the east or in the west.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(whose oil would almost glow forth (of itself), though no fire touched it.) `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said (this means) because the oil itself is shining.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Light upon Light!) Al-`Awfi narrated from Ibn `Abbas that this meant the faith and deeds of a person. As-Suddi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Light upon Light!) &#8220;Light of the fire and the light of the oil: when they are combined they give light, and neither of them can give light without the other. Similarly the light of the Qur&#8217;an and the light of faith give light when they are combined, and neither can do so without the other.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah guides to His Light whom He wills.) means, Allah shows the way to the ones whom He chooses, as it says in the Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad from `Abdullah bin `Amr, who said, &#8220;I heard the Messenger of Allah say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah created His creation in darkness, then on the same day He sent His Light upon them. Whoever was touched by His Light on that day will be guided and whoever was missed will be led astray. Hence I say: the pens have dried in accordance with the knowledge of Allah, may He be glorified.)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And Allah sets forth parables for mankind, and Allah is All-Knower of everything.) Having mentioned this parable of the Light of His guidance in the heart of the believer, Allah ends this Ayah with the words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And Allah sets forth parables for mankind, and Allah is All-Knower of everything.) meaning, He knows best who deserves to be guided and who deserves to be led astray. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Hearts are of four kinds: the heart that is clear like a shining lamp; the heart that is covered and tied up; the heart that is upside-down; and the heart that is clad in armor. As for the clear heart, it is the heart of the believer in which is a lamp filled with light; as for the covered heart, this is the heart of the disbeliever; as for the upside-down heart, this is the heart of the hypocrite, who recognizes then denies; as for the armor-clad heart, this is the heart in which there is both faith and hypocrisy. The parable of the faith in it is that of legume, a sprout that is irrigated with good water, and the likeness of the hypocrisy in it is that of sores that are fed by blood and pus. Whichever of the two prevails is the characteristic that will dominate.) Its chain of narrators is good (Jayyid) although they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not record it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Following is taken from Tafseer Ibn Kathir</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah encouraged His Prophet to pray in Masjid Quba&#8217; which, from the first day, was built on Taqwa, obedience to Allah and His Messenger , for gathering the word of the believers and as an outpost and a fort for Islam and its people. This is why Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Verily, the Masjid whose foundation was laid from the first day on Taqwa is more worthy that you stand therein (to pray).)</span></strong> in reference to the Masjid of Quba&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An authentic Hadith records that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(One prayer in Masjid Quba&#8217; is just like an `Umrah.)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah used to visit Masjid Quba&#8217; while riding and walking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Other Notes:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">It is prescribed for the visitor to Madeenah and for the one who lives there to go to the Mosque of Quba’ and pray there, following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and seeking the reward of ‘Umrah. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">It was narrated that Sahl ibn Haneef said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: </span><b style="line-height:1.5em;">“</b><span style="color:#008000;"><strong><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Whoever goes out until he comes to this mosque – meaning the Mosque of Quba’ – and prays there, that will be equivalent to ‘Umrah</span></strong></span><b style="line-height:1.5em;">.”</b><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> Narrated by Ahmad, 3/437; al-Nasaa’i, 699; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in </span><i style="line-height:1.5em;">Saheeh al-Targheeb</i><span style="line-height:1.5em;">, 1180, 1181.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">In </span><em style="line-height:1.5em;">Sahih Muslim </em><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> it is narrated that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to go to the mosque of Quba’ every Saturday, walking or riding, and he would pray two rak’ahs there</span><b style="line-height:1.5em;">.</b><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1191; Muslim, 1399</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imam Ibn Kathir<br />
</strong>Tafsir Ibn Katheer (Abridged) Volume 9<br />
© Darussalam 2000</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Know that the life of this world is only play and amusement, pomp and mutual boasting among you, and rivalry in respect of wealth and children.  (It is) like a rain (Ghayth), thereof the growth is pleasing to the tiller; afterwards it dries up and you see it turning yellow; then it becomes straw.  But in the Hereafter (there is) a severe torment, and (there is) forgiveness from Allah and (His) pleasure.  And the life of this world is only a deceiving enjoyment.&#8221; [57:20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted degrades the significance of this life and belittles it by saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;that the life of this world is only play and amusement, pomp and mutual boasting among you, and rivalry in respect of wealth and children.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, this is the significance of this life to its people, just as He said in another Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Beautified for men is the love of things they covet; women, children, much of gold and silver (wealth), branded beautiful horses, cattle and well-tilled land.  This is the pleasure of the present world&#8217;s life; but Allah has the excellent return with Him.&#8221; ( 3:14 )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted also sets a parable for this life, declaring that its joys are fading and its delights are perishable, saying that life is,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Like a rain (Ghayth),&#8221; which is the rain that comes down to mankind, after they had felt despair.  Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And He is it Who sends down the Ghayth (rain) after they have despaired.&#8221; (42:28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;thereof the growth is pleasing to the tiller;&#8221; meaning that farmers admire the vegetation that grows in the aftermath of rain.  And just as farmers admire vegetation, the disbelievers admire this life; they are the most eager to acquire the traits of life, and life is most dear to them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;afterwards it dries up and you see it turning yellow; then it becomes straw.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, that vegetation soon turns yellow in color, after being fresh and green.  After that, the green fades away and becomes scattered pieces of dust.  This is the parable of this worldly life, it starts young, then matures and then turns old and feeble.  This is also the parable of mankind in this life; they are young and strong in the beginning.  In this stage of life, they look youthful and handsome.  Slowly, they begin growing older, their mannerism changes and their strength weakens.  They then grow old and feeble; moving becomes difficult for them, while doing easy things becomes beyond their ability.  Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allah is He Who created you in (a state of) weakness, then gave you strength after weakness, then after strength gave (you) weakness and gray hair.  He creates what He wills.  And He is the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful.&#8221; (30:54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This parable indicates the near demise of this life and the imminent end of it, while in contrast, the Hereafter is surely coming.  Those who hear this parable should, therefore, be aware of the significance of the Hereafter and feel eagerness in the goodness that it contains,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;But in the Hereafter (there is) a severe torment, and (there is) forgiveness from Allah and (His) pleasure.  And the life of this world is only a deceiving enjoyment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, surely, the Hereafter that will certainly come contains two things either severe punishment or forgiveness from Allah and His good pleasure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And the life of this world is only a deceiving enjoyment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, this life is only a form of enjoyment that deceives those who incline to it.  Surely, those who recline to this life will admire it and feel that it is dear to them, so much so, that they might think that this is the only life, no life or dwelling after it.  Yet, in reality, this life is insignificant as compared to the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah, sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; Paradise is nearer to any of you than the strap of his shoe, and so is the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; [Ahmad 1:387]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari collected this Hadith through the narration of Ath-Thawri [Fath al-Bari 11:328].  This Hadith indicates the close proximity of both good and evil in relation to mankind.  If this is the case, then this is the reason Allah the Exalted encouraged mankind to rush to perform acts of righteousness and obedience and to avoid the prohibitions.  By doing so, their sins and errors will be forgiven and they will acquire rewards and an exalted status.  Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Race with one another in hastening towards forgiveness from your Lord, and Paradise the width whereof is as the width of the heaven and the earth.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And march forth in the way (to) forgiveness from your Lord, and for Paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth, prepared for those who have Taqwa.&#8221; (3:133)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said here,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;prepared for those who believe in Allah and His Messengers.  That is the grace of Allah which He bestows on whom He is pleased with.  And Allah is the Owner of the great bounty.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, &#8220;This, that Allah has qualified them for, is all a part of His favor, bounty and compassion.&#8221;  We mentioned a Hadith collected in the Sahih in which the poor emigrants said to the Messenger, sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger!  The wealthy people will get higher grades and permanent enjoyment.&#8221;  He asked, &#8220;Why is that?&#8221;  They said, &#8220;They pray like us and fast as we do.  However, they give in charity, whereas we cannot do that, and they free servants, whereas we cannot afford it.&#8221;  The Prophet, sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam, said, &#8220;Shall I tell you of a good deed that, if you acted upon, you would catch up with those who have surpassed you? None would overtake you and be better than you, except those who might do the same.  Say, &#8220;Glorious is Allah,&#8221; Allah is Most Great&#8221;, and &#8220;Praise be to Allah&#8221;, thirty three times each after every prayer.&#8221;  They later came back and said, &#8220;Our wealthy brethren heard what we did and they started doing the same.&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Messenger, sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This is the favor that He gives to whom He wills.&#8221; [Muslim 1:416]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1-10 Verses of Al-Momin Surah<br />
</strong><strong>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What is Jannat ul Firdaus?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah said: (If you ask Allah for Paradise, then ask him for Al-Firdaws, for it is the highest part of Paradise, in the middle of Paradise, and from it spring the rivers of Paradise, and above it is the (Mighty) Throne of the Most Merciful.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Who shall inherit Firdaws? (1-10 Verses of Al-Monin Surah)</strong></p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Successful indeed are the believers.</li>
<li>Those who with their Salah are Khashi`un (with fear and with tranquillity).</li>
<li>And those who turn away from Al-Laghw.</li>
<li>And those who pay the Zakah.</li>
<li>And those who guard their private parts.</li>
<li>Except from their wives or their right hand possessions, for then, they are free from blame.</li>
<li>But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors.</li>
<li>Those who are faithfully true to their Amanat and to their covenants are Ra`un.</li>
<li>And those who strictly guard their Salawat.</li>
<li>These are indeed the heirs.</li>
<li>Who shall inherit <strong>Firdaws</strong>. They shall dwell therein forever.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Success is for the believers whose qualities are described here</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Successful indeed are the believers) means, they have attained victory and are blessed, for they have succeeded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">***These are the believers who have the following characteristics ***</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Those who with their Salah are Khashi`un.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said: &#8220;(Khashi`un) means those with<strong> fear and with tranquillity</strong>.&#8221; This was also narrated from Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and Az-Zuhri.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was reported from `Ali bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, that Khushu` means the <strong>Khushu` of the heart.</strong> This was also the view of Ibrahim An-Nakha`i.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, &#8220;Their Khushu` was in their hearts.&#8221; So they lowered their gaze and were humble towards others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khushu` in prayer is only attained by the one who has emptied his heart totally, who does not pay attention to anything else besides it, and who prefers it above all else. At that point it becomes a delight and a joy for eyes, as in the Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad and An-Nasai from Anas, who said that the Messenger of Allah said:(Fragrance and women have been made dear to me, and Salah was made the joy of my eye.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And those who turn away from Al-Laghw.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It refers to falsehood, which includes Shirk and sin, and any words or deeds that are of no benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allah says: (<em><strong>And if they pass by Al-Laghw, they pass by it with dignity</strong></em>)[25:72].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qatadah said: &#8220;By Allah, there came to them from Allah that which kept them away from that (evil).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And those who pay the Zakah.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most commentators say that the meaning here is the Zakah that is paid on wealth, even though this Ayah was revealed in Makkah, and Zakah was ordained in Al-Madinah in the year 2 H. The apparent meaning is that the Zakah that was instituted in Al-Madinah is the one based upon the Nusub and the specific amounts, apart from which it seems that the basic principle of Zakah was enjoined in Makkah. As Allah says in Surat Al-An`am, which was also revealed in Makkah: (but pay the due thereof on the day of their harvest, ) [6:141]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It could be that what is meant here by Zakah is purification of the soul from Shirk and filth, as in the Ayah:(Indeed he succeeds who purifies himself (Zakkaha). And indeed he fails who corrupts himself.) [91:9-10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It could be that both meanings are intended, purification of the soul and of one&#8217;s wealth, because that is part of the purification of the soul, and the true believer is one who pays attention to both matters. And Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And those who guard their private parts. Except from their wives and their right hand possessions, for then, they are free from blame. But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It means, those who protect their private parts from unlawful actions and do not do that which Allah has forbidden; fornication and homosexuality, and do not approach anyone except the wives whom Allah has made permissible for them or their right hand possessions from the captives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One who seeks what Allah has made permissible for him is not to be blamed and there is no sin on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says: (they are free from blame. But whoever seeks beyond that) meaning, other than a wife or slave girl, (then those are the transgressors.) meaning , aggressors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Those who are faithfully true to their Amanat and to their covenants)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When they are entrusted with something, they do not betray that trust, but they fulfill it, and when they make a promise or make a pledge, they are true to their word.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is not like the hypocrites about whom the Messenger of Allah said: (The signs of the hypocrite are three: when he speaks he lies, when he makes a promise he breaks it, and when he is entrusted with something he betrays that trust.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And those who strictly guard their Salawat.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It means, they persistently offer their prayers at their appointed times, as Ibn Mas`ud said: &#8220;I asked the Messenger of Allah , `O Messenger of Allah, which deed is most beloved to Allah&#8217; He said, (Prayer at the appointed time.) I said, `Then what&#8217; He said,(Kindness to one&#8217;s parents. ) I said, `Then what&#8217; He said,(Jihad in the way of Allah.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was recorded in the Two Sahihs. Qatadah said: &#8220;At the fixed times, with the proper bowing and prostration.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah begins and ends this list of praiseworthy qualities with Salah, which is indicative of its virtue, as the Prophet said: (Adhere to righteousness, you will never be able encompass it all. Know that the best of your deeds is Salah. None will preserve his Wuddu&#8217; except the believer.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having described them with these praiseworthy characteristics and righteous deeds, Allah then says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(These are indeed the heirs. Who shall inherit Firdaws. They shall dwell therein forever.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah said: (If you ask Allah for Paradise, then ask him for Al-Firdaws, for it is the highest part of Paradise, in the middle of Paradise, and from it spring the rivers of Paradise, and above it is the (Mighty) Throne of the Most Merciful.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah said:(There is not one among you who does not have two homes, a home in Paradise and a home in Hell. If he dies and enters Hell, the people of Paradise will inherit his home, and this is what Allah said: (These are indeed the heirs.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jurayj narrated from Layth from Mujahid:(These are indeed the heirs.) &#8220;The believers will inherit the homes of the disbelievers because they were created to worship Allah Alone with no partner or associate. So when these believers did what was enjoined on them of worship, and the disbelievers neglected to do that which they were commanded to do and for which they had been created, the believers gained the share that they would have been given if they had obeyed their Lord. Indeed, they will be given more than that as well.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what was reported in Sahih Muslim from Abu Burdah, from his father, from the Prophet who said: (Some of the Muslims will come on the Day of Resurrection with sins like mountains, but Allah will forgive them and put (their burden of sin) on the Jews and Christians.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to another version: the Messenger of Allah said: (When the Day of Resurrection comes, Allah will appoint for every Muslim a Jew or Christian, and it will be said, &#8220;This is your ransom from the Fire.&#8221;) `</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz asked Abu Burdah to swear by Allah besides Whom there is no other God, three times, that his father told him that from the Prophet , and he swore that oath. I say: this Ayah is like Allah&#8217;s saying: (Such is the Paradise which We shall give as an inheritance to those of Our servants who have had Taqwa.) [19:63] (This is the Paradise which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds which you used to do.) [43:72]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Tafseer Ibn Kathir &#8211; Surah A-Baqarah (2:189)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness, etc.) that you enter the houses from the back, but Al-Birr is from Taqwa. So enter houses through their proper doors.)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari recorded that Al-Bara&#8217; said, &#8220;During the time of Jahiliyyah, they used to enter the house from the back upon assuming the Ihram. Thereafter, Allah revealed (the following Ayah):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness, etc.) that you enter the houses from the back but Al-Birr is from Taqwa. So enter houses through their proper doors.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded the same Hadith from Al-Bara&#8217; but with the wording; &#8220;The Ansar used to enter their houses from the back when returning from a journey. Thereafter, this Ayah (2:189 above) was revealed&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan said, &#8220;When some people during the time of Jahiliyyah would leave home to travel, and then decide not to travel, they would not enter the house from its door. Rather, they would climb over the back wall. Allah the Exalted said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness) that you enter the houses from the back,).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement:<br />
(&#8230;and have Taqwa of Allah that you may be successful.) Have Taqwa of Allah, means to do what He has commanded you and refrain from what He has forbidden for you,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(that you may be successful.) tomorrow when you stand before Him and He thus rewards you perfectly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Tafseer Ibn Kathir &#8211; Surah Fatihah</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[1]</strong><strong> Why the Devil is called Shaytan ?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Arabic language, Shaytan is derived from Shatana, which means the far thing. Hence, the Shaytan has a different nature than mankind, and his sinful ways are far away from every type of righteousness. It was also said that Shaytan is derived from Shata, (literally `burned&#8217;), because it was created from fire. Some scholars said that both meanings are correct, although they state that the first meaning is more plausible. Further, Siybawayh (the renowned Arab linguistic) said, &#8220;The Arabs say, `So-and-so has Tashaytan,&#8217; when he commits the act of the devils. If Shaytan was derived from Shata, they would have said, Tashayyata (rather than Tashaytan).&#8221; Hence, Shaytan is derived from the word that means, far away. This is why they call those who are rebellious (or mischievous) from among the Jinns and mankind a `Shaytan&#8217;. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And so We have appointed for every Prophet enemies ـ Shayatin (devils) among mankind and Jinn, inspiring one another with adorned speech as a delusion (or by way of deception)) (6:112).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, the Musnad by Imam Ahmad records that Abu Dharr said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Abu Dharr! Seek refuge with Allah from the devils of mankind and the Jinns.) Abu Dharr said, &#8220;I asked him , `Are there human devils&#8217; He said, (Yes.)&#8221; Furthermore, it is recorded in Sahih Muslim that Abu Dharr said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The woman, the donkey and the black dog interrupt the prayer (if they pass in front of those who do not pray behind a Sutrah, i.e. a barrier).) Abu Dharr said, &#8220;I said, `What is the difference between the black dog and the red or yellow dog&#8217; He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The black dog is a devil.).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Ibn Jarir At-Tabari recorded that `Umar bin Al-Khattab once rode a Berthawn (huge camel) which started to proceed arrogantly. `Umar kept striking the animal, but the animal kept walking in an arrogant manner. `Umar dismounted the animal and said, &#8220;By Allah! You have carried me on a Shaytan. I did not come down from it until after I had felt something strange in my heart.&#8221; This Hadith has an authentic chain of narrators.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[2] What does Isti`adhah mean</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Isti`adhah means, &#8220;I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed Satan so that he is prevented from affecting my religious or worldly affairs, or hindering me from adhering to what I was commanded, or luring me into what I was prohibited from.&#8221; Indeed, only Allah is able to prevent the evil of Satan from touching the son of Adam. This is why Allah allowed us to be lenient and kind with the human devil, so that his soft nature might cause him to refrain from the evil he is indulging in. However, Allah required us to seek refuge with Him from the evil of Satan, because he neither accepts bribes nor does kindness affect him, for he is pure evil. Thus, only He Who created Satan is able to stop his evil. This meaning is reiterated in only three Ayat in the Qur&#8217;an. Allah said in Surat Al-A`raf,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the foolish (i.e. don&#8217;t punish them).) (7:199)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is about dealing with human beings. He then said in the same Surah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And if an evil whisper comes to you from Shaytan, then seek refuge with Allah. Verily, He is Hearing, Knowing (7: 200).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also said in Surat Al-Mu&#8217;minun,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Repel evil with that which is better. We are Best-Acquainted with the things they utter. And say: &#8220;My Lord! I seek refuge with You from the whisperings (suggestions) of the Shayatin (devils). And I seek refuge with You, My Lord! lest they should come near me.&#8221; (23:96-98).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further, Allah said in Surat As-Sajdah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal. Repel (the evil) with one which is better, then verily he, between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend. But none is granted it (the above quality) except those who are patient ـ and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion (of happiness in the Hereafter, i.e. Paradise and of a high moral character) in this world. And if an evil whisper from Shaytan tries to turn you away (from doing good), then seek refuge in Allah. Verily, He is the Hearing, the Knowing) (41:34-36).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[3] The Tafsir of Isti`adhah (seeking Refuge)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and stay away from the foolish (i.e. don&#8217;t punish them). And if an evil whisper comes to you from Shaytan (Satan), then seek refuge with Allah. Verily, He is Hearing, Knowing) (7:199-200),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Repel evil with that which is better. We are Best-Acquainted with things they utter. And say: &#8220;My Lord! I seek refuge with You from the whisperings (suggestions) of the Shayatin (devils). And I seek refuge with You, My Lord! lest they should come near me.&#8221;) (23:96-98) and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Repel (an evil) with one which is better, then verily he with whom there was enmity between you, (will become) as though he was a close friend. But none is granted it except those who are patient ـ and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion (of happiness in the Hereafter, i.e. Paradise and of a high moral character) in this world. And if an evil whisper from Shaytan tries to turn you away (O Muhammad ) (from doing good), then seek refuge in Allah. Verily, He is the Hearing, the Knowing.) (41:34-36) These are the only three Ayat that carry this meaning. Allah commanded that we be lenient human enemy, so that his soft nature might make him an ally and a supporter. He also commanded that we seek refuge from the satanic enemy, because the devil does not relent in his enmity if we treat him with kindness and leniency. The devil only seeks the destruction of the Son of Adam due to the vicious enmity and hatred he has always had towards man&#8217;s father, Adam. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Children of Adam! Let not Shaytan deceive you, as he got your parents ﴿Adam and Hawwa&#8217; (Eve)﴾ out of Paradise) (7:27),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surely, Shaytan is an enemy to you, so take (treat) him as an enemy. He only invites his Hizb (followers) that they may become the dwellers of the blazing Fire) (35:6) and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Will you then take him (Iblis) and his offspring as protectors and helpers rather than Me while they are enemies to you What an evil is the exchange for the Zalimun (polytheists, and wrongdoers, etc)) (18:50).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The devil assured Adam that he wanted to advise him, but he was lying. Hence, how would he treat us after he had vowed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;By Your might, then I will surely, mislead them all. Except Your chosen servants among them (i.e. faithful, obedient, true believers of Islamic Monotheism).&#8221;) (38:82-83)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So when you ﴿want to﴾ recite the Qur&#8217;an, seek refuge with Allah from Shaytan, the outcast (the cursed one). Verily, he has no power over those who believe and put their trust only in their Lord (Allah). His power is only over those who obey and follow him (Satan), and those who join partners with Him.) (16:98-100).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[4] The Meaning of Ar-Rajim</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ar-Rajim means, being expelled from all types of righteousness. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And indeed We have adorned the nearest heaven with lamps, and We have made such lamps Rujuman (as missiles) to drive away the Shayatin (devils)) (67:5).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, We have adorned the near heaven with the stars (for beauty). And to guard against every rebellious devil. They cannot listen to the higher group (angels) for they are pelted from every side. Outcast, and theirs is a constant (or painful) torment. Except such as snatch away something by stealing, and they are pursued by a flaming fire of piercing brightness) (37:6-10).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And indeed, We have put the big stars in the heaven and We beautified it for the beholders. And We have guarded it (near heaven) from every Shaytan Rajim (outcast Shaytan). Except him (devil) who steals the hearing then he is pursued by a clear flaming fire.) (15:16-18).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are several similar Ayat. It was also said that Rajim means, the person who throws or bombards things, because the devil throws doubts and evil thoughts in people&#8217;s hearts. The first meaning is more popular and accurate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[5] Virtues of the Isti`adhah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Isti`adhah cleanses the mouth from the foul speech that it has indulged in. It also purifies the mouth and prepares it to recite the speech of Allah. Further, the Isti`adhah entails seeking Allah&#8217;s help and acknowledging His ability to do everything. The Isti`adhah also affirms the servant&#8217;s meekness, weakness and inability to face the enemy of his inner evil, whom Allah alone, Who created this enemy, is able to repel and defeat. This enemy does not accept kindness, unlike the human enemy. There are three Ayat in the Qur&#8217;an that affirm this fact. Also, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, My servants (i.e. the true believers of Islamic Monotheism) ـ you have no authority over them. And sufficient is your Lord as a Guardian.) (17:65).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We should state here that the believers, whom the human enemies kill, become martyrs, while those who fall victim to the inner enemy &#8211; Satan &#8211; become bandits. Further, the believers who are defeated by the apparent enemy &#8211; disbelievers &#8211; gain a reward, while those defeated by the inner enemy earn a sin and become misguided. Since Satan sees man where man cannot see him, it is befitting that the believers seek refuge from Satan with Whom Satan cannot see. The Isti`adhah is a form of drawing closer to Allah and seeking refuge with Him from the evil of every evil creature.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[6] Is the Isti`adhah (seeking Refuge) required</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The majority of the scholars state that reciting the Isti`adhah (in the prayer and when reciting the Qur&#8217;an) is recommended and not required, and therefore, not reciting it does not constitute a sin. However, Ar-Razi recorded that `Ata&#8217; bin Abi Rabah said that the Isti`adhah is required in the prayer and when one reads the Qur&#8217;an. In support of `Ata&#8217;s statement, Ar-Razi relied upon the apparent meaning of the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then seek refuge.) He said that the Ayah contains a command that requires implementation. Also, the Prophet always said the Isti`adhah. In addition, the Isti`adhah wards off the evil of Satan, which is neccessary, the rule is that the means needed to implement a requirement of the religion is itself also required. And when one says, &#8220;I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed devil.&#8221; Then this will suffice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[7] Seeking Refuge before reciting the Qur&#8217;an</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So when you ﴿want to﴾ recite the Qur&#8217;an, seek refuge with Allah from Shaytan, the outcast (the cursed one).) meaning, before you recite the Qur&#8217;an. Similarly, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When you intend to offer As-Salah (the prayer), wash your faces and your hands (forearms)) (5:6) meaning, before you stand in prayer, as evident by the Hadiths that we mentioned. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, &#8220;When the Messenger of Allah would stand up in prayer at night, he would start his prayer with the Takbir (saying &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221;; Allah is Greater) and would then supplicate,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(All praise is due to You, O Allah, and also the thanks. Blessed be Your Name, Exalted be Your sovereignty, and there is no deity worthy of worship except You.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would then say thrice,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah,).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would then say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I seek refuge with Allah, the Hearing, the Knowing, from the cursed Satan, from his coercion, lures to arrogance and poems.).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The four collectors of the Sunan recorded this Hadith, which At-Tirmidhi considered the most famous Hadith on this subject.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah recorded that Jubayr bin Mut`im said that his father said, &#8220;When the Messenger of Allah started the prayer, he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah is the Greater, truly the Greatest (thrice); all praise is due to Allah always (thrice); and all praise is due to Allah day and night (thrice). O Allah! I seek refuge with You from the cursed Satan, from his Hamz, Nafkh and Nafth.).&#8221; `Amr said, &#8220;The Hamz means asphyxiation, the Nafkh means arrogance, and the Nafth means poetry.&#8221; Also, Ibn Majah recorded that `Ali bin Al-Mundhir said that Ibn Fudayl narrated that `Ata&#8217; bin As-Sa&#8217;ib said that Abu `Abdur-Rahman As-Sulami said that Ibn Mas`ud said that the Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Allah! I seek refuge with You from the cursed devil, from his Hamz, Nafkh and Nafth.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;The Hamz means death, the Nafkh means arrogance, and the Nafth means poetry.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] Seeking Refuge with Allah when One is Angry</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his Musnad, Al-Hafiz Abu Ya`la Ahmad bin `Ali bin Al-Muthanna Al-Mawsili reported that Ubayy bin Ka`b said, &#8220;Two men disputed with each other in the presence of the Messenger of Allah and the nose of one of them became swollen because of extreme anger. The Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I know of some words that if he said them, what he feels will go away, &#8216;I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed Satan.&#8217;)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nasa&#8217;i also recorded this Hadith in his book, Al-Yawm wal-Laylah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari recorded that Sulayman bin Surad said, &#8220;Two men disputed in the presence of the Prophet while we were sitting with him. One of them was cursing the other fellow and his face turned red due to anger. The Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I know of a statement which if he said it, will make what he feels disappear, `I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed Satan.&#8217;) They said to the man, `Do you not hear what the Messenger of Allah is saying&#8217; He said, `I am not insane.&#8221;&#8217; Also, Muslim, Abu Dawud and An-Nasa&#8217;i recorded this Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many other Hadiths about seeking refuge with Allah. One can find this subject in the books on supplication and the virtues of righteous, good deeds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Tafseer Ibn Kathir &#8211; Surah 3 : Ale Imraan :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(31. Say (O Muhammad to mankind): &#8220;If you (really) love Allah, then follow me (i.e. Muhammad), Allah will love you and forgive you your sins. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;) (32. Say: &#8220;Obey Allah and the Messenger.&#8221; But if they turn away, then Allah does not like the disbelievers.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This honorable Ayah judges against those who claim to love Allah, yet do not follow the way of Muhammad . Such people are not true in their claim until they follow the Shari`ah (Law) of Muhammad and his religion in all his statements, actions and conditions. It is recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Whoever commits an act that does not conform with our matter (religion), then it will be rejected of him.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Allah said here,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say (O Muhammad to mankind): &#8220;If you (really) love Allah, then follow me, Allah will love you&#8230;&#8221;) meaning, what you will earn is much more than what you sought in loving Him, for Allah will love you. Al-Hasan Al-Basri and several scholars among the Salaf commented, &#8220;Some people claimed that they love Allah. So Allah tested them with this Ayah;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say (O Muhammad to mankind): &#8220;If you (really) love Allah, then follow me, Allah will love you&#8230;&#8221;). &#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;And forgive you your sins. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;) meaning, by your following the Messenger , you will earn all this with the blessing of his mission. Allah next commands everyone,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say: &#8220;Obey Allah and the Messenger.&#8221; But if they turn away) by defying the Prophet ,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(then Allah does not like the disbelievers.) thus, testifying that defiance of the Messenger&#8217;s way constitutes Kufr. Indeed, Allah does not like whoever does this, even if he claims that he loves Allah and seeks a means of approach to Him, unless, and until, he follows the unlettered Prophet, the Final Messenger from Allah to the two creations: mankind and the Jinn. This is the Prophet who, if the previous Prophets and mighty Messengers were to have been alive during his time, they would have no choice but to follow, obey him, and to abide by his Law.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Tafseer Ibn Kathir . The Noble Qur&#8217;an An-Nisa 4:86</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When you are greeted with a greeting, greet in return with what is better than it, or (at least) return it equally.) meaning, if the Muslim greets you with the Salam, then return the greeting with a better Salam, or at least equal to the Salam that was given. Therefore, the better Salam is recommended, while returning it equally is an obligation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Raja&#8217; Al-`Utaridi said that `Imran bin Husayn said that a man came to the Messenger of Allah and said, &#8220;As-Salamu `Alaykum&#8221;. The Prophet returned the greeting, and after the man sat down he said, &#8220;Ten.&#8221; Another man came and said, &#8220;As-Salamu `Alaykum wa Rahmatullah, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger.&#8221; The Prophet returned the greeting, and after the man sat down he said, &#8220;Twenty.&#8221; Then another man came and said, &#8220;As-Salamu `Alaykum wa Rahmatullah wa Barakatuh.&#8221; The Prophet returned the greeting, and after the man sat down he said, &#8220;Thirty.&#8221; This is the narration recorded by Abu Dawud. At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa&#8217;i and Al-Bazzar also recorded it. At-Tirmidhi said, &#8220;Hasan Gharib&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are several other Hadiths on this subject from Abu Sa`id, `Ali, and Sahl bin Hanif. When the Muslim is greeted with the full form of Salam, he is obliged to return the greeting equally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Ahl Adh-Dhimmah the Salam should not be initiated nor should the greeting be added to when returning their greeting. Rather, as recorded in the Two Sahihs their greeting is returned to them equally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Umar narrated that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When the Jews greet you, one of them would say, `As-Samu `Alayka (death be unto you).&#8217; Therefore, say, `Wa `Alayka (and the same to you).&#8217;) In his Sahih, Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Do not initiate greeting the Jews and Christians with the Salam, and when you pass by them on a road, force them to its narrowest path.) Abu Dawud recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(By He in Whose Hand is my soul! You will not enter Paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love each other. Should I direct you to an action that would direct you to love each other Spread the Salam among yourselves.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tafseer Ibn kathir</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Surah 4: Ayah 94.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O you who believe! When you go (to fight) in the cause of Allah, verify (the truth), and say not to anyone who greets you: &#8220;You are not a believer;&#8221; seeking the perishable goods of the worldly life. There is much more benefit with Allah. Even as he is now, so were you yourselves before, till Allah conferred on you His Favors, therefore, be cautious in discrimination. Allah is Ever Well-Aware of what you do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that `Ikrimah said that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;A man from Bani Sulaym, who was tending a flock of sheep, passed by some of the Companions of the Prophet and said Salam to them. They said (to each other), `He only said Salam to protect himself from us.&#8217; Then they attacked him and killed him. They brought his sheep to the Prophet , and this Ayah was revealed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O you who believe!), until the end of the Ayah.&#8221; At-Tirmidhi recorded this in his (chapter on) Tafsir, and said, &#8220;This Hadith is Hasan, and it is also reported from Usamah bin Zayd.&#8221; Al-Hakim also recorded it and said, &#8220;Its chain is Sahih, but they did not collect it.&#8221; Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas commented;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and say not to anyone who greets you: &#8220;You are not a believer;&#8221;), &#8220;A man was tending his sheep and the Muslims caught up with him. He said, `As-Salamu `Alaykum.&#8217; However, they killed him and took his sheep. Allah revealed the Ayah;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And say not to anyone who greets you: &#8220;You are not a believer; seeking the perishable goods of the worldly life).&#8221; Ibn `Abbas said; &#8220;The goods of this world were those sheep.&#8221; And he recited,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Peace) Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Qa`qa` bin Abdullah bin Abi Hadrad narrated that his father `Abdullah bin Abi Hadrad said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah sent us to (the area of) Idam. I rode out with a group of Muslims that included Abu Qatadah, Al-Harith bin Rab`i and Muhallam bin Juthamah bin Qays. We continued on until we reached the area of Idam, where `Amr bin Al-Adbat Al-Ashja`i passed by us on his camel. When he passed by us he said Salam to us, and we did not attack him. Because of some previous problems with him, Muhallam bin Juthamah killed him and took his camel. When we went back to the Messenger of Allah and told him what had happened, a part of the Qur&#8217;an was revealed about us,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O you who believe! When you go (to fight) in the cause of Allah), until,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Well-Aware).&#8221; Only Ahmad recorded this Hadith. Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that the Messenger of Allah said to Al-Miqdad,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(You killed a believing man who hid his faith with disbelieving people, after he had announced his faith to you. Remember that you used to hide your faith in Makkah before.) Al-Bukhari recorded this shorter version without a complete chain of narrators. However a longer version with a connected chain of narrators has also been recorded. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bazzar recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah sent a military expedition under the authority of Al-Miqdad bin Al-Aswad and when they reached the designated area, they found the people had dispersed. However, a man with a lot of wealth did not leave and said, `I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah.&#8217; Yet, Al-Miqdad killed him, and a man said to him, `You killed a man after he proclaimed: &#8220;There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah. By Allah I will mention what you did to the Prophet .&#8217; When they went back to the Messenger of Allah, they said, `O Messenger of Allah! Al-Miqdad killed a man who testified that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah.&#8217; He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Summon Al-Miqdad before me. O Miqdad! Did you kill a man who proclaimed, &#8220;There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah&#8221; What would you do when you face, &#8220;There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah tomorrow&#8221;) Allah then revealed;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O you who believe! When you go (to fight) in the cause of Allah, verify (the truth), and say not to anyone who greets you: &#8220;You are not a believer;&#8221; seeking the perishable goods of the worldly life. There are much more profits and booties with Allah. Even as he is now, so were you yourselves before till Allah conferred on you His Favors, therefore, be cautious in discrimination). The Messenger of Allah said to Al-Miqdad,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He was a believing man who hid his faith among disbelieving people, and he announced his faith to you, but you killed him, although you used to hide your faith before, in Makkah.)&#8221; Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(There is much more benefit with Allah.) means, better than what you desired of worldly possessions which made you kill the one who greeted you with the Salam and pronounced his faith to you. Yet, you ignored all this and accused him of hypocrisy, to acquire the gains of this life. However, the pure wealth with Allah is far better than what you acquired. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(so were you yourselves before, till Allah conferred on you His Favors.) means, beforehand, you used to be in the same situation like this person who hid his faith from his people. We mentioned the relevant Hadiths above. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And remember when you were few and were reckoned weak in the land). `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Sa`id bin Jubayr commented about Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(so were you yourselves before), &#8220;You used to hide your faith, just as this shepherd hid his faith.&#8221; Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(therefore, be cautious in discrimination), then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah is Ever Well-Aware of what you do.) and this part of the Ayah contains a threat and a warning, as Sa`id bin Jubayr stated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whosoever Ya`shu (turns away blindly) from the remembrance of the Most Gracious, We appoint for him Shaytan to be a Qarin (a companion) to him. And verily, they hinder them from the path, but they think that they are guided aright!. Till, when (such a one) comes to Us, he says, &#8220;Would that between me and you were the distance of the two easts (or the east and west) a worst companion (indeed)!&#8221;</strong></span> (Surah Zukhruf 43:36-38)</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(And whosoever Ya`shu (turns away blindly))</strong></span> means, whoever willfully ignores and turns away</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(from the remembrance of the Most Gracious,)</strong></span> Al-`Asha (the root of Ya`sh) refers to weakness of vision; what is meant here is weakness of insight.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">(We appoint for him Shaytan to be a Qarin (a companion) to him.)</span></strong> This is like the Ayat:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#339966;">(And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him)</span> (4:115),</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#339966;">(So when they turned away, Allah turned their hearts away)</span> (61:5), and</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#339966;">(And We have assigned for them intimate companions, who have made fair seeming to them, what was before them and what was behind them)</span> (41:25). Allah says here:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">(And verily, they hinder them from the path, but they think that they are guided aright! Until, when he comes to Us,)</span></strong> meaning, for this person who willfully neglects true guidance, We send to him a Shaytan to lead him astray and show him the path to Hell. When he comes before Allah on the Day of Resurrection, he will complain about the Shaytan who was appointed to accompany him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">(he says, &#8220;Would that between me and you were the distance of the two easts &#8211; a worst companion (indeed)!&#8221;)</span></strong> Some of them recited it; (حَتْى إِذَا جَاءَانَا)<strong><span style="color:#000000;"> (Till, when they both come to Us.)</span></strong> referring to the companion Shaytan and the one whom he accompanies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Shaytan disowns His Followers on the Day of Resurrection</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(And Shaytan will say when the matter has been decided: &#8220;Verily, Allah promised you a promise of truth. And I too promised you, but I betrayed you. I had no authority over you except that I called you, and you responded to me. So blame me not, but blame yourselves. I cannot help you, nor can you help me. I deny your former act in associating me (Shaytan) as a partner with Allah (by obeying me in the life of the world). Verily, there is a painful torment for the wrongdoers.&#8221;)</span> (Ibrahim 14:22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah narrates to us what Iblis will say to his followers after Allah finishes with the judgement between His servants, sending the believers to the gardens of Paradise and the disbelievers to the lows (of the Fire). Iblis, may Allah curse him, will stand and address the latter, in order to add depression to their depression, sorrow to their sorrow and grief to their grief. He will declare,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Verily, Allah promised you a promise of truth.)</strong> by the words of His Messengers that if you follow them, you will gain safety and deliverance. Truly, Allah&#8217;s promise was true and correct news, while I promised you then betrayed you.&#8217; Allah said in another Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(He (Shaytan) makes promises to them, and arouses in them false desires; and Shaytan&#8217;s promises are nothing but deceptions.)</strong> (4:120)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(I had no authority over you)</strong> Shaytan will say, `I had no proof for what I called you to, nor evidence for what I promised you,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(except that I called you, and you responded to me.)</strong> even though the Messengers establish the proof and unequivocal evidences against you and affirmed the truth of what they were sent to you with. But you disobeyed the Messengers and ended up earning this fate,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(So blame me not,)</strong> today,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(but blame yourselves.)</strong>, because it is your fault for defying the proofs and following me in the falsehood that I called you to.&#8217; Shaytan will say next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(I cannot help you)</strong>, I cannot benefit, save, or deliver you from what you are suffering,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(nor can you help me.)</strong>, nor can you save me and deliver me from the torment and punishment I am suffering,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(I deny your former act of associating me (Shaytan) as a partner with Allah.)</strong> or because you associated me with Allah before,&#8217; according to Qatadah. Ibn Jarir commented; &#8220;I deny being a partner with Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored.&#8221; This opinion is the most plausible, for Allah said in other Ayat,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And who is more astray than one who calls on others besides Allah, such as will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls to them And when mankind are gathered, they will become their enemies and will deny their worshipping.)</strong> (46:5-6) and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Nay, but they (the so-called gods) will deny their worship of them, and become opponents to them.)</strong>(19:82) Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>(Verily, the wrongdoers)</strong></span>, who deviate from truth and follow falsehood, will earn a painful torment. It appears that this part of the Ayah narrates the speech that Shaytan will deliver to the people of the Fire after they enter it, as we stated. `Amir Ash-Sha`bi said, &#8220;On the Day of Resurrection, two speakers will address the people. Allah the Exalted will say to `Isa, son of Maryam,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>(Did you say unto men: &#8220;Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allah&#8221;)</strong></span> (5:116) until,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>(Allah will say: &#8220;This is a Day on which the truthful will profit from their truth.&#8221;)</strong></span>(5:119) Shaytan, may Allah curse him, will stand and address the people,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#333333;"><strong>I had no authority over you except that I called you, and you responded to me</strong></span>.) Allah next mentioned the final destination of the miserable ones, who earned the disgrace and torment and having to listen to Shaytan address them, then He mentioned the final destination of the happy ones.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"> <strong>الرَّبّ</strong>  <strong><em>Ar-Rabb</em></strong> (the Lord and Nurturer) the Lord and Master who has none like Him in His Lordship, the One Who nurtures and rectifies the affairs of the creation by the favours which He showers upon them, the Sovereign Owner Who alone creates and commands, the One Who controls the affairs and grants blessings, the One Who nurtures, the Creator, the Provider, the One Who aids and the One Who guides.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Meaning of <em>Ar-Rabb</em>, the Lord</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Ar-Rabb</em> is the owner who has full authority over his property. <em>Ar-Rabb</em>, linguistically means, the master or the one who has the authority to lead. All of these meanings are correct for Allah. When it is alone, the word <em>Rabb</em> is used only for Allah. As for other than Allah, it can be used to say <em>Rabb Ad-Dar</em>, the master of such and such object. Further, it was reported that <em>Ar-Rabb</em> is Allah&#8217;s Greatest Name.</p>
<p><strong>Source</strong> : <em>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</em>, <em>Surah Fathiha</em>, Dar-us-salam English publication</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211;</p>
<p>Shaikh Saalih ibn Saalih al-Fawzaan <em>haafidhahullaah said in Sharh Usool-ith-Thalaathah:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And Ar-Rabb (the Lord) is the One Who is worshipped</strong></span>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اعْبُدُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الْأَرْضَ فِرَاشًا وَالسَّمَاءَ بِنَاءً وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً فَأَخْرَجَ بِهِ مِنَ الثَّمَرَاتِ رِزْقًا لَّكُمْ ۖ فَلَا تَجْعَلُوا لِلَّهِ أَندَادًا وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O mankind, single out your Lord with all worship, He Who created you and those who came before you so that you may be dutiful to Him, seeking to avoid His anger and His punishment. He Who made the earth a resting place for you and the sky a canopy, and He sent down from the clouds rain, and He brought out with it crops and fruits from the earth as provision for you, so do not set up rivals for Allaah whilst you know that you have no Lord besides Him</span></strong></span>. [2:21-22] (#9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[#9]: His saying, “<strong>And <em>Ar-Rabb</em> (the Lord) is the One Who is worshipped</strong>”: meaning, He is the One Who deserves to be worshipped, as for other than Him, then it does not deserve worship, because it is not a Lord. This is the intent of the speech of the Shaikh rahimahullaah in his saying, “<em>Ar-Rabb</em> (the Lord) is the One Who is worshipped”, meaning He is the One Who deserves worship. Then also it is not sufficient that a person just affirms <em>Ar-Ruboobiyyah</em> (Lordship), rather he must affirm <em>Al-‘Uboodiyyah</em> (Allaah’s deserving all worship), He the Perfect and Most High, and he must carry it out making it purely and sincerely for Him, the Perfect and Most High. So since he has affirmed that He is <em>Ar-Rabb</em> (the Lord) then it is binding upon him to affirm that he is <em>Al-Ma‘bood</em> (the One Who therefore deserves to be worshipped), and that others besides Him do not deserve anything from worship.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(V.1:2) <strong>Lord</strong>: The actual word used in the Qur&#8217;ân is <em>Rabb</em>. There is no proper equivalent for <em>Rabb</em> in the English language. It means the One and the Only Lord for all the universe, its Creator, Owner, Organizer, Provider, Master, Planner, Sustainer, Cherisher, and Giver of security. <em>Rabb</em> is also one of the Names of Allâh.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">We know that Ad-Dahr (time) is not one of the Names of Allaah</span>, for it does not possess a meaning that reaches the highest extent of goodness. As for the Prophet&#8217;s (saws) statement: &#8220;Do not curse time, for indeed, Allaah is Ad-Dahr (time)&#8221;,[2] then its meaning is that He is the &#8220;Owner of time &#8211; the One who dispenses it&#8221;. This change occurs based on the evidence found in his (saws) statement in the second narration (of this hadeeth) in which Allaah said: &#8220;In My hand is the Command. I turn (in cycles) the night and the day.&#8221; [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:<br />
[2] Saheeh Muslim: Book of Words from Good Manners (no. 2246) from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah. Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr said in Al-Fath (10/565): &#8220;Ahmad has transmitted it from another path from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah with the wording: &#8216;Do not curse time, for indeed Allaah has stated: &#8216;I am Ad-Dahr (Time). The days and the nights belong to Me. I will renew them, vanquish them and bring forth kings after kings.&#8217; And its chain of narration is authentic.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A Point of Benefit</strong>:<br />
The great scholar Ibn Al-Qayyim said in Zaad Al-Ma&#8217;aad (2/355): &#8220;Anyone that curses time is lingering between two states of which there is no doubt that he is from one of them. Either he has cursed Allaah Himself or he has ascribed a partner to him (Shirk). For indeed, if he believes that Allaah is the only one that did that and he curses whomsoever did it, then he has cursed Allaah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: Book of Tawheed (no. 7491) and Saheeh Muslim: Book of Words from Good Manners (no. 2246) from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: What is the ruling on abusing time (ad-Dahr)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: ad-Dahr (Time) is a subjugated form of creation from Allah’s many creations. It is not permissible to abuse it. It has been established in the Saheeh that the Messenger of Allah (peace &amp; blessings of Allah be upon him) said: {Indeed Allah says, “The son of Adam harms Me when he abuses ad-Dahr (Time), and I am ad-Dahr (Time), I turn the night and the day, by My hand I control every thing.”} Thus regarding ad-Dahr (Time) there is nothing that is in His Hand in which He created ad-Dahr in addition to creating the universe to be confined to ad-Dahr. So the meaning of Allah is ad-Dahr is that He created ad-Dahr and the entire universe is confined to ad-Dahr and Allah knows best.</p>

They said, &#8220;<span style="color:#993300;">During the time of Jahiliyyah, when an affliction, a calamity or a disaster struck them, the Arabs used to say, `Woe to Ad-Dahr (time)!&#8217; So they used to blame such incidents on Ad-Dahr, cursing Ad-Dahr in the process. Surely, it is Allah the Exalted and Most Honored Who causes these (and all) things to happen. This is why when they cursed Ad-Dahr, it was as if they were cursing Allah Himself, since truthfully, He causes all incidents to happen. Therefore, abusing Ad-Dahr was prohibited due to this consideration, for it was Allah Whom they meant by abusing Ad-Dahr, which &#8212; as we said&#8211; they accused of causing (distressful) incidents</span>.&#8221; This is the best explanation for this subject, and it is the desired meaning. Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We should mention that Ibn Hazm and those of the Zahiriyyah like him made an error when they used this Hadith to include Ad-Dahr among Allah&#8217;s most beautiful Names.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah informs about the Jinns when He sent His Messenger Muhammad and revealed the Qur&#8217;an to him. Among the ways He protected it (the Qur&#8217;an) was by filling sky with stern guards guarding it from all of its sides. The devils were then expelled from the places where they used to sit prior to that. This was so that they could not steal anything from the Qur&#8217;an and tell it to the soothsayers, thereby causing matters to be confused and mixed up. If this happened it would not be known who was being truthful. Allah did this out of His kindness to His creation, His mercy upon His servants and His protection of His Mighty Book (the Qur&#8217;an).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the Jinns said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#339966;">And we have sought to reach the heaven; but found it filled with stern guards and flaming fires. And verily, we used to sit there in stations, to (steal) a hearing, but any who listens now will find a flaming fire watching him in ambush</span>.) meaning, whoever would like to steal some information by listening, he will find a flaming fire waiting in ambush for him. It will not pass him or miss him, but it will wipe him out and destroy him completely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#339966;">And we know not whether evil is intended for those on earth, or whether their Lord intends for them guidance</span>.) meaning, `we do not know if this &#8212; the matter which has occurred in the sky &#8212; is intended for those who are in the earth or if their Lord intends some guidance for them.&#8217; They stated this in such a manner out of their etiquette in phrasing their speech, because they did not attribute the doing of evil to anyone and they attributed the good to Allah. Verily, it has been recorded in the Sahih,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#339966;">And evil is not attributed to You (Allah)</span>.) It used to be that shooting stars (meteors) occurred before this, however it did not happen much, rather only occasionally. As was reported in the Hadith of Ibn `Abbas when he said, &#8220;While we were sitting with the Messenger of Allah a shooting star flashed in the sky. So the Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;">(What did you all used to say about this)</span> We replied, &#8220;We used to say that a great person has been born and a great person has died.&#8221; The Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;">(This is not so, rather whenever Allah decrees a matter in the heaven&#8230;)&#8217;</span>&#8216; and then he went on to narrate the rest of the Hadith which we have already mentioned in its entirety in Surah Saba&#8217;. This is what caused them to seek the reason for this occurrence. So they set out searching in the east and the west. Then they found the Messenger of Allah reciting (the Qur&#8217;an) while leading his Companions in prayer. Thus, they knew that this Qur&#8217;an was the reason for the sky being guarded. Therefore, some among them believed in it and the others became more rebellious in their transgression. A discussion of this has preceded in a Hadith of Ibn `Abbas concerning Allah&#8217;s statement in Surat Al-Ahqaf,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;">(And (remember) when We sent towards you (Muhammad) a group of the Jinn (quietly) listening to the Qur&#8217;an.) (46:29)</span> There is no doubt that when so many shooting stars began appearing in the sky, it horrified humans and Jinns alike. They were very disturbed and alarmed by it. They thought that it was the destruction of the world. As-Suddi said, &#8220;The sky was never guarded except if there was a Prophet in the earth or the religion of Allah was victorious and dominant in the earth.&#8221; So the devils before the time of Muhammad had taken sitting stations for themselves in the heaven of this world and they would listen to the matters that occurred in the heaven. But when Allah sent Muhammad as a Prophet and Messenger, they were suddenly pelted one night (with the flaming, shooting stars).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the people of Ta&#8217;if were frightened because of this and they began to say, `The dwellers of the sky have been destroyed.&#8217; This was because they saw the severe fires in the sky and the shooting flames. They began freeing their servants and abandoning their luxuries. So `Abd Yalayl bin `Amr bin `Umayr said to them and he was referred to for judgement among them &#8220;Woe to you O people of Ta&#8217;if! Hold on to your wealth and look at these guiding stars in the sky.If you see them remaining in their place, then the dwellers of the sky have not been destroyed, rather this has happened because of Ibn Abi Kabshah (&#8211; meaning Muhammad ). And if you look and see that you can no longer see these stars, then verily the dwellers of the sky have been destroyed.&#8221; So, they looked and saw that the stars still remained, and thus, they kept their wealth. The devils also were frightened during that night. They went to Iblis and informed him of what happened to them. So he (Iblis) said, &#8220;Bring me a handful of dirt from every land so that I may smell it.&#8221; So they brought it and he smelled it and said, &#8220;It is your friend in Makkah.&#8221; Then he sent a group of seven Jinns to Makkah, and they found the Prophet of Allah standing in prayer in Al-Masjid Al-Haram while reciting the Qur&#8217;an. They drew near to him eager to hear the Qur&#8217;an, until their chests almost pressed against him. Then they accepted Islam and Allah revealed their matter to His Messenger . We have mentioned this chapter in its entirety in the first section of the Kitab As-Sirah with lengthy discussion. Allah knows best and unto Him is all praise and blessings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the males among the Jinn, but they increased them in Rahaq</span>.</strong>) (27:7) meaning,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`we (Jinn) used to think that we had some virtuous status over mankind because they used to seek refuge with us whenever they (men) would settle in a valley or any place in the wilderness, the open country steppes and other places.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the custom of the Arabs in the pre-Islamic days of ignorance. They used to seek refuge with the greatest Jinn of a particular place so that no harm or evil would afflict them. Like one would do if he entered into the land of his enemies, in the vicinity of a great and powerful man, he would seek the protection and guardianship of that man. So when the Jinns saw that the humans were seeking refuge with them due to their fear of them, they increased them in Rahaq which means fear, terror and fright. They did this so that the people would be more afraid of them and seek refuge with them even more. As Qatadah said concerning this Ayah, (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">but they increased them in Rahaq</span></strong>.) means, &#8220;the Jinns were courageous and increased in insolence against them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As-Suddi</strong> said, &#8220;A man used to set out with his family (on a journey) until he came to a piece of land where he would settle. Then he would say, `I seek refuge with the master (Jinn) of this valley from the Jinns, or that myself, my wealth, my child or my animals are harmed in it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Qatadah</strong> said, &#8220;When they sought refuge with them instead of Allah, the Jinns would overcome them with harm because of that.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from `<strong>Ikrimah</strong> that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Jinns used to fear humans just like humans fear them, or even worse. So whenever humans would come to a valley the Jinns would flee. So the leader of the people would say, `We seek refuge with the leader of the inhabitants of this valley.&#8217; So the Jinns said, `We see these people fleeing from us just like we flee from them.&#8217; Thus, the Jinns started coming near the humans and afflicting them with insanity and madness.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, Allah said, (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the males among the Jinn, but they increased them in Rahaq</span></strong>.) meaning, in sin. Abu `Aliyah, Ar-Rabi` and Zayd bin Aslam, all said, (in Rahaq) &#8220;This means in fear.&#8221; Mujahid said, &#8220;The disbelievers would increase in transgression.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Go back and finish your mission, for you have not finished it.)</strong> Khalid went back and when the custodians who were also its servants of Al-`Uzza saw him, they started invoking by calling Al-`Uzza! When Khalid approached it, he found a naked woman whose hair was untidy and who was throwing sand on her head. Khalid killed her with the sword and went back to the Messenger of Allah , who said to him,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The knowledge of Ghayb is one of the attributes of Lordship, thus no one knows the Ghayb of Heaven and Earth except Allah;</p>
<p>Allah (may He be Exalted) says,</p>
<p><strong>And with Him are the keys of the Ghayb (all that is hidden), none knows them but He</strong>.  (Surah Al-An`am, 6: 59)</p>
<p>He (Great is His Majesty) also says,</p>
<p><strong>Say: “None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghayb (Unseen) except Allâh”</strong> (Surah Al-Naml, 27: 65)</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The below is taken from Tafseer Ibn Kathir:</span><br />
</strong><span style="color:#999999;">[from dar-us-salam english publication]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(14. Then when We decreed death for him, nothing informed them (Jinn) of his death except a little worm of the earth which kept (slowly) gnawing away at his stick. So when he fell down, the Jinn saw clearly that if they had known the Unseen, they would not have stayed in the humiliating torment.) </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">[Noble Qur&#8217;an &#8211; Soorah Saba 34:14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah tells us how Sulayman, peace be upon him, died and how Allah concealed his death from the Jinn who were subjugated to him to do hard labor. He remained leaning on his stick, which was his staff, as Ibn `Abbas may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and others said. He stayed like that for a long time, nearly a year. When a creature of the earth, which was a kind of worm, ate through the stick, it became weak and fell to the ground. Then it became apparent that he had died a long time before. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">It also became clear to Jinn and men alike that the Jinn do not know the Unseen as they (the Jinn) used to imagine and tried to deceive people</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(nothing informed them (Jinn) of his death except a little worm of the earth which kept (slowly) gnawing away at his stick. So when he fell down, the Jinn saw clearly that if they had known the Unseen, they would not have stayed in the humiliating torment.)</strong> meaning, it became clear to the people that they (the Jinn) were lying.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">And (remember) when Shaytan made their (evil) deeds seem fair to them and said, &#8220;<strong>No one of mankind can overcome you this day (of the battle of Badr) and verily, I am your neighbor (for each and every help)</strong>.&#8221; But when the two forces came in sight of each other, he ran away and said &#8220;<strong>Verily, I have nothing to do with you. Verily, I see what you see not. Verily, I fear Allah for Allah is severe in punishment.</strong>&#8221;) [Soorah al-Anfal (8): 48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And (remember) when Shaytan made their (evil) deeds seem fair to them and said, &#8220;No one of mankind can overcome you today and verily, I am your neighbor.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaytan, may Allah curse him, made the idolators&#8217; purpose for marching seem fair to them. He made them think that no other people could defeat them that day. He also ruled out the possibility that their enemies, the tribe of Bani Bakr, would attack Makkah, saying, &#8220;I am your neighbor.&#8221; Shaytan appeared to them in the shape of Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju`shum, the chief of Bani Mudlij, so that, as Allah described them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He﴿ Shaytan ﴾ makes promises to them, and arouses in them false desires; and Shaytan&#8217;s promises are nothing but deceptions) (4:120).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jurayj said that Ibn `Abbas commented on this Ayah, (8:48)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;On the day of Badr, Shaytan, as well as, his flag holder and soldiers, accompanied the idolators. He whispered to the hearts of the idolators, `None can defeat you today! I am your neighbor.&#8217; When they met the Muslims and Shaytan witnessed the angels coming to their aid, (he ran away), he went away in flight while proclaiming, (Verily, I see what you see not.)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali bin Abi Talhah said, that Ibn `Abbas said about this Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;No one of mankind can overcome you today and verily, I am your neighbor&#8217;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>&#8220;Shaytan, as well as, his devil army and flag holders, came on the day of Badr in the shape of a Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju`shum, man from Bani Mudlij, Shaytan said to idolators, `None will defeat you this day, and I will help you.&#8217; When the two armies stood face to face, the Messenger of Allah took a handful of sand and threw it at the faces of the idolators, causing them to retreat. Jibril, peace be upon him, came towards Shaytan, but when Shaytan, while holding the hand of a Mushrik man, saw him, he withdrew his hand and ran away with his soldiers. That man asked him, `O Suraqah! You claimed that you are our neighbor&#8217; He said, (Verily, I see what you see not. Verily, I fear Allah for Allah is severe in punishment) Shaytan said this when he saw the angels.&#8221;</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Katheer – Allaah have mercy upon him – reports the following incident in his tafseer of <strong>Surah Al-Jinn, verse 11</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad b. Sulaymaan al-Najjaad said in his Amaalee: … Abu Mu’aawiyah said, I heard Al-A’mash say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“ ‘A jinni once came to us and I asked him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">what is the favorite food amongst you?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied, ‘Rice.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we gave some to them and I saw handfuls of rice being lifted and I couldn’t see anyone [picking them up].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked, ‘Do these false desires (bid’ah) that are amongst us exist amongst you?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied, ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘How are the Raafidah amongst you?’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘The worst of us.’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer said, ‘I presented this chain of narration to our Shaykh, Al-Haafidh Abu Al-Hajjaaj Al-Mizzee and he said, ‘This chain of narration is saheeh all the way to Al-A’mash.’’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahya was commanded by Allaah with Tawheed, singling out Allaah with all worship, without ascribing partners to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imam Ahmad</strong> narrated that Al-Harith Al-Ash&#8217;ari said that the Prophet of Allaah <em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah commanded Yahya bin [son of] Zakariya to implement <strong>five commands</strong> and to order the Children of Israel to implement them, but Yahya was slow in carrying out these commands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Isa (Jesus, son of Mary) said to Yahya, &#8216;<em>You were ordered to implement five commands and to order the Children of Israel to implement them. So either order, or I will do it</em>.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahya said, &#8216;<em>My brother! I fear that if you do it before me, I will be punished or the earth will be shaken under my feet</em>.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, Yahya bin Zakariya called the Children of Israel to <em><strong>Bayt Al-Maqdis</strong></em> (Jerusalem), until they filled the Masjid. He sat on the balcony, thanked Allaah and praised him and then said, &#8216;A<em>llaah ordered me to implement five commandments and that I should order you to adhere to them</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">The first</span></strong> is that you <strong>worship Allaah alone</strong> and not associate any with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The example of this command is the example of a man who bought a servant from his money with paper or gold. The servant started to work for the master, but was paying the profits to another person. Who among you would like his servant to do that? Allaah created you and sustains you. Therefore, worship Him alone and do not associate anything with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also command you to <strong>pray</strong>, for Allaah directs His Face towards His servant&#8217;s face, as long as the servant does not turn away. So when you pray, do not turn your heads to and fro.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also command you to <strong>fast</strong>. The example of it is the example of a man in a group of men and he has some musk wrapped in a piece of cloth, and consequently, all of the group smells the scent of the wrapped musk. Verily, the odor of the mouth of a fasting person is better before Allaah than the scent of musk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also command you to give <strong>charity</strong>. The example of this is the example of a man who was captured by the enemy. They tied his hands to his neck and brought him forth to cut off his neck. He said to them, &#8216;Can I pay a ransom for myself?&#8217; He kept ransoming himself with small and large amounts until he liberated himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I also command you to always remember Allaah. The example of this deed is that of a man who the enemy is tirelessly pursuing. He takes refuge in a fortified fort. When the servant remembers Allaah, he will be resorting to the best refuge from Satan.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says in Surah Al-A&#8217;raf,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(201. Verily, those who have Taqwa, when an evil thought comes to them from Shaytan, they remember (Allah), and (indeed) they then see (aright).)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(202. But (as for) their brothers (the devils&#8217; brothers) they (the devils) plunge them deeper into error, and they never stop short.)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#000000;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Allah mentions His servants who have <span style="color:#800080;text-decoration:underline;">Taqwa</span>, obeying His orders, and avoid what He forbade</strong></span></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">(when comes to them)</span> an evil thought, or anger, or the whispers of Shaytan cross their mind, or intend to err, or commit an error,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">(they remember)</span> Allah&#8217;s punishment, as well as, His tremendous reward. They remember Allah&#8217;s promises and threats, then repent, go back to Him, seek refuge with Him and ask for forgiveness before death,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">(and (indeed) they then see (aright))</span> they become aright and aware of the error of their ways.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allah said next,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">(But (as for) their brothers they plunge them deeper)</span> in reference to the devils&#8217; brothers among mankind. Allah said in another Ayah, (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Verily, the spendthrifts are brothers of the Shayatin</strong></span>) (17:27) for they are followers of the Shayatin, who listen to them and obey their orders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">(They plunge them deeper into error)</span> the devils help them commit sins, making this path easy and appealing to them</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">(and they never stop short)</span> for the devils never cease inciting mankind to commit errors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">(But (as for) their brothers they plunge them deeper into error, and they never stop short.)</span> &#8220;Neither mankind stop short of the evil that they are doing nor the devils stop short of luring them. &#8221; Therefore,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">(they never stop short)</span> refers to the devils getting tired or stopping their whispering.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allah said in another Ayah,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>See you not that We have sent Shayatin against the disbelievers to push them to do evil</strong></span>) (19:83) persistently luring the disbelievers to commit evil, according to Ibn `Abbas and others.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><br />
</strong>Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, &#8220;When this Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[مَّن ذَا الَّذِى يُقْرِضُ اللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا فَيُضَاعِفَهُ لَهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#008000;"><em>Who is he that will lend Allah handsome loan: then (Allah) will increase it manifold to his credit (in repaying),</em></span>) was revealed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Ad-Dahdah Al-Ansari said, `<strong>O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! Does Allah ask us for a loan</strong>&#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«نَعَمْ، يَاأَبَا الدَّحْدَاح» (<strong>Yes, O Abu Ad-Dahdah.</strong>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, `Give me your hand, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger,&#8217; and the Prophet placed his hand in his hand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Ad-Dahdah said, `<strong>Verily, I have given my garden as a loan to my Lord.&#8217; He had a garden that contained six hundred date trees; his wife and children were living in that garden too.</strong> Abu Ad-Dahdah went to his wife and called her, `Umm Ad-Dahdah!&#8217; She said, `Here I am.&#8217; He said, <strong>`Leave the garden, because I have given it as a loan to my Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored.&#8217;</strong> She said, <strong>`<span style="color:#008000;">That is a successful trade, O Abu Ad-Dahdah!</span>&#8216;</strong> She then transferred her goods and children. The Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«كَمْ مِنْ عَذْقٍ رَدَاحٍ فِي الْجَنَّةِ لِأَبِي الدَّحْدَاح»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>(How plentiful are the sweet date clusters that Abu Ad-Dahdah has in Paradise!)&#8221;</em></span> In another narration, the Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«رُبَّ نَخْلَةٍ مُدَلَّاةٍ، عُرُوقُهَا دُرٌّ وَيَاقُوتٌ، لِأَبِي الدَّحْدَاحِ فِي الْجَنَّة»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>(How many a date tree that has lowered down its clusters, which are full of pearls and gems in Paradise for Abu Ad-Dahdah!)</em></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Source : Tafseer Ibn Kathir of Surah Al-Kahf</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> And never say of anything, &#8220;I shall do such and such thing tomorrow.&#8221; Except (with the saying), &#8220;If Allah wills!&#8221; And remember your Lord when you forget and say: &#8220;It may be that my Lord guides me to a nearer way of truth than this.&#8221;</span> &#8211; Surah Kahf: (23, 24 ayah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) declared Allah&#8217;s Oneness and proclaimed to be the Messenger of Allah (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) and revelation of Divine Message, the disbeliveers of Makkah sent some men to Jewish rabbis in al-Medina and said: &#8220;Ask them (the rabbis) about Muhammad (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam), and describe him to them, and tell them what he is saying.They are the people of the first Book, and they have more knowledge of the Prophets than we do.&#8217; So they set out for al-Medina, they asked the Jewish rabbis about the Messenger of Allah (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam). They described him to them and told them some of his teachings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The rabbis said: &#8216;Ask him about three things which we will tell you to ask, if he answers them then he is a Prophet who has been sent (by Allah); if he does not, then he is saying things that are not true, in which case how you will deal with him will be up to you. Ask him about some young men in ancient times, what was their story? For there is a strange and wondrous tale. Ask him about a man who traveled a great deal and reached the east and the west of the earth. What was his story? And ask him about he Ruh (soul or spirit) what is it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he tells you about these things, then he is a Prophet, so follow him, but if he does not tell you, then he is a man who is making things up, so deal with him as you see fit.&#8217; So, the men came back to Makkah and said: &#8216;O people! We have come to you with a decisive solution which will put an end to the problem between you and Muhammad (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam). The Jewish rabbis told us to ask him about some matters,&#8217; and they told them what they were. Then they came to the Messenger of Allah (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) and said: &#8216;O Muhammad (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) tell us,&#8217; and they asked him about the things they had been told to ask.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) said: &#8220;I will tell you tomorrow about what you have asked me.&#8221; But he (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) did not say, &#8216;If Allah Wills.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah Messenger (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) never spoke anything except with revelation. So, he waited for the revelation from Allah but fifteen days passed away without any revelation concerning those matter which the disbelievers asked, neither did Jibreel (alaihis-salaam) come to him. The people of Makkah started to doubt him and said: &#8216;Muhammad (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) promised to tell us the next day and now fifteen days have gone by and he has not told us anything in response to the questions we asked.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) felt sad because of the delay in revelation and was grieved by what the people of Makkah were saying about him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Jibreel (alaihis-salaam) came with the revelation of Soorah al-Kahf, which contained answers to the questions and also the above mentioned verse explaining the correct etiquette when determining to do something in the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Determining to do something in the future should always be attributed to the Will of Allah, Who is the Knower of the Unseen and Who Alone Knows what was and what is yet to happen and what is not to be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in Saheeh al-Bukharee from Abu Hurayrah (radhiyallahu anhu), who said: &#8220;The Messenger of Allah (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) said: &#8220;<strong>Sulaiman Ibn Dawood (alaihimus-salaam)</strong> said: &#8216;Tonight I will go around to all my seventy wives (according to some reports it is ninety or one hundred wives) so that each one of them will give birth to a son who will fight for the sake of Allah.&#8217; It was said to him, (according to one narration, an Angel said to him), say, &#8216;If Allah Wills.&#8217; But he did not say it. He went around to the women but none of them gave birth except for one, who gave birth to a half-formed child.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) said: &#8220;By the One, in Whose Hands is my soul, had he said, &#8216;If Allah wills,&#8217; he would not have broken his oath, and that would have helped him to attain what he wanted.&#8221; [Saheeh Muslim (vol. 3, no. 1275)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if one determines to do something in the future or even takes an oath, he should say, &#8216;If Allah Wills&#8217; or &#8216;Insha&#8217;Allah.&#8217; If one forgets to say &#8220;Insha&#8217;Allah&#8221; then he should say when he remembers it even if it is a year later, as Ibn Abbas (radhiallahu anhu) explained.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Suddi narrated through Abu Saalih and Abu Maalik from Ibn ‘Abbaas and Ibn Mas’ud, and also from some other Companions who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Iblis </em>(Satan) was expelled from Paradise and Adaam was made to dwell in it. He wandered through it alone as he had no partner in whom he could seek his comfort. However, once he slept and when he woke up, he found a woman sitting near his head, whom Allaah had created from his rib. Adam asked her: “<em>What are you?</em>” She replied: “<em>A woman.</em>” He asked her again: “<em>What are you created for?</em>” She answered: “<em>So you could seek comfort in me.</em>” Angels who were well aware of the extent of the knowledge of Adam asked: “<em>What is her name O Adaam?</em>” He said: “Eve (<em>Hawwa</em>).” They asked him: “<em>Why is it Hawwa?</em>” Adam replied: “<em>Because she was created from something living.</em>“</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">[<a href="http://wp.me/p2sNCV-1O5" target="_blank"><strong>Click here to Watch the Video</strong></a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What Yahya (Peace be upon him) was truly commanded with &#8211; Tawheed, of course.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad narrated that Al-Harith Al-Ash`ari said that the Prophet of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah commanded Yahya bin Zakariya to implement five commands and to order the Children of Israel to implement them, but Yahya was slow in carrying out these commands. `Isa said to Yahya, `You were ordered to implement five commands and to order the Children of Israel to implement them. So either order, or I will do it.&#8217; Yahya said, &#8216;My brother! I fear that if you do it before me, I will be punished or the earth will be shaken under my feet.&#8217; Hence, Yahya bin Zakariya called the Children of Israel to Bayt Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem), until they filled the Masjid. He sat o­n the balcony, thanked Allah and praised him and then said, `Allah ordered me to implement five commandments and that I should order you to adhere to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The first is that you worship Allah alone and not associate any with Him.</strong></span> The example of this command is the example of a man who bought a servant from his money with paper or gold. The servant started to work for the master, but was paying the profits to another person. Who among you would like his servant to do that Allah created you and sustains you. Therefore, worship Him alone and do not associate anything with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I also command you to pray</strong></span>, for Allah directs His Face towards His servant&#8217;s face, as long as the servant does not turn away. So when you pray, do not turn your heads to and fro.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I also command you to fast</strong></span>. The example of it is the example of a man in a group of men and he has some musk wrapped in a piece of cloth, and consequently, all of the group smells the scent of the wrapped musk. Verily, the odor of the mouth of a fasting person is better before Allah than the scent of musk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I also command you to give charity</strong></span>. The example of this is the example of a man who was captured by the enemy. They tied his hands to his neck and brought him forth to cut off his neck. He said to them, &#8216;Can I pay a ransom for myself&#8217; He kept ransoming himself with small and large amounts until he liberated himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I also command you to always remember Allah.</strong></span> The example of this deed is that of a man who the enemy is tirelessly pursuing. He takes refuge in a fortified fort. When the servant remembers Allah, he will be resorting to the best refuge from Satan.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Harith then narrated that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And I order you with five commandments that Allah has ordered me. Stick to the Jama`ah (community of the faithful), listen and obey (your leaders) and perform Hijrah (migration) and Jihad for the sake of Allah. Whoever abandons the Jama`ah, even the distance of a hand span, will have removed the tie of Islam from his neck, unless he returns. Whoever uses the slogans of Jahiliyah (the pre-Islamic period of ignorance) he will be among those kneeling in Jahannam (Hellfire).) They said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Even if he prays and fasts&#8221; He said, (Even if he prays, fasts and claims to be Muslim. So call the Muslims with their names that Allah has called them: `The Muslims, the believing servants of Allah.&#8217;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a Hasan Hadith, and it contains the statement, &#8220;Allah has created and sustains you, so worship Him and do not associate anything with Him in worship.&#8221; This statement is relevant in the Ayat (2:21-22) we are discussing here and supports singling Allah in worship, without partners.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">Anta waliyyee fid-dunya wal-akhirati tawaffanee musliman waalhiqnee bissaliheen </span>(Yusuf, 12: 101)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This    supplication    combined    the    acknowledgment    of monotheism, submission to Allah, showing one&#8217;s need for Him, being free of taking any supporters other than Him, expressing that dying while being a Muslim is the greatest aim of any servant. This entails acknowledging that we are in the hands ofAllah and not in the hands of any servant, confessing the truth of the Resurrection, and asking to join with the righteous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The below is take from Tafseer Ibn Kathir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Yusuf begs Allah to die as A Muslim</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the invocation of Yusuf, the truthful one, to his Lord the Exalted and Most Honored. He invoked Allah after His favor was complete on him by being reunited with his parents and brothers, after He had bestowed on him prophethood and kingship. He begged his Lord the Exalted and Ever High, that as He has perfected His bounty on him in this life, to continue it until the Hereafter. He begged Him that, when he dies, he dies as a Muslim, as Ad-Dahhak said, and to join him with the ranks of the righteous, with his brethren the Prophets and Messengers, may Allah&#8217;s peace and blessings be on them all. It is possible that Yusuf, peace be upon him, said this supplication while dying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">In the Two Sahihs it is recorded that `A&#8217;ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said that while dying, the Messenger of Allah was raising his finger and said &#8211; thrice, ثَلَاثًا (<strong>O Allah to Ar-Rafiq Al-A`la</strong> ﴿the uppermost, highest company in heaven﴾.)</span> It is also possible that long before he died, Yusuf begged Allah to die as a Muslim and be joined with the ranks of the righteous.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">We go through our entire lives looking for that perfect investment; whether it be our education, our jobs or our wealth. We put in so much time to gather information and to make sure that our investment will yield a satisfying return. In the end though, there is no certainty of the return on investment that we will gain, it could be 5%, 10%, or even -10%. We never know whether we will gain or lose from the investment that we make.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there is an alternative. The alternative is investing in the deen of Allah. In this investment, you will never lose, and that is the promise of Allah . As we all know, Allah is the one who never breaks any promise and He is The One and Only that we can count on. So, when He promises something, you can consider it a done deal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Who is he that will loan to Allah a beautiful loan, which Allah will double unto his credit and multiply many times? It is Allah that gives (you) Want or plenty, and to Him shall be your return&#8221;. </span></strong>&#8211; [Surah Baqarah, 2:245]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Tafsir Ibn Kathir on the above ayah:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said:<br />
(Who is he that will lend to Allah a goodly loan so that He may multiply it to him many times)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this Ayah, Allah encourages His servants to spend in His cause. Allah mentioned this same Ayah in several other parts of His Glorious Qur&#8217;an. The Hadith that mentions that Allah descends (every night down on the nearest heaven to us when the last third of the night remains) states that Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Who would give a loan to He Who is neither poor nor unjust.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement:<br />
(He may multiply it to him many times), is similar to His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(The likeness of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah, is as the likeness of a grain (of corn); it grows seven ears, and each ear has a hundred grains. Allah gives manifold increase to whom He wills.)</span> </strong>(2:261)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We will mention this Ayah later on. Allah then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And it is Allah that decreases or increases (your provisions), ) meaning, `Spend (in Allah&#8217;s cause) and do not be anxious.&#8217; Certainly, Allah is the Sustainer Who increases or decreases the provisions to whomever He wills among His servants. Allah&#8217;s wisdom is perfect, and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and unto Him you shall return.) on the Day of Resurrection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Surah No.41 :(Fussilat)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(49. Man does not get tired of asking for good; but if an evil touches him, then he gives up all hope and is lost in despair.) (50. And truly, if We give him a taste of mercy from Us, after some adversity has touched him, he is sure to say: &#8220;This is due to my (merit); I think not that the Hour will be established. But if I am brought back to my Lord, surely there will be for me the best with Him. &#8220;Then, We verily will show to the disbelievers what they have done, and We shall make them taste a severe torment.) (51. And when We show favor to man, he turns away and becomes arrogant; but when evil touches him, then he has recourse to long supplications.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah tells us that man never gets bored of asking his Lord for good things, such as wealth, physical health, etc., but if evil touches him &#8212; i.e., trials and difficulties or poverty &#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(then he gives up all hope and is lost in despair.), i.e., he thinks that he will never experience anything good again.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And truly, if We give him a taste of mercy from Us, after some adversity has touched him, he is sure to say: &#8220;This is due to my (merit)&#8230;&#8221;) means, if something good happens to him or some provision comes to him after a period of difficulty, he says, `this is because of me, because I deserve this from my Lord.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I think not that the Hour will be established.) means, he does not believe that the Hour will come. So when he is given some blessing, he becomes careless, arrogant and ungrateful, as Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay! Verily, man does transgress. Because he considers himself self-sufficient.) (96:6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(But if I am brought back to my Lord, surely there will be for me the best with Him.) means, `if there is a Hereafter after all, then my Lord will be generous and kind to me just as He was in this world.&#8217; So he expects Allah to do him favors in spite of his bad deeds and lack of certain faith. Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then, We verily will show to the disbelievers what they have done, and We shall make them taste a severe torment.) Thus Allah threatens punishment and vengeance to those whose conduct and belief is like that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And when We show favor to man, he turns away and becomes arrogant;) means, he turns away from doing acts of obedience and is too proud to obey the commands of Allah. This is like the Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(But ﴿Fir`awn﴾ turned away along with his hosts) (51:39).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(but when evil touches him,) means, difficulties,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(then he has recourse to long supplications.) means, he asks at length for one thing. Long supplications are those which are long on words and short on meaning. The opposite is concise speech which is brief but full of meaning. And Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And when harm touches man, he invokes Us, lying on his side, or sitting or standing. But when We have removed his harm from him, he passes on as if he had never invoked Us for a harm that touched him!) (10:12)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Surah As-Saffaat</strong>  &#8211; <span style="color:#008000;">(50. Then they will turn to one another, mutually questioning.) (51. A speaker of them will say: &#8220;Verily, I had a companion (in the world),&#8221;) (52. &#8220;Who used to say: `Are you among those who believe.) (53.

<p style="text-align:justify;">They mentioned the story of two men among the Children of Israel who were partners and who are included in the meaning of this Ayah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Ja`far bin Jarir recorded that Furat bin Tha`labah Al-Bahrani said concerning the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Verily, I had a companion)</span> [ 37. As-Saffaat verse 51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There were two men who were partners and had collected eight thousand Dinars. One of them had a craft and the other did not. The one who had a craft said to the other, `You do not have a craft, so I think I will divide the money with you and leave you.&#8217; So he left him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Then the first man bought a house</strong>, belonging to a king who had died, for the price of one thousand Dinars. He called his companion and showed him the house, saying, `What do you think of this house I bought it for one thousand Dinars.&#8217; He said, `How beautiful it is.&#8217; When he went out he said, `O Allah, this companion of mine has bought this house for one thousand Dinars; I ask You for one of the houses of Paradise &#8211; and he gave one thousand Dinars in charity.&#8217; Then as much time passed as Allah willed should pass.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first man married a woman</strong> with a dowry of one thousand Dinars, and invited his companion and made food for him. When he came, he said, `I have married this woman with a dowry of one thousand Dinars.&#8217; He replied; `How beautiful this is.&#8217; And when he left, he said, `O Lord, my companion has married a woman with a dowry of one thousand Dinars; I ask you for a wife from among Al-Hur Al-`Iyn&#8217; &#8212; and he gave one thousand Dinars in charity. Then as much time passed as Allah willed should pass.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Then the first man bought two gardens for two thousand Dinars</strong>, then he called his companion and showed them to him. He said, `I have bought these two gardens for two thousand Dinars.&#8217; He replied, `How beautiful this is.&#8217; When he came out, he said, `O Lord, my companion has bought two gardens for two thousand Dinars; I ask you for two gardens in Paradise&#8217; &#8212; and he gave two thousand Dinars in charity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the angel came to them and took their souls in death. He took the one who had given his money in charity and put him in a house that he liked. There, there was a woman who was so beautiful that the ground shinned under her, then he (the angel) took him to two gardens and gave him other things which are known only to Allah. The man said, `This is like a man who has such and such.&#8217; The angel said, `That is exactly what it is; this house, these gardens and this wife are all for you.&#8217; The man said, `I had a companion who used to say: Are you among those who believe&#8217; It was said to him, `He is in Hell.&#8217; He said, `Will you look down&#8217; So he looked down and saw him in the midst of Hell. At this, he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(By Allah! You have nearly ruined me. Had it not been for the grace of my Lord, I would certainly have been among those brought forth (to Hell).)&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;">(2.284. To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth, and whether you disclose what is in yourselves or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it. Then He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. And Allah is able to do all things.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah states that His is the kingship of the heavens and earth and of what and whoever is on or between them, that He has perfect watch over them. No apparent matter or secret that the heart conceals is ever a secret to Him, however minor it is. Allah also states that He will hold His servants accountable for what they do and what they conceal in their hearts. In similar statements, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say (O Muhammad ): &#8220;Whether you hide what is in your breasts or reveal it, Allah knows it, and He knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth. And Allah is able to do all things) ﴿3:29﴾, and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He knows the secret and that which is yet more hidden.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many other Ayat on this subject. In this Ayah (2:284), Allah states that He has knowledge of what the hearts conceal, and consequently, He will hold the creation accountable for whatever is in their hearts. This is why when this Ayah was revealed, it was hard on the Companions, since out of their strong faith and conviction, they were afraid that such reckoning would diminish their good deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, &#8220;When</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth, and whether you disclose what is in yourselves or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it. Then He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. And Allah is able to do all things)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">was revealed to the Messenger of Allah , it was very hard for the Companions of the Messenger . The Companions came to the Messenger and fell to their knees saying, `O Messenger of Allah! We were asked to perform what we can bear of deeds: the prayer, the fast, Jihad and charity. However, this Ayah was revealed to you, and we cannot bear it.&#8217; The Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Do you want to repeat what the People of the Two Scriptures before you said, that is, `We hear and we disobey&#8217; Rather, say, `We hear and we obey, and we seek Your forgiveness, O our Lord, and the Return is to You.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the people accepted this statement and their tongues recited it, Allah sent down afterwards,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do)the believers. Each one believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. (They say,) &#8220;We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers and they say, &#8220;We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all).&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When they did that, Allah abrogated the Ayah (2:284) and sent down the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has earned. &#8220;Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error.&#8221;) until the end.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim recorded it with the wording; &#8220;When they did that, Allah abrogated it (2:284) and sent down,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has earned. &#8220;Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error&#8221;.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said, `I shall (accept your supplication),&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;Our Lord! Lay not on us a burden like that which You did lay on those before us (Jews and Christians)&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said, `I shall (accept your supplication),&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;Our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear. &#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said, `I shall (accept your supplication),&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;Pardon us and grant us forgiveness. Have mercy on us. You are our Mawla (Supporter and Protector) and give us victory over the disbelieving people.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said, `I shall.&#8221;&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that Mujahid said, &#8220;I saw Ibn `Abbas and said to him, `O Abu Abbas! I was with Ibn `Umar, and he read this Ayah and cried.&#8217; He asked, `Which Ayah&#8217; I said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`(And whether you disclose what is in yourselves or conceal it.)&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Abbas said, `When this Ayah was revealed, it was very hard on the Companions of the Messenger of Allah and worried them tremendously. They said: O Messenger of Allah! We know that we would be punished according to our statements and our actions, but as for what occurs in our hearts, we do not control what is in them.&#8217; The Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say, `We hear and we obey.&#8217;) They said, `We hear and we obey.&#8217; Thereafter, this Ayah abrogated the previous Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allah), until,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has earned.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, they were pardoned what happens in their hearts, and were held accountable only for their actions.&#8221;&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Group recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Allah has pardoned my Ummah for what they say to themselves, as long as they do not utter it or act on it.)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Two Sahihs recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah said (to His angels), &#8220;If My servant intends to commit an evil deed, do not record it as such for him, and if he commits it, write it for him as one evil deed. If he intends to perform a good deed, but did not perform it, then write it for him as one good deed, and if he performs it, write it for him as ten good deeds.&#8221;)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Tafseer Ibn Kathir : 56. Al-Waqi&#8217;ah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(7. And you (all) will be in three groups. )</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;">(8. So those on the right &#8212; how (fortunate) will be those on the right!)</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;">(9. And those on the left &#8212; how (unfortunate) will be those on the left!)</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;">(10. And those foremost will be foremost.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And you (all) will be in three groups.) This means that people will be divided into three categories on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some will on the right of Allah&#8217;s Throne, and they are those who were brought forth from `Adam&#8217;s right side. This category will be given their Books of Records in their right hand and will be taken to the right side. As-Suddi explained that they will comprise the majority of the residents of Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another category is those who will be placed to the left of Allah&#8217;s Throne, and they are those who were brought forth from `Adam&#8217;s left side. This category will be given their Books of Records in their left hands and will be taken to the left side. They are the residents of the Fire, may Allah save us from their actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A third category is comprised of those who are the foremost and nearest before Allah. They are in a better grade and status and nearer to Allah than those on the right side. They are the chiefs of those on the right side, because they include the Messengers, Prophets, true believers and martyrs. They are fewer than those on the right side;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">so Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(So those on the right &#8212; how will be those on the right! And those on the left &#8212; how will be those on the left! And those foremost will be foremost.)</span> Allah divides people into these three groups upon their death, as indicated by the end of this Surah. Allah mentioned them in His statement as well,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Then We gave the Book as inheritance to such of Our servants whom We chose. Then of them are some who wrong themselves, and of them are some who follow a middle course, and of them are some who are, by Allah&#8217;s leave, foremost in good deeds.)</span>(35:32) Muhammad bin Ka`b, Abu Hazrah Ya`qub bin Mujahid said that,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(And those foremost will be foremost.)</span> is about the Prophets, peace be upon them, while As-Suddi said that they are the residents of the utmost highs (Ahl Al-`Illiyyin, in Paradise). The meaning of foremost is that they were foremost in performing the acts of righteousness just as Allah commanded them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(And march forth in the way to forgiveness from your Lord, and for Paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth.)</span>(3:133) and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Race with one another in hastening towards forgiveness from your Lord, and Paradise the width whereof is as the width of the heaven and the earth.)</span>(57:21) Therefore, those who rush to obey Allah in this life and are foremost in performing acts of righteousness, will be among the foremost believers honored in the Hereafter. Verily, the reward is according to the kind of deed, and as one does, so he is judged. So Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(These will be the nearest (to Allah). In the Gardens of Delight.)</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And certainly, the Shayatin do inspire their friends to dispute with you,)</strong> Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Ishaq said that a man said to Ibn `Umar that Al-Mukhtar claimed that he received revelation. So Ibn `Umar said, &#8220;He has said the truth,&#8221; and recited this Ayah, (And certainly, the Shayatin do inspire their friends&#8230;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Zamil said, &#8220;I was sitting next to Ibn `Abbas at a time when Al-Mukhtar bin Abi `Ubayd was performing Hajj. So a man came to Ibn `Abbas and said, `O Ibn `Abbas! Abu Ishaq (Al-Mukhtar) claimed that he received revelation this night.&#8217; Ibn `Abbas said, He has said the truth.&#8217; I was upset and said, `Ibn `Abbas says that Al-Mukhtar has said the truth&#8217; Ibn `Abbas replied, <strong>`There are two types of revelation, one from Allah and one from the devil. Allah&#8217;s revelation came to Muhammad , while the Shaytan&#8217;s revelation comes to his friends.&#8217;</strong> He then recited, (And certainly, the Shayatin do inspire their friends&#8230;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also mentioned `Ikrimah&#8217;s commentary on the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Inspiring one another with adorned speech as a delusion.)</strong> Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(to dispute with you,)</strong> Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas commented;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Eat not of that on which Allah&#8217;s Name has not been mentioned&#8230;) until,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;to dispute with you,) <strong>&#8220;The devils inspire their loyal supporters, `Do you eat from what you kill but not from what Allah causes to die&#8221;&#8217;</strong> As-Suddi said; &#8220;Some idolators said to the Muslims, `You claim that you seek Allah&#8217;s pleasure. Yet, you do not eat what Allah causes to die, but you eat what you slaughter&#8217; Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and if you obey them&#8230;), and eat dead animals,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(then you would indeed be polytheists. ) Similar was said by Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak and several others among scholars of the Salaf.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tafseer Ibn Katheer &#8211; Suratul Baqarah [Surah No.2]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;">(155. And certainly, We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to As-Sabirin (the patient).)</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966;"> (156. Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: &#8220;Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.&#8221;)</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966;"> (157. They are those on whom are the Salawat (i.e., who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His mercy, and it is they who are the guided ones.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah informs us that He tests and tries His servants, just as He said in another Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And surely, We shall try you till We test those who strive hard (for the cause of Allah) and As-Sabirin (the patient), and We shall test your facts (i.e., the one who is a liar, and the one who is truthful).)</strong> (47:31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, He tests them with the bounty sometimes and sometimes with the afflictions of fear and hunger. Allah said in another Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So Allah made it taste extreme of hunger (famine) and fear.) (16:112)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The frightened and the hungry persons show the effects of the affliction outwardly and this is why Allah has used here the word `Libas&#8217; (cover or clothes) of fear and hunger. In the Ayat above, Allah used the words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(with something of fear, hunger,) meaning, a little of each. Then (Allah said),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(loss of wealth,) meaning, some of the wealth will be destroyed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(lives) meaning, losing friends, relatives and loved ones to death,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and fruits,) meaning, the gardens and the farms will not produce the usual or expected amounts. This is why Allah said next:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(but give glad tidings to As-Sabirin (the patient).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then explained whom He meant by `the patient&#8217; whom He praised:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: &#8220;Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.&#8221;)</strong> meaning, those who recite this statement to comfort themselves in the face of their loss, know that they belong to Allah and that He does what He wills with His servants. They also know that nothing and no deed, even if it was the weight of an atom, will be lost with Allah on the Day of Resurrection. These facts thus compel them to admit that they are Allah&#8217;s servants and that their return will be to Him in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(They are those on whom are the Salawat (i. e., who are blessed and will be forgiven)</strong> from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His mercy,) meaning, Allah&#8217;s praise and mercy will be with them. Sa`id bin Jubayr added, &#8220;Meaning, safety from the torment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(and it is they who are the guided ones.)</strong> `Umar bin Al-Khattab commented: &#8220;What righteous things, and what a great heights.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(They are those on whom are the Salawat from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His mercy) are the two righteous things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and it is they who are the guided ones) are the heights.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The heights means more rewards, and these people will be awarded their rewards and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are several Ahadith that mention the <strong>rewards of admitting</strong> that the return is to Allah by saying:(&#8220;Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.&#8221;) when afflictions strike.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For instance, Imam Ahmad reported that Umm Salamah narrated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once, Abu Salamah came back after he was with Allah&#8217;s Messenger and said: I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger recite a statement that made me delighted. He said:(No Muslim is struck with an affliction and then says Istirja` when the affliction strikes, and then says: `O Allah! Reward me for my loss and give me what is better than it,&#8217; but Allah will do just that.) Umm Salamah said: So I memorized these words. When Abu Salamah died I said Istirja` and said: &#8220;O Allah! Compensate me for my loss and give me what is better than it.&#8221; I then thought about it and said, &#8220;Who is better than Abu Salamah&#8221; When my `Iddah (the period of time before the widow or divorced woman can remarry) finished, Allah&#8217;s Messenger asked for permission to see me while I was dyeing a skin that I had. I washed my hands, gave him permission to enter and handed him a pillow, and he sat on it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then asked me for marriage and when he finished his speech, I said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! It is not because I do not want you, but I am very jealous and I fear that you might experience some wrong mannerism from me for which Allah would punish me. I am old and have children.&#8221; He said: (As for the jealousy that you mentioned, Allah the Exalted will remove it from you. As for your being old as you mentioned, I have suffered what you have suffered. And for your having children, they are my children too.) She said, &#8220;I have surrendered to Allah&#8217;s Messenger.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Messenger married her and Umm Salamah said later, &#8220;Allah compensated me with who is better than Abu Salamah: Allah&#8217;s Messenger .&#8217; [ Muslim reported a shorter version of this Hadith]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tafseer Ibn Kathir &#8211; Surah Al Baqarah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(261. The parable of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah, is that of a grain (of corn); it grows seven ears, and each ear has a hundred grains. Allah gives manifold increase to whom He wills. And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures&#8217; needs, All-Knower.) </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a parable that Allah made of the multiplication of rewards for those who spend in His cause, seeking His pleasure. Allah multiplies the good deed ten to seven hundred times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said, <strong>&lt;&lt;The parable of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah&#8230;&gt;&gt;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa`id bin Jubayr commented, &#8220;Meaning spending in Allah&#8217;s obedience&#8221;.<br />
Makhul said that the Ayah means, &#8220;Spending on Jihad, on horse stalls, weapons and so forth&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The parable in the Ayah is more impressive on the heart than merely mentioning the number seven hundred. This Ayah indicates that Allah `grows&#8217; the good deeds for its doers, just as He grows the plant for whoever sows it in fertile land.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sunnah also mentions that the deeds are multiplied up to seven hundred folds. For instance, Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Mas`ud said that a man once gave away a camel, with its bridle on, in the cause of Allah and the Messenger of Allah said, (On the Day of Resurrection, you will have seven hundred camels with their bridles.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim and An-Nasa&#8217;i also recorded this Hadith, and Muslim&#8217;s narration reads, &#8220;A man brought a camel with its bridle on and said, `O Messenger of Allah! This is in the sake of Allah.&#8217; The Messenger said, (You will earn seven hundred camels as reward for it on the Day of Resurrection. )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another Hadith: Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Every good deed that the son of Adam performs will be multiplied ten folds, to seven hundred folds, to many other folds, to as much as Allah wills. Allah said, &#8220;Except the fast, for it is for Me and I will reward for it. One abandons his food and desire in My sake.&#8221; The fasting person has two times of happiness: when he breaks his fast and when he meets his Lord. Verily, the odor that comes from the mouth of whoever fasts is more pure to Allah than the scent of musk. Fasting is a shield (against sinning), fasting is a shield.) Muslim recorded this Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement, <strong>&lt;&lt;Allah gives manifold increase to whom He wills &gt;&gt;</strong> is according to the person&#8217;s sincerity in his deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&lt;&lt; And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures&#8217; needs, All-Knower &gt;&gt;</strong> meaning, His Favor is so wide that it encompasses much more than His creation, and He has full knowledge in whoever deserves it, or does not deserve it. All the praise and thanks are due to Allah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source : <strong>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>(260. And (remember) when Ibrahim said, &#8220;My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead.&#8221; He (Allah) said: &#8220;Do you not believe&#8221; He (Ibrahim) said: &#8220;Yes (I believe), but to be stronger in faith.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Take four birds, then cause them to incline towards you (then slaughter them, cut them into pieces), and then put a portion of them on every hill, and call them, they will come to you in haste. And know that Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.&#8221;)</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Khalil Supplicates to Allah to Show Him How He Resurrects the Dead</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars said that there are reasons behind this request by Ibrahim. For instance, when Ibrahim said to Nimrod, (My Lord (Allah) is He Who gives life and causes death,) he wanted to solidify his knowledge about resurrection by actually witnessing it with his eyes. Prophet Ibrahim said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">(&#8220;My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead.&#8221; He (Allah) said: &#8220;Do you not believe&#8221; He (Ibrahim) said: &#8220;Yes (I believe), but to be stronger in faith.&#8221;)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>(We are more liable to be in doubt than Ibrahim when he said, &#8220;My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead.&#8221; Allah said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe&#8221; Ibrahim said, &#8220;Yes (I believe), but (I ask) in order to be stronger in faith.&#8221;)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet&#8217;s statement in the Hadith means, &#8220;We are more liable to seek certainty.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer to Al-Khalil&#8217;s Request:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">(He said: &#8220;Take four birds, then cause them to incline towards you.&#8221;)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars of Tafsir disagreed over the type of birds mentioned here, although this matter in not relevant due to the fact that the Qur&#8217;an did not mention it. Allah&#8217;s statement, (cause them to incline towards you) means, cut them to pieces. This is the explanation of Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Malik, Abu Al-Aswad Ad-Dili, Wahb bin Munabbih, Al-Hasan and As-Suddi.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Ibrahim caught four birds, slaughtered them, removed the feathers, tore the birds to pieces and mixed the pieces together. He then placed parts of these mixed pieces on four or seven hills. Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;Ibrahim kept the heads of these birds in his hand. Next, Allah commanded Ibrahim to call the birds to him, and he did as Allah commanded him. Ibrahim witnessed the feathers, blood and flesh of these birds fly to each other, and the parts flew each to their bodies, until every bird came back to life and came walking at a fast pace towards Ibrahim, so that the example that Ibrahim was witnessing would become more impressive. Each bird came to collect its head from Ibrahim&#8217;s hand, and if he gave the bird another head the bird refused to accept it. When Ibrahim gave each bird its own head, the head was placed on its body by Allah&#8217;s leave and power. &#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Allah said,<br />
(And know that Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise) and no one can overwhelm or resist Him. Whatever Allah wills, occurs without hindrance, because He is the All-Mighty, Supreme above all things, and He is Wise in His statements, actions, legislation and decrees.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Ma`mar said that Ayyub said that Ibn `Abbas commented on what Ibrahim said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(but to be stronger in Faith)</strong>, &#8220;To me, there is no Ayah in the Qur&#8217;an that brings more hope than this Ayah.&#8221; Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Muhammad bin Al-Munkadir said that `Abdullah bin `Abbas met `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As and said to him, &#8220;Which Ayah in the Qur&#8217;an carries more hope for you&#8221; Ibn `Amr said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>(Say: &#8220;O `Ibadi (My servants) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not.)</em></span> (39:53).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;But I say that it is Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And (remember) when Ibrahim said, &#8220;My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead.&#8221; He (Allah) said: &#8220;Do you not believe&#8221; He (Ibrahim) said: &#8220;Yes (I believe)&#8230;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah accepted Ibrahim&#8217;s affirmation when he merely said, `Yes.&#8217; This Ayah refers to the doubts that attack the heart and the thoughts that Shaytan inspires.&#8221; Al-Hakim also recorded this in Al-Mustadrak and said; &#8220;Its chain is Sahih but they did not record it.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Source :Tafseer Ibn Kathir &#8211; Suratul Baqarah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">( Did you (O Muhammad ) not think of those who went forth from their homes in the thousands, fearing death Allah said to them, &#8220;Die&#8221;. And then He restored them to life. Truly, Allah is full of bounty to mankind, but most men thank not.) [Surah Baqarah Verse243]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abu Hatim related that Ibn `Abbas said that these people mentioned herein, were the residents of a village called Dawardan. `Ali bin `Asim said that they were from Dawardan, a village several miles away from Wasit (in Iraq).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his Tafsir, Waki` bin Jarrah said that Ibn `Abbas commented,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Did you (O Muhammad ) not think of those who went forth from their homes in thousands, fearing death) that they were four thousand persons who escaped the plague (that broke out in their land). They said, &#8220;We should go to a land</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that is free of death!&#8221; When they reached a certain area, Allah said to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;Die.&#8221;) and they all died. Afterwards, one of the Prophets passed by them and supplicated to Allah to resurrect them and Allah brought them back to life. So, Allah stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Did you (O Muhammad ) not think of those who went forth from their homes in the thousands, fearing death)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, several scholars among the Salaf said that these people were the residents of a city during the time of the Children of Israel. The weather in their land did not suit them and an epidemic broke out. They fled their land fearing death and took refuge in the wilderness. They later arrived at a fertile valley and they filled what is between its two sides. Then Allah sent two angels to them, one from the lower side and the other from the upper side of the valley. The angels screamed once and all the people died instantly, just as the death of one man. They were later moved to a different place, where walls and graves were built around them. They all perished, and their bodies rotted and disintegrated. Long afterwards, one of the Prophets of the Children of Israel, whose name was <strong>Hizqil (Ezekiel)</strong>, passed by them and asked Allah to bring them back to life by his hand. Allah accepted his supplication and commanded him to say, &#8220;O rotted bones, Allah commands you to come together.&#8221; The bones of every body were brought together. Allah then commanded him to say, &#8220;O bones, Allah commands you to be covered with flesh, nerves and skin.&#8221; That also happened while Hizqil was watching. Allah then commanded him to say, &#8220;O souls, Allah commands you to return, each to the body that it used to inhabit.&#8221; They all came back to life, looked around and proclaimed, &#8220;All praise is due to You (O Allah!) and there is no deity worthy of worship except You.&#8221; Allah brought them back to life after they had perished long ago.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We should state that bringing these people back to life is a clear proof that physical resurrection shall occur on the Day of Resurrection.<br />
This is why Allah said:<br />
(Truly, Allah is full of bounty to mankind,) meaning, in that He shows them His great signs, sound proofs and clear evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet, (but most men thank not.) as they do not thank Allah for what He has given them with in their worldly life and religious affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The story of the dead people (2:244 above) also indicates that no caution can ever avert destiny and that there is no refuge from Allah, but to Allah Himself. These people departed from their land fleeing the epidemic and seeking to enjoy a long life. What they earned was the opposite of what they sought, as death came quickly and instantaneously and seized them all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is an authentic Hadith that Imam Ahmad reported that `Abdullah bin `Abbas said that `Umar bin Al-Khattab once went to Ash-Sham (Syria). When he reached the area of Sargh, he was met by the commanders of the army: Abu `Ubaydah bin Jarrah and his companions. They told him that the plague had broken out in Ash-Sham. The Hadith then mentioned that `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf, who was away attending to some of his affairs, came and said, &#8220;I have knowledge regarding this matter. I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Peace be upon him) say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(If it (the plague) breaks out in a land that you are in, do not leave that land to escape from it. If you hear about it in a land, do not enter it.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Umar then thanked Allah and went back. This Hadith is also reported in the Sahihayn.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Isti&#8217;adhah : Seeking Refuge with Allah &#8211; Tafseer Ibn Kathir &#8211; Surah Fatihah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Isti`adhah : </strong>&#8220;a uthu billahi minash Shaitaanir Rajeem&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Isti`adhah means, &#8220;I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed Satan so that he is prevented from affecting my religious or worldly affairs, or hindering me from adhering to what I was commanded, or luring me into what I was prohibited from.&#8221; Indeed, only Allah is able to prevent the evil of Satan from touching the son of Adam. This is why Allah allowed us to be lenient and kind with the human devil, so that his soft nature might cause him to refrain from the evil he is indulging in. However, Allah required us to seek refuge with Him from the evil of Satan, because he neither accepts bribes nor does kindness affect him, for he is pure evil. Thus, only He Who created Satan is able to stop his evil. This meaning is reiterated in only three Ayat in the Qur&#8217;an. Allah said in Surat Al-A`raf,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the foolish (i.e. don&#8217;t punish them).) (7:199)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is about dealing with human beings. He then said in the same Surah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And if an evil whisper comes to you from Shaytan, then seek refuge with Allah. Verily, He is Hearing, Knowing (7: 200).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also said in Surat Al-Mu&#8217;minun,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Repel evil with that which is better. We are Best-Acquainted with the things they utter. And say: &#8220;My Lord! I seek refuge with You from the whisperings (suggestions) of the Shayatin (devils). And I seek refuge with You, My Lord! lest they should come near me.&#8221; (23:96-98).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further, Allah said in Surat As-Sajdah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal. Repel (the evil) with one which is better, then verily he, between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend. But none is granted it (the above quality) except those who are patient ـ and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion (of happiness in the Hereafter, i.e. Paradise and of a high moral character) in this world. And if an evil whisper from Shaytan tries to turn you away (from doing good), then seek refuge in Allah. Verily, He is the Hearing, the Knowing) (41:34-36).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Tafsir of Isti`adhah (seeking Refuge)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and stay away from the foolish (i.e. don&#8217;t punish them). And if an evil whisper comes to you from Shaytan (Satan), then seek refuge with Allah. Verily, He is Hearing, Knowing) (7:199-200),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Repel evil with that which is better. We are Best-Acquainted with things they utter. And say: &#8220;My Lord! I seek refuge with You from the whisperings (suggestions) of the Shayatin (devils). And I seek refuge with You, My Lord! lest they should come near me.&#8221;) (23:96-98) and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Repel (an evil) with one which is better, then verily he with whom there was enmity between you, (will become) as though he was a close friend. But none is granted it except those who are patient ـ and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion (of happiness in the Hereafter, i.e. Paradise and of a high moral character) in this world. And if an evil whisper from Shaytan tries to turn you away (O Muhammad ) (from doing good), then seek refuge in Allah. Verily, He is the Hearing, the Knowing.) (41:34-36) These are the only three Ayat that carry this meaning. Allah commanded that we be lenient human enemy, so that his soft nature might make him an ally and a supporter. He also commanded that we seek refuge from the satanic enemy, because the devil does not relent in his enmity if we treat him with kindness and leniency. The devil only seeks the destruction of the Son of Adam due to the vicious enmity and hatred he has always had towards man&#8217;s father, Adam. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Children of Adam! Let not Shaytan deceive you, as he got your parents ﴿Adam and Hawwa&#8217; (Eve)﴾ out of Paradise) (7:27),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surely, Shaytan is an enemy to you, so take (treat) him as an enemy. He only invites his Hizb (followers) that they may become the dwellers of the blazing Fire) (35:6) and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Will you then take him (Iblis) and his offspring as protectors and helpers rather than Me while they are enemies to you What an evil is the exchange for the Zalimun (polytheists, and wrongdoers, etc)) (18:50).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The devil assured Adam that he wanted to advise him, but he was lying. Hence, how would he treat us after he had vowed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;By Your might, then I will surely, mislead them all. Except Your chosen servants among them (i.e. faithful, obedient, true believers of Islamic Monotheism).&#8221;) (38:82-83)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So when you ﴿want to﴾ recite the Qur&#8217;an, seek refuge with Allah from Shaytan, the outcast (the cursed one). Verily, he has no power over those who believe and put their trust only in their Lord (Allah). His power is only over those who obey and follow him (Satan), and those who join partners with Him.) (16:98-100).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Sahih Al-Bukhari it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah (Sallallaahu &#8216;Alayhi Wa Sallam) used to supplicate;</p>
<p>«اللَّهُمَّ لَكَ الْحَمْدُ غَيْرَ مَكْفِيَ وَلَا مُوَدَّعٍ وَلَا مُسْتَغْنًى عَنْهُ رَبَّنَا»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Allah ! All praise is due to You, without being able to sufficiently thank You, nor ever wish to be cutoff from You, nor ever feeling rich from relying on You; our Lord!)</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was reported that Prophet Dawud, peace be upon him, used to say in his supplication,&#8221;O Lord! How can I ever duly thank You, when my thanking You is also a favor from You to me&#8221; Allah the Exalted answered him, &#8220;Now, you have thanked Me sufficiently, O Dawud,&#8221; meaning, `when you admitted that you will never be able to duly thank Me.&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning Allaah’s statement (what means): <strong>And those who give that (their charity) which they give (and also do other good deeds) with their hearts full of fear (whether their alms and charities, etc., have been accepted or not), because they are sure to return to their Lord (for reckoning).</strong> (Al-Mu’minun 23:60)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And those who give that which they give with their hearts full of fear, because they are sure to return to their Lord.) means, they give in charity, fearing that it may not be accepted from them because of some shortcoming or failure to meet the required conditions of giving. This has to do with fear and taking precautions, as Imam Ahmad recorded from `A&#8217;ishah: I said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah,</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic" style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">﴿وَالَّذِينَ يُؤْتُونَ مَآ ءاتَواْ وَّقُلُوبُهُمْ وَجِلَةٌ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And those who give that which they give with their hearts full of fear&#8230;) Are these the ones who steal and commit Zina and drink alcohol while fearing Allah&#8221; The Messenger of Allah replied:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic" style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">«لَا، يَا بِنْتَ أَبِي بَكْرٍ يَا بِنْتَ الصِّدِّيقِ، وَلَكِنَّهُ الَّذِي يُصَلِّي وَيَصُومُ وَيَتَصَدَّقُ وَهُوَ يَخَافُ اللهَ عَزَّ وَجَل»</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(No, O daughter of Abu Bakr. O daughter of As-Siddiq, the one who prays, fast and gives in charity, fearing Allah.) This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, and Ibn Abi Hatim recorded something similar in which the Prophet said:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic" style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">«لَا يَا بِنْتَ الصِّدِّيقِ، وَلَكِنَّهُمُ الَّذِينَ يُصَلُّونَ وَيَصُومُونَ وَيَتَصَدَّقُونَ وَهُمْ يَخَافُونَ أَلَّا يُقْبَلَ مِنْهُمْ:</span></p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic" style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">﴿أُوْلَـئِكَ يُسَـرِعُونَ فِى الْخَيْرَتِ﴾»</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(No, O daughter of As-Siddiq, they are the ones who pray and fast and give in charity while fearing that it will not be accepted from them, (It is these who hasten in the good deeds.)) This is also how Ibn `Abbas, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi and Al-Hasan Al-Basri interpreted this Ayah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan Al-Basri (rahimahullah)said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Whomever Allaah gives provision and he thinks that Allaah is not testing him, has no wisdom. Whomever has little provision and thinks that Allaah will not look at (provide for) him, has no wisdom.&#8221;  </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then recited the Ayaah,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“So, when they forgot (the warning) with which they had been reminded, We opened to them the gates of every (pleasant) thing, until in the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given, all of a sudden, We took them to punishment, and lo! They were plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows.”</span> (Al-An&#8217;am 6:44)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He added,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;By the Lord of the Ka&#8217;bah! Allaah deceived these people, when He gave them what they wished, and then they were punished.&#8221; </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Haatim recorded this statement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Ad-Durr Al-Manthur 3:270, Ibn Abi Haatim 4:1291]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Source</strong> : Tafsir Ibn Kathir  (Surah Burooj) &#8211; Published by Dar-us-salam</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded from Suhayb that the Messenger of Allah (Peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among the people who came before you, there was a king who had a sorcerer, and when that sorcerer became old, he said to the king, &#8220;I have become old and my time is nearly over, so please send me a boy whom I can teach magic.&#8221; So, he sent him a boy and the sorcerer taught him magic. Whenever the boy went to the sorcerer, he sat with a monk who was on the way and listened to his speech and admired them. So, when he went to the sorcerer, he passed by the monk and sat there with him; and on visiting the sorcerer the latter would thrash him. So, the boy complained about this to the monk. The monk said to him, &#8220;Whenever you are afraid of the sorcerer, say to him: `My people kept me busy.&#8217; And whenever you are afraid of your people, say to them: `The sorcerer kept me busy.&#8221;&#8217; So the boy carried on like that (for some time). Then a huge terrible creature appeared on the road and the people were unable to pass by. The boy said, &#8220;Today I shall know whether the sorcerer is better or the monk is better.&#8221; So, he took a stone and said, &#8220;O Allah! If the deeds and actions of the monk are liked by You better than those of the sorcerer, then kill this creature so that the people can cross (the road).&#8221; Then he struck it with a stone killing it and the people passed by on the road.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The boy came to the monk and informed him about it. The monk said to him, &#8220;O my son! Today you are better than I, and you have achieved what I see! You will be put to trial. And in case you are put to trial, do not inform (them) about me.&#8221;The boy used to treat the people suffering from congenital blindness, leprosy, and other diseases. There was a courtier of the king who had become blind and he heard about the boy. He came and brought a number of gifts for the boy and said, &#8220;All these gifts are for you on the condition that you cure me.&#8221; The boy said, &#8220;I do not cure anybody; it is only Allah who cures people. So, if you believe in Allah and supplicate to Him, He will cure you.&#8221; So, he believed in and supplicated to Allah, and Allah cured him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Later, the courtier came to the king and sat at the place where he used to sit before. The king said, &#8220;Who gave you back your sight&#8221;The courtier replied, &#8220;My Lord.&#8221; The king then said, &#8220;I did&#8221; The courtier said, &#8220;No, my Lord and your Lord &#8211; Allah&#8221; The king said, &#8220;Do you have another Lord beside me&#8221; The courtier said, &#8220;Yes, your Lord and my Lord is Allah.&#8221; The king tortured him and did not stop until he told him about the boy. So, the boy was brought to the king and he said to him, &#8220;O boy! Has your magic reached to the extent that you cure congenital blindness, leprosy and other diseases&#8221;He said, &#8221; I do not cure anyone. Only Allah can cure.&#8221; The king said, &#8220;Me&#8221; The boy replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; The king asked, &#8220;Do you have another Lord besides me&#8221;The boy answered, &#8221; My Lord and your Lord is Allah.&#8221; So, he tortured him also until he told about the monk. Then the monk was brought to him and the king said to him, &#8220;Abandon your religion.&#8221; The monk refused and so the king ordered a saw to be brought which was placed in the middle of his head and he fell, sawn in two. Then it was said to the man who used to be blind, &#8220;Abandon your religion.&#8221; He refused to do so, and so a saw was brought and placed in the middle of his head and he fell, sawn in two. Then the boy was brought and it was said to him, &#8220;Abandon your religion.&#8221; He refused and so the king sent him to the top of such and such mountain with some people. He told the people, &#8220;Ascend up the mountain with him till you reach its peak, then see if he abandons his religion; otherwise throw him from the top.&#8221; They took him and when they ascended to the top, he said, &#8221; O Allah! Save me from them by any means that You wish.&#8221; So, the mountain shook and they all fell down and the boy came back walking to the king. The king said, &#8221; What did your companions (the people I sent with you) do&#8221; The boy said, &#8220;Allah saved me from them.&#8221; So, the king ordered some people to take the boy on a boat to the middle of the sea, saying, &#8220;If he renounces his religion (well and good), but if he refuses, drown him.&#8221; So, they took him out to sea and he said, &#8220;O Allah! Save me from them by any means that you wish.&#8221; So they were all drowned in the sea.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the boy returned to the king and the king said, &#8220;What did your companions do&#8221; The boy replied, &#8220;Allah, saved me from them.&#8221; Then he said to the king, &#8220;You will not be able to kill me until you do as I order you. And if you do as I order you, you will be able to kill me.&#8221; The king asked, &#8220;And what is that&#8221; The boy said, &#8220;Gather the people in one elevated place and tie me to the trunk of a tree; then take an arrow from my quiver and say: `In the Name of Allah, the Lord of the boy.&#8217; If you do this, you will be able to kill me.&#8221; So he did this, and placing an arrow in the bow, he shot it, saying, &#8220;In the Name of Allah, the Lord of the boy.&#8221; The arrow hit the boy in the temple, and the boy placed his hand over the arrow wound and died. The people proclaimed, &#8220;We believe in the Lord of the boy!&#8221; Then it was said to the king, &#8220;Do you see what has happened That which you feared has taken place. By Allah, all the people have believed (in the Lord of the boy).&#8221;So he ordered that ditches be dug at the entrances to the roads and it was done, and fires were kindled in them. Then the king said, &#8220;Whoever abandons his religion, let him go, and whoever does not, throw him into the fire.&#8221; They were struggling and scuffling in the fire, until a woman and her baby whom she was breast feeding came and it was as if she was being somewhat hesitant of falling into the fire, so her baby said to her,&#8221;Be patient mother! For verily, you are following the truth!&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim also recorded this Hadith at the end of the Sahih. Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar related this story in his book of Sirah in another way that has some differences from that which has just been related. Then, after Ibn Ishaq explained that the people of Najran began following the religion of the boy after his murder, which was the religion of Christianity, he said, &#8220;Then (the king) Dhu Nuwas came to them with his army and called them to Judaism. He gave them a choice to either accept Judaism or be killed, so they chose death. Thus, he had a ditch dug and burned (some of them) in the fire (in the ditch), while others he killed with the sword. He made an example of them (by slaughtering them) until he had killed almost twenty thousand of them. It was about Dhu Nuwas and his army that Allah revealed to His Messenger :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Cursed were the People of the Ditch. Of fire fed with fuel. When they sat by it. And they witnessed what they were doing against the believers. And they had no fault except that they believed in Allah, the Almighty, Worthy of all praise! To Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth! And Allah is Witness over everything.)</span> (85:4-9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what Muhammad bin Ishaq said in his book of Sirah &#8212; that the one who killed the People of the Ditch was Dhu Nuwas, and his name was Zur`ah. In the time of his kingdom he was called Yusuf. He was the son of Tuban As`ad Abi Karib, who was the Tubba` who invaded Al-Madinah and put the covering over the Ka`bah. He kept two rabbis with him from the Jews of Al-Madinah. After this some of the people of Yemen accepted Judaism at the hands of these two rabbis, as Ibn Ishaq mentions at length. So Dhu Nuwas killed twenty thousand people in one morning in the Ditch. Only one man among them escaped. He was known as Daws Dhu Tha`laban. He escaped on a horse and they set out after him, but they were unable to catch him. He went to Caesar, the emperor of Ash-Sham. So, Caesar wrote to An-Najashi, the King of Abyssinia. So, he sent with him an army of Abyssinian Christians, who were lead by Aryat and Abrahah. They rescued Yemen from the hands of the Jews. Dhu Nuwas tried to flee but eventually fell into the sea and drowned. After this, the kingdom of Abyssinia remained under Christian power for seventy years. Then the power was divested from the Christians by Sayf bin Dhi Yazin Al-Himyari when Kisra, the king of Persia sent an army there (to Yemen). He (the king) sent with him (Sayf Al-Himyari) those people who were in the prisons, and they were close to seven hundred in number. So, he (Sayf Al-Himyari) conquered Yemen with them and returned the kingdom back to the people of Himyar (Yemenis).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Source : Tafsir Ibn Kathir &#8211; Dar-us-salam &#8211; (Al-­Qasas, 76-84)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(76. Verily, Qarun was of Musa&#8217;s people, but he behaved arrogantly towards them. And We gave him of the treasures, that of which the keys would have been a burden to a body of strong men. Remember when his people said to him: &#8220;Do not exult. Verily, Allah likes not those who exult.&#8221;) (77. &#8220;But seek, with that which Allah has bestowed on you, the home of the Hereafter, and forget not your portion of lawful enjoyment in this world; and be generous as Allah has been generous to you, and seek not mischief in the land. Verily, Allah likes not the mischief-makers.&#8221;)</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Qarun and His People&#8217;s exhortation</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was recorded that Ibn `Abbas said:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿إِنَّ قَـرُونَ كَانَ مِن قَوْمِ مُوسَى﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, Qarun was of Musa&#8217;s people,) &#8220;He was the son of his paternal uncle.&#8221; This was also the view of Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, `Abdullah bin Al-Harith bin Nawfal, Sammak bin Harb, Qatadah, Malik bin Dinar, Ibn Jurayj and others; they all said that he was the cousin of Musa, peace be upon him. Ibn Jurayj said: &#8220;He was Qarun bin Yashar bin Qahith, and Musa was the son of `Imran bin Qahith.</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَءَاتَيْنَاهُ مِنَ الْكُنُوزِ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And We gave him of the treasures,) meaning, of wealth;</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿مَآ إِنَّ مَفَاتِحَهُ لَتَنُوأُ بِالْعُصْبَةِ أُوْلِى الْقُوَّةِ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(that of which the keys would have been a burden to a body of strong men.) Groups of strong men would not have been able to carry them because they were so many. Al-A`mash narrated from Khaythamah, &#8220;The keys of Qarun&#8217;s treasure were made of leather, each key like a finger, and each key was for a separate storeroom. When he rode anywhere, the keys would be carried on sixty mules with white blazes on their foreheads and white feet.&#8221; Other views were also given, and Allah knows best.</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿إِذْ قَالَ لَهُ قَوْمُهُ لاَ تَفْرَحْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ الْفَرِحِينَ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Remember when his people said to him: &#8220;Do not exult. Verily, Allah likes not those who exult.&#8221;) means, the righteous ones among his people exhorted him. By way of sincere advice and guidance, they said: &#8220;Do not exult in what you have,&#8221; meaning, `do not be arrogant and proud of your wealth.&#8217;</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ الْفَرِحِينَ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, Allah likes not those who exult.) Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;This means, those who rejoice and gloat.&#8221; Mujahid said, &#8220;It means those who are insolent and reckless, and do not thank Allah for what He has given them.&#8221; His saying:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَابْتَغِ فِيمَآ ءَاتَاكَ اللَّهُ الدَّارَ الاٌّخِرَةَ وَلاَ تَنسَ نَصِيبَكَ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(But seek, with that which Allah has bestowed on you, the home of the Hereafter, and forget not your portion of lawful enjoyment in this world;) means, `use this great wealth and immense blessing Allah has given you to worship your Lord and draw closer to Him by doing a variety of good deeds which will earn you reward in this world and the Hereafter.&#8217;</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَلاَ تَنسَ نَصِيبَكَ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and forget not your portion of lawful enjoyment in this world;) `That which Allah has permitted of food, drink, clothing, dwelling places and women. Your Lord has rights over you, your self has rights over you, your family has rights over you, and your visitors have rights over you. So give each of them their due.&#8217;</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَأَحْسِن كَمَآ أَحْسَنَ اللَّهُ إِلَيْكَ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and be generous as Allah has been generous to you, ) `Be generous to His creatures, as He has been generous to you.&#8217;</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَلاَ تَبْغِ الْفَسَادَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and seek not mischief in the land.) meaning: `do not let your aim be to spread corruption on earth and do harm to Allah&#8217;s creation.&#8217;</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ الْمُفْسِدِينَ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, Allah likes not the mischief-makers.)</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic"><a name="1"></a>﴿قَالَ إِنَّمَآ أُوتِيتُهُ عَلَى عِلْمٍ عِندِى أَوَلَمْ يَعْلَمْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ قَدْ أَهْلَكَ مِن قَبْلِهِ مِنَ الْقُرُونِ مَنْ هُوَ أَشَدُّ مِنْهُ قُوَّةً وَأَكْثَرُ جَمْعاً وَلاَ يُسْأَلُ عَن ذُنُوبِهِمُ الْمُجْرِمُونَ ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(78. He said: &#8220;This has been given to me only because of the knowledge I possess.&#8221; Did he not know that Allah had destroyed before him generations, men who were stronger than him in might and greater in the amount they had collected But the criminals will not be questioned of their sins.)</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Allah informs us how Qarun responded to the exhortations of his people when they sought to guide him</h2>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿قَالَ إِنَّمَآ أُوتِيتُهُ عَلَى عِلْمٍ عِندِى﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He said: &#8220;This has been given to me only because of the knowledge I possess.&#8221;) meaning, `I have no need of your advice; Allah has only given me this wealth because He knows that I deserve it and because He loves me. &#8216; In other words: `He has given it to me because He knows that I am fit for this.&#8217; This is like the Ayat:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿فَإِذَا مَسَّ الإِنسَـنَ ضُرٌّ دَعَانَا ثُمَّ إِذَا خَوَّلْنَـهُ نِعْمَةً مِّنَّا قَالَ إِنَّمَآ أُوتِيتُهُ عَلَى عِلْمٍ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When harm touches man, he calls upon Us; then when We have changed it into a favor from Us, he says: &#8220;Only because of knowledge I obtained it.&#8221;) (39:49) An alternative interpretation of this Ayah says that the meaning is: &#8220;Only because of what Allah knows about me did I obtain this favor.&#8221; This is like His saying:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَلَئِنْ أَذَقْنَـهُ رَحْمَةً مِّنَّا مِن بَعْدِ ضَرَّآءَ مَسَّتْهُ لَيَقُولَنَّ هَـذَا لِى﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And truly, if We give him a taste of mercy from Us, after some adversity has touched him, he is sure to say: &#8220;This is from me.&#8221;) (41:50) meaning, &#8220;I deserved it.&#8221; Imam `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam explained this Ayah very well. Concerning the phrase,</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿قَالَ إِنَّمَآ أُوتِيتُهُ عَلَى عِلْمٍ عِندِى﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He said: &#8220;This has been given to me only because of the knowledge I possess.&#8221;) He said: &#8220;Were it not for the fact that Allah is pleased with me and knows my virtue, He would not have given me this wealth.&#8221; And He said:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿أَوَلَمْ يَعْلَمْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ قَدْ أَهْلَكَ مِن قَبْلِهِ مِنَ الْقُرُونِ مَنْ هُوَ أَشَدُّ مِنْهُ قُوَّةً وَأَكْثَرُ جَمْعاً﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Did he not know that Allah had destroyed before him generations, men who were stronger than him in might and greater in the amount they had collected) This is what those who have little knowledge say when they see a person whom Allah has granted a lot of wealth; they say that if he did not deserve it, Allah would not have given it to him.</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic"><a name="1"></a>﴿فَخَرَجَ عَلَى قَوْمِهِ فِى زِينَتِهِ قَالَ الَّذِينَ يُرِيدُونَ الْحَيَوةَ الدُّنْيَا يلَيْتَ لَنَا مِثْلَ مَآ أُوتِىَ قَـرُونُ إِنَّهُ لَذُو حَظٍّ عَظِيمٍ &#8211; وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْعِلْمَ وَيْلَكُمْ ثَوَابُ اللَّهِ خَيْرٌ لِّمَنْ ءَامَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَـلِحاً وَلاَ يُلَقَّاهَآ إِلاَّ الصَّـبِرُونَ ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(79. So, he went forth before his people in his finery. Those who were desirous of the life of the world, said: &#8220;Ah, would that we had the like of what Qarun has been given! Verily, he is the owner of a great fortune.&#8221;) (80. But those who had been given knowledge said: &#8220;Woe to you! The reward of Allah is better for those who believe and do righteous deeds, and this none shall attain except the patient.&#8221;)</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">How Qarun went forth in His Finery, and His People&#8217;s Comments</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah tells us how Qarun went forth one day before his people with his magnificent regalia; wearing his fine clothes, accompanied by his fine horses, his servants and retinue. When those whose desires and inclinations were for the world saw his adornments and splendor, they wished that they could have the same as he had been given, and said:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿يلَيْتَ لَنَا مِثْلَ مَآ أُوتِىَ قَـرُونُ إِنَّهُ لَذُو حَظٍّ عَظِيمٍ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Ah, would that we had the like of what Qarun has been given! Verily, he is the owner of a great fortune.) meaning, `he is very lucky and has a great share in this world.&#8217; When the people of beneficial knowledge heard this, they said to them:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَيْلَكُمْ ثَوَابُ اللَّهِ خَيْرٌ لِّمَنْ ءَامَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَـلِحاً﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Woe to you! The reward of Allah is better for those who believe and do righteous deeds,) `Allah&#8217;s reward to His believing, righteous servants in the Hereafter is better than what you see,&#8217; as is reported in the authentic Hadith:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">«يَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى: أَعْدَدْتُ لِعِبَادِي الصَّالِحِينَ مَا لَا عَيْنٌ رَأَتْ وَلَا أُذُنٌ سَمِعَتْ وَلَا خَطَرَ عَلَى قَلْبِ بَشَرٍ وَاقْرَءُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</span></p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿فَلاَ تَعْلَمُ نَفْسٌ مَّآ أُخْفِىَ لَهُم مِّن قُرَّةِ أَعْيُنٍ جَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah has prepared for His righteous servants what no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and the heart of a human cannot comprehend. Recite, if you wish: (No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do.)) (32:17).</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَلاَ يُلَقَّاهَآ إِلاَّ الصَّـبِرُونَ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and this none shall attain except the patient.) As-Suddi said: &#8220;None shall reach Paradise except for the patient&#8221; &#8212; as if this were the completion of the statement made by the people of knowledge. Ibn Jarir said, &#8220;This applies only to those who patiently forsake the love of this world, seeking the Hereafter. It is as if this is part of what the people of knowledge said, but it is made part of the Words of Allah, stating this fact.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic"><a name="1"></a>﴿فَخَسَفْنَا بِهِ وَبِدَارِهِ الاٌّرْضَ فَمَا كَانَ لَهُ مِن فِئَةٍ يَنصُرُونَهُ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُنتَصِرِينَ &#8211; وَأَصْبَحَ الَّذِينَ تَمَنَّوْاْ مَكَانَهُ بِالاٌّمْسِ يَقُولُونَ وَيْكَأَنَّ اللَّهَ يَبْسُطُ الرِّزْقَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ وَيَقْدِرُ لَوْلا أَن مَّنَّ اللَّهُ عَلَيْنَا لَخَسَفَ بِنَا وَيْكَأَنَّهُ لاَ يُفْلِحُ الْكَـفِرُونَ ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(81. So, We caused the earth to swallow him and his dwelling place. Then he had no group to help him against Allah, nor was he one of those who could save themselves.) (82. And those who desired his position the day before, began to say: &#8220;Know you not that it is Allah Who expands the provision or restricts it to whomsoever He pleases of His servants. Had it not been that Allah was Gracious to us, He could have caused the earth to swallow us up! Know you not that the disbelievers will never be successful.&#8221;)</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">How Qarun and His Dwelling Place were swallowed up by the Earth</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After telling us about Qarun&#8217;s conceit and pride in his adornments, and how he was arrogant towards his people and transgressed against them, Allah then tells us how he and his dwelling place were swallowed up by the earth. This was also reported in the Sahih by Al-Bukhari from Salim, who said that his father told him that the Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">«بَيْنَمَا رَجُلٌ يَجُرُّ إِزَارَهُ إِذْ خُسِفَ بِهِ، فَهُوَ يَتَجَلْجَلُ فِي الْأَرْضِ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَة»</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(While a man was dragging his lower garment, he was swallowed up and he will remain sinking down into the earth until the Day of Resurrection.) He also recorded something similar from Salim from Abu Hurayrah from the Prophet . Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">«بَيْنَمَا رَجُلٌ فِيمَنْ كَانَ قَبْلَكُمْ خَرَجَ فِي بُرْدَيْنِ أَخْضَرَيْنِ يَخْتَالُ فِيهِمَا، أَمَرَ اللهُ الْأَرْضَ فَأَخَذَتْهُ، فَإِنَّهُ لَيَتَجَلْجَلُ فِيهَا إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَة»</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When a man among the people who came before you went out wearing two green garments, walking proudly and arrogantly, Allah commanded the earth to swallow him up, and he will remain sinking down into it until the Day of Resurrection.) This version was recorded only by Ahmad, and its chain of narration is Hasan (sound).</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿فَمَا كَانَ لَهُ مِن فِئَةٍ يَنصُرُونَهُ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُنتَصِرِينَ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then he had no group to help him against Allah, nor was he one of those who could save themselves.) means, his wealth, group, servants and retinue were of no avail to him; they could not protect him from the wrath and vengeance of Allah. Nor could he help himself or save himself. There was no one to help him, neither himself nor anybody else.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">His People learned a Lesson from Him being swallowed up</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s saying:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَأَصْبَحَ الَّذِينَ تَمَنَّوْاْ مَكَانَهُ بِالاٌّمْسِ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And those who had desired his position the day before,) means, those witnessed him with his finery and said:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿قَالَ الَّذِينَ يُرِيدُونَ الْحَيَوةَ الدُّنْيَا يلَيْتَ لَنَا مِثْلَ مَآ أُوتِىَ قَـرُونُ إِنَّهُ لَذُو حَظٍّ عَظِيمٍ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Those who were desirous of the life of the world, said: &#8220;Ah, would that we had the like of what Qarun has been given! Verily, he is the owner of a great fortune.&#8221;) When he was swallowed up in the earth, they began to say:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَيْكَأَنَّ اللَّهَ يَبْسُطُ الرِّزْقَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ وَيَقْدِرُ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Know you not that it is Allah Who expands the provision or restricts it to whomsoever He pleases of His servants.) Wealth does not indicate that Allah is pleased with its owner, for Allah gives and withholds, allows times of difficulty and times of ease, raises and lowers, His is the most complete wisdom and most convincing proof. According to a Hadith narrated by Ibn Mas`ud,</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">«إِنَّ اللهَ قَسَمَ بَيْنَكُمْ أَخْلَاقَكُمْ كَمَا قَسَمَ أَرْزَاقَكُمْ، وَإِنَّ اللهَ يُعْطِي الْمَالَ مَنْ يُحِبُّ وَمَنْ لَا يُحِبُّ، وَلَا يُعْطِي الْإِيمَانَ إِلَّا مَنْ يُحِب»</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah has alloted character among you just as He has alloted your provision. Allah gives wealth to those whom He loves and those whom He does not love, but He gives Faith only to those whom He loves.)</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿لَوْلا أَن مَّنَّ اللَّهُ عَلَيْنَا لَخَسَفَ بِنَا﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Had it not been that Allah was Gracious to us, He could have caused the earth to swallow us up!) meaning, `were it not for the kindness and grace of Allah towards us, we could have been swallowed up by the earth just as he was swallowed up, because we wanted to be like him.&#8217;</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَيْكَأَنَّهُ لاَ يُفْلِحُ الْكَـفِرُونَ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Know you not that the disbelievers will never be successful.) He was a disbeliever, and the disbelievers will never be successful before Allah in this world or in the Hereafter.</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic"><a name="1"></a>﴿تِلْكَ الدَّارُ الاٌّخِرَةُ نَجْعَلُهَا لِلَّذِينَ لاَ يُرِيدُونَ عُلُوّاً فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَلاَ فَسَاداً وَالْعَـقِبَةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ ﴾</span></p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿مَن جَآءَ بِالْحَسَنَةِ فَلَهُ خَيْرٌ مِّنْهَا وَمَن جَآءَ بِالسَّيِّئَةِ فَلاَ يُجْزَى الَّذِينَ عَمِلُواْ السَّيِّئَاتِ إِلاَّ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(83. That is the home of the Hereafter, We shall assign to those who do not want to exalt themselves in the land nor cause corruption. And the good end is for those who have Taqwa.) (84. Whosoever brings good, he shall have the better thereof; and whosoever brings evil, then those who do evil deeds will only be requited for what they used to do.)</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">The Blessings of the Hereafter for the humble Believers</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah tells us that He has made the home of the Hereafter, and its eternal delights which will never change or fade away, for His believing, humble servants who do not rebel against the truth with pride and oppression in the land. They do not exalt themselves above the creatures of Allah, arrogantly oppressing them and spreading corruption among them. `Ikrimah said that this phrase referred to haughtiness and arrogance. Ibn Jurayj said:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿لاَ يُرِيدُونَ عُلُوّاً فِى الاٌّرْضِ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(those who do not want to exalt themselves in the land) &#8220;Arrogance and tyranny,</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَلاَ فَسَاداً﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(nor cause corruption) committing sins.&#8221; Ibn Jarir recorded that `Ali said, &#8220;If a man wants the straps of his sandals to be better than the straps of his companion&#8217;s sandals, then he is one of those referred to in the Ayah,</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿تِلْكَ الدَّارُ الاٌّخِرَةُ نَجْعَلُهَا لِلَّذِينَ لاَ يُرِيدُونَ عُلُوّاً فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَلاَ فَسَاداً وَالْعَـقِبَةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(That is the home of the Hereafter, We shall assign to those who do not want to exalt themselves in the land nor cause corruption. And the good end is for those who have Taqwa.) This is understood to mean that if his intention is to show off and appear better than others, then that is to be condemned, as it was reported in the Sahih that the Prophet said:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">«إِنَّهُ أُوحِيَ إِلَيَّ أَنْ تَوَاضَعُوا حَتَّى لَا يَفْخَرَ أَحَدٌ عَلَى أَحَدٍ وَلَا يَبْغِي أَحَدٌ عَلَى أَحَد»</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(It has been revealed to me that you should be humble to the extent that none of you boasts to others or mistreats others. ) But if a person simply likes to look good, then there is nothing wrong with that. It was recorded that a man said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, I like to have my garment looking good and my shoes looking good &#8212; is this a kind of arrogance&#8221; The Prophet said:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">«لَا، إِنَّ اللهَ جَمِيلٌ يُحِبُّ الْجَمَال»</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(No, for Allah is beautiful and loves beauty&#8230;) And Allah says:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿مَن جَآءَ بِالْحَسَنَةِ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Whosoever brings good,) meaning, on the Day of Resurrection,</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿فَلَهُ خَيْرٌ مِّنْهَا﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(he shall have the better thereof;) meaning, the reward of Allah is better than the good deeds of His servant &#8212; how can it not be, when Allah has multiplied it many times over This is the position of generosity. Then Allah says:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَمَن جَآءَ بِالسَّيِّئَةِ فَلاَ يُجْزَى الَّذِينَ عَمِلُواْ السَّيِّئَاتِ إِلاَّ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and whosoever brings evil, then those who do evil deeds will only be requited for what they used to do.) This is like the Ayah,</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَمَن جَآءَ بِالسَّيِّئَةِ فَكُبَّتْ وُجُوهُهُمْ فِى النَّارِ هَلْ تُجْزَوْنَ إِلاَّ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whoever brings an evil deed, they will be cast down on their faces in the Fire. (And it will be said to them) &#8220;Are you being recompensed anything except what you used to do&#8221;) (27: 90). This is the position of generosity and justice.</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic"><a name="1"></a>﴿إِنَّ الَّذِى فَرَضَ عَلَيْكَ الْقُرْءَانَ لَرَآدُّكَ إِلَى مَعَادٍ قُل رَّبِّى أَعْلَمُ مَن جَآءَ بِالْهُدَى وَمَنْ هُوَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ &#8211;<a name="2"></a> وَمَا كُنتَ تَرْجُو أَن يُلْقَى إِلَيْكَ الْكِتَـبُ إِلاَّ رَحْمَةً مِّن رَّبِّكَ فَلاَ تَكُونَنَّ ظَهيراً لِّلْكَـفِرِينَ &#8211; وَلاَ يَصُدُّنَّكَ عَنْ ءَايَـتِ اللَّهِ بَعْدَ إِذْ أُنزِلَتْ إِلَيْكَ وَادْعُ إِلَى رَبِّكَ وَلاَ تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ &#8211; وَلاَ تَدْعُ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَـهاً ءَاخَرَ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ كُلُّ شَىْءٍ هَالِكٌ إِلاَّ وَجْهَهُ لَهُ الْحُكْمُ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ ﴾</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">During his Caliphate, ‘Alî b. Abî Tâlib – Allah be pleased with him – saw some armor of his with a Christian. He decided to take the matter up legally, so he took the dispute to Shurayh (the Judge).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alî said, “This is my armor, and I have not sold it nor given it away.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shurayh said to the Christian, “What have you to say about what the Amîr of the Believers claims?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Christian replied, “It is my armor, although I do not regard the Amîr of the Believers to be a liar.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shurayh then turned to ‘Alî, “O Amîr of the Believers, do you have any proof (of ownership)?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alî laughed and said, “Shurayh is correct, I have no proof.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Shurayh judged that the armor was the Christian’s.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Christian took it and began to walk away but then returned. He proclaimed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;"> “As for me, I testify that this is the judgment of the Prophets – the Amîr of the Believers himself takes me to his judge and the judge rules against him! I bear witness that there is no deity deserving worship but Allâh and I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allâh. By Allâh, the armor is yours o Amîr of the Believers. I followed the army when you were on your way to the Battle of Siffîn and the armor came out of your equipment.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alî said, “If you have accepted Islâm the armor is yours.” And then he put him on his horse. Al-Sha’bî (the reporter of this incident) said, “I was later informed by those who saw this man that he fought the Khawârij (alongside ‘Alî) at the battle of Nahrawân.”</p>
<p>Ibn Kathîr, <strong><em>Al-Bidâyah wa Al-Nihâyah</em></strong> Vol.8 p5.</p>
