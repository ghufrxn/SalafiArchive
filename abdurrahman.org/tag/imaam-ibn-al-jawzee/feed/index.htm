										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ghamm</strong> Occurs Due To Misfortunes that happened in the past while <strong>hamm</strong> occurs due to an expected misfortune in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When someone has the feeling of grief in regard to his past sins, his grief will benefit him, because he is rewarded for it. Whoever worries about a good deed he wishes to do, his worry will benefit him as well. However if someone grieves for something that he missed from this world, then [he should know] that the missed thing will not return and that grief harms, so practically he is adding harm to harm, as I have mentioned in the previous chapter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A resolute person should protect himself from what brings about grief, and that is losing an object he loves. Therefore, whoever has many objects that he loves, his grief increases, and whoever decreases his objects of love his grief decreases accordingly. Someone may say, when I have no objects of love I also still have grief, we affirm this but we say to him; your grief over not having a loved one is not even a tenth of the grief experienced by the one who has lost a loved one. Have you not noticed that the one who does not have a child lives in grief but not as much as the one who lost his child?! Moreover when a person becomes accustomed to what he loves and enjoys it for a long period of time, it takes over his heart, therefore when he loses it he will feel the bitterness of his loss which will be greater than all the satisfaction he had during his lifetime. This is because the loved one is corresponding to the self just as health corresponds to it, which causes the self not to find satisfaction except in it, for its absence disturbs it. This is why the self grieves for its loss much more than it rejoices in its presence, because the inner self believes that what it had was its given right to possess. Therefore a wise person should monitor the closeness between himself, his beloved to ensure it remains moderately balanced, however if he requires that which brings about grief [i.e. loving some object or person], this causes grief then the cure is first to believe in predestination and that whatever Allah predestines is going to happen. He should then know that life is founded on distress, all constructed buildings shall eventually be ruined, all gatherings shall eventually depart, and whoever wants the lasting of what does not last is like he who wants what does not exist to exist. Therefore he should not ask of life what it was not created for.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A poet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It [worldly life] is founded on distress yet you want it, Free of harm and distress </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should imagine that what befell him is multiplied, for this is when what he suffers will be easier on him. It is a habit of smart porters to put something heavy on top of what they are carrying, and then after taking a few steps, to remove the heavy object as that makes what they are carrying feel lighter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should also wait, in times of prosperity for an attack of tribulation, so that if any tribulation befalls him, he should think of what remains instead of what he has lost so that when part of that befalls him it becomes very easy on him. Such as when some- one loses some money so he counts what remains, and then considers the remaining as a profit. Or if someone imagines that he loses his eyesight, so that when he has ophthalmia, it becomes easy on him to bear this illness, likewise with the rest of harmful matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A poet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The prudent imagines in himself,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>his tribulations before they befall him.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>If they suddenly befall him,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>they do not surprise him because he had already imagined them.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the ignorant trusts the days,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>and he forgets the demise of those who came before him.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So when trials of times surprise him,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>with some trials he becomes lost</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Though if he was strict in his affairs,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>patience would have taught him boldness</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A member of the righteous predecessors said, &#8220;I saw a woman, whose youthfulness surprised me, I said, &#8216;[There is no doubt] This face has never suffered from sorrow or sadness.&#8217; She said, Do not say that! For I do not know anyone who has suffered from what I have suffered. I had a husband who bought a sacrificial animal and slaughtered it, and we had two sons. The eldest told the one younger than him, &#8216;Come and I will show you how our father slaughtered the ewe/ So he slaughtered his brother. When we started to look for him, he ran away and my husband died while looking for him/ I said, &#8216;So how are you handling your sorrow?&#8217; She said, &#8216;If I could find aid in sorrow I would have employed it.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Section One: Treating Sorrow, Sadness and Grief</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sorrow, sadness and grief may befalls one due the prevalence of blackness, which should be treated with what will remove this blackness; which are the things that bring about joy. Grief freezes the blood while happiness heats it until its intrinsic heat is raised, both of them (happiness and grief) can harm, and may lead to death, if they are not immediately kept within moderate levels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Devil&#8217;s Deception of People by giving them High Hopes (of living long)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many Jews and Christians contemplated joining Islam, but Iblis convinced them to procrastinate saying: &#8220;Do not rush, look more into the issue.&#8221; Until they die as non-Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also causes the sinner to procrastinate seeking repentance. A poet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Do not rush into committing a sin,</strong><br />
<strong>and then procrastinate repenting.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Iblis makes those seeking righteousness feel lazy, and he causes those who are serious to procrastinate. He convinces a jurist to rest instead of going over his lesson again. And convinces a worshipper who had woken up to pray at night that he still has a lot of time. <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Iblis tries to make people lazy procrastinators, and to make them have hope (of a long life)</strong></span>. A disciplined person must take advantage of time, and never procrastinate. That which is feared can never be trusted, and that which passes can never be brought back again. The main reason for doing less good and more evil is relying on the hope of a long life, this is because a person continues to pro­crastinate performing good deeds and refraining from evil deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He who hopes to wake up in the morning will not do much at night, and he who hopes to travel during the day will travel much at night. However, he who sees death to be near works hard during his life. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: &#8220;<strong>Perform prayer as if you were departing</strong>.&#8221; [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the Salaf said: &#8220;<strong>Beware of procrastination, for it is one of devil&#8217;s strongest weapons</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A disciplined person prepares for his journey, while a procrastinator doesn&#8217;t. So when it comes time to travel the disciplined person feels happy while the procrastinator feels that he is in trouble. This is how people are. Some are alert, so when the Angel of Death comes they do not feel guilty. Others are not disciplined, so they feel the agony when it comes time to travel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If procrastination is part of your nature then repelling it becomes difficult. But when one knows that he has a persistant enemy he will always be on guard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah to give us safety from the enemy&#8217;s cunning, the devil&#8217;s fttnah&#8217;s and the evils of ourselves and the dunyd. Indeed He is near and responsive.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">When death befalls someone, he should know that it is an hour of serious suffering because it is a moment of severe pain, when he is leaving all objects of love, his loved ones, and to all that the horror of the throes of death and fear of where his wealth go. Then Shaytan comes and attempts to have the slave [of Allah] become discontent with his Lord, he tells him &#8216;Look at you! What made you die? Is it painful? You are leaving your wife, your children and you will be laid under the ground? So he might cause him to become discontent with his Lord, hating Allaah&#8217;s decree, making him say things that include any kind of objection , or he might make him unjust in his will, giving some of the inheritors preference over others, to on and so forth. In this case, we need to cure the whispers of Shaytaan and cure the self .</p>
<p>Abu Dawood reported from Abu al-Yusr (radiy Allaahu anhu) that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) used to say,</p>
<h1 style="text-align:center;"> أعوذ بك أن يتخبطني الشيطان عند الموت</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Aoodhubika an ya takhabaTani ash-Shaytaan ‘indal Mawt</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;I seek refuge in You that Shaytaan flounders me at death: [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In that minute Shaytaan tells his assistants,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;If you miss him now [i.e. you do not succeed to lead him astray before he dies], you will never catch him again [i.e. you will never be able to deviate him at any other time].&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the cure for these trials we should first mention that whoever is mindful of Allah while in good health, Allah will protect him when he is ill, and whoever observes Allah in his thoughts, Allah will protect him when he moves his bodily parts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;">Al-Khattaab said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;His seeking refuge in the &#8216;<strong>floundering of Shaytaan at death</strong>&#8216;, that is if Shaytaan seizes him when he leaves this world, preventing him from repenting or hinders him from mending his affairs, leaving an injustice or he makes him despair from the mercy of Allaah or makes him hate death or be sorry for this life, so he becomes discontented with Allah&#8217;s decree in dissolution, going to the hereafter, so one has a bad end and he meets his Lord while he is discontented with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was narrated that the Shaytaan is never tougher on a man as in death and he tells his assistants: &#8216;<strong>Take this person! if you miss him today you will never catch him again</strong>.&#8217; We seek refuge in Allah from his evil, we ask him to bless our death and to have a good end.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[1] Reported by Abu Dawood 1552-1553, al-Nasa&#8217;i[8:283] through the chain of Afla&#8217; Mawla (emancipated slave) of Abu Ayyub from Abu al-Yusr that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) used to pray, <strong>&#8220;O Allah! I seek refuge in you from dying under abolishment, not being deliberate, I seek refuge in you from drowning, from burning and from senility, I seek refuge in you that Shaytaan flounders me at death, I seek refuge in you that I die while escaping from fighting for Your sake and I seek refuge in you from dying because of a sting.&#8221;</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;These ropes are the various lusts with which I strike on the children of Adam.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahya asked: &#8216;Does there exist a rope for me too?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Satan said: &#8216;Yes.&#8217; When you satiate yourself with food, you experience weightiness and it is for this reason you become disinclined to perform prayers, remembrance and supplications.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hearing this, Yahya vowed: By Allah! Never shall I eat to my fill, ever again.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Iblis responded by pledging: And by Allah, never shall I give advice to a Muslim, ever again.&#8217;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Paperback 592 Pages<br />
ISBN : 9780904336051<br />
Publisher : Dar as-Sunnah</p>
<p><strong>About The Book</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is from enmity and hopelessness of the devil that his endeavour to misguide mankind from the Path of Allah will persist. This misguidance takes many shades and forms; be it from planting seeds of doubt, or giving rise to deviant ideas antithetical to the sacred teachings of Islam, and essentially becoming entangled within regressive intellectual and rhetorical discourses. The Ummah has suffered varying levels of deviation, some of which remain prevalent today, while more continue to be uncovered &#8211; and such is the impact of delusive plottings of the devil and his allies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book is the sixth instalment from Dar as-Sunnah of the illustrious Imam, Abu&#8217;l-Faraj Ibn Jawzi. Being a complete translation of his well-known and prized work, Ibn Jawzi enumerates within it, many of the mechanisms and modus operandi used by the devil in deceiving and leading mankind away from the Straight Path. It is of particular value and importance because only by unearthing and accentuating some of the traps of the devil, can mankind avoid them as well as navigate others away from falling prey to his harm.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Speaking about the devil and his plotting, the author wrote that, &#8220;he was only able to do so while creeping during the night of ignorance. Had the dawn of knowledge shone on him, he would have been exposed. Thus I decided to warn from his plots for identifying evil is a form of warning from it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This translation of Tablees Iblees will provide important analysis in developing self-awareness and critical thinking to ward off many deceptions of the devil, which have plagued mankind from the time of Adam. For such reasons alone, this work is a valuable addition to the scholarly discourse it presents to the English speaking world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>About the Author:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abu&#8217;l-Faraj Jamal al-Din Abdul Rahman ibn Ali Ibn Muhammad ibn Ali Ibn Ubayd Allah Ibn al-Jawzi al-Qurashi al Tamimi al Bakri al-Baghdadi al-Hanbali (509/510-597) was the Imam of the Hanbalis and foremost orator of kings and commoners in his time, whose gatherings reportedly reached one hundred thousand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A hadith master, philologist, commentator of Qur&#8217;an, expert jurist, physician, and historian of superb character and exquisite manners.<br />
Ibn al-Jawzi was a prolific author of over seven hundred books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was the author of a vast number of works of which several have been printed in recent times. He was famous as a preacher and the traveller Ibn Jubair gives an enthusiastic account of two of his sermons heard in Baghdad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was born in 509/510 AH in the city of Baghdad and grew up studying under the leading scholars of the time, He also was noted for his scholarship in the fields of history, linguistics, tafseer and fiqh. In fact, he became the leading scholar of the Hanbali Madhab of his time and played an important role in reviving and spreading it, especially after the become a favorite of the Abassid Caliph, al Mustadi</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Jawzi was severely tried towards the end of his life when his criticism of Shaykh `Abd al-Qadir al-Gilani &#8211; his senior of forty years &#8211; led to accusations made against him to the Sultan al-Nasir by the Shaykh&#8217;s children and supporters. He was taken from Baghdad to the city of Wasit where he remained imprisoned for five years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Jawzi passed away in 597 AH, two years after his release from Imprisonment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What Can This Eternal Life be Bought With?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">WHEN A PERSON THINKS about the life of this world before entering it, he considers it long. Likewise, when he thinks about it after leaving it, he sees a long period of time and knows that the stay in the grave is long. When he thinks about the Day of judgment, he knows that its fifty thousand years long, and when he thinks about Paradise and Hell, he knows that they will never end.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now, when he goes back to look at the time spent in this world, lets say 60 years, he can see that thirty of it is spent sleeping, fifteen or so is spent in childhood and most of what&#8217;s left goes to chasing after desires, food and money. When he accounts for what is left, he finds that much of it is nothing but showing off and heedlessness. The price of eternal life is the hours of his life, but what is left of them for him to buy it with?!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Truly, <strong>most of the blessings I have been given have not been earned by me but rather they are conferred as a result of the planning of The Gentle One alone.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I remember myself as a child: A highly motivated six-year old sitting in class with older boys. The intellect I had been given superseded of old men. <strong>I do not recall myself playing on the road with other kids or even laughing out loud. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I was seven or so, I attended the gatherings in the Masjid. I would not sit in a circle of mere wordplay, but searching for a Hadeeth Scholar who would narrate about the Prophet’s (Sall-Allaahu ‘alayhi wa Sallam) life. <strong>I would memorize everything he said, then go back home and write it down.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was blessed for being granted my teacher Abu al-Fadl ibn Nasir (Rahimahullaah) who would take me to different Scholars and let me hear the Musnad [of Imaam Ahmad] and other major works.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>All this time I had no idea of why I was made to do these things.</strong> My teacher recorded all I had heard, and when I reached puberty he handed me this record. I accompanied him till his death, and through him I learned the science of Hadeeth and transmission.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The kids used to go down to Tigris River and play on the bridge, <strong>but when I was small I used to take a book and sit far from people by the shore studying Sacred Knowledge. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Then I was inspired to abandon the vanities of this world so I began constant fasting and reduced my food intake to very little.</strong> I trained myself to be patient, embarking on a continuous pursuit in order to do so and staying up at night.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I didn’t feel satisfied with studying just one science so I read jurisprudence, sermon delivery and Hadeeth and followed those who practiced Zuhd. After that I studied linguistics. There was not a narrating Scholar or a preacher where I lived who I didn’t sit with and whenever such a person would arrive from elsewhere I would go to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>I used to choose of virtuous deeds what suited me and if I had to choose between two things I usually chose the right of al-Haqq (Allaah). </strong>He has planned my life and cultivated me in a beautiful fashion, guiding me towards what is best for me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He has protected me from my enemies, the jealous, and those who might plot against me. He has made everything convenient for my studies of Sacred Knowledge and sent me books from unexpected places. He gave me good understanding, the ability to memorize and write quickly and a talent for authoring books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I lacked nothing of this world. As a matter of fact, things were quite the opposite as Allaah gave me more than enough. He put a great deal of acceptance of me into peoples’ hearts and made the impact of my words leave them not questioning the authenticity of what I had to say.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Approximately 200 thimmis [i.e. people of the book who live in Muslim lands according to a truce contract] have become Muslim at my hands <strong>and over 100 000 sinners have repented in my gatherings.</strong> More than 20 000 men have announced their repentance from foolish ways during my exhortations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I used to go around Hadeeth gatherings of different Scholars and run till I was out of breath so no-one would precede me. <strong>I would start my day having nothing to eat and finish it having nothing to eat.</strong> Never did Allaah degrade me to take from another person, instead He provided for me in order to protect my honour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Truth is, mentioning all my experience would take quite a while. And here I am now and you can see what I have achieved. <strong>I will tell you the whole story in one single sentence,</strong> and that is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ وَيُعَلِّمُكُمُ اللَّهُ</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">”<strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">Fear Allaah, and Allaah will teach you</span>.</strong>” [Surah al-Baqarah:282]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Talbees Iblees: pg. 162-163<br />
Taken from Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then a group of people – i.e. from the Sufis – came and began to speak to them concerning hunger, poverty, whisperings and notions. And they authored books on these subjects, as was the case with Al-Haarith Al-Muhaasibee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then another group of people came (afterward) that revised the way of Sufism, characterizing it with attributes by which they distinguished it (from its original state), such as: wearing old tattered clothes, hearing (music), bursting out in passionate emotions, dancing and clapping. And they particularized themselves by exceeding in cleanliness and purification.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then this matter (Sufism) continued to flourish, and their shaikhs began to fabricate stories for them and speak about their mystical occurrences. This affirmed their remoteness from the scholars. Rather, this even affirmed their view that what they were upon was the most complete forms of knowledge, such that they named it the hidden knowledge (<i>al-‘ilm-ul-baatin</i>), while making knowledge of the Religion, apparent knowledge (<i>al-‘ilm-uhd-dhaahir</i>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among them were those whose severity in hunger brought them to fancy corrupt notions. So they would claim strong love and passion for the truth. It was as if they imagined a figure with a beautiful appearance and thus fell madly in love with it. These individuals linger between disbelief and innovation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then these people divided into various orders and their beliefs grew corrupt. So among them were those who held the view that Allaah is incarnate in His creation (<i>hulool</i>), and those who held the view that the Creator and creation were in reality one existence (<i>Ittihaad</i>)!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Devil did not stop speaking to them about different types of innovations until they made them into aspects of the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there came Abu ‘Abdir-Rahmaan As-Sulamee who wrote a book for them called ‘<i>as-Sunan</i>.’ He also compiled a book for them called ‘<i>Haqaa’iq-ut-Tafseer</i>’, in which he mentioned amazing things about them (i.e. Sufis) concerning their interpretation of the Qur’aan, based on the (mystical things) that occurred to them, without tracing that back to any of the sources where knowledge is derived from. And indeed, what brought them to take such things and place them as their views was their state of daze, due to their strict abstinence of food and their love for talking at great lengths of the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Mansoor ‘Abdur-Rahmaan Al-Qazaaz informed us that: Abu Bakr Al-Khateeb informed us, saying: Muhammad bin Yoosuf Al-Qattaan An-Naisaburee said to me: &#8220;Abu ‘Abdir-Rahmaan As-Sulamee is not reliable. He was not able to hear anything except for a few sounds, due to deafness. So when the ruler Abu ‘Abdillaah bin Al-Bay’ died, he began to narrate hadeeth on the authority of Al-A’asam from Taareekh Yahyaa Ibn Ma’een as well as other books besides it. And he would fabricate <i>ahaadeeth</i> for the Sufis.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Nasr As-Siraaj wrote a book for them called ‘<i>Lum’-us-Soofiyyah</i>’ in which he stated horrendous beliefs and hideous statements that we will mention later in more detail, by the Will of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Abu Taalib Al-Makkee wrote the book <i>Qoot-ul-Quloob </i>in which he mentioned fabricated ahaadeeth and narrations that cannot be traced back to any source with regard to the subject of prayers during the days and nights and other subjects. He also mentioned false doctrines in it and constantly repeated statements such as: <b>&#8220;Some of the mukaashifeen (those to whom Allaah has disclosed secrets of hidden realities) have stated&#8230;&#8221;</b> These types of words are empty and pointless. He also mentions in it, relating from some Sufis, that Allaah reveals aspects of the hidden matters to his &#8220;saints&#8221; in this world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Mansoor Al-Qazaaz informed us: Abu Bakr Al-Khateeb informed us, saying: Abu Taahir Muhammad bin al-‘Ullaaf said: &#8220;Abu Taalib Al-Makkee entered the city of Basrah after the death of Abul-Husayn bin Saalim and ascribed to his views. The he traveled to Baghdad and the people gathered around him in the place of admonition to hear from him. So he began to speak but got confused and began to mix up his words. It was memorized from him that he said: <b>&#8216;There is nothing more harmful to the creation than the Creator.’</b> So the people declared him an innovator and deserted him completely. Afterward, he was prevented from speaking to the people.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khateeb said: &#8220;Abu Taalib Al-Makkee wrote a book in the language of the Sufis called <i>Qoot-ul-Quloob</i> in which he mentioned many horrendous and repugnant things concerning Allaah’s Attributes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there came Abu Nu’aim Al-Asbahaanee who wrote a book for them called ‘<i>Hilyat-ul-Awliyaa</i>’, in which he mentioned many evil and despicable things on the laws of Sufism. And he had no shame in stating that Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Uthmaan and ‘Alee, as well as the rest of the high-ranking Companions, were from among the Sufis! So in this book, he spoke of amazing things that occurred to them. He also mentioned Shuraih Al-Qaadee, Al-Hasan Al-Basree, Sufyaan Ath-Thawree and Ahmad bin Hanbal as being from among them (i.e. the Sufis). Similarly, in ‘<i>Tabaqaat-us-Soofiyyah</i>&#8216;, As-Sulamee mentioned Fudail (bin ‘Iyyaad), Ibraaheem bin Adham and Ma’roof Al-Kurkhee as being from among the Sufis, by pointing out that they were individuals who abstained from the worldly life and its luxuries (zuhd).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufism is a way that is well known for exceeding in abstinence of worldly luxuries (<i>zuhd</i>). What shows the difference between them (i.e. scholars above, and the Sufis) is that no one ever condemned abstinence (<i>zuhd</i>), whereas Sufism was condemned because of what we will mention later.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abd-ul-Kareem bin Hawaazin Al-Qushayree wrote a book for them called ‘<i>ar-Risaalah</i>’, in which he mentioned many far-fetched and mystical things such as talk on <i>al-fanaa </i>(annihilation) and <i>al-baqaa </i>(subsistence), <i>al-qabd </i>(contraction), <i>al-bast </i>(expansion), <i>al-waqt </i>(the moment), <i>al-haal </i>(ecstasy), <i>al-wajd </i>(finding) and <i>al-wujood </i>(existence), <i>al-jam’ </i>(union) and <i>tafaruqqah</i> (separation), <i>as-sahu </i>(clarity) and <i>as-sakr </i>(drunkenness), <i>adh-dhawq </i>(taste) and <i>ash-sharab </i>(drink), <i>al-mahu </i>(effacement) and <i>al-ithbaat </i>(affirmation), <i>at-tajallee </i>(manifestation) and <i>al-muhaadarah </i>(presence), <i>al-mukaashafah</i> (unveiling) and <i>al-lawa’ih</i>, <i>at-tawaali’ </i>and <i>al-lawaami’</i>, <i>at-takween</i> and <i>at-tamkeen</i>, <i>ash-sharee’ah </i>and <i>al-haqeeqah </i>(reality),[1] and other insanities that do not amount to anything. And his tafseer is even more bizarre than this!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there came Muhammad bin Taahir Al-Maqdisee who wrote &#8216;<i>Safwat-ut-Tasawwuf</i>&#8216; for them, in which he stated things that any person with common sense would feel ashamed to mention! We will mention what is proper from its subjects, with the Will of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there came Abu Haamid Al-Ghazaalee who wrote the book &#8216;<i>Ihyaa ‘Uloom-ud-Deen</i>&#8216; for them, according to the methodology of the (Sufi) people, which he filled with baseless ahaadeeth even though he knew well they were baseless. He spoke about knowledge of the <i>Mukaashafah </i>(unveiling of unseen by Allaah to Sufis) and withdrew from the principles of Fiqh. And he stated such things as: ‘Indeed the stars, the sun and the moon, which Ibraaheem saw, were in fact lights that screened Allaah!’ Such things are not mentioned in any of the sources of knowledge. Rather, this is from the types of speech of the Baatiniyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Al-Ghazaalee) also said in the book &#8216;<i>Al-Mufsih bil-Ahwaal</i>&#8216;: &#8220;While in their state of wakefulness, the Sufis are able to witness the angels and souls of the prophets, hear their voices and take hold of benefit from them. Then this condition escalates from the witnessing (of their) images to levels in which they are contained within these domains.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The factors that caused these individuals to write these books was their little knowledge of the Sunnah, Islaam and the narrations, as well as their dedication for what they approved of from the way of the people (Sufis). They only approved this way because of adoration for abstinence (<i>zuhd</i>) that was established in their souls. They did not see any condition better than the condition of these people (Sufis) in regards to appearance, nor any speech more pleasant than their speech, whereas in the biographies of the Salaf, they found a form of harshness. So the people inclined very strongly towards these individuals (Sufis).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was due to what we stated previously, that it was a way, which was characterized outwardly by cleanliness and worship, whereas on the inside, it was about indulging in leisure and hearing music, which the bodily dispositions incline to. The original Sufis would flee from the leaders and authorities. However (in later times) they became friends.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The majority of these books that were compiled for them have things in them that cannot be traced back to any (authentic) source. Rather, they are only based on mystical occurrences that befell some of them, which they managed to take hold of and record. They called this hidden knowledge (<i>al-‘ilm-ul-baatin</i>). Abu Ya’qoob Ishaaq bin Hayya said: &#8220;I heard Ahmad bin Hanbal once when asked about the occurrence of delusions and notions, so he replied: <b>&#8216;The Sahaabah and the Taabi’een never spoke about such things.&#8217;</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b style="line-height:1.5em;">Footnotes:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <b>Translator’s Note:</b> These are names for Sufi concepts and beliefs. Some of them have been defined as such: Fanaa: (Annihilation) A state in which the mureed (Sufi) becomes so absorbed in dhikr that he becomes unaware of himself and his surroundings and is at tranquility with the remembrance of his Lord, negating or annilihating his self. Bast (Expansion) and Qabd (Contraction) refer to the various degrees of relative union and separation from the Creator. Baqaa: The consciousness of survival in Allaah. Waqt: (Time) The moment in which someone becomes conscious of the reality and the Creator; the mureed is neither in the past or the future. Mukaashafah: (Unveiling) The state in which the Truth (Allaah) and the Unseen become revealed to the Sufi. Tajallee: (manifestation) the state in which Allaah manifests revelation to the Sufi. Sakr: (Drunkenness) A state in which the mureed is absorbed in the hidden matters to the point that the common person cannot understand him. Wajd: (Finding) State of ecstasy in which the Sufi finds the realization and presence of Allaah, usually after hearing (Samaa) dhikr. Jam’: (Union) A state in which the Sufi only sees the Truth (Allaah) without the creation. Muhaadarah: (Presence) Being in the presence of Allaah. Tafarruqah or Farq: (Separation) When the Sufi in the state of Fanaa sees the creation (i.e. himself), the opposite of Jam’. And Allaah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Shytan has power over the believers due to their sins</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A hadith states, &#8220;Allah is with the judge as long as he does not commit any injustice. If he commits any injustice, Allah is free from him and keeps Shytan with him.&#8221; [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Abu al-Faraj ibn al-Jauzi</strong> [2] has related a unique story from <strong>al-Hassan al-Basri</strong> (rahimahullah). The story, depending on how authentic it is, shows the ability of a human in overpowering Shytan if he is sincere to Allah in his religion and it shows how Shytan can take advantage of the human when he strays.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan al-Basri narrated that there was a tree that was worshipped instead of Allah. One man decided to chop down that tree. He was going to chop down the tree out of anger for the sake of Allah. On the way to the tree he met Iblees who was in the form of a man. Iblees asked him, &#8220;What do you plan on doing?&#8221; The man answered, &#8220;I am going to chop down that tree that is worshipped instead of Allah.&#8221; Shytan said, &#8220;If you do not worship it, why should it harm you if others do so?&#8221; The man replied, &#8220;I will chop it down.&#8221; Shytan then told him, &#8220;Would you like something better than that&#8221; Do not cut it and you will get two dinars every morning under your pillow.&#8221; &#8220;From where will I get that?&#8221; the man asked. &#8220;I will give it to you,&#8221; said Iblees. The man returned and the next morning he found two dinars under his pillow. The following morning he again found two dinars under his pillow. On the following morning he did not find anything. He got upset and went to chop down the tree. Shytan again appeared to him in the shape of the same man. Shytan asked him, &#8220;What do you want to do?&#8221; The man answered, &#8220;I plan on cutting down that tree that is worshipped instead of Allah!&#8221; Iblees said, &#8220;You have lied. There is no way you will be able to do it,&#8221; The man left to chop it down. The earth swallowed him and him until it almost killed him. Iblees asked, &#8220;Do you know who I . I am Shytan. I met you for the first time when you were angry for the sake of Allah and I had no power over you. I deceived you by two dinars and you stopped what you had intended to do [for the sake of Allah]. Now you have come because you are angry about the two dinars, and I have gotten mastery over you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>[1] This was recorded by al-Haakim and al-Baihaqi with a hasan chain. See al- Albanee Sahih al-Jaami, vol. 2, p.130</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>[2] Ibn al-Jawzi, Talbees Iblees, p. 43 [The author, al-Ashqar alluded to the fact that the authenticity of this story needs to be ascertained. Most likely, it is from the Israaeeliyaat or stories of the Jews and Christians.]</em></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Wahb ibn Munabbih has related the following lengthy story from the people of the book.” We present it here to show the way of Shytan in his attempt to mislead mankind. The story warns humans about Shytan”s “sincere advice”. One must oppose the thing that Shytan is calling to. Wahb said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a pious worshipper of the tribe of Israel. He was the most pious person of his time. During his time, there were three brothers who had a sister. She was a virgin. And they had no sister other than her. They were all about to leave the town to go to war. They did not know with whom to leave their sister and who they could trust to look after her. They all agreed to leave her with that pious person. They all trusted him. They went to him and asked if they could leave her with him. She would be in the building next to him until they return from the fighting. He refused their request and sought refuge in Allah from them and their sister. They persisted until he finally acquiesced. He said, “Put her in the house next to my place of worship.” So they put her in that house and they left, leaving her there. She remained living next to that pious person for some time. He would put food for her in front of his building of worship. Then he would lock the door and return to his place of worship. He would then tell her to come out of her house and take the food. Then Shytan approached him softly. He encouraged him to treat her kindly. He told him that it was not good to make the woman come out of her house during the day as someone may come upon her. If he took the food directly to her door that would mean a greater reward for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continued for some time to go to her door and place the food at the front of her door without speaking to her. Then Iblees came again and encouraged him to do good and get more reward. He said, “If you took her the food and placed it in the house for her, you would get a greater reward.” He continued to encourage him. So he started to take the food into her house. He continued like that for some time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Iblees came again and again encouraged him to do good. He said, “If you talk to her for a while she will be put to ease by your conversation as she is in a state of fear and she is all alone.” He then started talking to her from atop his place of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Iblees came again. He said, “If you were to come down and talk to her while she sits at her door and talks to you, that would be even more comforting for her.” He continued to encourage him until he came down and sat at his door and would talk to her. The girl would come out of her building and sit at her door and they would talk for a while.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Iblees came again and encouraged him to get great rewards for treating her well. He said, “If you were to go from the door of your place of worship and sit close to her door, that would be even more comforting for her.” He continued exhorting him until he did so. He continued that act for a while. Then Iblees came again. This time he said, “If you enter her house and talk to her, and not make her show her face in public it would be even better for you.” He continued exhorting him until he entered her house and spent the whole day talking to her. Then when night fell, he returned to his place of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Iblees came to him after that and continued to make her more appealing to him. Until the worshipper got upon her and kissed her. And Iblees continued to make her look nice in his eyes and desire her until he finally had sex with her. She got pregnant and gave birth to a boy. Then Iblees came and told the worshipper, “Do you not realize what the brothers of the girl will do to you when they see she has given birth to your son” You will not be safe if your matter becomes clear. You should go to the boy and kill it and bury it, that way you can conceal your affair and they will not do anything to you for what you did to her.” Then he said to him, “Do you think she will conceal from her brothers what you did to her and your killing of her son. Take her, kill her and bury her with her son.” He continued spurring him on until he killed her and threw her in the ditch with her son. Then he put a large rock over them and leveled it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he returned to his place of worship and worshipped therein. He stayed in that state for as long as Allah willed until the brothers came back from the fighting. They came to him and asked him about their sister. He mourned her loss and started to cry. He said, “She was the best of women and that is her grave.” The brothers came to the grave and cried over their sister and asked Allah to have mercy on her. They stayed at her grave for a few days and then went to their families. When the night overtook them and they went to their beds, Shytan came to them in their sleep in the form of a traveler. He started with the eldest and asked him about their sister. The brother told him what the pious man had stated and how they were shown her grave. Shytan told him that the pious man had lied. He said, “He did not tell you the truth about your sister. He got her pregnant and she had his son and then he killed and buried her out of fear of you. Then he threw them in a ditch he dug behind the door of the house she was staying in, to the right of the entrance. Go and enter the house in which she stayed and on the right of the entrance you will find everything I told you about.” Then he went to the middle brother and did the same. Then he went to the youngest brother and did the same. When they woke, they were all surprised at what they had seen. When they met each other, they all said, “Isaw an amazing thing last night,” and they informed each other of what they had seen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eldest said, “That dream has nothing to it so just ignore it.” The youngest said, “I will not leave it until I go and look at that place.” They all went until they reached the door of the place where there sister stayed. They opened the door and looked for the place that was described to them in their dreams. They found their sister and her son buried in a ditch, as they were told. They asked the worshipper about it and he confirmed what Iblees had told them. They then took him and were about to crucify him. When they had him on the wooden cross, Shytan said to him, “You know that I am your companion who tempted you by the woman until you got her pregnant and you killed her and her son. If you obey me today and deny Allah, who formed and shaped you, I will rescue you from your predicament.” The worshipper then belied Allah. When he belied Allah, Shytan left from being between him and the others and they were able to crucify him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many scholars related this story in their commentary to the following verse,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Or the likeness of Shytan when he tells man to disbelieve, then, when he disbelieves, says to him,  “Lo! I am innocent of you. Lo! I fear Allah, the Lord of the Worlds” ” (Surah al-Hasr 16).</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They mention that this verse refers to this worshipper and to others similar to him. Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">This story, and others similar to it, are from the Israaeeliyaat or stories which have their source in the books or tales of the Jews and Christians. We do not say it is true nor do we say it is false, but it is allowed to narrate them as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “Narrate stories about the Tribe of Israel if there is no harm in that.</span></p>
