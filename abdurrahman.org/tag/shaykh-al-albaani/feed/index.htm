<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>ḤADĪTH 1</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The messenger of Allah (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>أتَانِي جِبْرِيْلُ ، فَقَالَ : يَا مُحَمَّدُ ، عِشْ مَا شِئْتَ فَإِنَّكَ مَيِّتٌ ، وَأَحْببْ مَنْ شِئْتَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>فَإِنَّكَ مُفَارِقُهُ ، وَاعْمَلْ مَا شِئْتَ فَإِنَّكَ مَجْزِيٌّ بهِ ، وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ شَرَفَ الْمُؤْمِنِ قِيَامُ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>اللَّيْلِ ، وَعِزَّهُ اسْتِغْنَاؤُهُ عَنْ النَّاسِ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">Jibrīl came to me and said, “Oh Muhammad, live how you like for you will certainly die. Love whom you like for you will certainly leave him. Do as you like for you will certainly be compensated for it. And know that the dignity of a believer is his standing at night (in prayer), and his honor is his managing himself without need of other people.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Albānī’s Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah (no. 831)]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">ḤADĪTH 2</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abū Hurayrah (رضي الله عنه) reported that Allah’s messenger (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) asked:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> أَتَدْرُوْنَ مَا الْمُفْلِسُ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Do you know what a bankrupt person is?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They replied, “A bankrupt person among us is the one with no money or possessions.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) continued:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الْمُفْلِسَ مِنْ أُمَّتِي يَأْتِي يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ بصَلاةٍ وَصِيَامٍ وَزَكَاةٍ، وَيَأْتِي قَدْ شَتَمَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">هَذَا.، وَقَذَفَ هَذَا ، وَأَكَلَ مَالَ هَذَا ، وَسَفَكَ دَمَ هَذَا ، وَضَرَبَ هَذَا ، فَيُعْطَى هَذَا </span><span style="color:#000000;">مِنْ حَسَنَاتِهِ ، وَهَذَا مِنْ حَسَنَاتِهِ ، فَإِنْ فَنِيَتْ حَسَنَاتُهُ قَبْلَ أَنْ يُقْضَى مَا عَلَيْهِ ، </span><span style="color:#000000;">أُخِذَ مِنْ خَطَايَاهِمْ فَطُرِحَتْ عَلَيْهِ ، ثُمَّ طُرِحَ فِي النَّارِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">The bankrupt person from my nation is the one who will come on the Day of Resurrection with prayer, fasting, and charity. But he had insulted this person, slandered that person, cheated this person out of money, spilled this person’s blood, and hit that person. Each of these people (he harmed) will then be given some of his good deeds. And if his good deeds run out before settling his affairs, their sins will be taken and put upon the man, then he will be thrown in the fire.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Albānī’s Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah (no. 847)]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>ḤADĪTH 3</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jābir Ibn ‘Abdullah (رضي الله عنه) reported that the messenger of Allah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اِتَّقُوْا الظُّلْمَ ، فَإِنَّ الظُّلْمَ ظُلُمَاتٌ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ، وَاتَّقُوْا الشُحَّ ، فَإِنَّ الشُّحَّ </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَهْلَكَ مَنْ كَانَ قَبْلَكُمْ ، حَمَلَهُمْ عَلَى أَنْ سَفَكُوْا دِمَاءَهُمْ وَاسْتَحَلُّوْا مَحَارِمَهُمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">Beware of oppression because oppression will become darkness on the Day of Resurrection. And beware of stinginess because stinginess destroyed those who came before you. It led them to shed each other’s blood and declare each other’s sanctity permissible to violate.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Albānī’s Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah No. 858]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">ḤADĪTH 4</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Faḍālah Ibn ‘Ubayd reported in a marfū’[<span style="color:#ff0000;">5</span>] form:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اجْعَلُوْا بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَ النَّارِ حِجَابًا ، وَلَوْ بشِقِّ تَمْرَةٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">Construct between yourself and the fire a barrier even with half a date (given in charity).</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Albānī’s Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah No. 897]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">5</span>] Ibn al-‘Uthaymīn, in Muṣṭalaḥ al-Ḥadīth, explained a marfū’ ḥadīth as one that is either raised to the status of being directly attributed to the prophet (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) as his explicit statement, action, approval, or as a physical or character description, or it is determined for a number of reasons that the statement carries the ruling of being attributed to the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">ḤADĪTH 5</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas (رضي الله عنه) reported in a marfū’ form:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا أَرَادَ اللَّهَ بعَبْدٍ خَيْرًا عَجَّلَ لَهُ العُقُوْبَةَ فِي الدُّنْيَا ، وَإِذَا أَرَادَ اللَّهَ بعَبْدٍ شَرًّا </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْسَكَ عَلَيْهِ ذُنُوْبَهُ حَتَّى يُوَافِيْهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>When Allah wants good for a servant, He hastens his punishment (for his sins) in this life. And if Allah wants bad for a servant, he preserves his sins for him until he meets Him on the Day of Resurrection.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Albānī’s Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah No. 1220]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">ḤADĪTH 6</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Amr Ibn al-Ḥamaq (رضي الله عنه) reported in a marfū’ ḥadīth:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا أَرَادَ اللَّهُ بعَبْدٍ خَيْرًا عَسَّلَهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>When Allah wants good for a servant, He makes others pleased with him. It was asked, “And what is this pleasing respect others have for him, messenger of Allah?” He answered:</strong></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَفْتَحُ لَهُ عَمَلاً صَالِحًا بَيْنَ يَدَيْ مَوْتِهِ حَتَّى يَرْضَى عَنْهُ مَنْ حَوْلَهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">He makes the person able to do good deeds at the time of his death so that those around him are pleased with him.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Albānī’s Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah No. 1114]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">ḤADĪTH 7</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Uqbah Ibn ‘Āmir (رضي الله عنه) reported in a marfū’ form:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا رَأَيْتَ اللَّهَ يُعْطِي الْعَبْدَ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا عَلَى مَعَاصِيْهِ مَا يُحِبُّ ، فَإِنَّمَا هُوَ</span><span style="color:#000000;"> اسْتِدْرَاجٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">If you see that Allah provides for a servant in this life from what he likes because of his sins, it is only <em>Istidrāj </em>(allowing him to gradually increase in sin).</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The messenger of Allah then recited the verse:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَلَمَّا نَسُوْا مَا ذُكِّرُوا بهِ فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَبْوَابَ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ حَتَّى إِذَا فَرِحُوْا بمَا </span><span style="color:#000000;">أُوْتُوْا أَخَذْنَاهُم بَغْتَةً فَإِذَا هُم مُّبْلِسُوْنَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So when they forgot what they had been reminded about, We opened to them the doors of every (good) thing until, when they rejoiced in that which they were given, We seized them suddenly, and they were (then) in despair.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">(It will be) when you see people being unconcerned about their promises and their trustworthiness declines, and they (the people and tribulations) are like this—and he interlocked his fingers.</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abū Hurayrah said: I replied, “I will, messenger of Allah.” He (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) then took my hand and counted on five fingers, saying:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">Be cautious of the prohibited things and you will be the most worshipping of people. Be content with what Allah has destined for you and you will be the richest of people. Behave well toward your neighbor and you will be a true believer. Love for people what you love for yourself and you will be a Muslim. And do not laugh excessively, for excessive laughter kills the heart.</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[6] Question</strong></span>:</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">How do we combine between the two ayahs:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَمَن يَبْتَغِ غَيْرَ الْإِسْلَامِ دِينًا فَلَن يُقْبَلَ مِنْهُ وَهُوَ فِي الْآخِرَةِ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ</strong></span></h3>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Whoever seeks other than Islaam as a Religion, it will never be accepted from him”</strong></span> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan 3:85] and</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَالَّذِينَ هَادُوا وَالصَّابِئُونَ وَالنَّصَارَىٰ مَنْ آمَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحًا فَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</strong></span></h3>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Verily, those who have believed and those who were Jews, Sabians, and Christians who believed in Allaah and the Last Day and do righteous deeds – there is no fear upon them nor do they worry.”</strong></span> [Surah Al-Maa’idah 5:69]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[6] Answer by Imam al-Albaani </strong>(<em>rahimahullaah</em>)<strong>:</strong></span></p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no contradiction between these two ayahs as the question suggests. And this is because the verse about Islaam (3:85) came after the Message of Islaam was conveyed to those people whom Allah described in the second ayah as: “<strong>There is no fear upon them nor do they worry</strong>.”</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah mentions amongst them the Sabians. When the word Sabian is mentioned what quickly comes to mind is a reference to those who worship the stars. However, in reality, this term applies to all people that fall into Shirk after having been from among the adherents of Tawheed. So the Sabians were once proponents of pure Monotheism, but then they were subjected to polytheism and worshipping of stars. So the ones mentioned in this verse refer to the believers amongst them, the adherents of Tawheed.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Before the Message of Islaam came, these people were like the Jews and Christians, whom were also mentioned in the same list as the Sabians. So this refers to those among them that were practicing their Religion at their time. They were from among the believers of whom: “There is no fear upon them nor do they worry.”</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">However, after Allaah sent Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) with the Religion of Islaam, the Message of Islaam was conveyed to these three types of people – the Jews, the Christians and the Sabians. And so nothing else but Islaam was accepted from them.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Allaah’s statement: “<strong>Whoever seeks other than Islaam as a Religion</strong>” refers to after Islaam was conveyed to him upon the tongue of the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) and after the Message of Islaam was passed on to him. So at that point, nothing other than Islaam was acceptable</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who died before the advent of the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) or those who are alive today on the face of the earth but yet the Message of Islaam has not reached them or the Message of Islaam has reached them but in a manner that is distorted from its true and original state – as I have mentioned in some occasions about the Qadiyanis, for example, who today have spread throughout Europe and America, claiming Islaam, however this Islaam, which they claim to be upon is not from Islaam at all, since they believe that prophets will come after the final Prophet, Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) – then these people, among the Europeans and Americans that have been called to the Qadiyani form of Islam while the true Message of Islaam was not conveyed to them, they fall into two categories:</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">The first category contains those who remained upon their prior (pure) Religion and held steadfast onto it. This is how the ayah: “there is no fear upon them nor do they worry” should be understood.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">The second category consists of those who deviated from this Religion – as is the case with many Muslims today – so the proof is established against them.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those whom the Call to Islaam has not been conveyed to at all – whether after Islaam came or before it, such people will get a special treatment in the Hereafter. And it is by Allaah sending them a messenger that will test them, just as the people were tested in the worldly life. So whoever answers the call of this messenger on the Day of Judgement and obeys him will enter Paradise. And whoever disobeys him will enter the Hellfire.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">This book is a complete translation of a treatise entitled “<strong>Kayfa Yajibu ‘alaynaa an Nufassir al-Qur’aan-al-Kareem</strong>” (How are we Obligated to Interpret the Noble Qur’aan).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The source used for the translation was the Al-Maktabah al-Islaamiyyah first edition published in 1421H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The foundation of this treatise is questions that were posed to the Shaikh, may Allaah have mercy on him, to which he responded in recorded format. These questions and answers were then transcribed, printed on paper and presented to the Shaikh who read them and commented on them in his own handwriting. The publishing house printed and distributed the book after the death of Imaam Al- Albaanee due to the great benefit found in the work since the author discusses several rules and principles related to interpreting the meanings of the Qur’aan, which every Muslim should follow when trying to understand the Book of Allaah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaanee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Ibn Saa`id said: ‘It is a hadeeth with a singular chain which is <em>hasan</em>.’ I say: Its narrators are reliable, all of them are narrators of Muslim, except that this narrator ar-Rifaa`ee has been spoken against by some of them. al-Haafiz said: ‘He is not strong&#8230;al-Bukhaaree said: I saw them being united upon his being weak.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: However he is not alone in reporting it, since Aboo Nu`aym reported it in ‘Akhbaar Asbahaan’ (2/225), and likewise at-Tabaraanee in ‘al-Awsat’ (no.907), through two other chains of narration from Hafs ibn Ghiyaath that he narrated it to us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: And this is a chain of narration saheeh to the standard of Muslim, so the hadeeth is Saheeh through this chain, and all praise is for Allaah. And al-Mundhiree said in ‘at-Targheeb’ (1/146): ‘at-Tabaraanee reported it with a hasan chain’, and al-Haythamee said: ‘Its narrators are reliable’.</p>

Translated by Abu <u>T</u>al<u>h</u>ah Dawud Burbank <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Author’s Introduction</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah, Lord of the worlds and may His praises and peace be upon the noblest of Messengers and upon his family and all his Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>To proceed:</strong> I have included in this treatise the answer to a question asked about that which has been named <em><strong>Fiqh ul- Waaqi&#8217;</strong></em> , its ruling, how great is the Muslims’ need for it and an explanation of its correct form in the <em>Sharee’ah</em>. The basis for this treatise was an unprepared answer in a sitting from the sittings of knowledge, in which there were, all praise is for Allaah, a number of Muslim youth keen to seek correct knowledge, drawn from the Book and the Sunnah, upon the <em>manhaj</em> of the <em>Salaf us- Saalih</em> (the Pious Predecessors), the best of this Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of these brothers, may Allaah reward him with good, transcribed my words from cassette-tape and presented it to me. I corrected it, added to it and revised it for publication, such that its benefit would be more universal and of greater worth , if Allaah wills. I ask Allaah to make this brief treatise of benefit to it’s reader and to make it of use to those who seek it. Indeed He is the One. who hears and responds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad Naasir ud-Deen al-Albaanee<br />
Ammaan, 29th of Shawwaal 1412H.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Knowledge of Current Affairs</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah. We praise Him, seek His aid, seek His forgiveness and we seek Allaah&#8217;s refuge from the evil of ourselves and from our evil actions. Whosoever Allaah guides, then none can misguide him and whosoever Allaah misguides, then none can guide him. I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Allaah alone, having no partners and I bear witness that Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) is His slave and Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The nations are about to call each other and set upon you just as the diners sets upon food.” </strong></span><strong style="color:#000000;">It was said, Will it be because of our small number that day. </strong><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said, “Rather, on that day you will be many, but you will be like foam, like the foam on the river and Allaah will remove the fear of you from the hearts of your enemies and will throw weakness (<em>wahn</em>) into your hearts.” </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> Someone said, O Messenger of Allaah, what is <em>wahn</em>? </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said, “Love of the world and hatred for death.”</strong></span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<em>Saheeh</em> &#8211; related by Abu Daawood (4297), ar-Rooyaanee in <em>al-Musnad</em> (2/ 134/25), Ibn Asaakir in <em>Taareekh Dimashq</em> (2/ 97/ 8) from Thawbaan &#8211;<em> radiallaahu ’anhu</em>. It was authenticated in <em>as-Saheehah</em> (958) of Shaikh al-Albaanee.]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The State of Affairs of the Muslims</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This noble prophetic hadeeth has manifested, with the strongest expression and clearest image, the very great trial (<em>fitnah</em>) that has come upon the Muslims, which has destroyed their unity, weakened their resolve and split their ranks. Part of this trial has struck at the root of the hearts of a great number of <em>du’aat</em> and students of knowledge so that they have become divided , regretfully, between themselves. Some of them speaking ill of others and the others criticizing the remainder and refuting them.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Recognizing the Truth through Refutation</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These rebuttals on their own, or these criticisms alone, will harm neither the one refuting, nor the one refuted. Since, with the people of Justice, the truth is recognized by its light and its proofs. This is not so with the people of blind-sectarianism and deviation. But what will harm them is speech without knowledge, talking without restraint and speaking untruthfully about the servants of Allaah!</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Matter of <em>Fiqh ul-Waaqi’</em></strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During this trial, various questions have sprung-up concerning <em>fiqh</em>, <em>manhaj</em> and <em>da’wah</em> and we were able to answer them at that time with answers backed by knowledge and all praise is for Allaah, the Most Perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Amongst the questions brought about by this trial, about which there had been much talk is that which some have decided to start calling F<em>iqh ul- Waaqi</em>. I do not argue concerning the form of this knowledge for which they have newly invented this name which is <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi’</em> , since many of the scholars have previously written that those who should take on the responsibility of guiding the Ummah and providing answers to their problems (that they) should be aware of and know their state of affairs. Therefore, from amongst those sayings well-known is: Passing judgement about a matter comes after comprehending it. This does not come about except by knowing the situation surrounding the matter under discussion. This is a basic principle of giving religious verdicts (<em>fataawaa</em>) in particular and from the principles of knowledge in general.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">S0 <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi</em>’, is to find out those things which are of importance to the Muslims from their affairs, or the plans of their enemies, in order to warn them and uplift them practically. It is not speculative talk nor preoccupying oneself with news and reports about the unbelievers nor drowning oneself in analyzing them and their thoughts!</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Importance of Knowing the State of Affairs</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So knowing the situation in order to arrive by it at the <em>Sharee’ah</em> ruling is an important obligation from the obligations which have to be carried out by a discerning section of the specialist Muslim students of knowledge. Just like any branch of <em>Sharee’ah</em> knowledge, or social, economic or military affairs or any knowledge which benefits the Ummah of lslaam and brings it closer to the roads leading to a return of its strength, splendour and supremacy; especially when these branches of knowledge develop with the change of time and place.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Some Categories of <em>Fiqh</em> which are Obligatory</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It must be mentioned here, that the category of <em>Fiqh</em> [<span style="color:#ff0000;">2</span>] required from the Muslims as a whole is not just the <em>Fiqh</em> of the schools of thought, which they know and are instructed in, nor this <em>Fiqh</em> which some of the young <em>du’aat</em> have become aware of and started to call the attention of others towards. Since the categories of Fiqh which are obligatory upon the Muslims to master, even if they are only of the level of being obligatory upon some (<em>Fard Kifaayah</em>) are greater than all of this, and more widespread.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">2</span>] <em>Fiqh</em>: Understanding. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said. as is related by al-Bukhaaree (1/25) and at-Tahaawee in <em>Mushkil ul-Aathaar</em> (2/278): “<em><strong>When Allaah intends excellence for someone, He gives them the understanding (Fiqh) of the Deen. Indeed I am the distributor and Allaah is the giver</strong>.</em> (Publisher’s Note)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from this, for example, is <em>Fiqh ul-Kitaab</em> (understanding the Book), <em>Fiqh us-Sunnah</em> (understanding the Sunnah), <em>Fiqh ul-Lughah</em> (understanding the Language), <em>Fiqh us-Sunan ul-Kawniyyah</em> (understanding the ways in which the creation Operates), <em>Fiqh ul-Khilaaf</em> (understanding the differences between the scholars) and their like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These categories of <em>Fiqh</em> , in general, are of no lesser importance than the two types of Fiqh previously indicated, whether the Fiqh that is well- known or <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi</em> ’ which we are at the moment trying to clarify here. Despite all of this, we do not find anyone who calls the attention of the people to these categories of Fiqh! Particularly <em>Fiqh ul-Kitaab was-Sunnah</em>, which is the head of these categories and is their foundation. This Fiqh, which if someone were to say that it is obligatory upon every individual (<em>Fard ’Ayn</em>), then he would not be far wrong, due to the dire need of the Muslims for it and how necessary it is for them. Yet, in spite of this, we do not hear those who speak constantly about it, laying down its methodology, nor occupying the youth with it, nor training and cultivating them upon it!</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What We Need is the <em>Manhaj</em>, not Mere Talk</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, there are many, all praise is for Allaah, who speak about the Book and the Sunnah today and point to them. However, the obligation that we require is not in merely writing a small work here and giving a lecture there, but rather What we need is that the Book and the Sunnah are made the general framework for every small or large matter and that their <em>manhaj</em> is made the undergarment and overgarment of <em>Da’wah</em> &#8211; its beginning and its end and that the thinking of those youths and others who are giving <em>Da’wah</em> should be lead in accordance with this great <em>manhaj</em> , upon which is the only means for the well-being of the Ummah. So there has to be scholars in every branch of <em>Fiqh</em> that has preceded, particularly <em>Fiqh</em> of the Book and the Sunnah, with clear criteria and principles.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Partitioning of the People through <em>Fiqh ul-Waaqi’</em></span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have heard and noticed that many Muslim youth have become trapped in a predicament about this branch of knowledge which they have called <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi’</em> and have regretfully partitioned into two groups at variance with each other. Some have gone beyond the bounds in this matter and others have fallen short of the mark! Since you will see and hear from those who over-inflate the importance of <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi’</em> and place it in a very high position, above its correct place amongst the branches of knowledge, that they want every scholar of the <em>Sharee’ ah</em> to be a scholar of what they call <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi</em>’! Just as the reverse also occurs from them. Those who listen to them and are instructed by them are made to think that everyone who is aware of the state of affairs (<em>waaqi</em>’) of the Islaamic world is (also) a scholar of the Book and the Sunnah and is upon the <em>manhaj</em> of the <em>Salaf us-Saalih</em>. This does not automatically follow, as is clear.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Completeness is Something Very Rare</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not expect to find a human being who is complete in every sense of the word, i.e., that we find one (person) who is a scholar of all these branches of knowledge that we have indicated and spoken about. Therefore, it is obligatory that all those who have spent their time and effort in coming to know the state of affairs of the Islaamic Ummah and the plots against it should work and co-operate with the scholars of the Book and the Sunnah, upon the <em>manhaj</em> of the <em>Salaf</em> of this Ummah. So they should put forward their Views and ideas and the scholars should explain Allaah&#8217;s ruling, Most perfect is He, based upon the authentic proof and clear evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who speaks about <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi</em>’ ; in the minds of those who hear him, he becomes one of the scholars and <em>muftees</em>, for no other reason than that he speaks about this <em>Fiqh</em> which we have indicated. This is something not in any way supported by truth. Then his words are taken as a stepping stone to reject the religious verdicts given by the scholars and to invalidate their <em>ijtihaad</em> and rulings which they have clarified.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Mistake of a Scholar Does Not Mean that He is to be Renounced</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is important to mention here that a scholar may make a mistake in passing judgement about a particular matter from these questions relating to the state of affairs, this has happened and will happen. Does this mean that the scholar is to be renounced and that those who disagree with him should describe him with improper words which it is not permissible to use for him? For example and it has been said: He is a scholar of the <em>Sharee’ah</em> and he is not a scholar of the current affairs! This is a statement which conflicts both with the <em>Sharee’ah</em> and the true state of affairs!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to this saying of theirs, it is as if they make it obligatory for the scholars of the Book and the Sunnah to also be fully aware of economics, social-affairs, politics, military affairs, use of modern weapons-systems and other matters also! I do not think that there is a sensible human who imagines all of these branches of knowledge and disciplines combined in the heart of a single man, however great a scholar or however complete!</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Mistake of Being Ignorant of the State of Affairs</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have also heard people saying: It is not important for us to know the state of affairs. This is also an error. Rather justice demands that it be said: There must be for every branch of knowledge those who know about it and specialize in it and that they all work together as required by Islaam as sincere brothers, not due to partisanship , nor sectarianism &#8211; in order to realize that which is of benefit to the Islaamic Ummah and to establish the Islaamic society that every Muslim aspires to, such that Allaah’s <em>Sharee’ah</em> is applied upon His earth. Each of these branches of knowledge are obligatory upon some of the scholars of the Muslims and it is not obligatory at all that a single person gathers all of them, not to mention the impossibility of that actually occurring!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example: In some cases, it is not permissible for a surgeon to carry out a particular operation until he has obtained the View of a scholar of the Book of Allaah, the Most Perfect and the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), upon the <em>manhaj</em> of the <em>Salafus-Saalih</em>. Since it is difficult, if we do say impossible, to find a proficient surgeon who also has good knowledge of the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, their <em>Fiqh</em> and the rulings derived from them.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Obligation of Co-operation</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, there has to be co-operation, acting upon the saying of the Lord of the worlds in His noble Book:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَتَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَىٰ ۖ وَلَا تَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Help you one another in righteousness and piety and do not help one another in sin and transgression.</span> [Sooratul-Maa‘idah (5):2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Through this, the good that is hoped for, for the Islaamic <em>Ummah</em> may be attained. This matter is something obvious, since a Muslim cannot think of a scholar having great knowledge of the Book and the Sunnah and then further that he is a skilled surgeon. Then on top of that, he is fully aware of what they call today <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi</em>’. Since, when he occupies himself with one branch of knowledge, that will reduce his time spent on other branches of knowledge. Thus, if he gives greater importance to a certain field then he will naturally be detracted from other fields and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Completeness will not come about except by all of them working together, each of them in his special field. By this means and this means alone, what the <em>Sharee’ah</em> wishes, for all the Muslims, can be achieved and they can be saved from clear ruin. The Lord of the worlds says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَالْعَصْرِ &#8211; </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ &#8211; </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِلَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالْحَقِّ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">By Time! Verily man is in loss. Except those who believe and do righteous deeds and help one another to the truth and help one another to patience.‘</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<em>Sooratul-‘Asr</em> (103) :1-3]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Going Beyond Bounds Regarding that which is Essential</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet what we have noticed and still notice, is that the wild and fervent emotions which know no bounds have a number of negative results.From them is going beyond bounds in that which is essential. Since that which is obligatory and essential is of two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: That which is obligatory upon every Muslim (<em>Fard ’Ayn</em>)<br />
<strong>Secondly</strong>: That which, if carried out by some, then it is not required from the rest (<em>Fard Kifaaee</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible to treat the <em>Fard Kifaaee</em> like the <em>Fard ’Ayn</em> and to make them equal. Even if we were to say, for the sake of argument, that it were obligatory upon the up and coming students of knowledge to know <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi</em>’. How could that be? Since we are not even able to apply this unrestricted statement to the major scholars of the Muslims, not to mention making it obligatory upon the students of knowledge to know the state of affairs, along with the necessary <em>Fiqh</em> demanded by this knowledge, so that each case can be given its fitting ruling.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Fiqh ul-Waaqi</em>’ is not to be Rejected</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, since this is the case, it is not permissible for any of the students of knowledge to reject the necessity of this <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi</em>’. Since it is not possible to obtain that which was lost and is hoped for by all the Muslims, which is freeing ourselves from the colonialization of the Muslim lands by the unbelievers , or at the very least, some of them, except by knowing their mutual plots and agreements, in order to beware and warn, so that their colonialization and enslavement of the Islaamic world ceases to continue. A large part of this goal cannot be attained except by educating and cultivating the Muslim youth correctly in <em>Aqeedah</em>, knowledge and <em>manhaj</em>, built upon the purification (<em>tasfiyah</em>) of Islaam from all the accretions that have been added to it and upon the principle of cultivation and education (<em>tarbiyah</em>) upon this pure Islaam, just as Allaah sent it down upon the heart of His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم).</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Between the Scholars and the Rulers</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From those matters which need to be mentioned here is that the ones who have the ability to bring the Ummah to carry out that which is obligatory upon it, whether upon all or some of them, are not those passionate speakers, nor the academic scholars, rather they are the rulers (<em>hukkaam</em>) who have the power of giving orders and having them implemented and to enact and to dissolve, nor are they the enthusiastic youth, nor emotional <em>du’aat</em> who carry no weight, nor authority with them!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the speakers, the scholars and the callers must educate and train the Muslims to accept the law of Islaam and to submit to it and also to call the rulers with that which is best, to that which is right. To use the scholars properly with their various levels and types of knowledge: <em>Fiqh</em> of the Book and the Sunnah, <em>Fiqh</em> of the Language, <em>Fiqh</em> of the ways in which the creation operates, <em>Fiqh</em> of the state of affairs and likewise for all important matters. Putting into effect the great Islaamic principle of <em>Shooraa</em> (carrying out the affairs through consultation), then on that day will the affairs be straightened out and the Believers rejoice at the victory from Allaah:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَإِنْ أَعْرَضُوا فَمَا أَرْسَلْنَاكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَفِيظًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">But if they turn away, then We have not sent you as a protector over them.</span> [Sooratush-Shooraa (42):48]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Reason Behind the Degradation of the Muslims</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A very important matter must be explained here, about which many are unaware. The reason why the Muslims continue to be downtrodden and enslaved by the unbelievers, even by the Jews of some Islaamic lands, is not that many of the people of knowledge are ignorant about the state of affairs, not knowing the plots and the plans of the Unbelievers, as some think!</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">From the Mistake of Some <em>Du’aat</em></span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, I hold that giving extra and undue importance to <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi</em> , such that it becomes a total program for the <em>du’aat</em> and the youth, upon which they are educated and educate others, thinking that it is the way to salvation, is an evident error and a clear mistake! The matter about which no two scholars differ and about which no two goats would lock horns over is that the primary reason for the degradation which has settled upon the Muslims is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: The ignorance of the Muslims of the Islaam which Allaah sent down upon the heart of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: That many of the Muslims who know about the Islaamic rulings for some of their affairs do not put them into practice, but neglect them and allow them to fall into disuse.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Tasfiyah and Tarbiyah</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the key to a return of the glory of Islaam is: Implementation of beneficial knowledge (’<em>Ilm un-Naafi’</em>) and establishing righteous action (’<em>Amal us-Saalih</em>) and this is a very great affair which the Muslims cannot reach, except through the <em>manhaj</em> of <em>tasfiyah</em> and <em>tarbiyah</em>. These are two very great obligations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By the first of these the following is intended:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: Purifying the Islaamic ’<em>Aqeedah</em> from that which is alien to it, such as Shirk (associating partners along with Allaah in those things that are specific to Him), <em>ta’teel</em> (denial of Allaah’s attributes), <em>ta’weel</em> (twisting the meanings of Allaah’s attributes) and refusing authentic ahaadeeth because they are connected to ’<em>Aqeedah</em>, and their like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: Purifying the Islaamic Fiqh from the erroneous judgements made, which are contrary to the Book and the Sunnah, freeing the minds from the bonds of blind-following and the darkness of sectarianism.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>: Purifying the books of <em>tafseer</em>, <em>fiqh</em>, <em>raqaaiq</em> (matters concerning the heart) and other than that, from <em>ahaadeeth</em> that are weak (<em>da’eef</em>), fabricated (<em>maudoo</em>’) and unsupported narrations of the people of the Book (<em>Israaeeleeyaat</em>) and reprehensible matters (<em>munkaraat</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As regards the second obligation:</strong> Then by it I mean cultivating the young generation upon this Islaam, purified from all that we have mentioned, giving them a correct Islaamic education from the beginning, without any influence of the infidel western education.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt, that bringing these two obligations about requires huge efforts and sincere co-operation between all of the Muslims organisations and individuals, from all of those who are truly concerned with establishing the desired Islaamic society, each one working in his own field and speciality.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Correct Islaam</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the scholars who know the rulings from the correct Islaam must take pains to call the Muslims to this correct Islaam and bring them to understand it, then to cultivate them upon it, just as Allaah says:</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَٰكِن كُونُوا رَبَّانِيِّينَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تُعَلِّمُونَ الْكِتَابَ وَبِمَا كُنتُمْ تَدْرُسُونَ</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Rather, be you <em>Rabbaani’yyeen</em>,</span>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">01</span>] <span style="color:#008000;">because you teach the Book and you study it. </span><br />
[Soorah Aal-‘Imraan (3):79]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">01</span>] <em>Rabbaanee</em> (plural: <em>Rabbaaniyyeen</em>) is the scholar who acts upon his knowledge and has insight into the condition of the people, so that he raises them upon the primary matters of knowledge before that which is more detailed. </span><span style="color:#999999;">In his Jaami’ us-Saheeh (1/192 &#8211; with Fath), al-Bukhaaree &#8211; <em>rahimahullaah</em> &#8211; says: Ibn ‘Abbaas said: “<em>Be Rabbaaniyyeen. wise-ones and scholars</em>.” It is said: The <em>Rabbaanee</em> is one who teaches people simple knowledge before the more difficult one. (Publisher’s note)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the only solution, which comes in the Book and the Sunnah, as is in His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> إِن تَنصُرُوا اللَّهَ يَنصُرْكُمْ وَيُثَبِّتْ أَقْدَامَكُمْ</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">If you help Allaah then Allaah will help you and establish your feet firmly.</span><br />
[Soorah Muhammad (47) : 7]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>How Will Allaah’s Help Come?</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah. From those things about which there is total agreement between the Muslims is that:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِن تَنصُرُوا اللَّهَ يَنصُرْكُمْ </strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">If you help Allaah then Allaah will help you. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means if you carry out what He has ordered you to do, then Allaah will grant you victory over your enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the most important texts that support this meaning and which totally fits the state of affairs in which we are presently living, in that the disease and the cure are both mentioned together is his (صلى الله عليه وسلم) saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“When you indulge in <em>eenah</em> transactions and take hold of the tails of cows and become satisfied with cultivation and abandon <em>Jihaad</em> , then Allaah will cover you with humiliation, which He will not remove from you, until you return to your <em>Deen</em>.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[<em>Saheeh</em> &#8211; related by Abu Daawood (3426), ad-Dawlaabee. in <em>al-Kunaa</em> (2/65), aI-Baihaqee in <em>as-Sunan ul-Kubraa</em> (5 / 3l 6) and others, from Ibn ’Umar &#8211; <em>radiallaahu ’anhu</em>. It was authenticated by al-Albaanee in <em>as-Saheehah</em> (11).]</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Reason for the Sickness of the Muslims</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the sickness of the Muslims today is not because of their ignorance of any particular branch of knowledge. Although, I agree that every branch of knowledge which is of benefit to the Muslims is obligatory in proportion to this. But the reason for the degradation which has come upon the Muslims is not their ignorance of this knowledge known today as <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi&#8217;</em> ’. Rather, the reason, as occurs in the authentic <em>hadeeth</em>, is their neglecting action in accordance with the rulings of the <em>Deen</em>, from the Book and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His (صلى الله عليه وسلم) saying: “<strong>When you indulge in <em>eenah</em> transactions</strong>” is an indication of a type of usurious transaction, seeking a means around the <em>Sharee’ah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His (صلى الله عليه وسلم) saying: “<strong>and take hold of the tails of cows</strong>” is an indication of giving importance to worldly matters and pre-occupying oneself with them and not giving importance to the <em>Sharee’ah</em> and its rulings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise is his (صلى الله عليه وسلم) saying: “<strong>and become satisfied with cultivation</strong>” and his (صلى الله عليه وسلم) saying: “<strong>and abandon jihaad</strong> ” is a result of desiring this world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مَا لَكُمْ إِذَا قِيلَ لَكُمُ انفِرُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ اثَّاقَلْتُمْ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ ۚ أَرَضِيتُم بِالْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا مِنَ الْآخِرَةِ ۚ فَمَا مَتَاعُ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا فِي الْآخِرَةِ إِلَّا قَلِيلٌ</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! What is the matter with you, that when you are asked to go forth in the path of Allaah you cling heavily to the earth? Do you prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter? But little is the comfort of this world in comparison to the Hereafter.</span> [Sooratut-Tawbah (9):38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His (صلى الله عليه وسلم) saying: “<strong>Allaah will cover you with humiliation, which He will not remove from you, until you return to your Deen</strong>” contains a clear indication that the <em>Deen</em> which it is obligatory to return to is that which Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, mentions in a number of verses, such as His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّ الدِّينَ عِندَ اللَّهِ الْإِسْلَامُ</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed the Deen with Allaah is Islaam.</span><br />
[Soorah Aal-‘Imraan (3):19]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ الْإِسْلَامَ دِينًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">This day have I perfected your Deen for you, completed My favours upon you and have chosen for you Islaam as Deen. </span>[Sooratul-Maa‘idah (5):3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">lmaam Maalik’s famous comment about this aayah clearly explains what is meant, when he &#8211; <em>rahimahullaah</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>What was not on that day considered <em>Deen</em>, is not <em>Deen</em> today. So the latter part of this <em>Ummah</em> will not be set right except by that which set right its first part</strong>.”</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Going Beyond Bounds in <em>Fiqh ul-Waaqi’</em></span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards those <em>du’aat</em> today who concentrate heavily on <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi’</em> and over inflate it’s importance and give it a higher position than is due. They go into excesses in this understanding and giving others the understanding, perhaps unintentionally, that it is obligatory upon every scholar, indeed every student of knowledge to have knowledge of this Fiqh!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas, many of those <em>du’aat</em> know fully that this <em>Deen</em> with which our Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, is pleased for us, has been greatly misunderstood within the Muslim <em>Ummah</em> for a long time, even with regards to <em>Aqeedah</em>, to the extent that we find many people indeed who say <em>Laa ilaaha illallaah</em> and carry out the pillars and even carry out optional worship, such as standing in prayer during the night, giving charity and their like, but they deviate from the sayings of Allaah, the Most High, (such as):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَاعْلَمْ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Know that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah</span>. [SoorahMuhammad (47):19]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The State of the <em>Du’aat</em> with regards to <em>Fiqh ul-Waaqi’</em></strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We know that many of these <em>du’aat</em> agree with us fundamentally in recognizing the reason for the evil situation in which the Muslims live. That is their being far from the correct understanding of Islaam that is obligatory upon every individual to have, not just obligatory upon some only. So what is obligatory is to correct the beliefs, correct the worship and correct the manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Where in this <em>Ummah</em> are those who are seeking to establish this obligation which is an obligation upon all (<em>Fard ’Ayn</em>) and not just upon some (<em>Fard Kifaaee</em>)? ? Since the <em>Fard Kifaaee</em> should come after the <em>Fard Ayn</em>, as has been established and not before! Therefore, being pre-occupied with and giving undue importance in calling the elite of the Muslim Ummah, to take care of a <em>Fard Kifaaee</em>, which is <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi</em> and giving less importance to the <em>Fiqh</em> which is <em>Fard ’Ayn</em> upon every Muslim, which is Fiqh of the Book and Sunnah, as I have indicated, is an excess and a neglect of that which is obligatory upon every individual of the Muslim <em>Ummah</em>. It is going beyond bounds in raising the importance of something, which in reality, is no more than <em>Fa&#8217;rd Kifaayah</em>!</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The True and Just Saying about <em>Fiqh ul-Waaqi’</em></strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the matter is as Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَكَذَٰلِكَ جَعَلْنَاكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Thus have We made you a justly-balanced Ummah.</span><br />
[Sooratul-Baqarah (2):143]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi&#8217;</em> with its correct <em>Sharee’ah</em> meaning is obligatory without doubt, but it is obligatory upon some, not all. If some of the scholars attain it, then it is not obligatory upon the rest of the scholars, not to mention the students of knowledge or the common Muslims!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is essential to keep matters in due proportion when calling the Muslims to awareness of <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi’</em> and not to drown them with political news and analysis of western thinkers. Rather, what is obligatory always, is to concentrate on the <em>tasfiyah</em> (purification) of Islaam from corruption, then the <em>tarbi&#8217;yah</em> (cultivation) of the Muslims, groups and individuals, upon this pure Islaam; connecting them to the pure and correct <em>manhaj</em> (methodology) of <em>Da’wah</em>: The Book and the Sunnah with the understanding of the Salaf of this Ummah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Obligation of Mutual Love and Ties of Relationship</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From that which is also obligatory upon the scholars, with their various specialities, not to mention the rest of the Ummah , is that they should comply with the saying of their Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>The example of the Believers in their mutual love and mercy is like a single body</strong>.” [<span style="color:#ff0000;">01</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">01</span>] <em>Saheeh</em> &#8211; related by Muslim (8/20), Ahmad (4/70) and at-Tiyaalasee (790). from an- Numaan ibn Basheer <em>radiallaalm ’anhu</em>. The full text of the hadeeth being: “<em>The example of the Believers in their mutual love and mercy is like a single body. When one part of it feels pain then the whole of the body suffers in sleeplessness and fever</em>.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This great prophetic simile, with its beautiful meaning, will not be realized except by the scholars working in co-operation with the individuals of the society, teaching and learning, calling and acting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, those who know the <em>Fiqh</em> of the <em>Sharee’ah</em> with its evidences and rulings, should co-operate with those who know <em>Fiqh ul-Waaqi’</em> in its correct and practical form, not merely as a discussion. S0 one supports the other with what they have of knowledge and understanding and one alerts the other to what is clear to them so that they can be aware and warn. From this sincere co-operation between the scholars and the <em>Du’aat</em>, with their different areas of expertise, it will be possible to fulfill the hope of every sincere Muslim.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Danger of Accusing the Scholars</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards accusing some of the scholars or students of knowledge and labelling them as being ignorant of <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi’</em> and accusing them with such things as one would feel shame to mention, then this is a mistake and an error. It is not permissible for this to continue, since it is from hatred and many ahaadeeth prohibit the Muslims having hatred for each other, rather the opposite has been ordered, that is, to have mutual love, to come together and to co-operate.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">How Can We Cure the Mistakes</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Any Muslim who sees a matter about which a scholar or caller has made a mistake, then it is obligatory upon him to remind and advise them. If the mistake was in a particular place, then it should be called to their attention there and then in the best way without broadcasting or publicizing it; in order to bring about what is more befitting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the mistake was made publicly and broadcasted, then there is no harm in calling the mistake to attention and explaining it openly, but as Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color:#000000;">ادْعُ إِلَىٰ سَبِيلِ رَبِّكَ بِالْحِكْمَةِ وَالْمَوْعِظَةِ الْحَسَنَةِ ۖ وَجَادِلْهُم بِالَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching and argue with them in ways that are best. </span>[Sooratun-Nahl (16):125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is important to explain that the correction of an error meant here, is not the correction founded upon the emotions and feelings of the youth without any knowledge or proof. Rather, what is meant is correction based upon clear proof and sound evidence.This correction, in this mild and wise manner, will not be achieved except between sincere scholars and well-wishing and sincere students of knowledge, who are together in their knowledge and <em>Da’wah</em> built upon the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> and upon the <em>manhaj</em> of the <em>Salaf us-Saalih</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards the case if the one who is to be corrected is one who knowingly deviates from this methodology, then there is for him a particular treatment and method befitting the scale of his deviation and distance from the truth and correct way.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Danger of Present-Day Politics</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Finally</strong>, we must advise the Muslims of a very important matter in this regard. Our approval of <em>Fiqh ul-Waaqi’</em> with its approved form in the <em>Sharee’ah</em> or our preoccupation with it, must not lead us to opening the doors of modern politics (<em>siyaasah</em>) of the transgressors. Those fooled by the words of the rulers, willing pupils of their methods and those drowned in their ways.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, what is obligatory, is to pursue the politics of the <em>Sharee’ah</em> &#8211; which is to protect and take care of the affairs of the Ummah. This cannot be except in the light of the Book and the Sunnah upon the <em>manhaj</em> of the <em>Salaf us-Saalih</em> and in the hands of the active scholars and the just rulers. Since Allaah curbs with the rulers those whom He does not curb with the Qur‘aan.[1]</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[1] See <em>ad-Durrul-Manthoor</em> (4/99) of as-Suyootee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for the western politics, which open the doors and deceives its people; it has no <em>Deen</em> with it. It flows onwards with those caught in its tide, or drowned in its sea. Its harm comes upon him and he is afflicted by its fire, since he preoccupied himself with the subsidiary (<em>furoo</em>’) and left the fundamentals (<em>usool</em>)!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah have mercy upon the one who said: <em>Whosoever seeks to hasten something before its time is ripe, is punished by being deprived of its achievement.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our final call is that all praise is for Allaah, Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">‘Silsilah al-Ahadeeth as-Saheehah’.<br />
By The Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ Muhammad Nasur uddeen al-Albaani. Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3258</strong> – On the authority of Rabeeyah al-Asslamee who said : I used to serve the Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> and he gave me some land, and he gave Abu Bakr some land, and when it came to dividing the land, we differed over a cluster of dates from a date palm tree. Abu Bakr said : this is on my side of the land! And I said : It is on my side! There used to be a problem between me and Abu Bakr, and Abu Bakr said a statement to me which I hated but he regretted saying it, so he said to me: ‘O Rabeeyah! Say something to me similar to what I said to you, so that it can be a requital.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I said : ‘I will not say it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr said : ‘You will say it or I will request the Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> to order you to say it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I said : ‘I will not say it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr left that portion of the land for me and went off to the Prophet <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> and I followed him. The people from my tribe followed us and said to me: ‘May Allaah have mercy on Abu Bakr, why is he going to the Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em>about you, and he said what he said about you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I said : ‘Do you know who this is?? This is Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq, he is one of the two who were in the cave, he is one who has grown old as a Muslim ( one of the elders of the Muslims), beware he does not turn around and see you assisting me against him and becomes angry and he meets the Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> , and the Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> will become angry due to him being angry, and then Allaah Azza wa Jal becomes angry due to them being angry and then Rabeeyah will be destroyed.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said : ‘What do you order us to do?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said : ‘Go back.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> went off to the Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> , so I followed him by myself, until he reached the Prophet <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> and he told him the story as it was. The Prophet <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> raised his head towards me and said: ‘O Rabeeyah what’s the matter between you and as-Siddeeq?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said : ‘O Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> such and such happened, and he said a statement to me which I disliked, then he said to me, say something similar to what I said to you so that it can be requited, but I refused.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> said: ‘Yes, do not say a word back to him, but say: May Allaah forgive you O Abu Bakr. May Allaah forgive you O Abu Bakr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hasan said: ‘Abu Bakr turned around and he was crying.’</p>

<p>From “Aḥkām al-Janāiz” by Muḥammad Nāṣir al-Dīn al-Albānī</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This article is comprised of a single ḥadīth that, when presented with the various wordings and additions, illustrate with clear descriptions the distinction between a believer and a disbeliever at the time of death. This ḥadīth, though recorded in earlier ḥadīth collections, was translated from “Aḥkām al-Janāiz wa Bidau’hā” (no. 105, pp. 198-202) by Muḥammad Nāṣir al-Dīn al-Albānī with the scholar’s accompanying notes included.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"> We say with regard to the <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of Allaah, holding as our creed and belief, due to the <em>tawfeeq </em>(guidance, correctness) granted by Allaah, that: Allaah is One, having no partner</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>[1] Translator’s Side Point:</strong></span> <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> says regarding the last phrase “<strong>having no partner</strong>” &#8211; denial of any partner for Allaah the Most High will not be complete except by negating/denying three types of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Firstly</strong></span>: By denying <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> in Allaah’s Lordship; which is to believe that there is another creator along with Allaah, He the Perfect and Most High, as is the belief of the Magians – those who say that evil has a creator besides Allaah the Perfect. And this type of <em><u>sh</u>irk </em>is something very rare in this Ummah and all praise is for Allaah, even though the saying of the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> is very close to it – their saying that evil is the creation of the person; and this fact is indicated by the saying of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">القدرية مجوس هذه الأمة</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>The <em>Qadariyyah</em> are the Magians of this Ummah</strong>…” the <u>h</u>adee<u>th</u>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Secondly</strong></span>: It is <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> with regard to worship; which is, that a person worships someone along with Allaah – someone from the prophets or the righteous such as calling upon them for relief and calling upon them at times of hardship and so on. And this, regretfully, is present a great deal in this Ummah. And the major part of responsibility for it is borne by those <u>sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>s who support this type of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> by giving it the name of <em>tawassul</em> (drawing closer to Allaah) calling it by other than its name!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Thirdly</strong></span>: <em><u>Sh</u>irk</em> with regard to Allaah’s Attributes; which is, that a person describes someone from the creation of Allaah the Most High, with some of the attributes which are particular to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. Such as, claiming that people have knowledge of the hidden and unseen for example; and this type is widespread amongst many of the <u>S</u>oofees and those who are influenced by them.  For example, those who praise the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> with exaggerated praise like the one who said about him in a line of poetry: “From your generosity came about the whole world and whatever it contains and from your knowledge is the knowledge of the Preserved Tablet and the knowledge of everything the Pen has written.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from this has come the misguidance of those <em>dajjaals</em> – those who claim that the see the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> today whilst they are awake and that they ask him about things which are hidden – things about the secrets of the souls of people they associate with. Whereas, the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> did not know such things even when he was alive; rather, he was told to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>If I knew the hidden and unseen then I could have increased greatly in good and harm would not have touched me.</em></span><strong> </strong>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>188)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how could he know that after his death and after he passed on to the highest company of angels?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these three types of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>, whoever negates/denies them from Allaah in his <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of Him and he singles out Allaah in His Self and His worship and His Attributes, then that person is the <em>muwa<u>hh</u>id</em> (the person of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>) who is covered by the virtues particular to the people of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed.</em> And whoever commits something from that <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> then to him is directed the like of the saying of Allaah the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>If you commit shirk then (all of) your deeds will be rendered null and void and you will from the losers.</em></span><strong> </strong>(Sooratuz-Zumar (39), <em>aayah </em>65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So preserve this point because it is the most important thing in `<em>aqeedah</em>. So, there is no surprise in the fact that the author began with it. And whoever wishes to see further details then let him refer back to the explanation of this book and the books of the <u>Sh</u>uyoo<u>kh</u>ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibnul-Qayyim and Ibn `Abdil -Wahhaab and others, and those who followed upon their way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>An Important Note:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obvious that after all of this we must say: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Indeed, the Sunnah that bears this importance in Legislation (i.e. making Islamic laws), only refers to the Sunnah that is authentically reported on the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم by way of the knowledge-based paths and authentic chains of narration, which are well known to the scholars of Hadeeth and Narrators</strong></span>. It does not refer to that which is contained within the various books of Tafseer and Fiqh, or the books on Targheeb and Tarheeb, or those of Raqaa’iq and Mawaa’idh, for indeed many of the weak, rejected and fabricated ahaadeeth can be found in them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of these ahaadeeth, Islaam is completely free from, such as the hadeeth about Harut and Marut, and the story on the satanic verses (gharaneeq). I wrote a specific treatise refuting this narration, which has been published.[2] I have referenced a score of them in my book, the collection: <em>Silsilat-ul-Ahaadeeth ad-Da’eefah wal-Mawdoo’ah wa Atharuhaa as-Sayy fil-Ummah</em>.” So far the number of ahaadeeth in them has reached close to four thousand.[3] And they consist of ahaadeeth that are either weak or fabricated. Only five hundred ahaadeeth from these have been published so far! So it is an obligation upon the people of knowledge, particularly those that propagate their Fiqh and verdicts to the people, to not be overconfident in using the hadeeth as proof except after becoming sure about its authenticity. This is especially since the books of Fiqh that are commonly referenced today are filled with ahaadeeth that are weak, rejected and those that have no source to them, as is well known to the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have commenced an important project in my opinion, which is beneficial for those who preoccupy themselves with Fiqh, which I call: “<strong>The Weak and Fabricated Ahaadeeth in the Major Fiqh Books</strong>.” By this I mean the following books:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <em>Al-Hidaayah</em> of Al-Margeenaani, regarding Hanafi Fiqh<br />
2. <em>Al-Mudawwanah</em> of Ibn Al-Qaasim, regarding Maalikee Fiqh<br />
3. <em>Sharh-ul-Wajeez</em> of Ar-Raafi’ee, regarding Shaafi’ee Fiqh<br />
4. <em>Al-Mughnee</em> of Ibn Qudaamah, regarding Hanbalee Fiqh<br />
5. <em>Bidaayat-ul-Mujtahid</em> of Ibn Rushd, on comparative Fiqh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unfortunately, however, I did not get the chance to complete it because the Kuwaiti magazine, <em>Al-Wa’ee Al-Islaamee</em>, that promised to publish it and that received it graciously after reviewing it, didn’t print it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since I missed that opportunity, then perhaps I will be granted the opportunity, Allaah willing, on another occasion to offer a specific knowledge-based course to my brothers that are studying Fiqh, which will assist them and which will facilitate for them the way towards knowing the grades of the Hadeeth, by returning them to the necessary sources of the books of Hadeeth. And which will explain their special and distinct characteristics, as well as what can be relied on from them. And Allaah, Most High, is the One who grants success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] The book is called: “Nasab-ul-Majaaneeq fee Nasf Qissat-il-Gharaaneeq.” [Printed by Al-Maktab-ul- Islaamee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Now the number has passed five thousand ahaadeeth, may Allaah facilitate them to be printed soon</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[2] Question:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;">Noble Shaikh! The Qur’aaniyoon [3] say: Allaah says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;">وَكُلَّ شَيْءٍ فَصَّلْنَاهُ تَفْصِيلًا</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>“And We have explained everything in detail with a full explanation.”<br />
</strong> [Surah Al-Israa: 12]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;">And Allaah says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;">مَّا فَرَّطْنَا فِي الْكِتَابِ مِن شَيْءٍ</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>“We have not neglected anything in the Book.”</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#333333;"> [Surah Al-An’aam: 38]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;">And the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <strong>“Verily this Qur’aan – part of it is in the Hand of Allaah and part of it is in your hands. So hold fast onto it, for you will never go astray nor will you ever be ruined after it.”</strong> [4]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;">We would like your comments on this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[2] Answer:</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Allaah’s saying: <strong>“We have not neglected anything in the Book”</strong>, what is meant by the word “<strong>Book</strong>” here is the Preserved Tablet and not the Noble Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for Allaah’s statement: <strong>“And We have explained everything in detail with a full explanation”</strong>, if you attach what was explained previously to the Noble Qur’aan, then it becomes certain that Allaah has indeed explained everything in detail, however with another provision. You are aware that an explanation may at times be general, such as when one places general rules under which exist many particulars the likes of which cannot be confined due to their large number. So by the Wise Legislator placing well known rules for these many particulars, the meaning of the noble ayah becomes apparent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The explanation may also be detailed, and this is what is obvious from this ayah as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“I have not left behind anything that Allaah commanded me with except that I have ordered you to do it. And I have not left behind anything that Allaah forbade me from except that I have forbidden you from it.”</strong> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the explanation may at times be with rules, which many particulars (and details) fall under. And at other times it may be in such detail in terms of the vocabulary of the acts of worship and laws that it does not require being referenced to any of these rules.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among the rules that numerous branches fall under – and which show the greatness of Islaam and the vast scope of Islaam in legislating – for example, are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet’s صلى الله عليه وسلم statement: <strong>“There is no harming (of oneself) or others.”</strong> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet’s صلى الله عليه وسلم statement: <strong>“Every intoxicant is alcohol and every alcohol is unlawful.”</strong> [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his صلى الله عليه وسلم statement: <strong>“Every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Hellfire.”</strong> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are rules and generalizations that do not exclude anything related to harming of one’s self or harming of one’s wealth, with respect to the first hadeeth, nor does it exclude anything related to that which intoxicates, with respect to the second hadeeth, whether the intoxicant is derived from grapes, which is the most popular form, or from corn or from any other substance. So long as the product is an intoxicant, it is unlawful (Haraam).</p>
<p><em><span style="color:#808080;">[<strong>Note</strong>: Read </span><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2016/07/16/the-need-for-the-sunnah-in-order-to-understand-the-quraan/">The Need for the Sunnah in order to Understand the Qur’aan </a><span style="color:#808080;">– Shaykh al Albaani]</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same goes for the third hadeeth – it is not possible to take into account the number of innovations due to their large amount. It is not possible to account for all of them. However in spite of this, this hadeeth – even though brief in size – states with all clarity: <strong>“Every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Hellfire.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a detailed statement but with rules.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the laws that you are aware of, they are explained in detail by words that have been mentioned in the Sunnah in most cases and at times they are mentioned in the noble Qur’aan as is the case with the laws of inheritance, for example.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the hadeeth that was mentioned in the question, then it is an authentic hadeeth, and acting upon it is what we should try to adhere to as stated in the hadeeth in which the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <strong>“I have left two things amongst you by which you will never go astray so long as you hold steadfast onto them: The Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger.”</strong> [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So holding steadfast onto the Rope of Allaah – which is in our hands – refers to acting upon the Sunnah, which explains the noble Qur’aan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>A Weak Hadeeth from Mu’aadh regarding Opinion, and what is Rejected from it:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Before I finish my talk, I feel that it is necessary for me to direct the attention of the brothers in attendance to a famous hadeeth, which seldom is missing from the books on the Principles of Fiqh. I will mention it because <strong>it is weak</strong>, from the perspective of its chain of narration as well as it being in contradiction with what I spoke about in this talk, which was <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>the lack of there being any distinction between the Qur’aan and the Sunnah when it comes to deriving Laws, and the obligation of accepting these two sources together</strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed it is the hadeeth of Mu’aadh bin Jabal radhi Allaahu anhu who reported that the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said to him when he sent him to Yemen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“With what will you judge by?” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>He said: “By the Book of Allaah.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>He صلى الله عليه وسلم said: “And if you don’t find (the answer in) it?” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>He said: “Then by the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>He replied: “And if you don’t find (the answer in) it?” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>He said: “I will strive to form my own opinion.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>So he صلى الله عليه وسلم said: “All praise be to Allaah who guided the messenger of Allaah’s Messenger to that which Allaah’s Messenger loves.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the weakness of its chain, then this is not the place to discuss it now. But I clarified this exhaustively, perhaps the likes of which was not undertaken in the past, in (my book) the <strong>“Silsilah”</strong> (of weak hadeeth) I mentioned previously. [4] But suffice it to say now that the Ameer-ul-Mu’mineen in Hadeeth, Imaam Al-Bukhaaree, said about this hadeeth that it was “rejected.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">So having said this, it is now possible for me to begin explaining the contradiction it </span></strong><strong><span style="color:#993300;">poses, which I stated earlier. So I say:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth establishes a methodology of ruling for the judge, based on three stages. He is not permitted to seek a ruling from his opinion unless after he acknowledges he can’t find it in the Sunnah. Nor is he allowed to derive a ruling from the Sunnah until after he establishes he can’t find it in the Qur’aan. With respect to the opinion, this method (of deriving a ruling) is valid and correct according to all of the scholars, which is why they would say: “When the narration is mentioned, the opinion is nullified.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, with respect to the Sunnah, this method is not correct, because the Sunnah determines and explains the Book of Allaah. So it is obligatory for one to look for the ruling in the Sunnah, even if he thinks that it exists in the Qur’aan, based on what we stated previously. So the Sunnah with respect to the Qur’aan is not like the opinion with respect to the Sunnah. No, definitely not. Rather we must consider the Qur’aan and the Sunnah as one source, there being no distinction between them at all. This is as has been indicated in the sayings of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Indeed, I was given the Qur’aan and something similar to it, along with it”</span></strong> – meaning the Sunnah – and <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“They will not be separated from one another until they return to the Fountain.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this dividing them into categories, mentioned in the hadeeth, is not correct, because it necessitates that they are separate from one another. And this is false, as I have explained previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] It is found under number 885 of Silsilat-ul-Ahaadeeth ad-Da’eefah. We hope that the volume that includes it will be printed soon, in shaa Allaah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">It is unfortunate that there can be found some contemporary tafseer writers and authors that have taken the view of making permissible what has been mentioned in the last two examples <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>[1]</strong></span> , such as the permissibility of eating predatory animals and wearing gold and silk, relying upon the Qur’aan (as proof) only! In fact, there can be found in this present time a group that call themselves the <strong>Qur’aaniyoon</strong>, who interpret the Qur’aan according to their desires and intellects, without seeking assistance for that in the authentic Sunnah. Rather, the Sunnah, according to them, is subordinate to their desires. So whatever part of it conforms to their desires, they affirm it, and whatever doesn’t conform to their desires, they throw behind their backs (rejecting it).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم indicated these individuals in an authentic hadeeth, when he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Do not let any one of you sit reclining on his couch, then when something that I have commanded him to do comes to him, he says: ‘I don’t know! Whatever we find in the Book of Allaah, we will follow it.’”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by At-Tirmidhee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration, he صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“…’whatever we find in it that’s unlawful, we will declare unlawful.’ Indeed, I was sent with the Qur’aan and something equal to it along with it.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another report, he صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Indeed, whatever the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم forbade is the same as what Allaah forbade.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, what is unfortunate is that one dignified author wrote a book on the Legislation and Creed of Islaam. He stated in his introduction that he wrote the book but he had no references in it except for the Qur’aan! So this authentic hadeeth provides clear proof that the Islamic Legislation is not based on the Qur’aan only, but rather it is based on the Qur’aan and Sunnah. So whoever takes hold of one in the absence of the other, doesn’t actually take hold of any of them. This is because each one of them commands that the other one be adhered to. This is as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Whoever obeys the Messenger, has indeed obeyed Allaah.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Surah An-Nisaa: 80]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Surah An-Nisaa: 65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allaah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any choice in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger, has indeed strayed in a plain error.” </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Surah Al-Ahzaab: 36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And whatever the Messenger gives you then do it, and whatever he forbids you from, then abstain from it.”</strong></span> [Surah Al-Hashr: 7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In connection with this ayah, I am amazed at what has been authentically reported from Ibn Mas’ood radhi Allaahu anhu, which is that a woman once came to him and said: “Are you the one who said: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘May Allaah’s curse be on the woman that puck eyebrows and those who ask for their eyebrows to be plucked and those who tattoo…’</span></strong> He said: ‘Yes.’ She said: ‘I read the Qur’aan from its front to its back and I did not find in it that which you say!’ He responded: ‘If you had (truly) read it, you would have found it. Did you not read: ‘And whatever the Messenger gives you then take it (i.e. do it), and whatever he forbids you from, then stay away from?’ She said: ‘Of course!’ He صلى الله عليه وسلم said: ‘Then I indeed heard The Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم say: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘May Allaah’s curse be on the woman that pluck eyebrows and those who ask for their eyebrows to be plucked…’”</strong></span> [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">All praise is for Allaah. We praise Him, we seek His aid, and we ask for His forgiveness. We seek Allaah&#8217;s refuge from the evils of ourselves and from our evil actions. Whomsoever Allaah guides then none can misguide him, and whomsoever Allaah misguides then none can guide him. I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone, having no partner, and I testify that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger. To proceed:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">Then it was suggested to me that I should undertake an abridgement of my book, <em><strong>Sifat Salaatin-Nabiyy صلى الله عليه وسلم minat-Takbeer ilat-Tasleem Ka&#8217;annaka Taraahaa</strong></em>, “<em><strong>A Description of the Prophet&#8217;s صلى الله عليه وسلم Prayer from the Takbeer to the Tasleem as if You Were Seeing It</strong></em>,” and that I should shorten it and rephrase it for it to be more accessible to the common people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">So I saw this to be a favorable suggestion, and it agreed with what I myself had felt for a long time. I had also frequently heard such advice from brothers and friends. So this encouraged me to allocate to it a small part of my time which is crowded with knowledge related work and research. So I hastened, as far as my ability and efforts allowed, to carry out the suggestion, whilst asking the Guardian Lord, the One free of all imperfections and the Most High, that He should make it an action done purely and sincerely for His Face, and that He should cause it to be of benefit to my brother Muslims.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">In it I have quoted some extra points of benefit additional to what is to be found in Sifatus-Salaat. These were matters that came to my attention and I saw that it would be appropriate to mention them in the abridgement.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">I also gave particular attention to explaining some phrases occurring in some of the ahaadeeth and the adhkaar (words of remembrance of Allaah). I also provided major headings for each section, and also sub-headings for further clarification. Under these I quoted the points under discussion, numbered consecutively. Alongside each issue I quoted the ruling: whether it is a pillar (rukn) or an obligation (waajib). As for those matters about which I remained silent and did not mention a ruling, then they are from the Sunan1, and some of them carry the possibility of being declared obligatory &#8211; however stating one or the other with certainty would conflict with what is befitting from scholarly research.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">So the pillar (rukn) is that which is essential for completion of the affair that it falls within, being such that its absence necessitates that the action depending upon it is nullified. An example is the bowing (rukoo&#8217;) in the Prayer &#8211; it is a pillar of it, and if it is absent then the Prayer is nullified.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">The condition (shart) is like the pillar (rukn) except that it is something outside the action that is dependant upon it. An example is the ablution (wudoo) for the Prayer. Prayer is not correct without it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">The obligation (waajib) is that which has an established command in the Book or the Sunnah, but there is no proof that it is a pillar (rukn) or a condition (shart). One who carries it out is rewarded, and one who leaves it without valid excuse is punished. Just like it is the fard (obligation) and making a difference between the fard and the waajib is a newly invented use of terminology for which there is no proof.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">The sunnah is an action of worship that the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم continually performed, either always doing it or usually doing it, but which he did not command in a manner causing it to be an obligation. It is such that one who carries it out is rewarded, but one who leaves it out is not punished or blameworthy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">As for the hadeeth that some blind-followers mention and attribute to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, “Whoever leaves my sunnah will not receive my intercession,” then there is no basis for it from Allaah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم and whatever is not established as his صلى الله عليه وسلم saying, then it is not allowed to attribute it to him صلى الله عليه وسلم, for fear of falsely attributing something to him. As he صلى الله عليه وسلم said, “Whoever falsely quotes me as saying that which I have not said-then let him take his sitting place in the Hell-Fire.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">Then it goes without saying that in it, just as in the original work, I do not restrict myself to any particular madhhab from the four followed madhhabs. Rather in it I followed the way of the people of the hadeeth: those who adhere to acceptance of every hadeeth that is established from the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم. Because of this fact their position is stronger than the madhhabs of those besides them, and this is something witnessed to by the fair-minded people of every madhhab. Amongst those witnessing to this was Abul-Hasanaat al- Luknawee al-Hanafee who said, “How could that not be the case when they are the true inheritors of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, and are the true representatives of his Religion. May Allaah raise us up amongst them, and cause us to die whilst having love for them and whilst following their way.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">And may Allaah have mercy upon Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal who said, ‘The Religion of Muhammad is the narrations (akhbaar)’ &#8211; what a fine means for the youth are the reports (aathaar). Do not turn away desiring other then the hadeeth and its people. For opinion (ra&#8217;y) is night and the hadeeth is day. And perhaps a youth may be ignorant of where guidance lies whilst the sun has arisen and is shining brightly.&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad Naasirud-deen al-Albaanee Damascus, 26th Safar 1392AH</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>FACING THE KA&#8217;BAH (Istiqbaalul-Ka&#8217;bah)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) If you stand, O Muslim, to pray &#8211; then face the direction of the Ka&#8217;bah, wherever you are, in obligatory Prayers and optional Prayers. This is one of the pillars of the Prayer, such that the Prayer is not valid without it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) The obligation to face the direction of the Ka&#8217;bah is removed from a warrior having to pray the Fear Prayer and during severe fighting. It is also removed from one who is rendered incapable of it, such as one who is (very) ill, or one who is upon a ship, car or airplane and who fears that the Prayer time will reach its end. It is also removed from one who prays optional Prayer or the Witr Prayer upon a riding beast or vehicle. It is, however, preferable for him, if he is able, to turn it towards the Qiblah for the initial takbeer. After that it does not matter in which direction it turns.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) It is obligatory upon everyone who can actually see the Ka&#8217;bah to face it directly. As for those who cannot actually see it then they should face its direction.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE RULING CONCERNING PRAYING TOWARDS A DIRECTION OTHER THAN THAT OF THE KA&#8217;BAH BY MISTAKE</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4) If a person prays towards other than the Qiblah due to the sky being cloudy or for any reason other than that, after having tried to the best of his knowledge and ability to face the correct direction, then his Prayer will be correct and he will not have to repeat it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5) However if a person whom he holds to be reliable comes to him whilst he is praying and informs him of the correct direction, then he must immediately turn to the correct direction, and his Prayer will be correct.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>STANDING (Qiyaam)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(6) It is obligatory that the person prays standing. This is a pillar (rukn) except for:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) The one who is praying the Fear Prayer or during severe fighting. In these circumstances it is permissible for him to pray whilst riding.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) Also the one who is ill and the one who is unable to stand, he should pray sitting if he is able, or if not then whilst lying down. (iii) Also the person praying Optional (Nafl) Prayer, he may pray whilst riding or whilst sitting if he wishes, and in this case he should perform rukoo&#8217; (bowing) and sujood (prostration) by lowering his head and likewise the sick. He should lower his head further for the prostration than for the bowing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(7) It is not permissible for the person praying sitting to place something raised upon the ground to prostrate upon. Rather he should only make the movement for his prostration lower than that for his bowing, as we have already mentioned, this is what he does if he is unable to directly place his head upon the ground.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">PRAYER ON A SHIP OR AIRPLANE</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(8) It is permissible to pray the Obligatory Prayer upon a ship, and likewise in an airplane.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(9) A person may pray sitting in either of them if he fears that he will fall over.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(10) In the case of old age or bodily weakness, it is allowed for him during the standing to support himself against a pillar or with a stick.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(11) It is permissible to pray the voluntary Prayer during the night standing or even sitting without an excuse, and he can combine both of these. So he may pray and recite whilst sitting, and then shortly before the rukoo&#8217; he may stand and recite the few aayahs that remain for him whilst standing. Then he bows and prostrates, and then he does the same in the second rak&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(12) If he prays sitting, he sits with his legs crossed, or in any manner of sitting that is comfortable for him.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">PRAYER WHILST WEARING SHOES</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(13) It is allowed for him to stand in Prayer barefooted, just as it is allowed for him to pray whilst wearing shoes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(14) What is better is that he sometimes prays barefooted and sometimes prays wearing shoes, doing what is easy for him. So he should not force himself to wear them for the Prayer nor force himself to remove them. Rather if he happens to be barefooted he should pray barefooted, and if he is wearing shoes he should pray whilst wearing the shoes, unless a situation requires otherwise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(15) If he does remove his shoes then he should not place them on his right-hand side, rather he should place them to his left as long as there is nobody praying to his left. Otherwise he should place them between his feet [2]. This order is authentically reported from the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>PRAYING WHILST STANDING UPON THE PULPIT (MINBAR)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(16) It is allowed for the Imaam to pray upon an elevated place, such as the minbar &#8211; for the purpose of teaching the people. He stands upon it and says the takbeer [3] and recites and bows upon it. Then he steps backwards in order to perform the prostrations on the ground at the foot of the pulpit. Then he can return to it and do in the second rak&#8217;ah the same as that which he did in the first.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE OBLIGATION OF PRAYING TOWARDS A SUTRA (BARRIER) AND OF BEING CLOSE TO IT</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(17) It is obligatory that he prays towards a barrier (sutrah). It makes no difference whether he is praying in a mosque or elsewhere, nor whether the mosque is large or small. This is because of the all-embracing statement of the Prophet , “Do not pray except towards a sutrah, and do not let anyone walk in front o f you. So if a person insists (on trying to pass) then fight him, because he has an evil companion along with him,” meaning a devil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(18) It is obligatory that he is close to it, since the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم commanded that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(19) Between his صلى الله عليه وسلم place of prostration and the wall towards which he prayed there would be a space approximately wide enough for a sheep to pass through. So if one does likewise then he has carried out the closeness that is obligatory upon him.[4]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE REQUIRED HEIGHT OF THE SUTRAH (BARRIER)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(20) It is obligatory that the height of the sutrah above the ground be at least a span or two spans, due to his saying, “If one of you places in front of him the like of the back-part of a camel-saddle5, then let him pray and not care about what passes beyond that.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(21) The person praying faces the sutrah directly. This is what is apparent from the command to pray towards the sutrah. As for the matter of moving slightly to the right or the left, so that he does not stand directly in line with it, then this is not authentically established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(22) It is permissible to pray towards a staff stuck into the ground or its like, or towards a tree, or a pillar, or towards his wife who is lying upon the bed beneath the blanket, or towards his riding beast, even if it is a camel.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE FORBIDDANCE OF PRAYING TOWARDS GRAVES</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(23) It is not allowed to pray towards graves whatever the case, whether it be the graves of Prophets or anyone else besides them.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE FORBIDDANCE OF PASSING IN FRONT OF A PERSON WHO IS PRAYING EVEN IN THE SACRED MOSQUE IN MAKKAH (AL. MASJIDUL-HARAAM)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(24) It is not allowed to pass directly in front of a person who is praying if he has a sutrah in front of him. There is no difference in this between al-Masjidul-Haraam and other mosques. The forbiddance applies equally to all of them, due to the generality of his صلى الله عليه وسلم saying, “If the one who passes directly in front of a person knew the (sin) that was upon him, then he would rather stand and wait for forty than pass in front of him.&#8221; Meaning, passing in between him and the place of his sutrah. [6]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE OBLIGATION OF PREVENTING ANYONE TRYING TO PASS IN FRONT OF YOU, EVEN IN THE SACRED MOSQUE IN MAKAAH</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(25) It is not allowed for a person praying towards a sutrah to allow anyone to pass in front of him, due to the previous hadeeth, “&#8230; and do not let anyone walk in front of him &#8230;” and his صلى الله عليه وسلم saying, “If one of you prays towards something that screens him from the people, and someone wants to pass in front of him, then let him repel him by pushing him on the chest, and let him repel him as much as he can &#8230; [and in a narration &#8230; then let him fight him, for he is a devil].”</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">MOVING FORWARD TO PREVENT SOMEONE PASSING</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(26) And it is allowed for him to take a step or more forwards in order to prevent an animal or a child from passing in front of him, so that they pass behind him.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THAT WHICH BREAKS / DISRUPTS THE PRAYER</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(27) From the importance of the sutrah in Prayer is that it prevents the person&#8217;s Prayer being nullified by the passing of that which will disrupt it. Contrary to the one who prays without a sutrah, since his Prayer will be nullified if an adult woman, or likewise a donkey, or a black dog passes in front of him.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE INTENTION (an-Niyyah)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(28) The person who is going to pray must have in his heart the intention to pray that particular Prayer, be it the Obligatory Zuhr or &#8216;Asr Prayer, or the sunnah Prayer&#8217;s for them, for example. This is a condition (shart) or a pillar (rukn). As for expressing that upon the tongue, then it is an innovation (bid&#8217;ah), contrary to the sunnah. This was not upheld by any of the Imaams followed by the blindfollowers. THE TAKBEER (Saying: `Allaahu Akbar&#8217;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(29) He begins the Prayer by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaahu Akbar Allaah is Greater.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a pillar (rukn), due to his saying, “The key to the Prayer is Purification. That which makes outside actions forbidden is the takbeer, and that which causes outside actions to become permissible is the tasleem [7].”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(30) He should not raise his voice in saying the takbeer in any of the Prayers, unless he is an Imaam (leading others in prayer).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(31) It is allowed for the mu&#8217;adhdhin to repeat the takbeer of the Imaam in a louder voice in order for the people to hear it, as long as there is a need for that, such as the Imaam&#8217;s being ill, having a weak voice, or there being a very large number of people praying behind him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(32) The person following an Imaam in Prayer should not say the takbeer until the Imaam has finished saying it.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>RAISING THE HANDS AND HOW IT IS TO BE DONE</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(33) He should raise his hands whilst saying the takbeer or before it, or after it. All of these are established in the sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(34) He should raise his hands with the fingers extended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(35) He should raise his palms up to the level of his shoulders, and sometimes he should raise them even further, up to the level of his car lobes. [8]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>PLACING THE HANDS AND HOW IT IS TO BE DONE</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(36) Then after the takbeer he should place his right hand upon his left hand, and this is from the practice (sunnah) of the Prophets, &#8216;alaihimus-salaatu was-salaam, and Allaah&#8217;s Messenger commanded his Companions with it. It is therefore not permissible to leave the hands hanging by one&#8217;s sides.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(37) He should place his right hand upon his left hand, wrist and forearm.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(38) Sometimes he should grasp the left hand with the right hand. [9]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">WHERE THE HANDS ARE TO BE PLACED</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(39) He should only place his hands upon his chest. This applies equally to men and women. [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(40) It is not allowed to place the right-hand on the waist.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">HUMILITY AND ATTENTIVENESS (al-Khushoo’) AND LOOKING AT THE PLACE OF PROSTRATION</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(41) He must have humility and attentiveness in his Prayer, and should avoid everything that may divert his attention, whether it be designs or decoration. Nor should he pray when food that he desires has been served, nor whilst he is having to withhold urine or faeces.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(42) Whilst standing he should look towards the place of his prostration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(43) He should not turn to the right or the left, since his turning aside will be something that Satan snatches away and steals from the person&#8217;s Prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(44) It is not allowed for him to raise his sight to the sky.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">THE OPENING SUPPLICATION (Du&#8217;aa al-Istiftaah)</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(45) Then he should begin by reciting one of the supplications established from the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, and they are many. The most wellknown is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Subhaanak-Allaahumma, wa biham-dika, wa tabaarakasmuka, wa ta&#8217;aalaa jadduka, wa laa ilaaha ghayruka</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I declare You free and far removed from all imperfections, O Allaah, and all praise is for You. Blessed is Your Name. Great and Exalted is Your Kingdom. None has the right to be worshipped besides You.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The command for this is established, so one should be careful to do it. [11]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">THE RECITATION (al-Qiraa&#8217;ah)</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(46) Then he must seek refuge with Allaah, the Most High, and it is an obligation, he will be sinful if he leaves it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(47) The Sunnah is that he should sometimes say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A&#8217;oodhu billaahi min ash-Shaytaan-ir-Rajeem [min hamzihi, wa nafkhihi, wa nafthihi]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I seek refuge with Allaah from Satan, the Rejected One [from the insanity he brings about, from his arrogance and from his evil poetry].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(48) Or that he says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A&#8217;oodhu billaah-is-Samee&#8217;-il-&#8216;Aleem min ash-Shaytaan-ir-Rajeem min hamzihi, wa nafkhihi, wa nafthihi</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I seek refuge with Allaah, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing, from Satan, the Rejected One, from the insanity he brings about, from his arrogance and from his evil poetry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(49) Then he should say quietly, in both loud and silent Prayers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillaahir-Rahmaanir-Raheem</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower o f Mercy.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>RECITING SOORAH AL-FAATIHAH</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(50) Then he recites the whole of Soorah al-Faatihah, and (Bismillaah …) is an aayah from it. This is a pillar (rukn), and the Prayer will not be correct without it. So it is obligatory upon even those who do not know Arabic that they memorize it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(51) But one who is still unable to recite it, then it is sufficient for him to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Subhaan-Allaah, wal-hamdulillaah, wa laa ilaaha illallaah, wallaahu Akbar, wa laa hawla wa laa quwwata illaa billaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I declare Allaah free and far removed from all imperfections, and all praise is for Allaah, and Allaah is greater and no power except by the Will of Allah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(52) The Sunnah, when reciting it, is to read it aayah by aayah. One should pause after each aayah. So he says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillaahir-Rahmaanir-Raheem<br />
In the Name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he pauses &#8230; then he says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hamdu lillaahi Rabbil-&#8216;Aalameen<br />
All praise is for Allaah, the Lord of all the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he pauses &#8230; then he says:<br />
Ar-Rahmaan-ir-Raheem<br />
The Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he pauses &#8230; then he says:<br />
Maaliki Yawmid-Deen<br />
Owner o f the Day of Recompense.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he pauses, he does likewise until he completes it. [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The whole of the Prophet&#8217;s صلى الله عليه وسلم recitation would be like this. He would stop at the end of each aayah, and not join it together with the aayah after it, even if they were connected in meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(53) It is permissible to recite either “Maaliki” &#8230; Owner of the Day of Recompense, or “Maliki” &#8230; King of the Day of Recompense.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE RECITATION OF SOORAH AL-FAATIHAH BY ONE WHO IS PRAYING ALONG WITH AN IMAAM</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(54) It is obligatory that the one praying behind an imaam also recites it in quiet Prayers. He should also recite it in loud Prayers if he cannot hear an imaam reciting, or if it happens that the imaam remains silent after his own recitation in order to enable the follower to recite it. However, it is our view that this period of silence is not established from the Sunnah. [13]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE RECITATION AFTER SOORAH AL-FAATIHAH</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(55) It is from the Sunnah that after reciting al-Faatihah, he recites another Soorah &#8211; even in the Funeral Prayer, or that he recites some aayahs, in the first two rak&#8217;ahs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(56) He may sometimes lengthen the recitation after it and shorten it at other times, due to the needs of travel, having a cough and cold, being ill or due to the crying of a child.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(57) The length of recitation will vary according to the different Prayers. So generally, the recitation in the Dawn (Fajr) Prayer is longer than the recitation in any of the other Prayers. Next comes the Zuhr, then the &#8216;Asr and the Maghrib, then the &#8216;Ishaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(58) The recitation in the (optional) Night Prayer (Salaatul-Layl) is longer than any of those.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(59) The Sunnah is also to make the recitation in the first rak&#8217;ah longer than the recitation in the second rak&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(60) Also that he makes the recitation in the last two rak&#8217;ahs shorter than that in the first two, by about a half. [14]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>RECITING SOORAH AL-FAATIHAH IN EVERY RAK&#8217;AH</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(61) It is obligatory that he recites al-Faatihah in every rak&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(62) It is from the Sunnah that he sometimes recites something in addition to it in the last two rak&#8217;ahs also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(63) It is not allowed for the imaam to prolong the recitation more than what occurs in the Sunnah. By doing so he would cause difficulty to some of those who may be praying behind him, such as old people, sick people, nursing mothers and those who have needs to attend to.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>LOUD AND QUIET RECITATION</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(64) He should recite aloud in the Dawm (Fujr) Prayer, the Jumu&#8217;ah Prayer, the two &#8216;Eid Prayers, the Prayer for seeking rain, the Eclipse Prayer and in the first two rak&#8217;ahs of the Maghrib and &#8216;Ishaa Prayers. He should recite quietly in the Zuhr and &#8216;Asr Prayers, in the third rak&#8217;ah of the Maghrib Prayer and the last two rak&#8217;ahs of the &#8216;Ishaa Prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(65) It is permissible for the Imaam sometimes to recite an aayah loud enough to be heard by the people in the quiet Prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(66) As for the Witr Prayer and the Prayer during the night (Salaatul-Layl), then he should sometimes recite quietly in it, and recite loudly at other times. However, his voice should only be raised moderately.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>RECITING THE QUR&#8217;AAN SLOWLY (AND BEAUTFIULLY)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(67) The Sunnah is that he recites the Qur&#8217;aan slowly. He should not recite it quickly or hurriedly. Rather, his recitation should be clear and each letter distinguishable. He should also beatify the Qur&#8217;aan with his voice, and recite it in a beautiful and good manner, whilst abiding by the rulings that are well-known to scholars of recitation. He may not recite it in newly innovated tones, nor in the manner of singing.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">CORRECTING THE IMAAM</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(68) It is prescribed for the one praying behind an imaam that he corrects him if he becomes mixed up in his recitation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE BOWING (RUKOO&#8217;)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(69) When he has finished reciting he remains silent for a moment, long enough to return his breathing to normal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(70) Then he raises his hands, in the manner described previously with regard to the initial takbeer (point nos. 33, 34 and 35).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(71) He also says the takbeer (i.e., Allaahu Akbar), and this is obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(72) Then he performs the rukoo&#8217; (i.e., bows) in such a manner that all his joints are settled, and each part of the body is at rest. This is a pillar (rukn).</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">HOW THE BOWING (RUKOO&#8217;) IS PERFORMED</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(73) He should place his hands firmly upon his knees. He should spread his fingers, as if he were grasping his knees. All of this is obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(74) He should stretch out his back and make it level, such that if water were to be poured upon it, then it would settle upon it. This is an obligation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(75) He should neither cause his head to droop lower than his back, nor should he raise it above it. Rather he should make it level with his back.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(76) He should keep his elbows (straight and) apart from his sides.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(77) He should say in his rukoo&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Subhaana Rabbee al-&#8216;Azeem<br />
I declare my Lord, the Supreme, free and far removed from all imperfections. [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saying it three times, or more.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(78) From the Sunnah is that he makes the pillars of equal length. So he should make his rukoo&#8217;, his sujood (prostration), and his sitting between the two prostrations of similar length.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(79) It is not allowed for him to recite the Qur&#8217;aan in the rukoo&#8217; (bowing), nor in the sujood (prostration).</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>STRAIGHTENING UP FROM THE RUKOO&#8217;</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(80) Then he must raise up and straighten his back from the rukoo&#8217;. This is a pillar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(81) He must say, while raising his back:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Sami&#8217; Allaahu liman hamidah</span><br />
Allaah listens and responds to the one who praises Him. This is an obligation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(82) He should raise his hands when he rises up, in the manner that has preceded (point nos. 33, 34 and 35).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(83) Then he should stand straight up and remain still, such that every bone returns to its place. This is a pillar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(84) He should say while standing:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Rabbanaa wa lakal-hamd</span><br />
O our Lord! And all praise is for You.[16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is obligatory upon everyone praying, even if he is praying behind an imaam [17], since it is the saying prescribed for this standing position. As for the saying, then it is the saying prescribed to be said whilst rising.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(85) He should make this standing about as long as the rukoo&#8217; (bowing), as has preceded.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">THE SUJOOD (PROSTRATION)</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(86) Then he says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaahu Akbar<br />
Allaah is Greater.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and this is an obligation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(87) And he should raise his hands, sometimes.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">PLACING THE HANDS FIRST WHEN PROSTRATING</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(88) Then he prostrates, placing his hands upon the ground before his knees. This is what Allaah&#8217;s Messenger commanded, and it is what is established from his practice. He also forbade the people from kneeling down in the manner that the camel kneels, and the camel places its knees -which are its fore-legs &#8211; first.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(89) So when he prostrates, and it is a pillar, he should rest upon his palms, and extend together.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(90) He should keep his fingers them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(91) And point them towards the qiblah (direction of Prayer).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(92) And he should place his palms level with his shoulders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(93) And sometimes he places them level with his ears.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(94) And he must lift his elbows away from the ground. This is obligatory. He is not allowed to spread them on the ground in the manner of the dog.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(95) He must place his nose and his forehead firmly upon the ground, this is a pillar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(96) He must also place his knees firmly on the ground.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(97) And likewise his toes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(98) His feet should be placed upright on the ground. All of these are obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(99) The tips of his toes should be pointed towards the qiblah (direction of Prayer).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(100) And his heels should be joined together.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>BEING SETTLED IN THE PROSTRATION</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(101) It is obligatory that he is settled in his prostration. This comes about by his resting equally on each of the parts of the body that touch the ground when prostrating. These are: the forehead and the nose &#8211; together, the two palms, the two knees and the toes of each foot.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(102) So whoever settles in his prostration in this manner, then he has certainly attained the stillness necessary. This stillness (itmi&#8217;naan) in the prostration is a pillar also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(103) He should say in it:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Subhaana Rabbee al-A&#8217; laa</span><br />
I declare my Lord, the Most High, free and far removed from all imperfections.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">three times or more.[18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(104) It is recommended to supplicate to Allaah as much as possible while in prostration, since it is a time most suitable for the acceptance of supplications.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(105) He should make his prostration about as long as his bowing, as has preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(106) It is allowed to prostrate upon the earth, or upon something placed upon the ground such as a garment, a carpet, a mat and the like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(107) It is not allowed to recite the Qur&#8217;aan in prostration.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">SITTING UPON THE LEFT FOOT LAID FLAT (AL-IFTIRAASH) AND SITTING UPON THE RAISED HEELS (AL-IQ&#8217;AA`) IN BETWEEN THE TWO PROSTRATIONS</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(108) Then he raises up his head, saying the takbeer (i.e., Allaahu Akbar). This is an obligation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(109) He raises his hands at this point, sometimes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(110) Then he sits with calmness, such that every bone settles in its place. This is a pillar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(111) He should lay his left foot flat beneath him and sit upon it. This is an obligation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(112) He sets his right foot upright upon the ground.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(113) He should make the toes of his right foot point towards the qiblah (direction of Prayer).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(114) It is also permissible to sit upon the heels (al-Iq&#8217;aa`) sometimes. He does this by sitting upon his heels with both feet upright.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(115) He says in his sitting:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaahumma-ghfirlee, warhamnee, wajburnee, warfa&#8217;nee, wa&#8217;aafinee, warzuqnee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah forgive me, and have mercy upon me, and suffice me, and raise my rank, and grant me safety and well-being, and grant me provision.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(116) And if he wishes he may (instead) say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rabbi-ghfirlee, Rabbi-ghfirlee<br />
O my Lord, forgive me! O my Lord, forgive me!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(117) And he should prolong this sitting until it becomes of similar length to his prostration.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">THE SECOND PROSTRATION</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(118) Then he says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaahu Akbar<br />
Allaah is Greater.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and this is an obligation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(119) And he raises his hands with this takbeer, sometimes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(120) And he performs the second prostration, and this is a pillar also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(121) He does in the second prostration that which he did in the first.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">SITTING AT REST (JILSATUL-ISTIRAAHAH)</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(122) So when he raises his head up from the second prostration, and he intends to get up to perform the second rak&#8217;ah, then he says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaahu Akbar<br />
Allaah is Greater.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and this is an obligation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(123) And he raises his hands, sometimes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(124) And he (briefly) sits upright, sitting upon his left foot, such that every bone returns to its place, before standing.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">THE SECOND UNIT OF PRAYER (RAK&#8217;AH)</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(125) Then he gets up, supporting himself upon the ground with his fists clenched, like one who clenches his fists when kneading dough. So he stands up for the second rak&#8217;ah, and this is a pillar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(126) He does in the second rak&#8217;ah the same as he did in the first.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(127) Except that he does not recite, “The Opening Supplication,” (i.e., Du&#8217;aa al-Istiftaah) in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(128) He should make the second rak&#8217;ah shorter than the first rak&#8217;ah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>SITTING FOR THE DECLARATION OF FAITH (TASHAHHUD)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(129) So when he finishes the second rak&#8217;ah he sits to perform the tashahhud. This is obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(130) And he sits upon the left foot laid flat, as preceded with regard to the sitting between the two prostrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(131) However it is not allowed to sit upon the two heels for this sitting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(134) It it is not allowed for him to sit whilst resting upon his hand, especially the left hand.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>AGITATING THE FOREFINGER AND FIXING ONES SIGHT UPON IT</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(135) He should clench all the fingers of his right hand, placing his thumb onto his middle finger sometimes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(136) At other times he may make a circle with his thumb and middle finger together.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(137) He should point his forefinger towards the qiblah (Direction of Prayer).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(138) He should fix his gaze upon his forefinger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(139) And he should agitate it, making supplication with it, from the start to the end of the tashahhud.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(140) He should not point with his left forefinger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(141) He does all of this in every tashahhud.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE WORDING FOR THE TASHAHHUD AND THE SUPPLICATION AFTER IT</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(142) The tashahhud is obligatory. If he forgets it, then he should perform two extra prostrations for forgetfulness (Sajdatus-Sahw) at the end of the Prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(143) Its wording is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">At-Tahiyyaatu lillaahi, was-Salwaatu, wat-Tayyibaatu. As-Salaamu &#8216;alan-Nabee&#8217;, wa rahmatullaahi wa barakaatuh. As-Salaamu &#8216;alaynaa wa &#8216;alaa &#8216;ibaad-illaah-is-Saaliheen. Ashhadu an laa ilaaha illAllaah, wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan &#8216; abduhu wa rasooluh</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Words of Praise and glorification are for Allaah alone, and Prayers and acts of worship, and pure words and attributes. May Allaah send peace and security upon the Prophet19, and may Allaah&#8217;s Mercy and Blessings be upon him. May Allaah send peace and security upon us, and upon all of Allaah&#8217;s righteous servants. I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His Slave and Messenger.[20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(144) After this he should supplicate for blessings upon the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammad, wa &#8216;alaa Aali Muhammad, kamaa sallayta &#8216;alaa Ibraaheem, wa &#8216;alaa Aali Ibraaheem, innaka Hameedun Majeed. Allaahumma baarik &#8216;alaa Muhammad, wa &#8216;alaa Aali Muhammad, kamaa baarakta &#8216;alaa Ibraaheem, wa &#8216;alaa Aali Ibraaheem, innaka Hameedun Majeed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah! Extol and honor Muhammad and the true followers of Muhammad, just as You extolled and honored Ibraaheem and the righteous offspring of Ibraaheem. Indeed, You are deserving of all praise, Perfect in Glory and Honor. 0 Allaah! Send continual blessings upon Muhammad and upon the true followers of Muhammad, just as You sent blessings upon Ibraaheem and upon the righteous offspring of Ibraaheem. Indeed, You are deserving of all praise, Perfect in Glory and Honor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(145) And if you wish to say it in shorter form, then say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammad, wa ‘alaa Aali Muhammed, wa baarik &#8216;alaa Muhammad, wa &#8216;alaa Aal Muhammad, kamaa sallayta wa baarakta &#8216; alaa Ibraaheem wa &#8216;alaa Aali lbraaheem, innaka Hameedun Majeed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah! Extol and honor Muhammad and the true followers of Muhammad, and send continual blessings upon Muhammad and upon the true followers of Muhammad, just as You extolled and honored and sent blessings upon Ibraaheem and upon the righteous offspring of Ibraaheem. Indeed, You are deserving of all praise, Perfect in Glory and Honor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(146) Then he may choose, in this tashahhud, any of the reported supplications that please him, sand supplicate to Allaah with that.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE THIRD AND FOURTH RAK’AHS</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(147) Then he says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Allaahu Akbar</span><br />
Allaah is Greater.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and this is an obligation. The Sunnah is that he says it whilst he is sitting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(148) And he raises his hands, sometimes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(149) Then he gets up to pray the third rak&#8217;ah, and it, like the rak’ah coming after it, is a pillar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(150) He does the same when he wants to get up for the fourth rak&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(151) However before getting up, he should sit up straight, sitting upon his left foot, such that every bone returns to its place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(152) Then he stands by supporting himself upon his hands, just as he did in getting up for the second rak&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(153) In each of the third and fourth rak&#8217;ahs he recites Soorah al- Faatihah, and this is obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(154) Sometimes he may also recite an aayah or more in addition to it.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>AL-QUNOOT (SPECIAL INVOCATION) FOR A CALAMITY AND WHEN IT IS TO BE SAID</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(155) It is from the Sunnah that he performs a special invocation, and supplicates for the Muslims when some calamity strikes them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(156) It is to be said after the bowing (rukoo&#8217;), after he has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Rabbanaa wa lakal-hamd</span></strong><br />
O our Lord! And all praise is for You.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(157) There is no set supplication for this; rather he makes whatever supplication is suited to the specific calamity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(158) He should raise his hands whilst making this supplication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(159) If he is an imaam leading the people in Prayer, he should raise his voice with his supplication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(160) Those who are praying behind him should say `Aameen,&#8217; meaning, `O Allaah, respond to it!&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(161) So when he finishes it he should say the takbeer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaahu Akbar</strong></span><br />
Allaah is Greater.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and perform the prostration.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE QUNOOT (INVOCATION) IN THE WITR PRAYER21 ITS PLACE AND WORDING</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(162) As for the invocation (qunoot) for the Witr Prayer, then it is prescribed to say it occasionally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(163) It should be said before the rukoo&#8217;, contrary to the invocation at the time of a calamity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(164) He should make the following supplication:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Allaahum-mahdinee feeman hadayta, wa &#8216; aafinee feeman &#8216; aafayta, wa tawallanee feeman tawallayta, wa baarik lee feemaa a&#8217;tayta, wa qinee sharra maa qadayta, fa innaka taqdee wa laa yuqdaa &#8216;alayka. Wa innahu laa yadhillu man waalayta, wa laa ya&#8217;izzu man &#8216; aadayta. Tabaaraakta rabbanaa wa ta&#8217;aalayta. Laa manjaa minka illaa ilayka</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah! Continually guide me and make me amongst those whom You have guided, and make me one of those whom You save and secure from all evils. And make me one of those whom You love, and whose affairs You take care of. And grant me blessing in all that You have given me, and save me from the evil of what You have decreed, for You alone decree, and none can contradict Your Decree. None can humiliate those whom You have befriended, nor will those who are enemies of You ever have dignity and honor. Blessed are You, O our Lord, and Exalted. There is no way to flee for safety from You except by fleeing towards You.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(165) Then he should perform the bowing (rukoo&#8217;) and the two prostrations (sujood), as has proceeded.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE FINAL TASHAHHUD AND SITTING WITH ONE&#8217;S LEFT HIP RESTING UPON THE GROUND (AT-TAWARRUK)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(166) Then he should sit for the final tashahhud, and both are obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(167) He should do in it what he did in the first tashahhud.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(168) Except that in it he sits with his left hip resting upon the ground, and with both his feet on his right-side. He places his left foot beneath his right shin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(169) His right foot should be placed upright upon the ground.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(170) And it is allowed to lay it down flat, sometimes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(171) He should lean heavily upon his left knee with his palm,<br />
supporting himself in that manner.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE OBLIGATION OF SUPPLICATING FOR BLESSINGS UPON THE PROPHET (AS-SALAATU &#8216;ALAN-NABEE AND OF SEEKING ALLAAH&#8217;S REFUGE FROM FOUR THINGS</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(172) It is obligatory that he supplicates for blessings upon the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم in this tashahhud, and we have mentioned some wordings for this in the section on the first tashahhud (point nos. 145 and 146).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(173) He must seek Allaah&#8217;s refuge from four things, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Allaahumma innee a&#8217;oodhu bika min &#8216; adhaabi jahannam, wa min &#8216; adhaabil-qabr, wa min fitnatil-mahyaa wal-mamaat, wa min sharri fitnatil-maseehid-Dajjaal</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah! I seek refuge with You from the punishment of Hell-Fire, and from the Punishment of the Grave, and from the Trials of Living and Dying, and from the Evil Trials of the False Messiah (Dajjaal). [22]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>SUPPLICATING (DU&#8217;AA) BEFORE THE SALUTATION (SALAAM)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(174) Then he may supplicate for himself with whatever supplication he wishes from the supplications established in the Book and the Sunnah. There are very many, so if he has not memorised anything from them, then he may supplicate with whatever du&#8217;aa is easy for him, from that which will benefit him in his Religion or his worldly life.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE SALUTATION (AT-TASLEEM) AND ITS TYPES</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(175) Then he should give salutations to his right side, and this is a pillar, turning his face such that the whiteness of his right cheek can be seen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(176) He then gives salutations to his left side, turning his face such that the whiteness of his left cheek can be seen, even if it is the Funeral Prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(177) The imaam leading others in Prayer, should raise his voice with the salutation except when performing the Funeral Prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(178) There are a number of ways of giving the salutations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) To say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">As-Salaamu &#8216;alaykum wa rahmatullaahi wa barakaatuh</span><br />
May Allaah grant you peace and security, and may His Mercy and<br />
Blessings be upon You.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">to his right, and:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">As-Salaamu &#8216;alaykum wa rahmatullaah</span><br />
May Allaah grant you peace and security, and may His Mercy be upon you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">to his left.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) To say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">As-Salaamu &#8216;alaykum wa rahmatullaah</span><br />
May Allaah grant you peace and security, and may His Mercy be upon you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">to his right and left.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(c) To say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">As-Salaamu &#8216;alaykum wa rahmatullaah</span><br />
May Allaah grant you peace and security, and may His Mercy be upon you.<br />
to his right and:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">As-Salaamu &#8216;alaykum</span><br />
May Allaah grant you peace and security.<br />
to his left.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(d) To give a single salutation facing forwards, and turning slightly to the right, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">As-Salaamu &#8216;alaykum</span><br />
May Allaah grant you peace and security.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brother Muslim! This is what I have been able to do with regard to “The Abridgement of the Prophet&#8217;s صلى الله عليه وسلم Prayer Described.” I have striven to make it easily understandable, so that it should be clear to you and so that you may picture it as if you were seeing it with your (own) eyes. So if you perform the Prayer in the manner that I have described to you, from the Prayer of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, then I hope that Allaah, the Most High, will accept it from you, because in that case you will be putting into practice the saying of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, “<strong>Pray as you have seen me praying</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then along with this it is upon you that you do not forget the importance to be given to praying with an attentive heart, and to praying with humility and submissiveness (khushoo&#8217;), since this is the major goal of the servant&#8217;s standing before Allaah, the Most High, in Prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in accordance with the level of your fulfillment of what I have described to you, concerning humility, attentiveness and adherence to the manner in which the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم prayed, will be your attainment of the desired fruit indicated by our Lord, the Blessed and Most High, in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Indeed, the Prayer prevents immorality and sin”</strong></span> [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in conclusion I ask Allaah, the Most High, that He accepts our prayers, and the rest of our actions, and that He saves the reward of them for us on that Day when we shall meet Him &#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Day when neither wealth nor sons will avail &#8211; except one who meets Allaah with a heart free of associating anything in worship with Him.” [24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And all praise is for Allaah, the Lord and Sustainer of all creation.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ta&#8217;weel</strong>: To give a figurative explanation of any of Allaah&#8217;s Attributes, such as to say that Allaah&#8217;s Hand means `power&#8217; or `blessing&#8217; or that His Anger means `to intend to punish&#8217; or to say that His Throne really means His `sovereignty&#8217; and other similarly false interpretations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Taabi&#8217;ee (pl. Taabi&#8217;een):</strong> The Successors, that is the successors of the Companions, the next generation after the Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tahreef:</strong> To distort the meaning of Allaah&#8217;s Attributes or any of the texts of the Book and the Sunnah such as to say that Allaah&#8217;s Mercy means `the desire to confer a favor upon someone&#8217; or to say that Istawaa (to ascend) really means istawlaa (to conquer, dominate).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Takyeef:</strong> To enquire into exactly how Allaah&#8217;s Attributes are such as to say `How is Allaah&#8217;s Hand-&#8216; or `Exactly how does Allaah ascend the Throne-&#8216; etc. This is an innovation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Takbeer:</strong> Allaahu Akbar &#8230; Allaah is greater.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Taqiyah:</strong> Deception, manifesting other than ones true Religion, i.e., Hypocrisy (Nifaaq).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tasdeeq</strong>: To affirm something is true and correct.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tashbeeh</strong>: To claim that Allaah&#8217;s Attributes resemble the Attributes of the creation such as to say `Allaah&#8217;s Hand is like our hands&#8217; etc. This is heresy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tawheed</strong>: The Unity and Uniqueness of Allaah with respect to His Lordship, His Names and Attributes and in His right to be worshipped alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ummah</strong>: The Muslim Nation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Footnotes:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Sunan: pl. of sunnah, referring here to recommended actions established from the practice of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم [Trans. Note]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] I say: This contains a subtle indication that he should not place them in front of him. This is an etiquette that is disregarded by the majority of those who pray, since you see them praying towards their shoes!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] i.e., `Allaahu Akbar,&#8217; meaning, `Allaah is greater.&#8217; [Trans. Note]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] I say: We know from this that what the Muslims do in all mosques that I have seen in Syria and elsewhere with regard to praying in the middle of the mosque, far away from any wall or pillar, is nothing but negligence of the command and the practice of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Mu&#8217;khiratur-Rahl: It is the piece of wood placed at the back of the saddle, so the hadeeth contains an indication that it is not sufficient to use a line upon the ground. The hadeeth allowing that is not authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] As for the hadeeth that he صلى الله عليه وسلم prayed at the outer edge of the area for tawaaf without any sutrah and the people were passing in front of him, then this is not authentic. Furthermore, it does not mention that they were passing between him and his place of prostration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] i.e., the saying of, `As-salaamu &#8216;alaikum wa rahmatullaah &#8230;&#8217; to complete the Prayer</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] I say: As for actually touching the earlobes with the thumb then there is no basis for this in the Sunnah. Rather in my view it is something that incites misgivings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] As for the practice of combining both placing and grasping at one and the same time, as some late-comers hold to he good, then there is no basis for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] I say: The placing of the hands anywhere else but the chesr is either inauthentic (da’eef). Or has no basis</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] Whoever wishes to see the rest of the opening supplications then let him refer to Sifatus-Salaat, pp. 14-19 of the translation</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] The whole of Soorah al-Faatihah can be seen in Appendix One</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] I say: I have mentioned the evidence used by those who support it, along with its rebuttal in Silsilatul-Ahaadeethid-Da&#8217;eefah, nos. 546 and 547</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] For the details of this chapter, refer, if you wish, to Sifatus-Salaat, (pp. 25-39 of the translation).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] There are other sayings that can be said with this pillar (rukn). Some are long, some are medium length and some are short. Refer to Sifatus-Salaat, Eng. transl. pp. 44-46</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16] There are other sayings that can be said here. Refer to Sifatus-Salaat, (Eng. transl. pp. 47-50).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17] It is not prescribed to place one hand upon the other during this standing, since that is not reported. If you wish you may see further discussion of this in Sifatus-Salaat (Eng. transl. pp. 50-51).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18] There are other sayings that can be said in it, and you can refer to them in, Sifatus- Salaat, Eng. Transl., pp. 55-57</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19] This is what it is prescribed to say after the death of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and this wording is established in the tashahhud of Ibn Mas&#8217;ood, &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah, Ibn az-Zubayr and Ibn &#8216;Abbaas. So whoever wishes may refer to my book Sifatus-Salaat, (Eng. transl. p. 68).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20] I have mentioned other wordings of the tashahhud in my book (Eng. transl. pp. 67-70), and that which I have mentioned here is the most authentic</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[21] Witr: the odd-numbered rak&#8217;ah(s) said at the end of the (optional) Night Prayer</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[22] The ‘Trials of Living …’ are that which a person encounters in life with regard to being enticed by the worldly life and the desires to which it gives rise. The ‘Trials of dying &#8230;’ are the trials of the grave, and the questioning by the two Angels. And the ‘Trials of the False Messiah (Dajjaal) &#8230;’ are the supernatural occurrences that will happen at his hands; things that will lead many people to go astray, to follow him and accept his claim to divinity</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[23] Soorah al-Ankaboot (29):45</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[24] Soorah ash-Shu&#8217;araa (26):88-81)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[7] Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Allaah says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَجَعَلْنَا عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ أَكِنَّةً أَن يَفْقَهُوهُ وَفِي آذَانِهِمْ وَقْرًا<br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> <strong>“And We placed veils upon their hearts – so that they understand it not – and deafness in their ears.”</strong> [Surah Al-An’aam: 25]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Some people perceive this ayah to contain a sense of coercion in it (on the part of Allaah). So what is your opinion with regards to this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[7] Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“placing”</strong> </span>is an existential (<em>kawnee</em>) type of placing. In order to understand this, we must explain the meaning of Allaah’s Divine Desire (<em>Iraadah</em>). Divine Desire is divided into two categories.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Shar’ee</em> (Legislative) Desire and the <em>Kawnee</em> (Existential) Desire</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Legislative Desire is everything that Allaah has legislated for His servants and incited them to do, such as acts of worship and obedience, regardless of their rulings, whether obligatory or recommended. Allaah desires and loves these acts of worship and obedience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Existential Desire, it may at times be something that Allaah did not legislate but yet preordained. This type of Desire is only called “Existential Desire” since its term was derived from Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">إِنَّمَا أَمْرُهُ إِذَا أَرَادَ شَيْئًا أَن يَقُولَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Verily, His Command – when He desires something – is only that He says to it ‘Be’ and it is.”</strong> </span>[Surah YaaSeen: 82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word <strong>“something”</strong> here is an indefinite noun which consists of everything, whether acts of obedience or acts of disobedience. Such things come into existence by Allaah’s saying to it: “Be.” Meaning: It occurs through His Will, Ordainment, and Pre- Decree. So if we come to realize this Existential Desire, which includes everything regardless if it is an act of obedience or an act of disobedience, it will definitely lead us back to the subject of Al-Qadaa wal-Qadar (Allaah’s Divine Ordainment and Pre- Decree, since Allaah’s statement: <strong>“Verily, His Command – when He desires something – is only that He says to it ‘Be’ and it is”</strong> means that the thing to which He said “Be” is something He decreed, which will definitely come into existence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everything, according to Allaah, is decreed – it either consists of good or it consists of evil. However, that which applies from it to us – the two species of mankind and jinn who have been ordered by Allaah and are accountable for our actions – is that we look at what we do. The things we do either occur purely from our desire and free choice or they occur in spite of what we desire. Acts of obedience or disobedience do not apply to this second category and the end result of it is not Paradise or Hellfire. It is only the first category that the religious laws revolve around. And it is based on this that a person will be rewarded with either Paradise or the Hellfire. This means that whatever a person does based on his own desire and whatever he chases after through His actions and free choice, this is what he will be held accountable for. If it is good, then he will have good and if it is bad, then he will have bad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fact that a person has a free choice in a large portion of his actions is a fact that cannot be argued with whether religiously or intellectually.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for religiously, there are numerous texts from the Qur’aan and Sunnah that confirm that a person may choose to do what he is ordered to do and abandon what he is forbidden from doing. These texts are too numerous to mention.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for intellectually, it is clear to every person that is void of whims and desires that whenever he speaks or walks or eats or drinks or does anything that involves his free will, he is choosing on his own to do that action and not being forced to do that at all. For example, if I wish to speak right now, there is naturally no one that can force me to do that. However, this speech (of mine) is pre-decreed. What is meant by my speaking these words in spite of it being pre-decreed is that it is pre-ordained along with my free choice of what I will say and talk about. However, I have the ability to remain silent to make clear – to those doubtful about what I’m saying – that I have a free choice in the matter of speaking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, the fact that a person has a free choice and a free will is something that cannot be disputed or argued against. And as for one who does argue against such a fact, then this person is only arguing philosophically and casting doubts on self-evident intuitions. And when a person reaches this stage, he can no longer be talked to (logically).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the actions of a human being are divided into two categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Those that are done out of his choice and free will<br />
2. Those that are done as a result of him being forced and coerced to</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have nothing to say about the actions that are done due to coercion – not from a religious perspective or from a real-life perspective. The religion is only concerned with the matters of free choice and free will. This is the truth of the matter. If we implant this into our minds, we will be able to understand the afore-mentioned ayah: <strong>“And We placed veils upon their hearts.”</strong> This refers to the Existential Placing. We must remember that the afore-mentioned ayah: <strong>“Verily, His Command – when He desires something”</strong> refers to the Existential Desire. However, it is not done against the will and choice of this person whom Allaah has placed veils over his heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here is an example of this from an actual perspective: When a human being is created, he is formed while his flesh is still soft and tender. Then as he gets older and older, his flesh becomes harder and his bones become stronger. However, not all people are the same in this regard. So lets say for example this person is devoted to (learning) some type of study or science. What part of the body will grow strong in this person? His mind will strengthen. His brain will become stronger in the field that he preoccupies it with and applies all of its abilities on. However, from a physical standpoint, his body will not strengthen nor will his muscles develop.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The opposite of this is exactly true as well, for there may be a person that completely applies himself physically. So everyday he engages in sports and physical training – as we say today. Such a person’s muscles and body will progress and become strong. And he will acquire an image just like those that we see sometimes in real-life and sometimes in pictures in which for example the bodies of these athletes have become all muscle. Was this person created this way? Or did he earn and acquire for himself this strong physique loaded with muscles? This is something that he has attained based on his own actions and free choice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">This is the same example as someone who lingers in his misguidance, rejection, disbelief and denial and as a result attains this condition of these veils being placed by Allaah over his heart, not because Allaah compelled and forced this upon him but rather due to his actions and free choice.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So this is the existential placing which these disbelieving people have acquired (for themselves). They have gotten themselves to this point, which the ignorant think they were forced into, when in reality, such a fate was not obliged upon them, but rather came about due to what their own hands earned. And Allaah does not oppress His servants.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Need for the Sunnah in order to Understand the Qur’aan, and Examples for that:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“The male and the female thief – cut off their hands”</strong></span> [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 38] is a good example of this, for the word <strong>“thief”</strong> mentioned in it, is absolute, as is the case with the word “hand.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The verbal Sunnah explains the first of these two (words) and restricts it to mean just the thief that steals a quarter of a dinaar. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“There is no cutting off of the hand except in (cases where one steals) a quarter of a dinaar and more.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم explained the second (word) with his action or with the action of his Companions and his approving of that. This is since they would cut the hand of the thief off from the wrist, as is well known from the books of Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The verbal Sunnah also explains the <strong>“hand”</strong> that is mentioned in the verse concerning Tayammum:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Then wipe your faces and hands”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 43, Surah Al-Maa’idah: 6] in that it can also refer to the palm.<span style="line-height:1.5;">This is based on the Prophet’s saying: </span><span style="line-height:1.5;color:#000000;"><strong>“Tayammum is a tap (i.e. wipe) of the face and hands.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by Ahmad, Al-Bukhaaree, Muslim and others from the narration of ‘Ammaar bin Yaasir radhi Allaahu anhu] </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Below are some other verses from the Qur’aan that cannot be understood correctly, according to what Allaah intended, unless by way of the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“It is those who believe and mix not their Faith with dhulm (wrong) – for them (only) there is security and they are the guided ones.”</strong></span> [Surah Al-An’aam: 82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Companions of Allaah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم understood the phrase <strong>“with dhulm (wrong)”</strong> according to its general sense, which includes every wrong, even if it be small. This is why they had difficulty understanding the verse and so they said: “O Messenger of Allaah! Which one of us doesn’t mix their Faith with wrong?” So the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“It doesn’t mean that. It only means Shirk (here). Didn’t you hear Luqmaan say:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Verily Shirk is a great wrong?’</strong></span> [Surah Luqmaan: 13]”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by Al-Bukhaaree, Muslim and others]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Allaah’s says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And when you travel in the land, there is no sin on you if you shorten your prayer, if you fear that the disbelievers may attack you.”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 101]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The literal wording of this verse necessitates that shortening the prayer while on a journey can only be done on the condition when one is in the state of fear. This is why some of the Companions asked Allaah’s Messenger: “So then why do we shorten the prayer when we are in a state of security?” He صلى الله عليه وسلم replied: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“This is a charity that Allaah has expended to you, so take His charity.”</strong> </span>[Reported by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Forbidden to you (for food) are: al-maytatah (dead animals), blood, the flesh of swine…”</strong></span> [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But the verbal Sunnah explains that deceased locusts and fish, as well as liver and spleen (types) of blood are lawful. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Two types of deceased animals and two types of blood have been made lawful for us: locusts and sea fish [meaning all types of fish], and the liver and the spleen.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by Al- Bayhaqee and others in marfoo’ and mawqoof form. The chain of the mawqoof narration is authentic and it takes on the ruling of being marfoo’ since it cannot be stated based on one’s mere opinion.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Say (O Muhammad): ‘I find not in that which has been inspired to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, unless it be maytah (a dead animal) or blood poured forth (by slaughtering), or the flesh of swine (pork), for that surely is impure, or impious (unlawful) meat (of an animal) which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for other than Allaah…’”</span></strong> [Surah Al-An&#8217;aam: 145]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Sunnah came and forbade other things that haven’t been mentioned in this ayah, such as the Prophet’s صلى الله عليه وسلم saying: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Every predatory animal that has fangs and every bird that has claws is unlawful (for eating).”</span></strong> There are also other ahaadeeth on this subject that forbid other animals, such as what the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said on the Day of Khaybar: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Verily Allaah and His Messenger forbid you from (eating) domesticated donkeys, for they are impure.”</span></strong> [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say (O Muhammad): ‘Who has forbidden the adornment with clothes given by Allaah, which He has produced for his slaves, and the good (lawful) things from provision?’”</strong></span> [Surah Al-A&#8217;raaf: 32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But the Sunnah explains that there are certain types of adornments that are forbidden. It is authentically reported that the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم went out one day to meet his Companions holding silk in one hand and gold in the other, and said:<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> “These two things are unlawful for the males of my ummah, (but) lawful for the females.”</strong></span> [Reported by Al-Haakim who authenticated it] The ahaadeeth bearing this same understanding are many, well known and can be found in the two Saheeh collections as well as other collections.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many more examples like these (above) that are known to the people who have knowledge of Hadeeth and Fiqh. So from what has been stated previously, it should become clear to us, O brothers, the importance of the Sunnah in deriving Islamic laws. For indeed if we look back again at the examples I mentioned before, not to mention those that I didn’t mention, we will have certainty that there is no way to understand the noble Qur’aan, unless we understand it along with the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In the first example,</strong> the Companions understood the word <strong>“dhulm”</strong> mentioned in the ayah according to its literal meaning. This was even though they, may Allaah be pleased with them, were as Ibn Mas’ood said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The best of this ummah, possessing the most pious of hearts, profound in learning and the least of constraints.”</strong></span> But in spite of this, they erred with regard to understanding that. So if it were not for the Prophet refuting their error and guiding them to what was correct with regard to the meaning of “dhulm” – that it in fact meant Shirk here – we would have followed them upon their error. However, Allaah, Mighty and Majestic, saved us from that due to the grace of the Prophet’s guidance and Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And in the second example:</strong> if it weren’t for the afore-mentioned hadeeth, we would have remained in doubt, to say the least, regarding shortening the prayer while on a journey in the state of security. That is to say if we wouldn’t have already taken the view of making being in the state of fear a condition, as is literally stated in the ayah. This is also just what the Companions themselves understood (about the ayah) until they saw the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم shorten his prayer, and they shortened their prayer along with him, while they were in a state of security.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In the third example:</strong> If it weren’t for the hadeeth, we would have been forbidden from foods that were made lawful for us, such as (dead) locusts and fish, and liver and spleen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In the fourth example</strong>, if it weren’t for the hadeeth, which mentions some things (not mentioned in the ayah), we would have made lawful what Allaah had made forbidden through the tongue of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, such as predatory (fanged) animals and birds with claws.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The same goes for the fifth example,</strong> if it weren’t for the ahaadeeth reported in that regard, we would have made lawful that which Allaah made unlawful upon the tongue of the Prophet, such as silk and gold. This is why some of the Salaf used to say: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“The Sunnah judges upon the Book (i.e. Qur’aan).”</span></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[3]</strong> <strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">There are some who say that if a hadeeth contradicts an ayah in the Qur’aan, it should be rejected no matter what level of authenticity it has. Then they use as an example the hadeeth: <strong>“Indeed the deceased person will be punished (in the grave) due to the crying of his family for him.”</strong>[10] They use the statement of ‘Aa’ishah in which she used Allaah’s saying to refute this hadeeth:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">وَلَا تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَى</span></strong><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another.”</strong> [Surah Faatir: 18]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">How do we respond to those who say this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[3] Answer</strong>: Rejecting this hadeeth falls under the issues related to rejecting the Sunnah by way of the Qur’aan. So this shows the deviation of this way of thinking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the response to this hadeeth – and I am referring here particularly to those who adhere to the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah, then it is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>:<strong> From a hadeeth standpoint:</strong> There is no way to reject this hadeeth from a hadeeth standpoint due to two reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. It has been reported through an authentic chain of narration from Ibn ‘Umar radhi Allaahu anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Ibn ‘Umar radhi Allaahu anhu is not alone in reporting it, rather he was followed in that by ‘Umar bin Al- Khattaab radhi Allaahu anhu. Furthermore, he and his son are not alone in reporting it either, for they were also followed in that by Al-Mugheerah bin Shu’bah radhi Allaahu anhu. This is what comes to my mind at this time since the reports of all three of these Companions can be found in the two Saheeh Collections.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if a person were to conduct an exclusive research on this hadeeth, he would find other paths of narration for it. These three ahaadeeth all have authentic chains of narration so they cannot be rejected just based on the claim that they “contradict” the noble Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: <strong>From a tafseer standpoint:</strong> This is since the scholars have explained this hadeeth in two ways:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. This hadeeth only applies to a deceased person who knew during the course of his life that his family would commit oppositions to the Religion after his death and did not advise them. Nor he did direct them to not cry over him since this crying would serve as a means for his being punished in the grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The usage of the word <strong>“the”</strong> when referring to the <strong>“deceased person”</strong> is not allencompassing and inclusive. Meaning: The hadeeth does not mean that every deceased person will be punished due to the crying of his family members. Rather, the word “the” is for a specific designation, meaning it refers to only those who do not advise others to not commit what opposes the Religion after his death. So this is the type of person who will be punished by the crying of his family over him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who takes charge of advising his family and directing them with religious guidelines such as to not wail over him and to not commit the offenses that are done ,particularly in this era, then such a person will not be punished. But if he does not direct and advise (his family), he will be punished.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the detailed breakdown that we are required to understand from the first explanation, in accordance to the interpretation of many well known and famous scholars such as An-Nawawee and others. So when we come to comprehend this detailed breakdown, it becomes clear that there is in fact no contradiction between this hadeeth and Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">وَلاَ تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَى</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another.”</strong></span> [Surah Al-An’aam: 164]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A contradiction only becomes apparent if the word <strong>“the”</strong> in the word <strong>“the deceased person”</strong> is understood to be all-inclusive, meaning that it encompasses everyone who dies. This is where the hadeeth becomes obscure and contradicts the noble ayah in the Qur’aan. But if we comprehend the meaning of the hadeeth according to what was mentioned before, there would be no more contradictions or obscurities since we would understand that the one who is being punished (in the grave) is only like that because he failed to advise and direct his family members (before his death). This is the first manner in which this hadeeth has been interpreted in order to repel this so-called “contradiction.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. A second interpretation has been mentioned by Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah, may Allaah have mercy on him, in some of his writings. And it is that the punishment here does not refer to the punishment in the grave or the punishment in the Hereafter but rather, that it only refers to pain and sorrow. Meaning: When a deceased person hears the crying of his family for him, he will feel bad and sorrowful for their grief over him. This is what Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah said. If it is correct, it would eradicate the root of the misconception.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, I say: Such an explanation goes against two facts, which is why we can only rely on the first explanation of this hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Fact:</strong> The report from Al-Mugheerah bin Shu’abah radhi Allaahu anhu that I indicated previously has an addition to it that clarifies that the punishment here does not refer to just pain and sorrow, but rather that it refers to actual punishment, i.e. punishment in the Hellfire, unless Allaah forgives him. This is clearly stated in Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">إِنَّ اللّهَ لاَ يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاء</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah does not forgive that partners be associated with Him (in worship), but He forgives what is less than that to whom He wills.”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the narration of Al-Mugheerah radhi Allaahu anhu it states: <strong>“Indeed, the deceased person will be punished due to the crying of his family over him on the Day of Judgement.”</strong> So this clearly states that the deceased will be punished due to his family crying over him on the Day of Judgement and not in his grave, which is what Ibn Taimiyyah explained as meaning pain and sorrow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second Fact:</strong> When a person dies, he does not feel anything that goes on around him whether good or bad, as indicated by evidences in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, except in certain cases, which have been mentioned in some ahaadeeth either as a rule for every deceased person or for some only whom Allaah enables to hear some things that will cause them pain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So firstly there is the hadeeth reported by Al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh from Anas bin Maalik radhi Allaahu anhu in which he narrated that the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily, when a servant (of Allaah) is placed in his grave, and his companions depart from him – at the point where he can still hear their footsteps – two angels come to him.” </strong>[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This authentic hadeeth affirms a special type of hearing that a deceased person will have at the time he is buried and the people are walking away from him. Meaning: At the time that the two angels come to sit by him, his soul returns to his body and in this state of being, he is able to hear the footsteps (of his loved ones walking away).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the hadeeth does not mean on the outset that this deceased person and all deceased people will have their souls returned to them and that they will remain with the ability to hear the footsteps of the people passing by the graves up until the day that they will be resurrected. No.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a specific circumstance and a special type of hearing on the part of the deceased since his soul has returned to him. So if we were to go by the interpretation of Ibn Taimiyyah at this point, we would be forced to expand the senses of the deceased person to include everything that goes on around him whether at the time he is being transferred to his grave before his burial or after he is placed in his grave – meaning that he can hear his living family members crying over him. This requires a textual proof, which is missing. This is first.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>, some texts from the Qur’aan and the authentic Sunnah indicate that the deceased cannot hear. This is a huge topic and requires an in-depth discussion. However I will mention one hadeeth by which I will close the answer to this question. And it is the statement of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم in which he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah has angels that roam throughout earth who convey to me the greetings (of Salaam) on behalf of my ummah.” </strong>[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant by <strong>“roam”</strong> is that they frequent gatherings. So every time a Muslim sends Salaat (praises) on the Prophet, there is an assigned angel that conveys this greeting from that Muslim to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم. So if the deceased could hear, the one with the most right from those deceased to hear would be our Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم due to Allaah’s favoring him and particularizing him with special qualities and attributes over all of the prophets, messengers, and rest of mankind. So if anyone had the ability to hear, it would surely be the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم. And furthermore, if the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم were able to hear anything after his death, he would hear the Salaat (praises) of his ummah) on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So here we come to understand the error, or the deviation, of those who ask assistance – not from the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم – but rather from those less than him, whether messengers, prophets or righteous people. This is since if they were to ask assistance from the Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم, he would not hear them as is clearly stated in the Qur’aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ اللّهِ عِبَادٌ أَمْثَالُكُمْ<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And those whom you call besides Allaah are servants (of Allaah) just like you.”</strong></span> [Surah Al-A’raaf: 194]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">إِن تَدْعُوهُمْ لَا يَسْمَعُوا دُعَاءآُمْ<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“If you supplicate to them, they cannot hear your supplication.”</strong></span> [Surah Faatir: 14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, after they die, the deceased cannot hear unless there is some text that applies to a particular situation – as I mentioned before – such as the deceased hearing the footsteps. This concludes the answer to this question.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From the Book: <strong>How are we Obligated to Interpret the Qur’aan?</strong> Shaykh al-Albanee.<br />
<strong>[ <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/how-are-we-obligated-to-interpret-the-noble-quraan-shaykh-al-albanee-al-ibaanah-com.pdf" target="_blank">Download complete PDF book</a>]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[5] Question</strong>: Allaah informs us about Himself saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;">وَمَكَرُواْ وَمَكَرَ اللّهُ وَاللّهُ خَيْرُ الْمَاآِرِينَ</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And they plotted and Allaah too plotted. And Allaah is the best of plotters.”</strong> </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">[Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 54]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Perhaps the minds of some people may limit the understanding of this ayah to just its apparent meaning. And maybe we are not in need of explaining it. But how is it that Allaah is the best of plotters?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[5] Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This question is easy by the Grace of Allaah. This is since we are able to understand that plotting is not always necessarily characterized with being evil nor is it always necessarily characterized with being good. So perhaps a disbeliever may plot against a Muslim however this Muslim is bright and clever and not heedless and stupid. So he is aware of the plots of his disbelieving opponent and thus deals with him in retaliation to his plot. This is such that the end result is that this Muslim through his good plotting compels the disbeliever’s evil plot to backfire on his own self. So can it be said that when this Muslim plotted against the disbeliever, he engaged in an illegal affair? No one says this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is easy to comprehend this fact from the statement of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم: <strong>“War is deception.” [</strong>14] What can be said about deception is exactly the same that can be said about plotting. A Muslim deceiving his Muslim brother is forbidden. However, if a Muslim deceives a disbeliever who is an enemy to Allaah and an enemy to His Messenger, this is not forbidden. On the contrary, it is obligatory. The same goes for a Muslim plotting against a disbeliever who intends to plot against him, such that this Muslim reverses the plot of this disbeliever. This is a good form of plotting. This is a human being and that is a human being. But what do we say with respect to the Lord of all that exists, the All-Able, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He invalidates the plots of all the plotters. This is why Allaah says: <strong>“And Allaah is the best of plotters.”</strong> So when Allaah describes Himself with this description, our attention shuld be directed to the fact that plotting – even on the part of humans – is not always negative. This is since Allaah says: <strong>“The best of plotters.”</strong> So there is plotting that is good and plotting that is bad. So whoever plots for a good reason should not be condemned. And Allaah, Mighty and Majestic, is as He says, the <strong>“best of plotters.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In brief, I say: Whatever suppositions may come to your mind, Allaah is contrary to that. So if a person imagines something that is not befitting to Allaah, then he should know right away that he is wrong. Hence this ayah contains praise for Allaah, so there is nothing in it that is impermissible to ascribe to Allaah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Knowledge of Arabic is not sufficient for understanding the Qur’aan:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From what has been stated previously, it becomes clear that there is no way for anyone, even if he be a scholar of the Arabic Language and its disciplines, to understand the noble Qur’aan, without seeking assistance in that from the Prophet’s Sunnah in speech and action. This is since he will never be more knowledgeable of the language than the Companions of the Prophet, those who the Qur’aan was revealed to in their language. And (at that time) the language was not blemished with the errors of the non-Arabs and the slang of the common people, but in spite of that, they still erred in understanding these previously mentioned ayaat, when they relied on their knowledge of the language only.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So based on this, it is obvious that <strong>whenever a person is knowledgeable of the Sunnah, he will be more likely to understand the Qur’aan and extract rulings from it, than someone who is ignorant about it</strong>. So how about the one who doesn’t rely on it or reference it at all? This is why from the principles that have been agreed upon by the people of knowledge is: to interpret the Qur’aan with the Qur’aan and the Sunnah,1 and then the sayings of the Companions, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this, we become aware of the misguidance of the scholars of rhetoric, past and present, and their opposition to the Salaf, in their Creed, not to mention their rulings. And it is their remoteness from the Sunnah and their knowledge of it, and their making their intellects and desires as judges for themselves with regard to the verses concerning Allaah’s Attributes. What is better than what has been stated in Sharh Al- ‘Aqeedah At-Tahaawiyyah [of Ibn Abil-‘Izz Al-Hanafee] (pg. 212, 4th Edition):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“How can someone who didn’t learn from the Book and the Sunnah, but rather just learned it from the views of so and so, speak about the fundaments of the Religion! And if he claims that he is taking it from the Book of Allaah, then he is not taking the interpretation of the Book of Allaah from the ahaadeeth of the Messenger. He doesn’t look into it (i.e. the Sunnah), nor does he look at what the Companions or those who succeeded them in goodness said, which has been conveyed to us by way of reliable narrators chosen by the critics (i.e. hadeeth scholars). For indeed, they did not convey the arrangement of the Qur’aan only, but rather they conveyed the arrangement as well as the meanings. They would not learn the Qur’aan like the children do (today), rather they would learn it along with its meanings. And whoever does not follow their path, then he is speaking based on his opinion. And whoever speaks from his opinion, and from what he thinks Allaah’s Religion is, not getting that from the Book, he is in fact sinning (!), even if he may be correct. Whereas whoever takes from the Book and the Sunnah, he is rewarded even if he errs. However, if he is correct, his reward is multiplied.”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said (pg. 217):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“So it is an obligation to completely submit to the Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم, follow his orders, and meet his reports with acceptance and firm belief, without contradicting that by false notions that we consider “reasonable” or that constitute a misconception and doubt. Or that we put before it the views of men and the rubbish held in their minds. So we must single the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم out with regard to making him the judge, submitting to him, obeying him and complying with him, just as we single out the One who sent him in worship, humility, submissiveness, repentance and reliance (to Him).”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In summary:</strong> It is an obligation upon all of the Muslims to not differentiate between the Qur’aan and the Sunnah, with regard to the obligation of accepting both of them together and establishing Laws based on both of them. Indeed this is the guarantee that will prevent them from drifting to the right and the left, and from returning to deviation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم clearly stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“I have left two things for you, which you will never go astray so long as you adhere to them: The Book of Allaah and my Sunnah. These two will never separate from one another until they return to the Fountain.” </span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Maalik and Al-Haakim with a sound chain of narration]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] We do not say as is the custom amongst many of the people of knowledge: <strong>“We interpret the Qur’aan by the Qur’aan if there is no trace of it in the Sunnah, then we interpret it by the Sunnah.”</strong> This is due to what we will explain later on in the end of this treatise, when speaking about the (weak) hadeeth of Mu’aadh bin Jabal radhi Allaahu anhu.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, there is great and profound wisdom behind this Sunnah – i.e. the Sunnah of praying in an open area of land (i.e. the musallaa). And it is that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The Muslims will have two days out of the year where all the people of every city can gather together – whether men, women or children – and turn towards Allaah with their hearts in unity, praying behind one Imaam, making the takbeer and the tahleel and supplicating to Allaah sincerely together, as if they were united upon the heart of one man, happy and joyous about the blessing Allaah has bestowed on them. So the ‘Eid will truly be an occasion of celebration for them.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم ordered the women to go out to pray ‘Eid along with the people, and he did not make an exception for any of them. This is even to the point that he made no excuses for those women who did not have a garment by which they could veil themselves when coming out, as instead he commanded them to borrow garments from other women. And this is even to the point that he صلى الله عليه وسلم commanded those women who had a reason that prevented them from praying (i.e. menses) to go out to the musallaa, so that they may “witness the good and the supplication of the Muslims.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, and then his Khaleefahs (successors) after him, and the delegated leaders in the cities would lead the people in prayer. Then they would give them a sermon saying that which would admonish them. And they would teach them what would be of benefit to them in this world and in the Hereafter. And they would order them to give in charity in that gathering. So the rich person would show affection towards the poor person. And the poor would find joy in what Allaah has given them from His Bounty during this blessed assembly, which Allaah’s Mercy and Contentment descends upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is only proper for the Muslims to respond to following the Sunnah of their Prophet and reviving the rites of their Religion, which is the point of their resolution and success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“O you who believe! Respond to Allaah and to the Messenger when He calls you to that which will revive you.”</span></strong> [Surah Al-Anfaal: 24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaikh Waliyullaah Ad-Dihlawee said in Hujjatullaah-il-Baalighah under the heading “The Two ‘Eids” (2/30-32):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The foundation with regard to them is that every nation has a day in which they beautify themselves and go out from their city with their adornment. This is a custom, which no group amongst the Arabs and non-Arabs have stopped practicing. When the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم came to Madeenah, he found that the people had two days in which they would go out and enjoy themselves, so he said: ‘Allaah has replaced these two days with something that is better than them – the Day of Adhaa and the Day of Fitr.’ [20] It was said that these two (prior) days of celebration were: <strong>An-Nayrooz</strong> and <strong>Al-Mahrajaan</strong>. These two days were only replaced because there is no ‘Eid for a group of people except that the reason for its existence is to elevate the rites of a Religion or to comply with the founders of a particular way or something that resembles that. So the Prophet feared that if he were to leave them with their custom, there would remain this elevating of the rites of Jaahiliyyah (i.e. the Days of Ignorance) or the propagating of the (false) ways of the ancestors. So he صلى الله عليه وسلم replaced them with two days in which there was found an elevating of the rites of the pure and upright Religion (of Islaam). And along with adorning oneself for the occasion, he صلى الله عليه وسلم included the remembrance of Allaah as well as various acts of obedience, so that the gathering of the Muslims won’t just be for pure play and enjoyment, and so that no gathering from them will be void of raising Allaah’s Word.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first of these two days is ‘Eid-ul-Fitr, the day when they end their fasting and give a certain type of their Zakaat. So they experience this ‘natural joy’ that is caused by their withdrawing from conditions that were difficult upon them (i.e. the fast). And the poor person experiences joy at taking his charity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ‘intellectual joy’ they experience is due to the delight of knowing that Allaah has blessed them with the ability to complete what He made obligatory upon them (i.e. the fast)…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second is the day when Ibraaheem (intended to) sacrifice his son Ismaa’eel, may Allaah be pleased with both of them. But Allaah blessed them both by replacing him with the great sacrifice (i.e. a ram). This is since on this day, one can be reminded and take heed of the condition of the ancestors of this noble and upright religion, by sacrificing one’s soul and wealth in obeying Allaah, and having firm patience. In this, there is a similarity to those performing Hajj, where one tries to emulate them and longs to be in the state they are in. This is why it is legislated to make the Takbeer in it, which is found in Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘And so that you may magnify Allaah (by making Takbeer) for having guided you and so that you may be grateful.’</strong></span> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 185; Surah Al-Hajj: 37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means: Give thanks to Him for granting you the ability to fast. This is why performing the sacrifice and saying the takbeer out loud were legislated on the Days of Minaa. And this is why it is recommended for those who intend to offer the sacrifice to abandon shaving (the body hair). [21] And this is also why the Prayer and the Khutbah (sermon) were prescribed – so that no part of their gathering could be void of the remembrance of Allaah and the elevating of the rites of the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another objective from the objectives of the Pure Legislation is included in this, which is that: Every nation must have some presentation, in which its people gather together during it to display their strength and to show their numbers. This is why it is recommended for everyone to go out (to the musallaa) – even the children, the women, the young girls and the menstruating women. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>However, they (i.e. menstruating women) must not join the musallaa (i.e. the prayer) but rather witness the supplication of the Muslims.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is also why the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم would vary in the roads he took when going and coming from the musallaa, so that the people in each of the roads would see the strength of the Muslims. And since the origin of ‘Eid was to decorate and adorn oneself, it is recommended to wear one’s best garment, to enjoy oneself (taqlees), [22] to take different routes when going and coming and to go out to the musallaa.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">[End Quote]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20] I say: Ahmad and others reported it with an authentic chain of narration. I have referenced it in as-Saheehah (no.2021).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[21] I say: He is indicating the Prophet’s statement: “<strong>When the Hilaal (crescent) for Dhul-Hijjah is sighted and one of you wants to offer a sacrifice, then he must refrain from cutting his hair and nails</strong>.” And in one narration: “<strong>…then let him not cut any part of his hair or nails until he offers the sacrifice.</strong>” [See Mukhtasar Saheeh Muslim (no. 1251) and others] I say: It is apparent from the hadeeth that anyone who is determined to perform the sacrifice is obligated not to cut his hair and nails until he offers the sacrifice. So this type of cutting mentioned above is forbidden. Imaam Ahmad and others held this view. So let those who are tested with shaving their beards take note of this, for indeed, there are three sinful matters in their shaving of their beards for the day of ‘Eid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: The shaving itself, for it is a feminine trait, an imitation of the disbelievers, and an alteration of Allaah’s creation, as I have explained in my book “Adaab az-Zafaaf fis-Sunnah al-Mutahharah (Sixth Edition, pg. 118).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: Adorning oneself for the day of ‘Eid by disobeying Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: What is derived from this hadeeth of the forbiddance of cutting the hair for the one who intends to offer the sacrifice. In reality, there are very few people that are saved from committing this (sin), even some of the people of knowledge (do it)! We ask Allaah to protect us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[22] Shaikh Ad-Dihlawee said in his footnote: “Taqlees (Enjoying oneself) means beating the duff and playing when the kings arrive, in order to welcome them.” I say: He is indicating the hadeeth that has been reported by Ibn Maajah (1/391) and others with two chains of narration. In one of them is Shareek, who is Ibn ‘Abdillaah Al-Qaadee – he had bad memory. And in the other chain is found Abu Ishaaq, who is As-Subay’ee – he would mix up his narrations. At-Tahaawee weakened it in his Mushkil-ul-Athaar (2/209-210) based on two angles, so refer to it if you wish.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Beautiful Humble Dua of Abu Bakr -RadhiAllaahu anhu- the Best of Creation after the Prophets</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said after an announcer praised him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;I thank the brother, teacher Ibraheem for his statements and his praise, there is nothing that I can say in return except by following the first Khalifa Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq -RadhiAllaahu anhu- who was truly a Khalifa and the first of them for the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; but even though he was the Khalifa when he would hear a person praising him with goodness &#8211; and I believe that praise, no matter how excessive that person was in giving it, as long as it was for the Khalifa of the Messenger of Allaah, then he deserved it &#8212; but along with that -Allaah ul-Musta&#8217;aan (Allaah&#8217;s help is required) [here the Shaykh begins to shed tears] along with that Abu Bakr used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> اللهم لا تؤاخذني بما يقولون، </strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>O Allaah do not take me to task with   what they say, </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> واجعلني خيرًا مما يظنون، </strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>and make me better than what they presume </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>واغفر لي ما لا يعلمون،</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>and forgive me for what they do not know.&#8217; </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what as-Siddeeq al-Akbar said, so what can we say after him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I say &#8211; following him:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> اللهم لا تؤاخذني بما يقولون، واجعلني خيرًا مما يظنون، واغفر لي ما لا يعلمون، </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>O Allaah do not take me to task with what they say, and make me better than what they presume and forgive me for what they do not know.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[The Shaykh cries trying to utter this statement]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The truth is &#8211; and I say the truth &#8211; I am not as was described previously, by what you heard from our respected brother Ibraheem, indeed I am only a student of knowledge, nothing else. It is upon every student of knowledge to be with the statement of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"> (بلغوا عني ولو آية، بلغوا عني ولو آية، وحدثوا</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> عن بني إسرائيل ولا حرج، ومن كذب عليّ</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> متعمدًا فليتبوأ مقعده من النار)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>&#8216;Convey from me, even if it is only one Ayaah, convey from me, even if it is only one Ayaah. There is no problem of narrating from Bani Israel. Whoever intentionally lies against me then he should take his seat in Hell fire.&#8217; </strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>20 &#8211; Exiting from the Fire for those who Worshipped Allaah Alone</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">225 – When the believers will have finished from the fire on the Day of Judgment and become secure. Then one of you arguing for the truth, in the Duniya for his companion will not be more intense than the debating of the believers with their Lord, regarding their brothers whom had been entered into the fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: they will say:<strong> Our Lord! These are our brothers they used to pray along with us, and fast along with us, and perform the Hajj along with us, and you have entered them into the fire</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: that Allaah will say: &#8220;go and take out those whom you know.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they will come to them, and they will know them by their faces. The fire would not have eaten their faces. From amongst them there will be, he whom the fire has reached half way up his shins, and he whom the fire has reached to his ankles, and they will take them out.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The believers will say: &#8220;We took out those whom You have commanded to take out.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah will say: &#8220;Take out he who has the weight of a dirham of Emaan in his heart. Then the one who has the weight of half a dirham,&#8217; until He says: He who has an atom’s weight in his heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sa&#8217;eed said: whoever does not believe this, then let him read this Ayaah : &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Surely! Allaah wrongs not even of the weight of an atom, but if there is any good (done), He doubles it, and gives from him a great reward</strong></span>. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said: The Believers will say: &#8220;O our Lord! Indeed we have taken out those whom You have commanded to take out.&#8217; Then there will not remain anyone in the fire who has good in himself.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said: Then Allaah will say: the Angels have interceded, and the Prophets have interceded, and the believers have interceded and The Most Merciful of those who shows mercy remains.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said : Then Allaah will grab a handful from the fire &#8211; or He said : two handfuls &#8211; of people who never did any good for Allaah at all, indeed they will be burnt so much that they will have become charcoal.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said: they will be brought to water, which is said to be called the water of life. It will be poured on them they will sprout out like the seed sprouts after what is left over by the torrential floods, they will come out of their bodies like pearls, and they will have a stamp on their necks, saying: those freed by Allaah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said: it will be said to them: Enter into Paradise, whatever you wish for or anything you see then it is for you, and I have something with Me which is better than that. He said: They will say: Our Lord! What can be better than this?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said: Allaah will say: My being pleased with you, I will never be angry with you.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1661- &#8220;Indeed Allaah Azza wa Jal will take out a people from the fire after nothing remains of them except for their faces and Allaah will enter them into Paradise.&#8221; The hadeeth is in saheeh al-Bukhari (4/463-464) by a different narration on the authority of Abu Sa&#8217;eed in a narration ascribed to the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, and he mentions the whole of the hadeeth of the intercession; and in it, is stated: &#8220;Allaah Ta&#8217;aala will say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Go to those whom you find in their hearts the equivalent to a dinar of Emaan and take them out of the fire, Allaah prohibits the fire from their faces…</strong>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1450 &#8211; &#8220;Take out of the fire whoever has in his heart the equivalent of an atom worth of Emaan.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1451- &#8220;Some people from the people of Tawheed will be punished in the fire, until they will be like charcoal, then mercy will reach them. They will be taken out and thrown at the doors of Paradise. He said: then the people of Paradise will sprinkle water upon them, they will sprout like seeds left over, sprouts after the torrential floods, then they will enter paradise.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>22- The Covenant that Allaah Took from His Slaves</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>172- “Allaah will say to the one who has been punished the least from the people of the Hell-fire on the Day of Judgment: ‘O son of Adam! How have you found your resting place?’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>He will say: ’An evil resting place!’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>It will be said to him: ‘If you had the world and everything in it, would you ransom yourself with it?’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>He will say: Yes.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Allaah will say: You have lied, what I wanted from you was less than that, while you were in the spine (and in another narration: in the back) of Adam, that you do not associate anything with Me, and I will not enter you into the fire, but you refused and committed Shirk. He will be ordered to be taken to the fire.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Regarding this hadeeth:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Regarding His saying: ‘He will say: you have lied.’</strong></span> An-Nawawee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It means: If We returned you to the Duniya, you would not have ransomed it, because you were asked for something easier than that but you refused. This will have the same meaning as in the saying of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">But if they were returned (to the world), they would certainly revert to that which they were forbidden. And indeed they are liars</span> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the meaning of this hadeeth is combined with the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">If they had all that is in the earth, and as much again therewith to ransom themselves thereby</span> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Regarding, His saying: ‘I wanted from you’</strong></span>: i.e. I would have loved from you. When the word ‘Allaah’s Will’ (<strong>al-Irada</strong>) is mentioned in the Sharia&#8217;, it is used in the absolute sense. It means what is general both from the good and the bad, guidance and misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As is mentioned in the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">And whomsoever Allaah wills to guide, He opens his heart to Islaam, and whomsoever He wills to send astray, He makes his heart closed and constricted, as if he is climbing up to the sky</span>. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Will of Allaah (al-Irada) is that which will most definitely happen. Sometimes when this Will of Allaah (al-Irada) is applied it means, that which is the synonym of love and being pleased. As is mentioned in the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"> Allaah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you</span> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is the meaning of the intent of the saying of Allaah Ta’ala in this hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I wanted from you’ i.e. that I loved from you. The Will of Allaah (al-Irada) with this meaning might not happen, since Allaah Tabaraka wa Ta’ala does not force anyone to obey Him, even though He created them because of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">Then whosoever wills, let him believe, and whosoever wills, let him disbelieve</span> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, therefore Allaah Tabarak wa Ta’ala could want from His slave that what Allaah does not love from His slave, and Allaah loves from His slave that which His slave does not want.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim -may Allaah have mercy upon him &#8211; called this Will of Allaah (alIrada) a will of the order of being (al-Irada), taking that from the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">Verily, His Command, when He intends a thing, is only that He says to it, &#8220;Be!&#8221; and it is</span>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He called the other Will (al-Irada) which is a synonym for &#8216;being pleased&#8217;: the Sharia&#8217; Will (al-Irada).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever understands this division, then he has a solution to many of the problems of understanding the issues of <strong>al-Qadaa</strong> (Allaah&#8217;s ordainment of everything in creation) and <strong>al-Qadr</strong> (Allaah&#8217;s Pre-decree for the creation). And he will succeed from the fitna (tribulations) of the stance of those who say that a person does actions under force, or who hold the beliefs of the Mu&#8217;tazilah. The explanation of this can be found in the magnificent book ‘Shifaa’ al-Aleel al-Qadaa wal-Qadr wal-Hikmaah wa Ta’aleel’ by Ibn al-Qayyim -May Allaah have mercy upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Regarding His saying: ‘……. and you were in the spine of Adam.’</strong></span> Qadi Iyaad said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Messenger indicates to the saying of Allaah Ta’ala &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">And (remember) when your Lord brought forth from the Children of Adam, from their loins, their seed (or from Adam&#8217;s loin his offspring)</span>&gt;&gt;, in the Ayaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This covenant was taken from them while they were in the spine of Adam. So, whoever fulfills it after he is brought into this world then he is a believer, and whoever does not fulfill it, is a Kaffir.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the intent of this hadeeth is: I wanted from you when I took the covenant, but you refused so I took you to the Duniya but you committed Shirk.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is mentioned in &#8216;al-Fath&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Dislike of Making a vow</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">478 &#8211; &#8220;<strong>Allaah Azza wa jal said: Making a vow does not earn anything for the son of Adam except that which I have destined for him. Rather, making a vow is something which makes a miserly person give. He comes to Me with that which he would not offer due to his miserliness</strong>. &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration: &#8216;<strong>He offers that which he never offered before</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>From The Fiqh of the hadeeth</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth, with all its different wordings, indicates that it is not legislated to make a vow, rather it is disliked.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The apparent meaning of this prohibition in some of its narrations is that making a vow is haram as some of the scholars have said. However, the saying of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala: &#8220;<strong>Rather, making a vow is something which makes a miserly person give</strong>.&#8221; One feels that this dislike or prohibition is specific to making a vow which is offered to Allaah as a recompense or which is done in exchange for a reward rather than a vow which, from the onset, is done out of obedience to Allaah. This (second type of) vow is purely a means of coming closer to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because the one who is making the (second type of) vow has the correct intent with it, i.e. that he wants to receive an obligatory reward, which is better than the optional reward. This is the vow which is intended &#8211; and Allaah knows best &#8211; with the saying of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala: &lt;&lt;<strong>They fulfil their vows</strong>&gt;&gt; rather than the meaning of the vow which is offered as a recompense to Allaah or which is done in exchange for a reward.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafidh said in &#8216;al- Fath (11/ 5000) that at -Tabari narrated an athar with an authentic chain on the authority of Qatadah who said regarding the saying of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala: &lt;&lt;<strong>They fulfil their vows</strong>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;They would make vows in obedience to Allaah in their prayer and their Fasting, Zakaat, Hajj, Umra and in those things that Allaah had made obligatory upon them. Allaah labelled them as righteous people. It is clear that this praise is not for the making a vow which is offered as a recompense to Allaah.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Before this he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;That Qurtubi mentioned in his book &#8216;al- Mufhim&#8217;, that the prohibition in the hadeeth regarding the vow was that vow offered as a reward to Allaah, and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>An example of this prohibition is to say for instance, “If Allaah cures me from my illness then I will give such and such in charity.” The point of objection here is when the goal of coming closer to Allaah is given a condition, this then makes it clear that the action was not done with the pure intention of coming closer to Allaah Ta&#8217;ala rather he did it in exchange for recompense.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>What shows us this is that if he was not cured -from his illness- then he would not give charity. So he attached the act of giving charity to (Allaah) curing him. This is the condition of the miserly person. Surely he does not give anything from his wealth unless he has a quick, increased return on what he gave.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the meaning which is referred to in the hadeeth when the Messenger of Allaah said &#8220;Making a vow is something which extracts from a miserly person, that which a miserly person would not give&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Sometimes what is added to this ignorant belief is the idea that a vow means that the goal will be achieved or that Allaah gives him this goal due to this vow.</strong></span> This is also indicated in the hadeeth: &#8220;Without doubt, a vow cannot repel whatever Allaah has destined&#8221;. The first situation is close to disbelief and the second is a clear mistake.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al- Hafidh said: &#8220;I say: rather that the second type is also close to disbelief.&#8221; Then he brings a quote from al-Qurtubi in which the scholars regarded the prohibition mentioned in the narration is understood to be of disapproval. Then he says: &#8220;what is apparent to me is that, it is held to be prohibited for the one whom you fear has corrupt belief. Therefore it would be haram for this person to make this vow, and it would be regarded as disapproval for the one who does not have that corrupted belief.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a good explanation and what supports this is the story of Ibn Umar, who is the narrator of the hadeeth regarding the prohibition of vows, since they are vows offered as recompense.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: what he intends by this <strong>story</strong> is what has been narrated by Hakim (4/304) by way of Faleeh bin Sulayman on the authority of Sa&#8217;eed bin Harith that he heard Abdullaah bin Umar when he was asked by a man called Mas&#8217;ood bin &#8216;Amr, from the tribe of Bani Ka&#8217;b, say: o Abu Abdur Rahman my son was in the lands of the Persians, from those who were with Umar bin UbaydAllaah in Basra. There fell a severe plague, so when this reached me I made a vow that if Allaah brought my son to me I would walk to the ka&#8217;ba. My son came, but he was sick and died, so what do you think? &#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Umar said: Were we not prohibited from making vows?! Certainly the Messenger of Allaah -alayhis-sallat wa sallam- said; &#8220;A vow doesn&#8217;t bring anything forward nor does it delay anything, rather it takes something out of a miserly person.&#8221; Fulfil your vow.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>So, summing up, there is a warning in this hadeeth for the Muslim not to approach a vow which is offered as a reward. Therefore it is for the people to know this so that they do not fall into this prohibition whilst they thought that they were acquiring good by their deeds!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his Family, his Companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Giving the Kaffir the glad-tidings of the Hellfire and Passing by the Places where the Mushrikeen Where Destroyed</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>18- &#8216;When ever you pass by the grave of a kaffir then give him the glad tidings of the Hellfire.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Origin Of the hadeeth</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;A Bedouin came to the Prophet and said: ‘My father used to keep good relations with his relatives and he used to do such and such good deeds so where is he?” He -sall&#8217;Allaahu alayhi wa sallam- said &#8216;in the fire&#8217;: It was as if the Bedouin was upset due to this, so he said, “O Messenger of Allaah, then where is your father?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8216;Whenever you pass by the grave of a kaffir then give him the glad tidings of the Hellfire.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Bedouin accepted Islaam and he said; the Messenger of Allaah -sall&#8217;Allaahu alayhi wa sallam- gave me the responsibility of a task; I did not pass by a grave of a kaffir except that I gave him the glad tidings of the Hellfire.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>From the understanding of the hadeeth</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a great benefit in this hadeeth which many of the general books of fiqh have neglected which is none other than the legislation of giving the kaffir the glad tidings of the Hellfire if you pass by his grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is in this legislation is not hidden, since it contains that which awakens the believer and reminds him of the danger of the sin of the kaffir, who has committed a great sin which would make all of the sins of the world facing him seem like nothing if they were all gathered together. The sin is disbelief in Allaah Azza wa Jal and committing shirk with him, which Allaah Ta&#8217;ala explained His severe hatred of such that He excludes shirk from His forgiveness. He says</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong>Verily, Allaah forgives not that partners should be set up with him in worship, but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He pleases</strong> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; said; &#8216;That the biggest of the major sins is that you associate a partner to Allaah while He is the One who created you.&#8217; [Agreed upon.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Without doubt ignorance about this benefit is what leads some Muslims to fall into that which is contrary to what Allaah, the Most Wise, intends by this benefit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>With certainty we know that many of the Muslims come to the lands of the kuffar to take care of some of their general or specific interests. However, they do not suffice themselves with just this, rather they intend to visit some of the graves of those who are called great men from amongst the kuffar. They place flowers and wreaths and they stand in front of those graves with humility and sadness which indicates being pleased with those in the graves and not having a detest for them. </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They do this even though the best example i.e. that of the Prophets &#8211; alayhim assalam &#8211; dictates the opposite of what they do, as is mentioned in this authentic hadeeth. Listen to the statement of Allaah Azza wa Jal:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong>Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibraheem and those with him, when they said to their people: Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allaah, we have rejected you, and there has started between us and you, hostility and hatred for ever &gt;&gt;</strong> the Ayaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is their stance against those who were alive, so what about those are dead!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhaaree (2/120) and Muslim (8/221) narrate on the authority of Ibn Umar that the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam said to them when he passed by Hijr (a place where the people had been destroyed):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8216;Do not enter upon these people who were punished, except that you cry, and if you do not cry then do not enter upon them, so what afflicted them does not afflict you.&#8217; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah 19</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[He veiled his face with is garment while he was on his mount]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad narrated this and the extra wording is from his book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sadeeq Hasan Khan mentioned a heading for this hadeeth in his book &#8216;Nazl alAbraar&#8217; p.293, which is; &#8216;Chapter : crying and fear while passing by the graves of the oppressors and the place where they were destroyed, and showing the need of going back to Allaah Ta&#8217;ala and warning against being neglectful about this.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah Ta&#8217;ala to give us the understanding of our Deen and inspire us to perform actions according to it. Indeed He is the One who hears and answers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;There is no obedience due to anyone in disobedience to Allaah Tabarak wa Ta&#8217;aala.&#8221;</strong> [Silsilah Saheehah: 179]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;There is no obedience in disobedience to Allaah Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;aala.&#8221;</strong> [Silsilah Saheehah: 180 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;There is no obedience to mankind in disobedience to Allaah, indeed obedience is in goodness.</strong>&#8220;[Silsilah Saheehah: 181]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The reason for this hadeeth:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah- sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – dispatched an army, and he commanded a man to lead them, who lit a fire, and the man said to the army: enter into the fire. The people wanted to enter into the fire, but some of them said : verily we have just fled from the fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was mentioned to the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – and he said to those who wanted to enter into it: if you entered it you would have remained in it until the Day of Judgment, and he said a good word to the others, and he said…..(the above hadeeth).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The extra wording in the hadeeth is from Tayyalisee and the context is by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration by him where he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – dispatched a battalion and ordered a man from the Ansaar to lead them, and he ordered them to listen to him and obey him. They caused this man to get angry, so he said to them: Gather some firewood for me, so they gathered it for him. Then he said: light the fire and they lit the fire, then he said to them: Did not the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – order you to listen and to obey me? They said Yes, of course.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said &#8211; enter in to the fire!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they started to look at each other, and said (and in another narration: a young boy said to them) : indeed we fled to the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – from the fire, [ do not be hasty, until you meet the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – and if he orders you to enter it, then enter into it ], so this is what they did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man&#8217;s anger came down/subsided, and the fire was put out. When they returned to the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – and mentioned it to him, he said: if you had entered it, you would never have exited from it, <strong>indeed obedience is in goodness</strong>.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhari (8/47, 13/109), Muslim (6/16), Ahmad (1/82, 134) and other narrations which contain the extra wording is also by Ahmad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth has many benefits, the most important of which is the impermissibility of obedience to anyone, if it is disobedience to Allaah Tabarak wa Ta&#8217;aala, whether it is the leaders, scholars and the shaykhs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from this hadeeth you get to know the misguidance of different groups of people;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The first:</strong></span> some of the soofis who obey their shaykhs, even if they command them to commit sins, using as a proof, that they in reality are not committing sins. Also that the shaykh sees that which the follower does not see.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I know a shaykh from amongst these people who appointed himself as a leader. He mentioned a story to his followers in some of his lessons in the masjid, the summary of which is, one of the Soofi shaykhs ordered one of his followers that during the night he should go to his father and kill him while he is in his bed next to his wife! So when he killed him, he returned to the shaykh, happily having carried out the command of the shaykh! The shaykh looked at him and said: Do you think that you have really killed your father? Rather he is your mother&#8217;s boyfriend! As for your father he is away!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he makes and presents a Sharia&#8217; ruling, as he claims, from his story, and he says to his followers : If a shaykh orders his follower with a ruling which is apparently against the Sharia&#8217;, it is upon the followers to obey him in this, then he said: Do you not see this shaykh, he apparently orders the boy to kill his father, however in reality he ordered him to kill the one who fornicated with his mother, and that person deserved to be killed!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The falsity of this story is not hidden according to the Sharia&#8217; from many angles:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Firstly</strong></span>: Carrying out the punishment is not the right of the shaykh, no matter how important he is; rather it is from the right of the leader or the one in charge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Secondly</strong> </span>: if the case was that this actually took place, then why did he only carry out the punishment on the man and not the woman, and they both fornicated?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Thirdly</strong></span>: the Sharia&#8217; ruling for the married adulterer is to be stoned to death, and the person is not killed except by stoning. From this it is clear that the shaykh has opposed the Sharia&#8217; from many angles, this is also the situation with the follower who based upon this previous story, made it incumbent upon the Muslims to be obedient to the shaykh, to the extent one of them said to the people: if you see the shaykh and he is wearing a cross around his neck, then it is not allowed to criticize him!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With all the clarity of the absurdity of these stories, and their opposition together to the Sharia&#8217; and to the intellect, we find some people become deceived by these stories, and amongst them some of the cultured youth. A discussion took place between me and one of those youths about that story, and he had heard it from that follower of the shaykh, and what the shaykh had based his ruling upon. However, the discussion with him did not bring about any benefit. He persisted in believing this story, since according to his claim, it was a miracle, and he added: you people reject miracles!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when I said to him: If your shaykh orders you to kill your father, would you do it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: Indeed, I have not reached that level yet!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after this can anyone be blamed for characterizing the religion of these shaykhs except that they are the opium of the people?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second group is:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The blind followers who prefer to follow the statements of the Madhab above the statement of the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam with what is clearly taken from the statements of the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam. So if it is said to one of them, for example: <strong>do not pray the Sunnah of the Fajr prayer after the obligatory prayer has begun</strong>, due to the prohibition of the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – from doing so, which is clear, they do not obey, and they say the Madhab allows this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is said to them: <strong>the Nikah at-Tahleel</strong> ( whereby another man marries the divorced woman and then divorces so that she can be allowed to marry her first husband) is invalid, because the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – cursed the one who does this. They would answer by saying: No, but it is permissible according to such and such Madhab!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are hundreds of issues like this, and this is why many of the scholars held the opinion that the saying of Allaah Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala about the Christians: &lt;&lt; <strong>They took their rabbis and their monks to be their lords besides Allaah</strong> &gt;&gt; applies to these blind followers, as Fahkr ar-Razi has explained in his Tafseer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Maajah -rahimahullaah- reported in his &#8220;Sunan&#8221; [The Book of the Rites of Hajj: chapter (5): The Virtue of the Supplication of the person performing Hajj: (no.2893)]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Muhammad ibn Tareef narrated to us, saying: `Imraan ibn `Uyainah narrated to us: from `Ataa· ibn as-Saa·ib: from Mujaahid: from Ibn `Umar: from the Prophet sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam, that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The fighter in Allaah’s cause, and the person performing Hajj, and the person performing `Umrah are Allaah’s deputation: He called them, and they responded to Him; and they ask of Him, and He gives to them</strong></span>&gt;&gt;.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaanee -rahimahullaah- said: &#8220;Hasan&#8221;; and he said in &#8220;as-Saheehah&#8221; (no.1820), having quoted a supporting narration reported by al-Bazzaar (no.1153) as a hadeeth of Jaabir: &#8220;The hadeeth, when the two chains of narration are gathered is &#8220;Hasan&#8221;.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Imaam Ibn Maajah -rahimahullaah- reported (no.2895): &#8220;Aboo Bakr ibn Abee Shaybah narrated to us, saying: Yazeed ibn Haaroon narrated to us: from `Abdul-Malik ibn Abee Sulaymaan: from Abuz-Zubayr: from Safwaan ibn `Abdillaah ibn Safwaan, who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I was married to a daughter of Abud-Dardaa·, so he came to her and he found Ummud-Dardaa·, but he did not find Abud-Dardaa·. So she said to him: &#8220;Do you intend to perform Hajj this year?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Yes.&#8221; She said: &#8220;Then supplicate to Allaah for good for us, since the Prophet sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The supplication which a person makes for his brother in his absence is responded to. There will be an Angel by his head saying: ‘Aameen’ [O Allaah! Grant it], to his supplication, ‘and may you receive the like of it’.</strong> </span>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>He said: Then I went out to the market place, and I met Abud-Dardaa·, and he narrated the like of that to me from the Prophet sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Compiled &amp; Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Hadeeth</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Abu Hurairah who said the Messenger of Allaah<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>-SallAllaahu alayhi wa Sallam-</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">صنفان من أهل النار لم أرهما قوم معهم سياط كأذناب البقر يضربون بها الناس ونساء كاسيات عاريات مميلات مائلات رءوسهن كأسنمة البخت المائلة لا يدخلن الجنة ولا يجدن ريحها وإن ريحها ليوجد من مسيرة كذا وكذا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There are two types of the people of the Hell-Fire who I have not seen, a people who have whips like cows’ tails with which they are hitting the people, and women who will be naked in spite of being dressed, who are seduced (to wrong paths) and seduce others, their heads will be high like a camel with humps they will not enter Paradise, nor will they find its fragrance, even though its fragrance can be found from travelling such and such distance.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Imam Ahmad in ‘al-Musnad’ &amp; Muslim in ‘as-Saheeh’]<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Allaama, Muhadith</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Muhammad Nasir Deen al-Albaani<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></strong><strong>– May Allaah have mercy upon him.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Questioner:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">‘What is the ruling of a woman gathering her hair above her neck at the back of the head whereby it is shaped like a ball, taking into consideration that when a woman covers herself with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Hijaab</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>the shape of her hair would be apparent from her<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Hijaab</em>?’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Albaani said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This is a mistake many women who wear<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Hijaab</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>fall into, whereby they gather their hair at the back of the head and it bulges out from the back of their head, even though they have covered it with covering<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Hijaab</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>over it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed this opposes a condition from the conditions of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Hijaab</em>, which I had gathered in my book ‘<em>Hijaab Al-Marata Al-Muslimah min Al-Kitab wa Sunnah</em>‘. From these conditions is that the clothing should not show the shape of the limb or anything from the woman’s body,  this is why it is not permissible for a woman to put her hair in a circular shape at the back of her head or at the side of her head whereby it bulges out, so that it appears to the one who sees her, even unintentionally that she has shaggy hair or that she has little hair.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory that it is left hanging and not piled up/crumpled up.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From the cassette collection ‘Silsilah al-Huda wa Noor’ No.386, see<a href="http://albanyimam.com/play.php?catsmktba=13094" rel="nofollow">http://albanyimam.com/play.php?catsmktba=13094</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Ruling of  a Woman Winding up her Hair at the Top of her head</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Allaama</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Muhammad bin Salih al-Uthaymeen – May Allaah have mercy upon him.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">‘Some women gather their hair in the shape of a bun at the back of the head,  does this enter into the warning mentioned in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Hadeeth</em>: ‘Women whose  heads will be like the inclined hump of a camel they will not enter Paradise’.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Uthaymeen said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If a woman gathers her hair for when she is busy working away, then afterwards she lets it down,  then there is no harm in this, since she does not do this as an adornment or beautification but rather out of necessity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for gathering her hair and raising it up for the purpose of beautification, and it is facing upwards then it enters under the prohibition, due to the saying of the Prophet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>-sallAllahu alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Their heads will be like the hump of a camel.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A camel hump is at the top, and if the hair is above the neck then it does not enter under the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Hadeeth</em>. However, it is warned against doing so if a woman wants to go out to the market, since if she goes out to the market and gathers her hair on her head then it will appear from within her<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Abaya</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>(outer garment), and it will cause attention, so she is prohibited from having this hair-style if she goes out to the market places.</p>
</blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Advice for those about to perform Hajj</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Fourthly.</b> And be very careful not <strong>to walk directly in front of anyone praying in the Haraam </strong>mosque, not to speak of other mosques and prying places as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“If the one walking between the hands of one praying knew what were upon him then it would be better for him to stand still for forty (…) than that he should walk between his hands.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Maalik, al-Bukhaaree, Muslim, the 4 Sunan of Abu Juhaim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is a general text covering everyone walking in front, and everyone praying – and there is no authentic Hadith to make any exception for the one doing so in the Haraam Masjid – and you should pray therein like any other place towards a sutrah – according to the general nature of the Hadith regarding that – and there are also some narrations from the Companions particularly about the Masjid-ul-Haraam – which I have mentioned in ‘The Original’.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">* as-Saheehah (no.2926) of Shaikh al-Albaanee-rahimahullaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;From Jaabir ibn `Abdillaah who said: “Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&lt;&lt;Narrate from the Banoo Israa·eel. and there is no harm, because amazing things happened amongst them.&gt;&gt;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he began narrating, and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&lt;&lt; A group from the Banoo Israa.eel went out until they came to one of their grave- yards, and they said: &#8220;If only we were to pray two rak`ahs, and make supplication to Allaah- the Mighty and Majestic -that He should bring out for us a man from those who have died, so that we could ask him about death.&#8221; He said: So they did so. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So, whilst they were in that condition, a man put his head out from a grave from those graves. He was a brownish person, with the mark of prostration between his eyes. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said “O people what do you want with me? <span style="color:#993300;">I died a hundred years ago, and the heat of death has not subsided from me until just now</span>. So supplicate to Allaah- the Mighty and Majesticfor me so that He should return me to being just as I was”.&gt;&gt;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Reported by Ahmad in &#8220;az-Zuhd&#8221;(16-17), Ibn Abee Shaybah in &#8220;alMusannaf&#8221;(9/62)-without the story, and likewise by al-Bazzaar in his &#8220;Musnad&#8221;(1/108/192: &#8220;Kashful-Astaar&#8221;): from ar-Rabee` ibn Sa`d al-Ju`fee :he heard it from `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Saabit: from Jaabir ibn `Abdillaah who said: Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &#8230;, and he mentioned it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: The narrators in this chain are reliable, however there is a disagreement about whether Ibn Saabit heard from Jaabir. So Ibn Ma`een was asked: &#8220;Did `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Saabit hear from Jaabir?&#8221; So he said: &#8220;No.&#8221; However Ibn Abee Haatim confirmed his having heard from him, so he said in &#8220;al-Jarh watTa`deel&#8221; (2/2/240): “He narrated from `Umar, but this is mursal; and from Jaabir, and it is connected.” And this is contrary to what he quoted in &#8220;alMaraaseel&#8221; (p.84), and this is more correct, because of what follows.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the hadeeth was reported by `Abd Ibn Humayd in &#8220;al-Muntakhab minalMusnad&#8221; (q.152/1), with its full wording, and likewise by Wakee` in &#8220;azZuhd&#8221;(1/280/56), and by Ibn Abee Daawood in &#8220;al-Ba`th&#8221;(30/5), and in it Ibn Saabit clearly states that he had it narrated to him directly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <strong>the hadeeth is &#8220;Saheeh&#8221;</strong>, and the chain is fully connected, and all praise is for Allaah&#8230;”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet <em> &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> took him by the hand and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8221; قل: سبحان الله، والحمد لله، ولا إله إلا الله، والله أكبر.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>‘Say: ‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest.’</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Bedouin counted them on his hand, when he finished he began to reflect then came back to the Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> smiled and said:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>اللهم اغفر لي وارحمني وعافني وارزقني واهدني</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8216;Say: O Allaah forgive me, and have mercy on me, and pardon me, and provide for me, and guide me.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8216;O Bedouin! If you say: <em>&#8216;SubhanAllah&#8217;</em>, Allaah says: &#8216;you have spoken the truth,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If you say: <em>&#8216;Alhamdulillah&#8217;</em>, Allaah says: &#8216; you have spoken the truth, </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If you say: <em>‘</em><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em>, Allaah says: &#8216;you have spoken the truth,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If you say: <em>Allaahu Akbar</em>, Allaah says: &#8216;you have spoken the truth, </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If you say: O Allaah forgive me, Allaah says: I have done so,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If you say: O Allaah have mercy on me, Allaah says: I have done so, </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If you say: O Allaah give me provision, Allaah says: I have done so,</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Bedouin  counted it seven times on his fingers,  then went away.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Muhaddith al-Albaani</strong> <em>-Rahimullaah &#8211;</em> said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by al-Bayhaqi in &#8216;Shuab al-Eemaan&#8217;, and this <em>Isnaad</em> is <em>Jayyid</em> (good) its narrators are trustworthy as for al-Hasan bin Tawab; then I had become exhausted searching about him until I found who he was. So I performed a <em>Sajdah</em> to Allaah thankful for His success and I ask Him for an increase in His excellence.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from : &#8216;Silsilah Saheehah&#8217; No. 3336 by the Shaykh al-Muhaddith al-Albaani <em>-Rahimullaah </em>]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;My Ummah will continue to be upon good for as long as they hasten to break the fast and delay the pre-dawn meal.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other matter which I want to remind you of is what occurs in the previous hadeeth, <strong>&#8220;And they delay the pre-dawn meal&#8221;</strong> meaning: what is required here is the opposite to the case of the Iftaar. So he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬ commanded us to hasten to perform the Iftaar<span style="color:#808080;"><a style="color:#808080;" href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-9FW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">.</a></span> But as for the Suhoor, then it should be delayed. But what happens today is totally contrary to this, since many people eat their Suhoor before the appearance of Fajr by perhaps an hour. This is not befitting. This is contrary to the Sunnah shown by the saying of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬and by his practice. So the Companions of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬used to leave the Suhoor so late, that one of them would almost hear the Adhaan and he would still be eating because he had delayed the Suhoor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed there is an authentic hadeeth reported from the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬which shows the ease afforded by Islaam, to be counted as one of the principles of Islaam, which the Muslims are proud of, especially with regard to the matter of Fasting, since Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, concluded the Aayahs concerning Fasting with His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8216;Allaah desires ease for you, and He does not desire to make things difficult for you&#8217;</strong>. So from this ease is his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬saying, <strong>&#8220;If one of you hears the call to Prayer and the vessel is in the hand of one of you, then let him not put it down until he fulfils his need from it.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; If one of you hears the call to Prayer and the vessel&#8221; the vessel containing food, whether it be milk, some drink, water, anything which a person may take as Suhoor, and he hears the Adhaan, then he should not say, Now the food is forbidden due to the Adhaan being heard. The person who has had enough, it is not allowed for him to then have any more, whether it be a drink, or some fruit, when he has had his fill of whatever he was eating.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for the one who hears the Adhaan and he has not yet taken what he needs from the food and the drink, then the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬made that lawful for him. So he clearly said, in the clear and eloquent Arabic language, <strong>&#8220;If one of you hears the call to Prayer, and the vessel is in his hand, then let him not put it down until he fulfils his need from it.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what is meant here by the call is the second call, the <strong>second Adhaan</strong>. It is not the first Adhaan, which they wrongly call the Adhaan of Imsaak (i.e. withholding). We must know that there is no basis for calling the first Adhaan the Adhaan for withholding (imsaak).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second Adhaan is when we are to withhold, and this is clearly stated in the Quraan, since Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8216;And eat and drink until the white thread of dawn becomes clear to you from the black thread of the night.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So eating becomes forbidden at the start of the time of the Fajr Prayer. There is no separation between these two things. There is no withholding from food and drink for a quarter of an hour, or less than that, or more than that, before the start of the time for the Fajr Prayer. Not at all.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Because the Prayer becomes due when the true dawn appears, and food becomes forbidden for the fasting person when the true dawn appears. So there is no separation between these two matters at all.</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore there occurs in the hadeeth agreed upon by al-Bukharee and Muslim, from the hadeeth of Abdullaah Ibn ¹Umar Ibn al-Khattaab -radiyallaahu `anhu, that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬said, <strong>&#8220;Let not the Adhaan of Bilaal deceive you&#8230;&#8221;</strong> meaning, the first Adhaan, <strong>&#8220;&#8230;because he gives the Adhaan in order to awaken the person who is sleeping, and so that the person who wishes to eat the pre-dawn meal can do so. So eat and drink until Ibn Umm Maktoon gives the Adhaan.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Umm Maktoom, whose name was &#8216;Amr, was a blind man, and he was the one about whom the Saying of Allaah, the Exalted and Most High, came down:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;He frowned and turned away, that a blind man had come to him&#8217; to the end of the Aayaat. So he used to give the second Adhaan, the Adhaan which means that eating becomes prohibited and that it is now time for the Fajr Prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How did he used to give the Adhaan when he was blind? This is a question, which naturally occurs to some people. &#8216;Amr Ibn Umm Maktoom used to climb on the roof of the mosque, but he could not see the dawn, so he would wait until someone passing by saw the dawn. So when someone saw that the dawn had appeared and spread across the horizon, they would say to him, It is morning. It is morning. Then he would give the Adhaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So you will notice here that the Adhaan of &#8216;Amr ibn Umm Maktoom was after the Fajr had appeared, and had been seen by the people whilst they were walking in the streets. So when it was said to him, &#8220;It is morning. It is morning,&#8221; he would give the Adhaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore there is latitude in the affair, since the muadhdhin would be delayed in giving the Adhaan until he heard the people telling him, &#8220;It is morning, it is morning.&#8221; And then Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬said:<strong> &#8220;If one of you hears the call to Prayer and the vessel is in his hand, then let him not put it down until he has fulfilled his need from it.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, spoke truly when He said at the end of those Aayahs related to Fasting: <strong>&#8216;Allaah desires to make things easy for you, and He does not desire to make things difficult for you.&#8217;</strong> and <strong>&#8216;&#8230;that you should complete the number of days, and that you should glorify Allaah by mentioning takbeer for His having guided you, and that you should be thankful. &#8216;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore from the Fiqh that is to be criticized, and which runs contrary to this Sunnah, is that a person says, &#8220;If someone hears the Adhaan and has some food in his mouth, then he must spit it out.&#8221; So this is over strictness, and (ghuluww) exceeding the limits in the Religion, and the Lord of all of the creation admonished us, and reminded us, in His Book and in the Sunnah of His Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬that we should not exceed the due limits in our Religion. So He said, in the Noble Qur·aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8216;O People of the Book! Do not exceed the limits in your religion, and do not say anything about Allaah except the truth.&#8217;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And our Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬said to us, or he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬said, <strong>&#8220;Beware of (ghuluww) exceeding the limits in the Religion. Because those who came before you were destroyed by their exceeding the limits in their Religion.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah¹s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬has made it clear to us that there is latitude and a margin of ease in the matter of a person&#8217;s taking suhoor, to the extent that he said: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;If one of you hears the call to Prayer whilst the vessel is in his hand, then let him not put it down until he has completed his need from it.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is opposition to Allaah and to the Messenger that a person says that one who hears the Adhaan whilst he has food in his mouth must spit it out onto the ground. This is not from the Sunnah. Rather this is contrary to the Sunnah, and is contrary to the clear command of the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I have been asked many times, so I will not leave open the need for such a question, but rather I will precede you in (answering) it, by stating that this hadeeth is to be found in some of the most famous books of the Sunnah. From them being the Sunan of Aboo Daawood, and it is the third book from the well-known six books. The first of which is Saheehul-Bukhaaree, the second being Saheeh Muslim, and the third being the Sunan of Aboo Daawood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth is to be found in it, and it is likewise reported by Aboo &#8216;Abdillaah al-Haakim in his Mustadrak, and it is likewise reported by the Imaam of the Sunnah, Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, rahimahullaah, in his tremendous book known as the Musnad of Imaam Ahmad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the hadeth is not a strange hadeeth, rather it is a well-known hadeeth, and was reported by the Imaams of the Sunnah in the early times, and with an authentic chain of narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So here I say, to conclude this talk, since perhaps some of you have questions, which we will answer if Allaah wills, so I will conclude it with his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬saying &#8220;Allaah loves that His allowances be acted upon just as He loves that His prescribed duties be carried out,&#8221; and in one narration, &#8220;Just as He hates that disobedience to Him be committed.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there are two narrations,<strong> &#8220;Allaah loves that His allowances be acted upon just as He loves that His prescribed duties be carried out&#8221;</strong>, and the second narration is, <strong>&#8221; as He hates that disobedience to Him be committed.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore the Muslim should not practice <strong>false piety</strong>, and (as a result) refrain from obeying the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in that which he encouraged us upon and clarified to us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align:center;"><b><span lang="AR-SA">بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</span></b></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaanee, may Allaah have mercy upon him, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah, the Exalted and Most High, says in the Noble Quraan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8216;O you who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, so that you may become people having Taqwaa.&#8217;</strong></span> [Sooratul-Baqarah (2): 183]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in this Aayah, as will not be hidden to all those who are present, Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, informs the Ummah of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) , through this Aayah, that He has made Fasting obligatory upon them just as He had made its like obligatory upon the nations before us<span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-9FI">.</a></span> This is a matter that is well-known to all of the Muslims who read this Aayah, and clearly understand its meaning. But what I wish to speak about is something else, a matter which very few of the general people notice &#8211; and this is the saying of Allaah, the Exalted and Most High, at the end of this Aayah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> &#8216;&#8230;So that you may become people having Taqwaa.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, when He commands His believing servants, or obligates them with some Legislation, (then He) usually just mentions the command, without explaining the wisdom behind it. This is because the general wisdom behind Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, placing duties upon His servants is that He should test them by it, so that it should become apparent (as to) those who will obey Him and those who will disobey Him, the Exalted and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However in this Aayah, He mentioned something that is not found frequently in the Noble Quraan, which is that He mentioned the reason for the order to Fast, by His Saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8216;&#8230;So that you may become people having Taqwaa.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the wisdom behind the Believers&#8217; fasting is not just that they should prevent themselves from enjoyable and permissible good things, even though this is an obligation upon the fasting person &#8211; but this is not the only thing that is required and intended by this Fasting. Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, concluded His command to fast by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8216;&#8230;So that you may become people having Taqwaa.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: that the wisdom behind the prescription of Fasting is that the Muslim <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>should increase in obedience to Allaah</strong></span>, the Exalted and Most High, in the month of Fasting, and become more obedient than he was before it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬clearly stated and completely clarified this point of divine wisdom, by his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬saying, as is reported in the Saheeh of al-Bukhaaree (no. 1903), that he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Whoever does not abandon falsehood in speech and action, then Allaah has no need that he should leave his food and drink.&#8221; </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: that Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, did not intend and desire, by the obligation of Fasting &#8211; which is to withhold for a stated time, well known to you all &#8211; that they should only withhold from eating and drinking. <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Rather they should also withhold from that which Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, has forbidden with regard to sins and acts of disobedience to Him; and from that is falsehood in speech and action.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬is emphasizing the Aayah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8216;&#8230;So that you may become people having Taqwaa.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">i.e. that you should, as an act of worship <strong>to draw you closer to Allaah</strong>, the Mighty and Majestic, in addition to withholding from food and drink, also <strong><span style="color:#000000;">withhold from forbidden actions such as backbiting, carrying tales to cause harm to people, false witness, lying and so on</span></strong>, with regard to those forbidden manners that we are all aware of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore it is obligatory that all the Muslims should be aware that actions, which disrupt the Fast, are not just the physical acts, which are generally known, which are eating, drinking and sexual intercourse. The Fast is not just that you withhold from this. Therefore some of the scholars differentiate, and divide those things which disrupt the Fast into two categories, and this is what I intend by this talk of mine at this time that is blessed, if Allaah wills.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is especially important since those who deliver Khutbahs and admonish the people during Ramadaan, when they speak about those things which disrupt the Fast, then they only speak about the material things, those things that we have just mentioned &#8211; eating, drinking and sexual intercourse. But what they should do, as sincere advisers and people who give reminder to the Muslims in general, is to concentrate a great deal upon the second category of things which disrupt the Fast. This is because the people have become used to thinking that Fasting is just to refrain from the first category, to withhold from the material things. But there is another category of things, which disrupt the Fast, which we are able to call the non-material things that disrupt the Fast. So you have just heard his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬saying, <strong>&#8220;Whoever does not abandon falsehood in speech and action, then Allaah has no need that he should leave his food and drink.&#8221;</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Therefore every fasting person should examine himself and see: is he just withholding from the material things, or is he also withholding from those non-material things? Meaning: has he made his manners and behavior good when the blessed month of Ramadaan comes? If that is the case, then he has fulfilled the Saying of Allaah, the Exalted and Most High, at the end of the Aayah:</strong></span><span style="color:#008000;"> <strong>&#8216;&#8230;So that you may become people having Taqwaa.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for the one who restricts himself in his fasting to just withholding from food and drink, but who continues and persists upon the evil manners which he was upon previously, before Ramadaan, then this is not the Fasting that is desired and required from the wisdom behind the legislation of this noble month, which our Lord, the Mighty and Majestic indicates in His Saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8216;&#8230;So that you may become people having Taqwaa.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore we advise and remind our brother Muslims that they should remember this other category of things, those that are non-material, which disrupt the Fast, and it is something which the admonishers and those who seek to direct the people to the correct way rarely speak about, not to mention the general people, who are not aware of this category of things which disrupt the fast, i.e., the non-material things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what I wanted to remind our brothers who are present in this fine gathering about, if Allaah wills, so that it may be a cause for their increasing in acts of worship, seeking to draw closer to Allaah, the Exalted and Most High, in this blessed month, the month of Fasting, which is such that we hope that Allaah, the Exalted and Most High, will guide and grant us all the success of fulfilling the due right of this blessed month, which is that we withhold from both the material and the non-material things that disrupt the Fast.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">So here two matters were mentioned, and they are neglected by most of the people, and they are: hastening to break the fast, and delaying the pre-dawn meal (Suhoor).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for neglect of the first matter, which is hastening to break the Fast, then in the view of some people it contradicts another hadeeth, which is his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬saying, <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;My Ummah will continue to be upon good for as long as they hasten to pray the Maghrib Prayer.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So here we have two commands, to hasten with two matters. So it appears to some people that we cannot hasten to perform both of them together.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But reconciling between the command to hasten with breaking the Fast and the command to hasten to pray the Maghrib Prayer is a very easy matter. So it is something that our Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬made clear to us by his action and practice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬used to break the Fast with three dates. He would eat three dates. Then he would pray the Maghrib Prayer, then he would eat again if he found that he needed to eat the evening meal. </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But today we fall into two offences:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(i) Firstly we delay the Adhaan from its legislated time</strong>.<br />
<strong>(ii) Then after this delay comes another delay, which is that we sit down for a meal</strong> &#8211; except for a few people who are eager and pray the Maghrib Prayer in the mosque. But the majority of the people wait until they hear the Adhaan, and then they sit down to eat as if they are having a dinner, or their evening meal, and not just breaking their fast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Adhaan these days &#8211; in most of the lands of Islaam, is, unfortunately, I have to say, and not just in Jordan, and I have known this from investigation, in most of the lands of Islaam &#8211; the Adhaan for Maghrib is given after the time it becomes due. And the reason for this is that we have abandoned adhering to and applying the Islamic rulings, and instead <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>we have come to depend upon astronomical calculations. We depend upon the timetable.</strong></span> But these time-tables are based upon astronomical calculations which count the land as being a single flat plane. So they give a time for this flat plane, whereas the reality is that the land, particularly in this land of ours varies, varying between the depression of valleys and the elevation of mountains. So it is not correct that a single time be given which covers the shore, the planes and the mountains. No, each part of the land has its own time. So therefore whoever is able in his place of residence, in his city or his village, to see the sun set with his own eye, then whatever time it sets at, that is the hastening that we have been commanded with in his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬ saying, which we just mentioned: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;My Ummah will continue to be upon good as long as they hasten to break the fast.&#8217;</span></strong> So the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬was careful to implement this Sunnah by teaching it, and by putting it into practice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his teaching, then he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬said, in the hadeeth reported by al-Bukharee in his ‘Saheeh’ (no. 1954), <strong>&#8220;If the night appears from this side,&#8221;</strong> and he pointed towards the east, <strong>&#8220;and the day has departed from here,&#8221;</strong> and he pointed towards the west, <strong>&#8220;and the sun has set, then the fasting person&#8217;s fast is broken&#8221;</strong> What does &#8216;the fasting person&#8217;s fast is broken&#8217; mean? It means he has entered under the ruling that he should break his fast<span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2013/05/10/beautiful-talk-sunnahs-neglected-in-ramadaan-imaam-muhammad-naasir-ud-deen-al-albaanee-videoar-en-subtitles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">.</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then comes the previous ruling where the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬encouraged hastening to break the Fast, and the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬used to implement this, even when he was riding on a journey. So it is reported in the ‘Saheeh’ of al-Bukharee (no.1955) that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬ordered one of his Companions to prepare the Iftaar for him. So he replied, &#8216;O Messenger of Allaah it is still daytime before us.&#8217; Meaning: the light of the sun, so even though it had set, yet its light was still clear in the west. So the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬did not respond to what he had said, rather he re-emphasized the command to him to prepare the Iftaar. So the narrator of the hadeeth who said, We could see daylight in front of us, meaning: the light of day, the light of the sun, When we broke our fast, said, &#8220;If one of us had climbed onto his camel he would have seen the sun.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sun had set from here, and the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬ordered one of the Companions to prepare the Iftaar &#8211; Why? To hasten upon good <strong>&#8220;My Ummah will continue upon good for as long as they hasten to break the Fast.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is important is that we notice that the Iftaar, which is legislated to be hastened must be done with a few dates. Then we must hasten to perform the Prayer. Then after this the people can sit and eat as they need. This is the first matter, which I wanted to remind you of, and it is how to reconcile the two things that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ‬commanded we should hasten to perform.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The first being the command to hasten the breaking of the Fast, and the second being the command to hasten the Maghrib Prayer. So the Iftaar should be done with some dates, as occurs in the Sunnah, and if dates are not available, then with some gulps of water. Then the Prayer should be prayed in congregation in the mosque.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">[From &#8220;<em>Saheehus-Seeratin-Nabawiyyah</em>&#8216; (pp.80-81), Shaikh al-Albaanee &#8211; <em>rahimahullaah&#8217;s</em>&#8211; verified edition of al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer &#8211;<em>rahimahullaah&#8217;s</em>&#8211; &#8220;<em>as-Seeratun-Nabawiyyah</em>&#8216;.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Awf ibn Maalik al-Ashja`ee, who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) went off one day, and I was with him, until we entered a synagogue of the Jews (in al-Madeenah, on a festival day of theirs, and they disliked our entering upon them), and he said (to them):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">O assembly of Jews! Show me twelve men who will bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and Allaah will remove from every Jew beneath the sky the Anger which He has upon them</span></strong>.&gt;&gt; He said: So they remained silent; no one responded to him. Then he repeated it, but no one responded to him. So he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>You have refused, but, by Allaah ! I am indeed ‘al-Haashir’</strong> (the Prophet after whom the people will be gathered), and I am <strong>‘al-`Aaqib’</strong> (the final Prophet), and I am<strong> ‘an-Nabiyyul-Mustafaa’</strong> (the chosen Prophet): whether you believe or reject the truth</span>.</span>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he departed, and I was with him, until (when) we had almost left, a man behind us said: &#8220;Stay as you are, O Muhammad!&#8217; Then that man said: &#8221; What sort of man do you people know me to be amongst you, O company of Jews?&#8217; They said: &#8220;By Allaah! We do not know there to be any man amongst us who knows Allaah&#8217;s Scripture better than you; nor who has better understanding of the religion than you; nor than your father before you; nor than your grandfather before your father.&#8217; He said: &#8220;Then I testify for him, by Allaah, that he is indeed the Prophet of Allaah, whom you find in the Tawraat [Torah].” They said: &#8220;You have lied!&#8217; Then they rebutted his saying, and they said evil things about him, so Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>You people have lied. Your saying will never be accepted. Just now you were praising him with the good that you were praising him with; but when he believed you called him a liar, and said what you have said. Your saying will never be accepted</strong></span>.</span> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: So we departed, and we were three: Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), myself, and `Abdullaah ibn Salaam; and Allaah -the Most High- sent down regarding him:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِن كَانَ مِنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ وَكَفَرْتُم بِهِ وَشَهِدَ شَاهِدٌ مِّن بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ عَلَىٰ مِثْلِهِ فَآمَنَ وَاسْتَكْبَرْتُمْ ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الظَّالِمِينَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Say: Do you see: if this Qur·aan is from Allaah, and you reject it, and a witness from the children of Israa&#8217;eel testifies to its like, and believes in it; and you haughtily reject it; then Allaah does not guide the wrongdoing Disbelievers&#8221;</span></strong>  [ Sooratul-Ahqaaf (46): 10] [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[1] Shaikh al-Albaanee said: &#8220;Reported by Ahmad (6/25), and the additions are his; and by al-Haakim (3/415-416), and he said: &#8220;Saheeh to the standard of the two Shaikhs&#8217;! And adhDhahabee agreed with him! But it is only to the standard of Muslim, since al-Bukhaaree did not report the narrations of Safwaan ibn `Amr except in his &#8220;al-Adabul-Mufrad&#8217;.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>IMAAM AL-BUKHAAREE’S -rahimahullaah- NARRATION:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Bukhaaree narrated (no.3329): from Anas &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Abdullaah ibn Salaam heard of the arrival of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) at AlMadeenah, so he came to him and said: &#8220;I am going to ask you about three things which nobody but a Prophet will know.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8220;What is the first of the signs of the Hour? And what will be the first food, which the people of Paradise will eat? And on account of what does a child resemble its father; and on account of what does a child resemble its maternal uncles?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: «Jibreel has just informed me of them.» He said: `Abdullaah said: &#8220;He is the enemy to the Jews from amongst the Angels.&#8217; Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>«As for the first of the signs of the Hour, then it will be a fire, which gathers the people from the east to the west. As for the first food which the people of Paradise will eat, then it will be the extra lobe of the liver of the fish. As for the resemblance of the child, then when the man has intercourse with the woman and his semen outstrips the fluid of the woman, then the child will resemble him; and if her fluid outstrips, then the resemblance will be towards her.» </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8220;I testify that you are the Messenger of Allaah.&#8217; Then he said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah! The Jews are a people who are great liars: if they know about my Islaam before you ask them, then they will lie about me to you.&#8217; So the Jews came, and `Abdullaah ibn Salaam entered the house.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: «What sort of a man is `Abdullaah ibn Salaam amongst you?» They said: &#8220;He is the most knowledgeable one of us, and the son of the most knowledgeable one from amongst us; and he is the best one of us, and the son of the best one of us.&#8217; So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: «What would you think if `Abdullaah were to accept Islaam?» They said: &#8220;May Allaah preserve him from that.&#8217; So `Abdullaah came out to them and said: &#8220;I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah.&#8217; So they said: &#8220;He is the most evil one of us, and the son of the most evil one of us&#8217;, and they spoke against him&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>A BRIEF BIOGRAPHY OF `ABDULLAAH IBN SALAAM -radiyallaahu `anhu:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdullaah ibn Salaam ibn al-Haarith, al-Israa·eelee, Aboo Yoosuf. He was previously a confederate of Banoo `Awf ibn al-Khazraj. He accepted Islaam when Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) came to al-Madeenah. He was present at the battle of the Trench (al-Khandaq), and the battles after it. He was present with `Umar at the conquest of Jerusalem, and at alJaabiyah. He died in al-Madeenah in 43 H. <span style="color:#999999;">[[ ref. &#8220;Tahdheebut-Tahdheeb&#8217; of al-Haafiz Ibn Hajr]]</span> Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) bore witness that he will be a person of Paradise, as reported by al-Bukhaaree (no. 3812) and Muslim (no. 2483) from Sa`d ibn Abee Waqqaas &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em>&#8211; who said: &#8220;I never heard Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) say about anyone who still walked upon the earth that he was a person of Paradise, except `Abdullaah ibn Salaam. He said: And this Aayah came down concerning him:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَشَهِدَ شَاهِدٌ مِّن بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ عَلَىٰ مِثْلِهِ </strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">And a witness from the children of Israa·eel testifies to its like</span>&#8220;</strong> [Sooratul-Ahqaaf (46): 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And at-Tirmidhee reported (no. 3804) from Mu`aadh ibn Jabal -radiyallaahu `anhu- who said: I heard Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) say: &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He will be the tenth of ten in Paradise</strong></span>.&gt;&gt; [ Declared &#8220;Saheeh&#8217; by Shaikh al-Albaanee.]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The poet Abul-Qaasim Ash-Shaabee wrote: &#8220;<em>If the people one day want revival, then Al-Qadar (Divine Predestination) has no choice but to answer</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a direct form of <strong>disbelief</strong>. And it indicates that the people have gone far away from the knowledge. So they are not aware of what is permissible and what is not permissible for Allaah alone, as well as what is not permitted for those other than Him. This is due to neglectfulness – and it is from the factors that have made this poet say such a thing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And some <strong>Arab radio broadcasts</strong> have even adopted this saying as a <strong>hymn of Arab nationalism!</strong> This poetry states: &#8220;If the people one day want revival, then Al-Qadar (Divine Predestination) has no choice but to answer.&#8221; So this means that Al-Qadar is under the Will of the people! And this is in opposition to Allaah&#8217;s saying: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And you will not will until Allaah, Lord of the worlds, has willed”</span> [Surah At-Takweer: 29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah, guide us with those You have guided. And do not cause our hearts to deviate after having guided us. And grant us mercy from Yourself, indeed, You are the Grantor.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;The people are four, and the deeds are six.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the people are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[i] one granted plenty in this world and in the Hereafter, and</strong><br />
<strong> [ii] one granted plenty in this world, poor in the Hereafter and,</strong><br />

<strong> [v] ten times more, and</strong><br />
<strong> [vi] seven hundred times more:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[i &amp; ii] So the two which are binding are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever dies as a Muslim, a Believer, not associating anything with Allaah &#8211; then Paradise is binding for him; and whoever dies as a Disbeliever &#8211; then the Fire is binding for him; and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[iii &amp; iv] Whoever intends an evil deed but does not do it, and Allaah knows that his heart felt it and he desired it, then it is written as a good deed for him; and whoever intended an evil deed then it is not written against him; and whoever did it then it is written as one, and it is not multiplied for him, and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[v] whoever did a good deed &#8211; then ten times its like is written for him, and [vi] whoever spends something in Allaah&#8217;s cause, then it is multiplied for him seven hundred times over. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">Reported by Ahmad (4/345), Ibn Hibbaan (no.31), and Ibn Abee Shaybah in his &#8216;Musnad&#8217; (2/38/2).</span></p>

<p><strong>Scholar:</strong> Imâm Muhammad Nâsir-ud-Dîn al-Albânî<br />
<strong>Source:</strong> As’ilah wa Fatâwâ al-Imârât (2)<br />
<strong>Reference:</strong> Darulhadith.com<br />
<strong>Translation &amp; video:</strong> aFatwa.com (site is down)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albânî:</strong> There are no doubts that poetry exists in Islâm. The messenger (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There is poetry that most certainly is wisdom.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, that one sings the poetry and calls it as “Anâshîd” and “Religious Anâshîd”, then it is something our righteous Salaf (predecessors) did not know of at all. This, in fact, has a connection to the principle we mentioned earlier and which is a summary of that which the scholars always speak of in similar contexts, namely:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All good lies in following the earlier ones and all evil lies in that which the later ones have innovated</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Salaf did not used to sing Anâshîd and call them as “religious”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> _____________________________</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a side note, the Shaykh (al-Albânî) deemed singing to be allowed on some occasions, when he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“In these Hadiths and narrations exists an apparent evidence for it being allowed to sing without music on some occasions such as when one is thinking about death, longs for the family or home country, relaxes a little, gets away from the difficulties of the trip and the like.” (Tahrim-ul-Alat, p. 129, afatwa.com)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: What is the ruling on singing religious songs (Qasâ’id Dîniyyah) aloud in the mosques during religious holidays?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albânî</strong>: First and foremost, there is nothing in Islâm called as “religious songs”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly, it is not allowed to disturb the worshipers in the mosque even if it be with Qur’ân-verses. What should then be said about songs that are allegedly religious? They have even more right to be disallowed. The prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“O people! Each one of you is having a conversation in seclusion with their Lord. No one from among you should trouble the other and no one from among you should raise his voice when he reads over the voice of the other.”</em> (Ahmad 3/94)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said in another narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“…when he reads the Qur’ân.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner:</strong> They compare this with the poetry of Hassân bin Thâbit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albânî</strong>: The poetry of Hassân bin Thâbit? Is that a religious song? I say to you that there is nothing that is called as ‘religious songs’. As for the poetry in which the messenger (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) is defended, then say as you wish, but you should not sing and let it constitute a religious aspect. It should be read in the same way as you mention Allâh and ask for blessings and peace over the messenger (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: How can there not exist Islâmic and religious songs when one sings about Islâm and Islâmic characters?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albânî</strong>: Did this, what you are speaking of, exist with our righteous Salaf? We will treat you with leniency – may Allâh forgive you and me. Did this type exist with the Salaf?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: What type?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albânî</strong>: The type you are referring to… Why are you not speaking? [Everybody laughs]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner:</strong> The purpose of poetry and Arabic songs…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albânî</strong>: Excuse me. I do not want you to repeat your earlier speech. I understand what you are saying. I want you to concisely answer my question: Was this known with the righteous Salaf?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner:</strong> In the past? No.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albânî</strong>: There it is! You are now beginning to talk, after having been silent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: No, I wasn’t silent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albânî</strong>: No worries, no worries [Shaykh laughs]. That which was enough for them is thusly also enough for us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[53] <strong>Question</strong>: What is the ruling on the <strong>nasheeds (songs)</strong> that are circulating amongst many of the youth and which they call &#8220;<strong>Islaamic nasheeds</strong>?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If these nasheeds possess Islaamic meanings, and there aren&#8217;t any stringed or <strong>musical instruments</strong> accompanying them, such as the Duff, the drum and its types, then there is no problem with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, an important condition to its permissibility must be clarified. And it is that they must be free of anything that <strong>opposes the Religion</strong>, such as going to extremes and its sorts. Also, there is another condition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is that it must not be taken as a <strong>(habitual) practice</strong>. This is since it turns those who (constantly) listen to it away from reciting the Qur&#8217;aan, which the authentic Sunnah of the Prophet encourages.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, it turns them away from seeking <strong>beneficial knowledge</strong> and calling towards Allaah (i.e. da&#8217;wah), the One free of all defects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for using the duff with the nasheed, then it is permissible for the women when it occurs (solely) amongst them, apart from the men. And it is permissible during the time of &#8216;Eed and marriage only.</p>
<p>[Al-Asaalah, Issue #2]</p>
<p>[62] <strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Many of the Muslim youth exchange and pass around tapes that have songs (nasheeds) on them, which they call Islaamic. What is the correct opinion on this matter?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: If these songs (nasheeds) are void of <strong>stringed and musical instruments</strong>, then generally I say that there is no harm in them on the condition that they are free from things that are in opposition to the Religion, such as asking for help from other than Allaah (<strong>Istighaathah</strong>) and seeking a way of getting close to Allaah (<strong>tawassul</strong>) through the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also it is not permissible to take them as part of the Religion for this would turn the Muslim youth away from reciting the Book of their Lord and reflecting on it. And that is what Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, urged us with in many authentic ahaadeeth, such as his saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Recite the Qur&#8217;aan and chant it (i.e. recite it in a nice melodious manner), before there comes a people that will rush through it and not take their time with it. So chant it (nicely).</span>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whoever reflects on the condition of the Companions, will find that they did not have the likes of these songs (nasheeds) in their lives, for they were men of realities and not men of entertainment.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner:</strong> As soon as a man receives more money, he thinks of polygyny. His purpose is not to build a family. His purpose is enjoyment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albânî:</strong> That is good. That is good. That is good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the gathering and the shaykh laugh)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong> Does he not fall into something?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Albânî</strong>: Do you want to say that he falls into Haram? His purpose is allowed and he does not fall into any prohibition. However, we order him to add a recommended factor to this allowed deed. We order him to increase the Ummah of Muhammad (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) so that he is rewarded more with his Lord when he raises his offspring.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Taken from Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah &amp; Silsilah Ahadeeth Ad-Daeefah of The Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaah Muhammad Nasiruddeen al-Albaani Rahimahullaahu Ta’ala</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Translated byAbbas Abu Yahya</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">The Excellence of Hajj</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 1185 &amp; 1200 &#8211; On the authority of Ibn Abbas in a narration ascribed to the Prophet: &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Be regular with (in another narration: follow up) the Hajj and the Umrah since they wipe out poverty and sins, just as the furnace separates the slag from the iron.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Not Leaving Off Hajj for More than Five Years</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 1662 &#8211; The Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Indeed Allaah says: Verily I have made a slave’s body healthy and given him adequate livelihood yet five years have passed and he has not come to Me and redeemed himself, as a pilgrim.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Silsilah-Saheehah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Benefit: al-Mundhiri said in ‘al-Targheeb’ (2/134): Narrated by Ibn Hibban in his ‘Saheeh’ and by al-Bayhaqi who said: ‘Alee bin al-Mundhir said: Some of our companions narrated to me saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Hasan bin Hayyin used to be amazed by this hadeeth and used to implement it. He would love a healthy, prosperous person not to leave off Hajj for five years.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 1264 &#8211; On the authority of Jaabir in a narration ascribed to the Prophet: -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘The goodness of Hajj is feeding people and good speech.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 1820 &#8211; On the authority of Jaabir who said: the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Pilgrims for Hajj and Umrah are the delegates of Allaah. He called them and they responded, they asked of Him and He gave them.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Ihram</h2>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">What is Avoided in Hajj is that which is Avoided in Umrah</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No.2765 &#8211; On the authority of Safwaan bin Umayyah who said: A man came to the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam: wearing a lot of coloured perfume on his clothing, he was wearing different pieces of clothing and he had already assumed Ihraam for Umrah. He said: ‘What do you order me to do, O Messenger of Allaah, in my Umrah?’ Then Allaah -Azza wa Jal- revealed: &lt;&lt;Complete the Hajj and Umrah for Allaah &gt;&gt; So the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: ‘Where is the person who asked the question about Umrah?’ The man said: ‘Here I am.’ So the Messenger said: ‘Remove your clothing and take a bath, clean off the perfume as much as you can and whatever you used to do for your Hajj, then do that in your Umrah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh<br />
Silsilah-Saheehah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Benefit: Ibn Hajr said in ‘al-Fath’ (3/394): Ibn al-Muneer said in ‘al-Hashiyah’: ‘What the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said was: “Wassna’,” (i.e. the Arabic word for ‘do, make’) which means: ‘To leave something,’ because the clarification meant what a Muhrim keeps away from. So, the benefit taken from this explanation is that ‘leaving something is an action in itself.’</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">The Prohibition of the Woman in Ihram Covering her Face with a Scarf</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2930 &#8211; On the authority of ‘Uqbah bin ‘Aamr al-Juhanee who said: ‘My sister vowed that she would walk to the Ka’bah barefoot and unveiled. So the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- came to her and said: ‘What is wrong with this woman?’ They said: She vowed to walk to the Ka’bah barefoot and unveiled! So he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> ‘Order her to take a ride, cover herself, perform the Hajj and slaughter an animal.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh<br />
Silsilah-Saheehah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘In this hadeeth there are some important benefits, from them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That the Ihram of the woman is for her face, so it is not permissible for her to cover her face with her Khimaar (scarf), rather she covers her head and chest. This is like the hadeeth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> ‘A woman in Ihram does not wear a Niqaab (face veil), nor does she wear gloves.’ </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Narrated by Bukhari and Muslim.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Important note: Shaykh al-Albaani said in his book: ‘The Rites of Hajj and Umrah’ (p.12)</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘It is permissible for the woman to cover her face with something like a Khimaar or Jilbaab, which she throws over her head and it sits on her face. What is correct is that it can touch her face, but she cannot tie it to her face. </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is similar to what Ibn Taymeeyah -Rahimahullaah said.]’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2617 -The Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘O Allaah this Hajj has no ostentation in it nor any hypocrisy.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">The Permissibility of the Person in Ihram Covering his Face if Needed.</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2899 &#8211; On the authority of Uthmaan bin ‘Affan –RadiAllaahu anhu- that</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘The Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- would cover his face while he was in a state of Ihram.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh<br />
Silsilah-Saheeha</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abdullaah bin ‘Aamir bin Rabeeh that</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>he saw ‘Uthmaan bin ‘Affan in a village near Madina with his face covered by a deep red coloured, velvet cloth on a summer’s day while he was a Muhrim (in the state of Ihram).</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Its chain is authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said: ‘So if you know that the chain of narration is authentic, then there is no contradiction between this hadeeth and the report which is Mawqoof (the Isnad only goes back to the Companion) at ‘Uthmaan, as is apparent. This is because there is nothing that conflicts with the acceptability of ‘Uthmaan doing that which it is possible the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is better (that the hadeeth and the Athar correspond) rather than attributing a mistake to one of the trustworthy narrators simply because ‘Uthmaan did an action that he narrated from the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam. Do you not also see that there is no difference between what ad-Daraqutni -Rahimullaah- noted, saying that the Mawqoof (the Isnad only goes back to the Companion) precedes the Marfoo’ (a narration ascribed to the Prophet), and those who invert the issue saying that the Marfoo’ precedes the Mawqoof.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The truth is that both of them are authentic, so neither of them opposes the other. Indeed there are many Aathaar narrated by the Companions, the Tabieen and the diligent Imaams which permit the person in a state of Ihram to cover his face if need be. Ibn Hazm uses these Aathaar as evidence in his book ‘al-Muhalla’ (7/91-93) so as to support the original stance. Al-Bayhaqi also narrated some of these Aathaar (5/54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth does not oppose the saying of the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallamregarding the person who dies while in a state of Ihram:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Wash him with water mixed with Acacia leaves, shroud him in his clothing and do not cover his face or head.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Muslim and other than him and it is narrated in the book ‘al-Irwaa’ (4/198-199).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verdict is specific to the one who dies in a state of Ihram but the hadeeth under discussion is regarding the living, so it (i.e. the ruling) is different.’</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">What Animals are Permissible for the Muhrim to Kill</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 193 -‘Five types of animals which, if a Muhrim kills, there is no blame upon him: a crow, a predatory bird, a rat, scorpion and a voracious dog.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of Ibn Umar in a narration ascribed to the Prophet: -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘From what is clear in this hadeeth is the absence of blame, which shows the permissibility of killing them. It is not to be understood from this that it is recommended or obligatory to kill them or that it is better leave off killing them.’</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Talbeeyah</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 830 &#8211; On the authority of Zaid bin Khalid al-Juhanee, on the authority of the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Jibraeel came to me and said: O Muhammad! Order your Companions to raise their voices with the Talbeeyah (proclamation for Hajj or Umrah), since it is from the signs of Hajj.’ </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 1500 &#8211; On the authority of Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq who said that</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- was asked: ‘What is the best Hajj?’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>He answered ‘The one where you raise your voice reciting the Talbeeyah and you slaughter an animal.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 1621 &#8211; On the authority of Abu Huraira in a narration ascribed to the Prophet: -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘A person does not ever make Talbeeyah except that he is given glad tidings, nor does a person ever say Takbeer except that he is given glad tidings.’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> It was asked: ‘With Paradise?’ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>He answered: ‘Yes.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Mina</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 804 &#8211; On the authority of Ibn Abbas: the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam used to visit the House (Ka’bah) every night from the nights of Mina.’</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Tawwaaf</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2725 &#8211; On the authority of Abdullaah bin Umar who said I heard the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Whoever makes seven circuits of Tawwaaf around the House (Ka’bah) and prays two Rakats, it is the same as freeing a slave.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Salutation of the House &#8211; for the person not in Ihram- is Two Rakah</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadeeth has no chain &#8211; La Asl laha<br />
No.1012 ‘Salutation of the House is done with Tawwaaf.’<br />
The Hadeeth has no chain &#8211; La Asl laha</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Silsilah-Daeefah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I say: I do not know, neither from the sayings or actions of the Sunnah, that which attests the meaning of this hadeeth other than the general evidences which mention praying before sitting in the Masjid which then include the Masjid al-Haraam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The assertion that salutation of the Masjid al-Haraam is the Tawwaaf opposes the general evidence previously mentioned. So, this salutation cannot be accepted until it can be affirmed and how inconceivable is that? Especially as – due to experience &#8211; it is not possible for the person entering the Masjid al-Haraam during the days of the sacred seasons to perform the Tawwaaf every time he enters it, so praise be to Allaah Who has made the matter easy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And He has not placed any burden upon you in your religion&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed what must be brought to attention here regarding this verdict is that it is for the person who is not a Muhrim. As for the person who is in Ihram then the rightful Sunnah is that he begins with the Tawwaaf and then the two Rakah after it.’</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">The Hajj Pilgrimage is Only Made to the House of Allaah</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Da’eefah No. 265 Mawdoo- Fabricated</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O Abu Huraira! Teach the people the Quran and learn it, because if you died upon that, the Angels would visit your grave just as they visit the Ancient House (Ka’bah). Teach the people my Sunnah, even if they dislike it. If you would like not to stop on the bridge on the Day of Judgement, even for the blink of an eye until you enter Paradise, then do not innovate with your opinion.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mawdoo- Fabricated<br />
Silsilah-Daeefah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ibn al-Jawzi mentions this narration in his book ‘al-Mawdoo’aat’ (The Fabricated Ahadeeth) (1/264) and he said: ‘Not authentic and Abu Hammam (one of the narrators) is Muhammad bin Mujeeb.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahya said: ‘He is a liar.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Haatim said: ‘He is lost in hadeeth (i.e. rejected).’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Sooyuti brings a similar narration but mentions the wording: ‘If death comes to you and you are in this state then the Angels perform Hajj (pilgrimage) to your grave just as the believers perform Hajj to the House of Allaah, the Haraam.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Sooyuti remained silent about this; but I have a more severe hatred for this wording than the first &#8211; due to what it mentions about performing Hajj to a grave &#8211; as it is an innovated statement which has no origin in the Sharia’. Also, performing Hajj to a visited thing other than the House of Allaah, the Haraam, is not mentioned in the Sharia’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for performing Hajj (Pilgrimage) to graves, then that is done by Ahl-ul-Bida’ (the people of Bida’) who aggrandize graves to extreme by journeying to them, spending nights there, performing Tawwaaf around them, making Dua’, begging and imploring of the graves and other similar things which are all symbols of the Hajj. Some of them even authored a book entitled ‘The Rites of Making Hajj to Shrines and Graves’ as a refutation of what Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah mentioned in his books!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is major misguidance and no Muslim who has smelt the fragrance of pure Tawheed will doubt that this is the thing most disliked by the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-. So how can it be conceived possible that the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- made this statement: ‘the Angels would visit your grave just as they visit the Ancient House (Ka’bah).’ O Allaah! Indeed the heart testifies that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- never said even one of the letters from this statement. May Allaah disfigure the one who fabricated this.’</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Raml</h2>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">The Sharia’ Reasoning for the Brisk Walk During Tawwaaf</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2573 &#8211; On the authority of Ibn Abbas –RadiAllaahu anhu- ‘The Quraish said: ‘Indeed Muhammad and his Companions have been weakened by the fever of Yathrib.’ So in the year the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – performed Umrah he said to his Companions: ‘<strong>Walk briskly around the Ka’bah so the Mushrikeen can see your strength</strong>.’ So when they walked briskly the Quraish said: ‘It has not weakened them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh<br />
Silsilah-Saheehah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This chain is Saheeh according to the conditions of Imam Muslim. Bukhari narrates it without a complete chain in his ‘Saheeh’ (5/86) on the authority of Hamad bin Salamah in a narration similar to this, as does Hamad bin Zayd in a narration on the authority of Ayoob whose wording is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘The Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- commanded them to walk briskly for three circuits and walk calmly between the two corners so the Mushrikeen could see their strength and patience.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Mushrikeen said: ‘These are those whom you claimed had been weakened by the fever. They are stronger and more patient than such and such!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In ‘al-Musnad’ (1/305) via another chain which is narrated on the authority of Abu Tufail from Ibn ‘Abbas that when the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- stopped at a place not far from Makkah called ‘Marra az-Zahran’ on his way to Umrah, it reached the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- that the Quraish were saying: What has caused them to come here feeble and thin?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his Companions said: ‘If we slaughter our camels, eat from their meat and make a broth from its soup, then we will be relaxed when we enter upon the people tomorrow.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger said: ‘Do not do that, but gather your provisions and bring them to me.’ So they gathered them for the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and spread out a tablecloth made from leather. They ate, and had eaten satisfactorily, then left and every one of them took some in their sacks. Then the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- turned and went ahead until he entered the Masjid – and the Quraish were sitting near the black stone. The Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- uncovered one of his shoulders through his top garment then said: ‘Do not let the people see you as deficient/weak.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He touched the corner and entered Tawwaaf, passing by the Yemeni corner and walking to the Black Stone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Quraish said: ‘Just walking in the Tawwaaf does not please them, but they leap and jump like gazelles.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- did that for three circuits and so it became the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Tufail said: ‘Ibn ‘Abbas informed me that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- did this in his farewell Hajj.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Its chain is also authentic according to the conditions of Imam Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was also narrated by al-Bayhaqi in his book ‘Dala’il an-Naboowa’ (3/3/1) through two routes. Muslim narrated it (4/64) by way of al-Jareeri on the authority of Abu Tufail with a similar narration and it has been researched in ‘al-Irwaa’ (4/315).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was also narrated via ‘Atta on the authority of Ibn Abbas who said: ‘Indeed the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- walked, and he walked briskly, around the House (Ka’bah) to show the Mushrikeen his strength.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Benefit: Perhaps someone might say: ‘If the Sharia’ reason for the brisk walk during the Tawwaaf was to show the Mushrikeen the strength of the Muslims, then can it not be said that as the reason for doing the action has ceased, then the legislation of the brisk walk should cease<br />
too?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer: No, because the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – walked briskly in his Tawwaaf after that first Umrah, in his farewell Hajj, as is mentioned in the long hadeeth of Jabir and by other than him, such as this hadeeth of Ibn Abbas with the previous narration of Abu Tufail. This is why Ibn Hibban said in his book ‘Saheeh’ (6/47 al-Ihsaan): ‘So this objection has been cleared up and the brisk walk during Tawwaaf remains prescribed upon the Ummah of al- Mustafa &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – until the Day of Judgement.’</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Iltizaam</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No.2138- On the authority of Abdullaah bin ‘Amr who said</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam used to place his chest, face, forearms and hands between the Black Stone and the door of the Ka’bah in his Tawwaaf.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Arafat</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2551 &#8211; On the authority of ‘Aeysha that the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: ‘</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>There is no other day in which Allaah frees more slaves from the fire than the Day of ‘Arafah. Indeed, He comes close to them then boasts about them to the Angels and then He says: ‘What do these people want?’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Jamaraat</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2515 &#8211; On the authority of Ibn Abbas who said that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> ‘If you stone the Jamaar (pillars) it will be as light for you on the Day of Judgement.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 1437 &#8211; The Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam said: ‘Stone the Jamarah with pebbles the size of chick peas.’</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Gathering the Pebbles for Stoning the Jamaraat from Mina and not from Muzdalifah</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2144 &#8211; On the authority of al-Fadl bin Abbas who said</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam said to the people when they left on the evening of ‘Arafat and Muzdalifah: ‘You should be tranquil.’ He said this while he was preventing his female camel from speeding until he entered Mina and descended in a place between Mina and Muzdalifah. Then he said: ‘You should take pebbles the size of chick peas, with which you can stone the Jamarah.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then al-Fadl said: ‘and the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- was demonstrating with his hand just as when a person throws.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh<br />
Silsilah-Saheehah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Benefit: Nisa’ee wrote a chapter heading for this hadeeth saying: ‘From where does one collect the pebbles?’ indicating by this that collecting pebbles takes place in Mina and the hadeeth regarding this is clear. This is because the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- ordered them to do this when he stopped at a place called ‘Muhassir’, while he was in Mina, as is mentioned in the narration of Muslim and al-Bayhaqi.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What also indicates this is the apparent hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbas who said: The Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said to me on the morning of ‘Aqabah while he was on his she-camel: ‘Collect small stones for me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I collected small pebbles for him which were like chickpeas and when I placed them in his palm, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘The likes of these (type and size stones), O you people. Beware of exaggerating in the Deen, as indeed what destroyed those before you was exaggeration in the Deen.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Nisa’ee, al-Bayhaqi and Ahmad (1/215,247) with an authentic chain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the evidence here is his saying: ‘early at ‘Aqabah’ by which he means the early morning in which you stone the large Jamarat al-‘Aqabah, and from what is apparent from the hadeeth is that the act of collecting the pebbles took place in Mina, near the Jamarah. As for what people do today, collecting pebbles in Muzdalifah, we do not know an origin for it in the Sunnah, rather it opposes these two ahadeeth and it contains burden and inconvenience with no benefit.’</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Does the Person Performing Hajj Walk to the Jamarah to Stone it?</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2072 &#8211; On the authority of Ibn Umar –RadiAllaahu anhu- that</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘The Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- would walk to the Jamarah if he wanted to stone it; he would walk to it and walk back from it.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh<br />
Silsilah-Saheehah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Benefit: Tirmidhi said at the end of this hadeeth: ‘Most of the people of knowledge implement this hadeeth while some of them say: He would ride on the day of an-Nahr (slaughtering) and would walk for the days other than the day of an-<br />
Nahr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tirmidhi continues: ‘It is as if the person who said this statement intended to follow the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- in his action, because indeed what is narrated of the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- is that he rode on the day of an-Nahr to go to stone the Jamarah and only Jamarat ul-‘Aqabah is stoned on the day of an-Nahr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say (Albaani): As for the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- stoning the Jamarat ul- ‘Aqabah while he was riding, then this is mentioned in the long hadeeth of Jaabir cited in the book ‘The Hajj of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam’ from the narration of Muslim and others. This is why the hadeeth of Ibn Umar (above) that when the Prophet intended ‘to stone the Jamarat, he would walk to it and walk back from it’ is explained to mean other than the stoning of the day of an-Nahr, thereby reconciling this hadeeth of Ibn Umar with the hadeeth of Jaabir, and Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I came across that which supports this opinion, from the narration of Abdullaah bin Umar on the authority of Nafi’ with the wording: ‘On the authority of Ibn Umar: that he used to come to the Jamaar during the three days after the day of an-Nahr, going back and forth walking and he mentioned that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- used to do that.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Abu Dawood(1969) and Ahmad 92/156)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration by Ahmad (2/114,138):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Umar used to stone the Jamarat ul-‘Aqabah while riding on his animal on the day of an- Nahr and he never used to go to the other Jamaarat after that except that he would go back and forth walking. He asserted that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- never used to go back and forth to the Jamaarat, except on foot.’</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Everything is Permissible After Stoning the Jamaarat al-‘Aqabah Except Women</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 239 &#8211; On the authority of Ibn Abbas –RadiAllaahu anhu- who said that: The Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘When you stone the Jamarah, then everything except women becomes permissible.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh<br />
Silsilah-Saheehah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Benefit: In this hadeeth is a clear proof that when the person on Hajj has stoned the Jamaarat al- ‘Aqabah then all the prohibitions of Ihraam are lifted except for the prohibition of intercourse with women; this is not permissible for him as has been unanimously agreed.’</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Slaughter</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 805- On the authority of Jaabir who said: we used to preserve the slaughtered meat and take it to Madina during the time of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.’</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">After the Completion of Hajj</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No.1379 – On the authority of ‘Aeysha in a narration ascribed to the Prophet: -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘When you have completed your Hajj then you should hasten your journey to your family, since it is greater in its reward.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 1451- On the authority of Ibn Umar in a narration ascribed to the Prophet: -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Appreciate this House (Ka’bah) since it has been destroyed twice and the third time it will be raised up.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 883- On the authority of ‘Aeysha that she would carry Zam-Zam water, and she would say that</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam used to carry Zam-Zam water in leather water sacks and jugs, and he used to pour it on the sick and give it to them to drink.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">The Permissibility of Visiting the Prophet’s -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- Grave</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2497 &#8211; On the authority of ‘Aasim bin Humaid as-Sakooni –RadiAllaahu anhu- that when the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- sent Mu’adh to Yemen, he came out with him to advise him. Mu’adh was riding and the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- was walking next to his riding animal. When the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; had advised him he said: O Mu’adh! Indeed you might not meet me after this year and perhaps you will pass by my Masjid and my grave.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh<br />
Silsilah-Saheehah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Benefit: ‘Dr. al-Booti uses this hadeeth in the last part of his book ‘Fiqh as-Seerah’ as evidence for the permissibility of visiting the Prophet’s -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- grave – claiming that Ibn Taymeeyah rejects this visiting!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though we do not oppose his use of this proof, as it is indeed clear, we notify the readers that this is a false claim and a lie against Ibn Taymeeyah -Rahimullaah. Indeed his books make clear and abundant mention of its legality and he even expounded on how to visit the grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What Ibn Taymeeyah rejected was intending a journey to visit the grave as is the meaning of the hadeeth: ‘Do not undertake a journey except to three Masajid…’ which I have explained in detail with the sayings of Ibn Taymeeyah himself in my refutation of al-Booti entitled: ‘In defense of the Prophetic hadeeth.’ So what does the doctor intend by persisting with this slander which is even in the latest print of his book? Intelligent readers know the answer.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 45 &#8211; ‘Whoever performs the Hajj of the House (Ka’bah) and does not visit me has indeed treated me badly.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fabricated- Mawdoo<br />
Silsilah-Daeefah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Benefit: From what indicates its being fabricated is that ill-treatment of the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- is from the major sins, if not disbelief. So if the one who does not visit the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- has committed a great sin, then this necessitates that this visit is obligatory, like Hajj, which no Muslim would say. This is because even though visiting the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- is from the actions that bring one closer to Allaah, it does not exceed the status of being only recommended by the scholars. So how can it be that the one who leaves off visiting it is harsh to the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallamand is one who turns away from him!?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, His family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: ‘Whoever has any extra food then he should come with it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the people began coming with measures of food, some more and some less.  All that the army had was twenty-odd <em>Saa’</em> (a unit of measure).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> sat next to the food and supplicated for blessings then he said: ‘Take the food and be calm.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a man began taking food in his bag and his sack and they all began taking the food in their containers to the extent that a man would tie up the sleeves of his shirt and fill it up.  Even after they had all taken their food, the food remained as it had been.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: ‘I testify that there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah and that I am the Messenger of Allaah.

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet answered: ‘Worship Allaah and do not associate anything with Him, pray the prescribed prayers, give the obligatory Zakaat, perform Hajj and Umrah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ashhad (one of the narrators in the chain) said: ‘and I think he said: and fast Ramadan.’  ‘Look at what you would love the people to do for you then do the same for them and at what you would dislike from them then do not do that to them.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[43] <strong>Question</strong>: Is it permissible for a woman to freely dispose of her own money without the permission of her husband? And what if she knows prior to that, that her husband does not agree with her disposing of her money, even if it is for charity? And also, what about giving away her jewelry which she bought with her own money, without his permission. What is the ruling concerning this?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The ruling on this matter is clear from the hadeeth of the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;It is not permissible for a woman to freely dispose of her wealth except with the permission of her husband.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a hasan saheeh hadeeth, hasan by itself and saheeh based on its various routes of narration. And as for all the reports that it is thought present a contradiction to this hadeeth, then it is not correct to rely on that or claim that they contradict the hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the hadeeth in which the women gave their rings and earrings away in charity, as is reported in the Saheeh, then this has been responded to from many different angles:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of them is that it was probable that these charitable donations were given with the permission form the husbands of these women. And it is also possible that this event occurred before this ruling that occurs in the hadeeth became firmly established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So due to this, we advise every Muslim woman that adheres to acting on the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah to not give away from her wealth without the permission of her husband. This is because it will be a cause and a reason for the occurrence of disputes between the couple, and the end result of that will be very bad.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But in the case where a husband is mean and oppressive to his wife (by not granting her permission), she can take her case to the legal jurisdiction. And this is especially the case since today, the legal jurisdictions are in favor of the women. And in a more particular example, in cases like these, all of the judges are in agreement that the woman may freely dispose of her money without the permission of her husband. So if the matter is taken up to the court and the judge rules that this action was a violation on the part of the husband to his wife and he rules that she can give away her money, (she may do so). But if her husband objects and holds that by her doing so, she will be squandering money, at that point the judge can prevent her because, even though he bases it on the rule that it is allowed for her to spend from her wealth, he can not permit her to give away in charity that which is considered excessiveness and a squandering of money. And Allaah knows best.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[[45] Question: If a girl has reached the proper age for getting married, can her guardian force her to get married? Answer: It is not permissible for the guardian of a girl’s affairs to force her into getting married. So&#x2026; <p class="more-link-container"><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2015/02/14/it-is-not-permissible-for-a-girls-guardian-to-force-her-into-marriage-shaykh-al-albaani/" class="more-link wp-block-button__link"><svg class="svg-icon th-fill-current" width="24" height="24" aria-hidden="true" role="img" focusable="false" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M13 9l3 3m0 0l-3 3m3-3H8m13 0a9 9 0 11-18 0 9 9 0 0118 0z" /></svg> Read More <span class="screen-reader-text">It is not permissible for a girl’s guardian to force her into marriage &#8211; Shaykh&#160;al-Albaani</span></a></p>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[45] <strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">If a girl has reached the proper age for getting married, can her guardian force her to get married?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: It is not permissible for the guardian of a girl’s affairs to force her into getting married. So if the girl has not reached the proper age and has been forced into marriage, she can look for a way to dissolve this marriage after having reached the age of comprehension and maturity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because there was a girl that was forced into marriage during the time of the Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam. After the marriage, she went to the Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, and said to him: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah! My father has married me to a man that I dislike, in order to raise his own status.&#8221; So the Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, nullified her marriage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this, it is not permissible for a girl’s guardian to force her into marriage, regardless if she is a girl who has reached the legitimate age (of marriage) or she is divorced or she was married and then lost her husband. Rather it is only required of him to direct her towards what is most beneficial for her in her affairs of this world and the hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216; alayhi wa sallam, said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;There is no marriage except with (the permission of) a guardian and (the presence of) two trustworthy witnesses.&#8221;</span> And he, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, also said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Do not force your women (to get married), but rather get their consent.&#8221;</span> And he, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said: &#8220;Her silence is her consent.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are etiquettes and conditions that must be adhered to. However, at times there occurs something that opposes the Divine Legislation, such as when the father prevents his daughter and delays her marriage because of a materialistic ambition. Or because the man proposing marriage to her is poor, and due to this, his status will not be elevated. And so the girl remains without a husband. In this situation, the Divine Legislation has permitted her to marry herself because the Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Any woman that marries herself without the permission of her guardian, then her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid. But if they differ, then the authoritative figure (sultaan) is the guardian of one who has no guardian.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, this girl – whose father has prevented her marriage due to an obvious materialistic reason – she can take her case to a legitimate judge. So he will investigate the guardian of the girl&#8217;s affairs and interrogate him as to the reason why he is preventing her (from getting married). So if he hears a legitimate reason from him, such as that the man intending marriage is an innovator or he doesn&#8217;t pray or that he drinks alcohol, then the judge cannot oppose him in this. But if he hears illegitimate reasons from him, then at that point, the judge can assume guardianship of her marriage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[57] <strong>Question</strong>: One of the students of knowledge asked: Many school students ask one another concerning the ruling on leaving one&#8217;s hair to grow and shaving it off. They are confused about this issue because of what the school presses on them from the obligation of shaving all of the head or cutting it very short and because eof what the students see from some practicing teachers who let their hair grow and do not cut it, but they maintain and groom it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">So therefore I say [33] – seeking assistance from Allaah – that leaving the hair is Sunnah, as Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (rahimahullaah) said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;<em>It is sunnah. If we were able to manage and control it, we would keep it. But there is discomfort and trouble with (keeping) it (long)</em>.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"> And Ibn Al-Qayyim (rahimahullaah) said in Zaad Al-Ma&#8217;aad: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;<em>And it was not preserved from him, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, that he used to shave his head except during the sacrificial ceremonies of Hajj (nusuk)</em>.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">There are many authentic ahaadeeth that clarify the description of the Prophet&#8217;s sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam hair. It is stated in Al-Mughnee:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"> &#8220;<em>It is recommended that a person&#8217;s hair be according to the description of the Prophet&#8217;s hair. If it is long, then it should go to his shoulders and if it is short, then to the earlobes. And if it grows longer than that, then there is no harm in that. This has been reported on Ahmad</em>.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[33] These are still the words of the questioner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, <strong><span style="color:#000000;">keeping one&#8217;s hair and leaving it to grow</span></strong> must meet certain requirements, among which are:</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">There must be <strong>sincerity</strong> to Allaah, the Most High and following of the guidance of the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, in order to attain reward and merit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">There should be <strong>no imitation of women</strong> in his leaving of the hair to grow, such that he does with his hair what the women do with their hair, from the aspects of beautification that is specific to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">He should not desire by it to <strong>imitate the People of the Book or anyone else among the idol worshippers</strong>. Or in imitation of the haircuts and hairstyles of sinful Muslims, such as music and film artists or whoever treads their way, such as the shameless ones among the sports figures.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">One should <strong>clean it and groom it every other day</strong>. And it is recommended to oil it, perfume it and split it down the middle of the head. And if it grows long, then one can put it in locks.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>shaving the hair off</strong></span>, then Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah has written a detailed discussion on this subject and divided it into four types. A summary of what he said is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the shaving of the head is done for <strong>(1) Hajj or &#8216;Umrah</strong> or <strong>(2) for a necessity such as medical treatment</strong>, then this is established and prescribed in the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, and there is no doubt about it&#8217;s allowance (under these circumstances). As for it being done for any other reason besides those mentioned above, then it falls into being one of two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(3) First:</strong> That he shaves it with the intention of making <strong>worship to Allaah (ta&#8217;abbud)</strong>, to practice his Religion (tadayyun) and to abstain from the worldly affairs (zuhd) and not for Hajj or &#8216;Umrah. An example of this is such as his making the shaving of the head a trademark of the people of piety and Religion or from the highest level of abstinence and worship. Or that he places those who shave their heads as being better or more practicing or more pious than those who don&#8217;t shave it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh-ul- Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This is an innovation that neither Allaah nor His Messenger sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam commanded. It is neither obligatory nor recommended according to any of the Imaams of the Religion. Nor was it done by the Companions and those who followed them in righteousness, nor by the scholars who were well known for their piety and their worship, whether from the Companions, the Taabi&#8217;een, those who followed them or those that came after them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(4) Second:</strong> That he shaves his head for a reason other than the sacrifice of Hajj or &#8216;Umrah, and for other than a necessity, and not for trying to please or get closer to Allaah. The scholars have two opinions concerning this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first opinion:</strong> The dislike of it: This is the madh-hab of Maalik and others and it is found in one of the reports on Ahmad, may Allaah have mercy on them all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad said: &#8220;They used to dislike that.&#8221; The proof used by those who hold this opinion is that shaving the head is a trademark of the people of innovation, for the Khawaarij used to shave their heads. And the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said: &#8220;Their sign is the shaving of the head.&#8221; Also, some of the Khawaarij consider the shaving of the head as the completion of repentance and religious sacrifices. It is established in the Saheeh that: &#8220;When the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam was distributing the war booty on the Day of the Conquest, a man with a thick beard and a shaved head came to him…&#8221; And it is stated in the Musnad of Imaam Ahmad that the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said: &#8220;He is not from us who shaves his head.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbaas said: &#8220;The one who shaves his head persistently is a devil.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second opinion:</strong> Its allowance: This is the most known opinion with the followers of Abu Haneefah and Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee and it is found in a report from Ahmad also. And their proof is what Ahmad, Abu Dawood and An-Nasaa&#8217;ee have reported with an authentic chain, as has been stated by the author of Muntaqaa Al-Akhbaar, on the authority of Ibn &#8216;Umar, radyAllaahu &#8216;anhumaa, that: &#8220;The Prophet sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam saw a young boy who had shaved part of his head and left the rest of it, so he forbade them from that. And he said to them: &#8216;(Either) shave all of it or leave all of it.'&#8221; Afterwards, three small children were brought to him and he, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, shaved their heads.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because he forbade <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>al-qaz&#8217;</strong></span>, and that is to have some of the head shaved, then this provides evidence for the allowance of shaving all of it. Ash-Shawkaanee said in Nail-ul-Awtaar commenting on the hadeeth that the author of Al-Muntaqaa mentioned: &#8220;In it is proof for the allowance of shaving all of the head. Al-Ghazaalee said: &#8216;There is no harm in it for the one who desires cleanliness.&#8217; And in this is a refutation against those who hold that it is disliked.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, it is stated in Al-Mughnee: &#8220;Hanbal said: &#8216;My father and I used to shave our heads during the lifetime of Abu &#8216;Abdillaah. So he would see us while we had our heads shaved and he would not forbid us from it.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-Barr said: &#8220;The scholars have unanimously agreed upon the allowance of shaving the head. And this is sufficient as a proof.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">I say,[34] and with Allaah lies the success, this second opinion is what is more established to me due to the authenticity of its reports and their conclusiveness. And Allaah knows best. As for the school&#8217;s executive board preventing the general mass of students from letting their hair grow, then this regulation is only in the way of &#8220;suppressing the means and preventing the evil.&#8221; And this is because of what the school has noted in that a group of students, not small in number, keep their hair long not for the sake of following the Sunnah. But rather, they only do so for the sake of resembling and imitating the famous amongst the shameless celebrities and sports figures, regardless of whether they are Muslims or not. And this is done by them combing their hair in a manner that resembles the hair of these celebrities, expressing their love for them, their amazement with them and with what they are upon. Also, the harm of these students, who blindly follow, is not just limited to themselves and that&#8217;s all. Rather, their influence extends to their school colleagues and so they become affected by this false way, which leads to the wearing down of the students to having weak souls amidst their group. This is especially since they are in this age in which they have constantly changing personalities, numerous desires, and are quick to be influenced and quick to make make decisions. So you will find that the student at this age will receive more influence from his colleagues in school than from the incentives of his teachers or even his parents!! This is what I have to say and Allaah knows best.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[34] These are still the questioner&#8217;s words</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah, and may the peace and blessings be upon Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, his family, Companions and those who follow his guidance. To proceed, I strongly support the words that were stated in the last part of the fatwaa for it is traced back to an important legal principle, which is &#8220;Preventing the evil (mafsadah) comes before bringing about the good (maslahah).&#8221; So how can it be when there is no sort of maslahah (beneficial good), but only imitation of the disbelievers or the sinful people? And the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said in the authentic hadeeth: &#8220;…And whoever imitates a people is one of them.&#8221; There are many other ahaadeeth in various subjects of the Religion that bear this same meaning. I have mentioned about forty ahaadeeth from them in my book &#8220;Hijaab Al-Ma&#8217;at-ul-Muslimah&#8221;, which I have printed recently under the title &#8220;Jilbaab Al-Mar&#8217;at-ul-Muslimah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So due to this, I will always give the ruling that it is not permissible for the male youth and students to let their hair grow long and that they should either shave it off or cut it short, as the general masses of Muslims are doing today, and with Allaah lies the success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And furthermore, it is not for anyone to say today that it is disliked to shave the head, for there is no proof for that other than that it was a trademark of the Khawaarij. But today, they – and from among them are the Ibaadiyyah – do not adhere to this practice anymore, from what I know. And if they are found in some land to still be abiding by this practice, then the people of that land should contradict them in that due to what has been stated previously. And if this is not the case, then the fundamental principle is the allowance (to cut), as is stated in the hadeeth of Ibn &#8216;Umar which has been authenticated in Al-Muntaqaa. And Muslim has also reported it as I have verified in Al-Ahaadeeth As- Saheehah (no. 1123).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the hadeeth: &#8220;He is not from us who shaves his head&#8221; then it is a shortened version of the hadeeth of Abu Moosaa Al-Ash&#8217;aree, radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu, with the wording: &#8220;He is not from us who shaves (his head), tears (his clothes) and wails.&#8221; This is the way a group of the scholars have reported the hadeeth, such as Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad (4/411) and the two Shaikhs in their (respective) Saheeh collections. Al-Bukhaaree introduced it in his Saheeh by saying: &#8220;Chapter: What is forbidden from the act of shaving due to a calamity.&#8221; So therefore, the hadeeth is specific for someone who shaves his head as a means of announcing his grief due to the death of one of his relatives. What consists of this person&#8217;s objection of Allaah&#8217;s Divine Ordainment is the Prophet&#8217;s, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, linking it to his words &#8220;tears&#8221;, meaning his clothes and &#8220;wails&#8221; meaning raises his voice in wailing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what supports this is the occasion in which Abu Moosaa Al-Ash&#8217;aree, radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu, reported this hadeeth, for he reported it at the time when he was on his deathbed as occurs in the two Saheehs. And it is verified in Irwaa-ul-Ghaleel (no. 771) and in Ahkaam-ul-Janaa&#8217;iz. As for the narration from Ibn &#8216;Abbaas that has been mentioned in the previous fatwaa, then I have not come across its chain of narration and I do not deem that it is authentic. But if it is authentic, then it is likely that it is in reference to imitation of the Khawaarij based on what has been stated previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the saying that growing the hair on one&#8217;s head long is Sunnah, then there is no proof for it by which an argument can be established. And it is not sufficient in that regard to say that it is authentically reported on the Prophet (that he had long hair), for that was from his customs (&#8216;aadaat). And it has also been authentically reported on him, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, that he entered Makkah while having four locks (of tied hair), as is mentioned in my book &#8220;Mukhtasar Ash-Shamaa&#8217;il Al-Muhammadiyyah&#8221; (35/23). And &#8220;locks &#8221; means braids and plaits. But this was just an Arab custom, which some of them did not do all the time. So can it be said that this was the Sunnah also? Of course not! So then in customs like this, there must be a specific proof that asserts that it is a Sunnah of worship. But how can this be when the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, has placed an equality between the one who shaves his hair and the one who leaves it to grow as is found in his, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, saying: &#8220;(Either) shave all of it or leave all of it.&#8221; Rather, he shaved those three children&#8217;s heads as was mentioned in the fatwaa. And that is an authentic hadeeth also, which I have verified in my book &#8220;Ahkaam Al-Janaa&#8217;iz wa Bid&#8217;ihaa&#8221; (pg. 166).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not for any of the youth that are being tested with imitation of the disbelievers or of the sinful people in their hairstyles, to use the &#8220;Sunnah&#8221; as a pretext (i.e. excuse), for it is a Sunnah of custom and not a Sunnah of worship. And this is especially since many of these youth do not imitate the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, in what is obligatory upon them, such as trimming the moustache and growing the beard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily, in that there is a reminder for he who has a heart or lends his ear, while he is heedful.&#8221; [Surah Qaaf: 37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perfect are You, O Allaah, from all imperfections, and by Your praise, I bear witness that no deity has the right to be worshipped except You. I seek forgiveness in You and repent to You.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[59] <strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible to excavate the graves of the Muslims and the graves of the disbelievers?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: There is a difference, naturally, between excavating the graves of the Muslims and excavating the graves of the disbelievers. Thus, excavating the graves of the Muslims is not permissible except until after the corpse has deteriorated and become decay. This is since excavating the grave would expose the buried cadaver and its bones to wreckage, and the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said: &#8220;Breaking the bones of a deceased believer is like breaking his bones if he were alive.&#8221; So the believer has sanctity after his death, just as he used to have sanctity during his lifetime. However, this sanctity is of course within the legislated bounds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for excavating the graves of the disbelievers, then they do not possess this (same) sanctity. Therefore, it is permissible to excavate them based on what is established in Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim that when the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216; alayhi wa sallam, migrated from Makkah to Madeenah, the first thing he instituted was the construction of the Prophet&#8217;s masjid, which is still in existence today. But (at that time), there used be a garden there that belonged to a group of orphans from the Ansaar, in which were graves of polytheists. So he, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said to these orphans: &#8220;Give me a price for your land.&#8221; He meant by this, &#8220;Sell me your land for it&#8217;s price.&#8221; They responded: &#8220;It is for Allaah and His Messenger. We do not want any price for it.&#8221; And there was found old ruins and graves of polytheists on that land. So the Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, put someone in charge of the graves of the polytheists and so they were leveled (and the bodies were taken out). And he put someone in charge of the old ruins and they were flattened. Then the Prophet&#8217;s masjid was established on the ground of that garden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, the excavation of the graves is from two perspectives. As for it being done to the Muslim graves, then it is not permissible. And as for it being done to the disbelievers&#8217; graves then it is permissible. I have indicated in the response, that it is not permissible to excavate the Muslims&#8217; graves until the bodies first deteriorate and become dust, but when is this? Indeed, it differs according to the different types of land. There are arid desert lands, in which corpses can remain for as many years as Allaah wills. And there are moist lands, which expedite the decaying of the bodies buried in them. Thus, it is not possible to put a regulation that would determine the specific time it takes for the bodies to decay. So just as it is said: &#8220;The inhabitants of Makkah are the most knowledgeable about its mountain trails&#8221;, then those individuals who bury people in that land know best the approximate time it takes for the dead buried in the graves to decay.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[48] <strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling concerning putting limitations to the amount of offspring one has?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The person that limits his offspring without having a legitimate reason for doing so, I hold him to be <strong>foolish</strong> if not a disbeliever in the Qadaa and the Qadar (Divine Execution and Preordainment) of Allaah. This is since the individual that limits his progeny to only three children, for example, and he has reached the age of fifty (!), the thought of death does not even cross his mind, or that some violent storm should come and take the lives of his three children, thus leaving him till the end of his life as if he were barren and without offspring. Therefore, those that put limits to the amount of children they have, they do not reflect upon the things that every Muslim reflects on. And it is Al-Qadar (Preordainment), which befalls the people in the way that He wants, not in the way that they want. So this practice that is done in current times, is a severe negligence and a clear deprivation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Asaalah, Issue #2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[49] <strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Does the ruling on birth control differ from that of family limitation (of offspring)? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: Birth control has some detail to it. Therefore, I say that this thing, which has come to be known as &#8220;birth control&#8221; is from that which the Muslims of today are being tested by in the lands of Islaam. However, there are cases from it, which must be referred back to the motive behind it. An example of this is when the motive for this birth control is based on a prescription from Muslim doctors who are advising the couple towards this so-called &#8220;birth control&#8221; to safeguard the health of the woman who has departed from her natural state due to her having delivered many children! So if a skilled Muslim doctor issues these instructions as a form of advice, then that becomes a legitimate excuse for (the allowance of) this birth control.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an example in which birth control is permissible. As for an example that is contrary to this one, then it is such as when the motive behind it is due to poverty (!) or because of bills, which is always on the minds of the disbelievers!! So you can see one of them say: &#8220;My wife and I are two. And I have two children!! And the fifth member of them is their dog!! So this monthly pay that we receive is just enough for us (to pay our bills), and that&#8217;s all [five]!&#8221; This is not permissible in Islaam because this motive emanates from the logic of the Days of Ignorance, which we were warned to avoid and stay away from. Such is found in Allaah&#8217;s saying: &#8220;And do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We will provide you with sustenance as well as them.&#8221; [Surah Al-Ana’aam: 151]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is especially the case since the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Muslims believe that the child comes with his sustenance (already) with him</strong></span>. This is because, before it comes out into this world, its sustenance is ordained for it while it is in the womb of its mother, as has been clarified to us in the Noble Sunnah. So this example of birth control, with this motive, is not permissible at all. As for the baseless and false reasons that some people have used to justify and allow it, then they have no place in the Religion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[40] <strong>Question</strong>: What is the best way for women to give da&#8217;wah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: I say to the women: “<span style="color:#008000;"><em>Remain in your homes</em></span>.” [Surah Ahzaab: 33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you should not concern yourselves with da&#8217;wah. I reject the use of the word &#8220;da&#8217;wah&#8221; amongst the male youth by them making it seem like they are from the people of da&#8217;wah – as if the word da&#8217;wah has become the fashion of modern times. So every individual that knows something about the Religion becomes a Da&#8217;ee (caller to Islaam)! And this matter did not stop with the male youth until it was carried over to the female youth and housewives. And in many instances, they have begun to turn away from fulfilling the obligations of their households and their husbands and their children, turning away from these obligations towards something that is not obligatory upon them, such as establishing the da&#8217;wah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The general rule concerning the woman is that she is to stay in her home. And it has not been legislated for her to leave it unless she has a dire need. This is based on the statement of the Prophet,sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam: &#8220;And (praying in) their homes is better for them&#8221;, i.e. than the (congregational) prayer in the masjid.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today we see a prevalent phenomenon amongst the women in that they go out often to the masjids in order to pray the congregational prayer, not to mention the Jumu&#8217;ah prayer. In spite of this, their homes are better for them – unless there is a masjid in which the Imaam is a scholar who teaches those attending some aspects from the sciences of the Religion. So in this case, the woman could go out to pray in the masjid in order to listen to the knowledge. There is nothing preventing her from that. As for the woman preoccupying herself with the da&#8217;wah (!), then let her sit in her home and read from the books that her husband or brother or other male relatives provide for her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, there is nothing preventing her from setting a day in which she calls the women to come to her house or she goes out to attend the house of one of them. That is better than a group of women going out (to her). One woman going out to a group of women is better for them than all of them going out to her. As for her moving about and traveling, perhaps traveling without a mahram, and she justifies that by claiming that she went out for the purpose of da&#8217;wah, then these are from the presentday innovations. And I do not specify the women only with that, rather, even some of the male youth speak excessively about the da&#8217;wah and yet they have very little knowledge.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Salaf (Predecessors) used to say concerning these ayaat as well as those similar to them: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Leave them as they are stated</strong></span>.&#8221; But they did not mean by this to leave them the way they are without attaching any understanding to them. Rather, they meant by it, to leave them the way they are stated according to their correct understanding, without making comparisons for (the Attributes of Allaah stated in) them (<em><strong>tashbeeh</strong></em>), describing their manner (<em><strong>takyeef</strong></em>), misinterpreting them (<em><strong>ta&#8217;weel</strong></em>) and denying them (<em><strong>ta&#8217;teel</strong></em>). Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;There is nothing whatsoever like Him (in comparison). And He is the All-Hearer, the All- Seer.&#8221;</span></em> [Surah Ash-Shooraa: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this ayah, there is <em><strong>tanzeeh</strong> </em>(negation of all anthropomorphic qualities from Allaah) as well as <em><strong>ithbaat</strong> </em>(affirmation) for two attributes for Himself, which are hearing and seeing. The understanding of this elimination of all similarities to Allaah (tanzeeh) is that we must (also) affirm the attributes that Allaah has described Himself with or the Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, has described Him with, as it befits His grandness, may He be Glorified and Exalted. And we do not say &#8220;how&#8221; that is, such as by saying: &#8220;His hearing is like our hearing and His seeing is like our seeing.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, we do not misinterpret that (i.e. make ta&#8217;weel) as has been done by some of the extremists from the Mu&#8217;tazilah, such that they have misinterpreted Allaah&#8217;s hearing and seeing to be His knowledge. And this is in spite of Allaah&#8217;s describing Himself with knowledge in many other ayaat of the Noble Qur&#8217;aan! Thus, the misinterpretation (ta&#8217;weel) of these individuals of hearing and seeing for knowledge constitutes ta&#8217;teel (denial of Allaah&#8217;s Attributes). The scholars say about this: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The one who commits ta&#8217;teel worships nothing, while the one who commits tajseem worships a statue</strong></span>.&#8221; [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on this, we say, concerning the two ayahs mentioned previously in the question, which contain Allaah&#8217;s mocking and ridiculing, that it is a mocking and a ridiculing that is befitting for Allaah. And it is not like that which limited intellects may perceive it to be, from that which has comparisons to the<br />
creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] Surah Al-Baqarah: 15<br />
[14] Translator&#8217;s Note: This is because the one who commits ta&#8217;teel (mu&#8217;attil) denies all of Allaah&#8217;s Attributes, so it is as if he is worshipping nothing. On the other hand, the one who commits tajseem (mujassim) ascribes anthropomorphic qualities to Allaah, for example saying His eyes are like our eyes and His hand is like our hands. So it is like He is worshipping a statue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[42] Question: What is the ruling concerning a woman cutting some of her hair?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer: With regard to a woman cutting her hair, then one must look into the motive behind her doing it. So if a woman cuts her hair in imitation of the disbelieving or sinful women, then it is not permissible for her to cut it while having this intention. As for cutting only a small portion from her hair or cutting it in accordance to the desires of her husband, then I do not see anything preventing this from being done.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in Saheeh Muslim (no. 320) that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The Prophet&#8217;s wives used to cut their hair to the point that it would reach the earlobes.&#8221;</span></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[37] Question: There are some masjids in which the women pray below the actual masjid, such as in the basement or in an upper level (above the masjid). We are women who pray in these masjids, at times following the Imaam from a point where we are not able to see him nor the male followers. And sometimes there is a large empty space left over in the area of prayer for the men. Is our prayer valid if we cannot see the Imaam or any of the (male) followers, and while knowing that sometimes we enter the masjid and don&#8217;t know what rak&#8217;ah he is in. Is it allowed in this situation to follow (the Imaam) by (hearing) the raised voice only? And is it correct for us to follow the Imaam while we are on an upper or lower level knowing that at times there is ample room in the masjid (floor)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer: The answer is in two parts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first</strong> is that the prayer and the mentioned scenario is valid so long as the women pray in the masjid, regardless of whether it is in the upper or lower level. And it is so long as they are able to hear the takbeers from the Imaam indicating the change in position, such as from standing to bowing to prostrating.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second part</strong> is that it is not proper for the women to pray like this unless the area for the men is filled with people and they (the women) cannot find a place behind the rows for them to pray in. In these circumstances, it is permissible for the women to pray in the upper or lower level of the masjid. But if this masjid, where the Imaam and the men behind him pray, has ample room left over, then it is not allowed for the women to go up to the upper level or down to the lower level where they won&#8217;t be able to see the movements of the Imaam or the movements of the men praying behind him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason for this goes back to two matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. When the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said: &#8220;<em><span style="color:#008000;">The best rows for the men are their first ones and their worst (rows) are their last ones. And the best rows for women are their last ones and the worst (rows) are their first ones</span></em>&#8220;, he meant by it the same ground that the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, and his Companions behind him used to pray on. The women were not in upper or lower levels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The underlying reason for this is that the speakers at times can be low and at other times they are not working. So the prayer of the women who are following him from an upper or lower level, from which they cannot see the prayer of the Imaam or those behind him, is subject to becoming invalid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To summarize this answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The prayer that is performed while on an upper or lower level is valid. However, it is not permissible to designate those places for prayer when there is enough room in the prayer place (musalla), such that the women are able to pray in the back of it. </strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[33] <strong>Question</strong>: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Does wiping over ones khimaar and turban replace wiping over the ears, due to their both being part of the head? [24]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My opinion, and Allaah knows best, is that at times it does replace it and at other times it doesn&#8217;t. As for the condition in which it does replace wiping (the ears) then it is the state when the turban or the khimaar covers the entire head, including the ears. Thus, in this condition, the hadeeth would apply in that they (ears) are both part of the head literally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the other condition in which it is not sufficient to just wipe over the turban or the khimaar, then it is when the turban or the khimaar does not cover the ears. This means that the turban is wide or aloof from the ears. Under these circumstances I hold that the authentic hadeeth about wiping the head itself. This is such that three ways of wiping the head have been established on the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first way:</strong> This is the most common and normal of his ways and it was that he would wipe all of his head directly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second way:</strong> If the turban or the khimaar covered the head, then it was sufficient to just wipe over the turban or the khimaar, exactly like the head.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third and final way:</strong> And this is the area that requires evidence and needs speculation. And it is when the turban would cover the last part of the head, yet expose the front of it (forehead). In this condition, the Prophet sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam would wipe over his head directly and then grasp his turban.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[24] Translator&#8217;s Note: The Prophet said: &#8220;The ears are part of the head.&#8221; [Reported by At-Tirmidhee (37), Abu Dawood (134) and Ibn Maajah (444) and declared saheeh by Shaikh Al-Albaanee in As-Saheehah (1/36)] So we are obligated to wash them when taking wudoo and ghusl even though the ayah concerning wudoo doesn&#8217;t mention the ears but only the head. This question is based on this principle in that if we are permitted to wipe over certain garments in replacement of the head, are the ears included in the same manner?</span></p>

<p>Here’s a narration which I just read today which I found to be very deep. I thought I’d share it with you all.</p>
<p>The Prophet (<i>sallalahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</i>) said:</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“Instruct your dying ones to say ‘None has the right to be worshipped but Allah’, for indeed the soul of a believer departs through perspiration, and the soul of a disbeliever departs from the corner of his mouth just as the soul of the donkey departs.”</b></span></p>
<p>Reported by at-Tabaraanee in <i>Al-Kabeer</i> (1/77/3) as mentioned by Sheikh al-Albaanee (<i>rahimahullah</i>) in <i>As-Saheehah</i> No. 2151</p>
<p>After mentioning its chain of narration, the Sheikh said:</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><b>‘And this chain of narration is hasan (good)’</b>.</span> See <i>As-Saheehah</i> No. 2151.</p>
<p>May Allah make our last words ‘none has the right to be worshipped but Allah’. Aameen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 1</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">source: silsilat ul-hudā wa nnūr ~ the series of guidance and light ~ tape no. 8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Question #5: “What is the ruling on the one who abandons the prayer? And what is the difference between al-kufr ul-ʽamalī [1] (the disbelief related to actions) and al-kufr ul-ʽitiqādī [2] (the disbelief related to faith)?”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albānī answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The one who abandons the prayer has two states: either he believes in its legislation, or he denies its legislation. So regarding this second state, he is a disbeliever by the consensus of the Muslims. And likewise, whoever denies a matter from the religion that a Muslim cannot be ignorant about – for example, whoever denies (the legislation of) fasting, Hajj and whatever else there is of matters known by all the Muslims to be necessities of the religion – then he is a disbeliever. So there is no difference of opinion about this: whoever denies the legislation of the prayer is a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
But if there is a man who does not deny (the legislation) of the prayer and who acknowledges its legislation, but with respect to action, he does not perform it, he does not pray – maybe he does not pray at all and maybe he prays sometimes – so in this case, if we said that this man has disbelieved, this statement would not apply to him at all, because kufr (disbelief) is denial, and he is not denying the legislation of the prayer, as (Allāh), the Most High, said with regard</p>
<p>to the disbelievers: {And they denied them (those Āyāt)…, though their ownselves were convinced thereof}. [3]<br />
So if we take as an example so-and-so from the people who does not pray, but when he is asked ‘Why don’t you pray O my brother?’, he says to you, ‘Allāh will forgive me, by Allāh the worldly life has kept me busy, these children have kept me busy,’ and this type of talk. Of course, this talk is not an excuse for him at all, but he presents us a benefit which we didn’t know because we can’t know what is in his heart. He presents us a benefit that the man believes in the legislation of the prayer, as opposed to if the answer was, may Allāh forbid: ‘O my brother, the time for this prayer is gone; this was during a time when the people were not educated, they were unclean, they were in need of a specific nature of cleanliness, purity and exercise, and now the time for this has gone; now there are new means that free us of prayer’ – this (man) has disbelieved and thus (goes) to {Hell, and worst indeed is that destination}. [4]  As for if the answer is the first (example): ‘Why don’t you pray?’ (and he says,) ‘Allāh will forgive us, may Allāh curse the shaytān,’ and this type of talk that informs us that the man is not denying the legislation of the prayer, then if we said that this man is a disbeliever, we would be contradicting the reality, because this man is a believer, a believer in the legislation of the prayer and a believer in all of Islām, so how can we declare him a disbeliever?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, we say that there is no difference between the one who abandons the prayer and the one who abandons fasting and the one who abandons Hajj and the one who abandons anything from the acts of worship related to actions – (there is no difference) with regard to (judging whether) he is to be declared a disbeliever or not. When is he declared a disbeliever? If he denies. When is he not declared a disbeliever? If he believes. So it is not allowed – by consensus – to declare the believer to be a disbeliever. And many narrations have come in accordance with this…: ‘(Allāh will say:) Make whoever (sincerely) said lā ilāha illAllāh (none has the right to be worshiped but Allāh) enter Paradise,’ while he does not have a (good) deed equal to the weight of an atom, but he has the weight of an atom of īmān (faith), so this īmān is what prevents him from dwelling in the Fire forever, and he enters Paradise even if it is after he becomes a black coal. [5] However, this is the one who bears witness that none has the right to be worshiped but Allāh and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allāh, and he believes in all that has come from Allāh and His Messenger ; but he does not pray, or does not fast or does not perform Hajj or the like, or he steals or fornicates – there is no difference with regard to all these affairs when placed on the scales of disbelief related to actions and disbelief related to faith [because since he has faith, these impermissible actions do not fall under disbelief related to faith / major kufr].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For instance, a man commits fornication; do we declare him a disbeliever? You will say, no. I say, no. Don’t be hasty. We have to see, does he say that zinā (fornication) is prohibited? Does he say as some of the ignorant ones say: ‘there is no harām and there is no halāl’? If he says to me (such a) statement, he has disbelieved. Likewise, the one who steals and any (other) sin – for example, the man who backbites people, and we say to him: ‘Fear Allāh, the Messenger (of Allāh) said: ‘Backbiting is you mentioning about</p>
<p>your brother that which he dislikes,’6 and he says: ‘There is no ‘the Messenger said’ and such-and-such,’ (then) he has disbelieved. In this manner, (the same applies to) all the Islamically legislated rulings, whether it is a positive ruling, i.e., one of the obligatory duties, or a negative ruling, i.e., the prohibitions that he must keep away from. So, if he regards any of these prohibitions to be permissible in his heart, he has disbelieved. But if he falls into it by way of action while believing that he is disobeying (Allāh), he has not disbelieved.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there is no difference with regard to this between all the Islamically legislated rulings, whether they are from the obligatory duties or prohibitions. The obligatory duties must be carried out and it is not permissible to leave them off, but whoever leaves them out of laziness, it is not allowed to declare him a disbeliever. Whoever leaves them out of denial has disbelieved; whoever regards any of the forbidden things to be permissible has likewise disbelieved. There is no difference with regard to this at all between the obligations and prohibitions.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">source: <em>silsilat ul-ahaadeeth is-saheeha – </em>the series of authentic narrations <em>– hadeeth</em> no. 87</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hudhaifa bin al-Yamaan (<em>radiAllaahu ‘anhu</em>) said that the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “Islaam will be erased just as the decoration of a garment is (worn out and) erased, until it will not be known what is fasting, nor prayer, nor the rituals of Hajj, nor charity; and the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, (i.e., the Qur’aan) will be taken away (from the <em>mus-hafs</em>[1] and breasts of the people)[2] in one night such that not (even) an <em>aayah</em> from it will remain on earth. And groups of people will remain – the old people – saying: ‘We saw our forefathers upon this statement: ‘<em>laa ilaaha illAllaah </em>(none has the right to worshiped but Allaah),’ so we also say it.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then), Silah bin Zufar said to Hudhaifa: ‘What will ‘<em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>’ benefit them when they don’t know what is prayer, nor fasting, nor the rituals of Hajj, nor charity?’ Hudhaifa turned away from him. Then (Silah) repeated it to (Hudhaifa) three times, and every time Hudhaifa would turn away from him. Then he turned toward him on the third time and said three times: ‘O Silah! It will save them from the Fire.’”[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~*~*~*~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) comments:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There is an important benefit of <em>fiqh </em>in the <em>hadeeth</em>, which is that bearing witness that <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah </em>(none has the right to be worshiped but Allaah) saves the one who says it (sincerely) from dwelling forever in the Fire on the Day of Resurrection, even if he didn’t use to perform any of the other pillars of Islaam at all, such as prayer and so on. And it is known that the scholars have differed about the ruling on the one who abandons the prayer especially while believing in its legislation. So<strong> the majority was of the opinion that he has not disbelieved</strong>by that, but rather disobeyed Allaah; and Ahmad – in a report – was of the opinion that he has disbelieved, and that he is to be killed due to apostasy, not as a prescribed punishment. And it is has been authentically narrated from the Companions that they did not consider leaving any of the actions to be disbelief except the prayer; at-Tirmithee and al-Haakim reported it.[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I believe that that which is correct is the view of the majority, and that<strong> what was mentioned from the Companions does not clearly state that they meant by ‘disbelief’ here to be the disbelief which will make its possessor dwell forever in the Fire and for which it is not possible that Allaah will forgive him</strong>. How can that be when this is Hudhaifa bin al-Yamaan – who is one of the foremost of those Companions – responding to Silah bin Zufar, who was about to understand the affair as Ahmad’s understanding of it. So (Silah) said: ‘What will ‘<em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>’ benefit them when they don’t know what is prayer. . .,’ then Hudhaifa replied to him after his turning away from him, saying three times: ‘O Silah! It will save them from the Fire.’ Therefore, this is a clear statement from Hudhaifa (<em>radiAllaahu ‘anhu</em>) that the one who abandons the prayer is not a disbeliever [if he believes in its legislation], but rather a Muslim who will be saved from dwelling forever in the Fire on the Day of Resurrection. So be mindful of this, for indeed you may not find it in other than this place.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Question #10: “What about the <em>hadeeth</em>: ‘whoever abandons the prayer has disbelieved’?”[1]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>This is not the first <em>hadeeth</em> in which it is said that whoever does such-and-such has disbelieved</strong>. You have the famous <em>hadeeth</em> ‘whoever swears by other than Allaah has disbelieved,’[2] but we don’t say that whoever says ‘by the life of my father’ has apostatized from his religion.[3] And you know, for example, the<em>hadeeth</em> of ‘Umar bin al-Khattaab in Saheeh al-Bukhaari when the Messenger (of Allaah) (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) heard him swearing by his father, so he (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) said: ‘Don’t swear by your fathers; whoever of you swears, then let him swear by Allaah or keep silent.’[4] And in the <em>hadeeth</em> of (‘Umar’s) son ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Umar, he said that the Messenger (of Allaah) (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: ‘Whoever swears by other than Allaah has associated partners with Him,’[5] and in another narration, ‘he has disbelieved.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not necessary for the occurrence of the expression ‘whoever does such-and-such has disbelieved’ to mean that he has disbelieved with the disbelief of apostasy. Rather, it can have many meanings, such as for example: ‘he has disbelieved’ can mean that he is close to disbelieving, that he has disbelieved with the disbelief related to (only) actions (i.e., minor <em>kufr</em>), and such meanings that the people of knowledge were obliged to (apply) in order to reconcile between the texts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever abandons the prayer has disbelieved.’ (But also) we say, ‘whoever says<em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>[6] (sincerely) will enter Paradise;’[7] ‘whoever says <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> (sincerely), it will benefit him some day,’[8] [9] as mentioned in the<em>hadeeth</em> of al-Bazzaar and others. (Another <em>hadeeth</em> mentions that) ‘whichever slave runs away from his master has disbelieved.’[10] These expressions are very numerous: ‘he has disbelieved, he has disbelieved.’ And there isn’t any <em>hadeeth</em>that is interpreted like this upon its apparent meaning if it comes with the expression: ‘he has disbelieved.’ This <em>hadeeth</em> – ‘whoever abandons the prayer has disbelieved’ – is treated the same way as the other narrations which share the saying ‘he has disbelieved’ with the <em>hadeeth</em> about prayer. So here, many interpretations can occur for this text as for many (other) narrations. For example, ‘the tale-carrier[11] will not enter Paradise,’[12] (but) does that mean that he has disbelieved because of his tale-carrying? The answer is: if he considers that to be permissible by his heart, then Paradise has been forbidden for him. And if he acknowledges the forbiddance of that, and admits that he is wrong, a sinner and an evildoer, then his affair is with Allaah, as He, the Mighty and Majestic, said: ‘Verily, Allaah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills.’[13] So abandoning the prayer is an action that leads its doer to die upon other than<em>eemaan</em> (faith) – and Allaah’s protection is sought. And abandoning the prayer is from the characteristics of the disbelievers who don’t pray and don’t give the<em>zakaah</em> (obligatory charity). Hence, if the Muslim does not pray, he has resembled the disbelievers. So his disbelief here is the disbelief related to actions [as long as he believes in the legislation of the prayer]. And the narrations which must be explained (with regard to their true meanings) are very numerous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For instance, during the farewell pilgrimage, (the Prophet) (<em>‘alayhi ssalaat was salaam</em>) ordered Jareer bin ‘Abdillaah al-Bajalee to quiet the people down and make them listen, and he (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) said while addressing them: ‘Do not return to being disbelievers after me by striking the necks of one another.’[14]And he (<em>‘alayhi ssalaat was salaam</em>) said: ‘Insulting a Muslim is disobedience (to Allaah), and fighting him is disbelief.’[15] But if a Muslim kills or fights another Muslim, has this (person) apostatized from his religion? The answer is: no, because Allaah said: {And if two parties or groups among the believers fall to fighting, then make peace between them both. But if one of them outrages against the other, then fight you (all) against the one that which outrages till it complies with the Command of Allah}.[16] <strong>He considered each of the two groups – the one outraging and the one being outraged – to be from the believers, although the Messenger (of Allaah) said in the previous <em>hadeeth</em> that ‘insulting a Muslim is disobedience (to Allaah) and fighting him is disbelief.</strong>’ So how is disbelief interpreted here? It is minor disbelief; it is disbelief related to actions. And the narrations about prayer – which declare that the one who abandons the prayer has disbelieved – are also (interpreted) likewise: either it is said that he is close to the disbelief related to faith (i.e., major <em>kufr</em>), that he is close to dying upon other than the religion of Islaam, or (it is said) that he has disbelieved with the disbelief related to actions. This interpretation is necessary so that we don’t contradict the narrations of the Messenger (of Allaah) (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) with one another.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Question #23: “Our Shaykh, I am asking you about the issue of proofs with regard to the ruling on the one who abandons the prayer. In the treatise ‘The ruling on the one who abandons prayer’ by Shaykh Muhammad Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, he is of the opinion that the one who abandons the prayer is a disbeliever, and he has many proofs, such as Allaah’s statement about the <em>mushrikoon</em>:[1] {But if they repent, perform <em>salaah</em> (the prayer), and give <em>zakaah</em> (obligatory charity), then they are your brethren in religion}.[2] So he says that what is understood from the <em>aayah</em> is that if they don’t do that, they are not our brethren; and the religious brotherhood isn’t negated by sins even if they are great, but it is negated when one leaves Islaam”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Yet he is not saying that if the person prays but doesn’t give the <em>zakaah</em> that he is (likewise) not a Muslim and that he has disbelieved by that. May Allaah guide you, you are bringing his proof but I would like to turn your attention to (the fact) that<strong>there is no proof in it because he is not saying about the one who abandons the<em>zakaah</em> the same as he is saying about the one who abandons the prayer.</strong> You didn’t just narrate his opinion, rather you narrated (both) his opinion and his proof, but I would like to turn your attention to (the fact) that this is not a proof for him, because the <em>aayah</em> includes <em>zakaah</em> along with the prayer, [yet he is differentiating between the one who abandons the former and the one who abandons the latter].”</p>
<div>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Question #23 (continued): “What is the ruling on this man who has abandoned the prayer, not out of denying (its legislation) but out of laziness? And what is the<em>daleel </em>(evidence)?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This (man) is one who is rebellious and disobedient (to Allaah), and not a disbeliever. The<em> daleel</em> is that ‘Whoever says <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>[3] (sincerely) will enter Paradise,’[4] and the <em>daleel</em> is that ‘Allaah has prescribed five prayers upon (His) slaves, so whoever performs them and does them well, and completes their<em>rukoo</em>’ (bowing), <em>sujood </em>(prostration) and <em>khushoo</em>’ (submissive humility and attentiveness), then he has a covenant with Allaah that He will enter him into Paradise, and whoever does not perform them and does not complete their <em>rukoo</em>’,<em>sujood</em> and <em>khushoo</em>’, then he does not have a covenant with Allaah;<strong> If He wills, He will punish him and if He wills, He will forgive him</strong>,’[5] <strong>and if he was a disbeliever, He would not forgive him</strong> because Allaah says: ‘Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills.’”[6]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">*Question #10: (a) “What should the one making <em>istikhaara</em>[1] prayer say if he has two affairs on the same level and does not have an inclination toward either one, meaning 50-50?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) answers: “What I understand from your question is that he does not have an<strong> intention (to do something)</strong><em>,</em>[2] therefore there is no<em> istikhaara </em>prayer upon him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">*Question #10: (a) “Is the <em>istikhaara</em> prayer legislated for one who is confused about doing something or is it legislated for one who has made up his mind to do so?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani answers: “No, the <em>istikhaara</em> prayer does not remove confusion. <strong><em>Istikhaara</em> prayer is (done) after a person has made up his mind to do something</strong>; so here, <em>istikhaara</em> is performed. <em>Istikhaara </em>prayer is not legislated for removing doubt and uncertainty regarding a matter which the Muslim has not made up his mind about.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">*Question #5: (b) “Is the <em>du’aa</em> (supplication) of <em>istikhaara</em> prayer before the<em>tasleem</em> or after it?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani answers: “<strong>After</strong> the <em>tasleem.</em>“</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">*Question #12: (c) “Is it allowed to repeat the <em>istikhaara</em> prayer?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani answers: “It is allowed if his<em> istikhaara</em> prayer was not (performed in the way in which it is) legislated, and it is enough for it to be not legislated if he makes <em>istikhaara</em> to his Lord by (merely) his words, and not by his heart. And he himself is aware of this inattentiveness, so then he is forced to repeat (the <em>istikhaara</em> prayer). As for if he himself did not feel any of that, <strong>then he has innovated (if he repeats it)</strong>.”</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<hr size="1"/>
<div>
<p>[1] <em>istikhaara</em> means to seek (from Allaah) that which is best regarding something<br />
[2] this is in reference to the actual wording of the <em>hadeeth</em> in which the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “If one of you <em>intends to do something</em>, then let him pray two <em>ra’kah</em>, then say [the <em>du&#8217;aa</em> of <em>istikhaara</em>]“; Saheeh al-Bukhaari #6382</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <em>bidaayat us-sool fi tafdheel ir-rasool </em>&#8211; …the superiority of the Messenger (of Allaah) (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) – page no. 5-7</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh al-Albaani</em> (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) says in his introduction:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Know, O <em>Muslim</em> brother, that it is not possible for anyone to rise to this station of loving Allaah and His Messenger [<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>] except by<em>tawheed</em> (singling out) of Allaah, the Most High, alone in His worship, and by singling out the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) alone for following from among the servants of Allaah, due to (Allaah’s) statement: ‘He who obeys the Messenger (Muhammad (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>)) has indeed obeyed Allaah’[1] and His statement ‘Say (O Muhammad (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em>to mankind): ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me (i.e. accept Islamic Monotheism, follow the Qur’aan and the Sunnah), Allaah will love you.’’[2] And (the Prophet) (‘<em>alayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>) said: ‘No, by the One in whose Hand my soul is, if <em>Moosaa</em> was alive, he would have no choice but to follow me.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: so <strong>if someone like <em>Moosaa</em>, the one who Allaah spoke to (directly), cannot follow other than the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>), then can anyone else do that?</strong> Hence, this is one of the definite evidences of the obligation of singling out the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) in following, which is one of the requirements of the<em> shahaada </em>(testimony): ‘<em>anna muhammad ar-rasoolullaah</em> (that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah)’ [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>]. Therefore, Allaah, the Blessed and Most High, in the before-mentioned <em>aayah</em>, made following him (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) alone to be a proof of Allaah’s love for (the follower). And there is no doubt that <strong>whoever Allaah loves, Allaah is with him in everything</strong>, as occurs in the authentic<em>hadeeth al-Qudsi</em>:[4] ‘(Allaah says), ‘My slave does not come near to me with anything more beloved to me than that which I have made obligatory upon him, and My slave continues to come near me with supererogatory deeds until I love him; and when I love him, I am his hearing with which he hears, his sight with which he sees, his hand with which he grasps and his leg with which he walks.[5]And if he asks me, I will surely give him, and if he seeks refuge in Me, I will surely protect him . . .’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if this divine care is only for the beloved slave of Allaah, it is obligatory upon every Muslim to take the means which will make him beloved to Allaah, namely following the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) alone; and just by that, he will attain special care from his Mawlaa[7], the Blessed and Most High. Don’t you see that it is not possible to know the obligatory duties and distinguish them from the supererogatory acts except by following him (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) alone? And indeed there is no doubt that the more the Muslim learns about the biography of the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) and knows of his pleasant nature and virtues, the more his love for him [<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>] will be and the more extensive and comprehensive his following of him [<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>] will be.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Question #2: “What is the authenticity of adding <em>wa maghfiratuh</em>[1] in offering the<em>salaam</em> and responding to it?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh al-Albaani</em> (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There is no addition (of <em>wa maghfiratuh</em>) in the <em>hadeeth </em>with respect to offering the <em>salaam</em>; i.e., if a person starts with offering the <em>salaam</em>, he ends at <em>wa barakaatuh</em>: <em>asalaamu ‘alaykum wa rahmatullaahi wa barakaatuh.</em> And the<em>hadeeth</em> that has come – or in more precise words, (the <em>hadeeth</em>) that was narrated – (stating) that at the fourth time, the fourth of them said, <em>asalaamu ‘alaykum wa rahmatullaahi wa barakaatuh wa maghfiratuh</em>, then this is a weak narration. As for the addition (of <em>wa maghfiratuh</em>) in the response to <em>wa barakaatuh</em>, then it is established; i.e., a man says, <em>asalaamu ‘alaykum wa rahmatullaahi wa barakaatuh</em>, then we add <em>wa maghfiratuh</em> in the response…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is in agreement with the noble <em>Qur’aan</em> (with) the saying ‘When you are greeted with a greeting, greet in return with what is better than it, or (at least) return it equally.’[2] So if the greeter gives the <em>salaam</em>, saying <em>asalaamu ‘alaykum wa rahmatullaahi wa barakaatuh</em>, the <em>aayah</em> that stated ‘greet in return with what is better than it’ is not invalidated; this command still exists, which is (followed by saying) <em>wa maghfiratuh</em>. This addition (with respect to responding) has also been mentioned in…narrations established from some of the Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we have brought out a conclusion whose summary is that<strong> adding <em>wa maghfiratuh</em> in the response is allowed and starting (the <em>salaam</em> with it) is not allowed</strong>.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Question #11: “Are good deeds multiplied in general during <em>Ramadhaan</em> and likewise evil deeds?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh al-Albaani</em> (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This question is also often brought up regarding Makkah and the one residing in Makkah, whether he is a foreigner or a Makkan; are good deeds and evil deeds multiplied over there? The answer: t<strong>here isn’t any text in the Islamic legislation clearly (stating) that good deeds are multiplied, and likewise evil deeds, due to the excellence of a (certain) place or the excellence of a (certain) time</strong>; excellence of a place like <em>Makkah</em> and <em>Madinah</em> for example (and) excellence of a time like this month of ours, the month of <em>Ramadhaan</em>. There isn’t any clear text about good deeds or evil deeds being multiplied (in such cases). But some of the scholars, by way of deduction, say that they are multiplied – by way of deduction, i.e., not based on a text but rather by way of<em> ijtihaad</em>.[1] So if someone says that good deeds are multiplied, there is no harm in that because it is the saying of some of the scholars. But it is not allowed to be absolutely certain about that due to the nonexistence of (relevant evidence mentioned in) the holy text which ‘falsehood cannot come to from before it or behind it.’”[2]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: “Even if it is a <i>sunnah</i>?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaani: “Even if it is a <i>sunnah</i>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">* * *</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: “Are the prostrations of forgetfulness before the <i>tasleem</i> or after the <i>tasleem</i>?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“For all prostrations of forgetfulness, one has the <strong>choice </strong>between prostrating<strong>before</strong> the <i>tasleem</i> <strong>or after </strong>the <i>tasleem</i>. And the detailed explanation mentioned in some, especially Hanbali, books that it is before the <i>tasleem</i> for additions and after the <i>tasleem</i> for omissions – this is baseless. Those who say so saw some cases to which such an explanation can be applied, however there are also cases that nullify this explanation. Therefore, one has the choice between performing the <i>tasleem</i> then prostrating, or prostrating then performing the<i> tasleem</i> of exiting the prayer.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"> * *</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“…When all the<em> hadeeth</em>s are gathered together, it becomes clear that one who forgets in prayer has a choice: if he wants, he <strong>(first) performs the <i>tasleem</i></strong> and that is <strong>absolutely better</strong>; or if he wants, he does not perform the <i>tasleem</i> except after completing the two prostrations of forgetfulness.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: “The same as these i.e. <i>tasbeeh</i> and <i>rabb-ighfir lee</i>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh: “Yes, there isn’t anything special.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">“If he intentionally leaves them out,<b> </b>the prayer does not become invalid; however he will be a<strong> sinner</strong> because of his leaving out the two prostrations of forgetfulness that the Messenger ﷺ  ordered (us) to perform.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">source: fataawaa jeddah, tape no. 13/4<br />
<em>asaheeha translations</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: “How do we reconcile between the Prophet’s (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) prohibition of praying in the graveyard and his praying over the grave of the woman who used to sweep the mosque?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaikh al-Albaani</strong> (<em>rahimahullaah</em>):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There is no contradiction between the two<em> hadeeth</em>s, and all praise is due to Allaah. The first <em>hadeeth</em> with the prohibition of praying in the graveyard is as his  (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) saying in Saheeh Muslim: ‘Don’t sit on graves and don’t pray towards them.’[1] So the prohibition of praying in the graveyard, i.e. praying towards the graves, is because <strong>prayer must be sincerely for the Face of Allaah (<em>tabaarak wa ta’aala</em>) without any glorification for other than Allaah corrupting it or being mixed with it,  as that is one type of <em>shirk</em></strong>.[2] So if a Muslim begins to pray to Allaah while facing the grave, there is an obvious suspicion that this person at least intends – as many of the ignorant people do in this era – to seek blessing from this dead person by means of his prayer and by means of his seeking nearness to Allaah (<em>‘azza wa jal</em>) with his prayer. Thus, he has fallen into some <em>shirk</em>,  and he may go too far into it such that his situation reaches the point where it would expel him from the circle of Islaam, and refuge is sought in Allaah. This meaning is what should be considered with regard to the Messenger’s (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) prohibition of praying in the graveyard or praying towards the grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for praying over the dead person while he is in his grave, then this is something else. It has no connection with (the previous situation of) praying to Allaah – Who is alone with no partner – while facing the grave of the dead person, the intention of which is not so that Allaah forgives him, has mercy on him, as is the implied purpose when supplicating over the dead person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, <strong>praying over the dead person while he is in his grave is one thing, and praying to Allaah (<em>‘azza wa jal</em>) while facing the grave is another thing</strong>.<strong> This (the latter) is what is prohibited and that (the former) is what is allowed</strong>, so there is no contradiction between this and that.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet ﷺ said: “If you marry a woman or buy a slave, place your hand on her forehead, say ‘<i>bismillaah</i>’ and supplicate for blessing and say:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center"><big><b>اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَ</b><b>سْأَلُكَ مِنْ خَيْرِهَا وَخَيْرِ مَا جَبَلْتَهَا عَلَيْهِ وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّهَا وَشَرِّ مَا جَبَلْتَهَا عَلَيْهِ</b></big></p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center">(O Allaah, indeed I ask You for the good in her and the good characteristics that You created in her, and I seek refuge in You from the evil in her and the evil characteristics that You created in her)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you buy a camel, place your hand on top of its hump and say the same.”<a>[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This <i>hadeeth</i> has evidence that Allaah is the Creator of good and evil, contrary to those – such as the Mu`tazilah and others – who hold that evil is not from His creation تبارك وتعالى. <strong>There is nothing in Allaah’s being Creator of evil that contradicts His Perfection تعالى, rather it is from His Perfection تبارك وتعالى</strong>. Details of that are present in comprehensive volumes, one of the best being the book<i>Shifaa ul-`aleel fi l-qadhaa.i wa l-qadari wa tta`leel</i> by Ibn ul-Qayyim, so look through it if you wish.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And is this supplication legislated when buying something like a car? My answer is: yes, due to the good that is hoped from it and the evil that is feared from it.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <em>silsilat ul-hudaa wa nnoor – </em>the series of guidance and light &#8211; tape no. 697</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question #3: “Is it allowed for the woman to put on make-up if she leaves her house wearing the<em> hijaab</em>?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh al-Albaani </em>(<em>rahimahullaah</em>) answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>It is not permissible for the woman who does not wear <em>hijaab</em>, let alone who wears <em>hijaab</em>, to use the makeup of the disbeliever, the make-up of the rebellious and disobedient (to Allaah). </strong>When were you aware of some women’s adornment called by a name for which Allaah did not send down an authority: ‘make-up’? This is a word that we don’t know, not us nor your forefathers from before. Rather, it is a foreign word expressing an adornment for the rebellious and disobedient women of Europe; and our women – except those of them whom Allaah protects – unfortunately imitate decorating themselves with this adornment which the Islamic society is being affected by, namely make-up. So it is not permissible for the woman. And this reality is one of the strange ironies: in the road we see a woman wearing a decent <em>hijaab</em> (but) I don’t say the Islamically legislated <em>hijaab</em>; she ties what they call the ‘<em>ishaarb</em>’ – or <em>khimaar</em> which is the (correct) Arabic word – covering her hair, her neck and so on, but she has face powder and lipstick on. This (wearing the <em>hijaab</em>) is against this (wearing make-up): two contradictory, conflicting matters that do not go together. What is the reason (for this type of occurrence)? It is one of two things: either ignorance and heedlessness of the Islamically legislated ruling or it is due to the women’s following of the whisperings of <em>shaytaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, we firstly remind the women who suffer from this make-up. Then secondly, we remind the guardians of women such as a father or a husband or a brother, due to the fact that (the Prophet) (<em>‘alayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>) said: ‘Everyone of you is a shepherd and everyone of you is responsible for his flock. So the man is a shepherd and he is responsible for his flock-’[1] to the end of the<em>hadeeth</em>. Thus, the Arabic or general proverb states: ‘The horse is from the horseman.’ So you, the husband of the woman, it is not permissible for you to allow her to go out in this manner which puts to trial the middle-aged men, let alone the young men! And you, O man, O father, O brother, are supposed to be very jealous. Why? Because the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa aalihi wa sallam</em>) used to say: ‘<strong>A <em>duyyooth </em>will not enter Paradise</strong>.’[2] Why? Who is a <em>duyyooth</em>? He is the one who does not guard his womenfolk jealously.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="entry-title" style="text-align:center;"><strong>We should not eat while standing</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: “Is it allowed to eat while standing?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say, there is no text about the prohibition of eating while standing like there occurs the text prohibiting drinking while standing. But there is a narration from Anas bin Maalik رضي الله عنه that when he narrated to those around him in a gathering that the Prophet ﷺ prohibited drinking while standing, someone said to him: ‘What about eating (while standing)?’ He replied: ‘It is worse.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say here, we should follow this Companion because we don’t have anything with which we can contradict him. But what is the distinction between eating while standing and eating while walking? <strong>Eating while walking is allowed</strong>, because there is text clearly stating that they used to eat while walking during the time of the Prophet ﷺ. As for eating while standing, there is no text regarding it from the Prophet ﷺ, neither negative nor positive. All we have is this authentic narration from Anas bin Maalik and this is what we act upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, maybe some of you noticed in these times that it has become a fashion for the disbelievers to eat while standing although chairs are present; but they don’t sit on them out of pride. So then, the previous ruling is further strengthened. <strong>I say, we are with the narration of Anas, because Anas knew what we don’t know, and because the disbelievers nowadays and the Muslims who imitate them eat while standing, so we differ from them</strong>.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Question #6: “Is it <em>sunnah</em> to eat with three fingers generally with respect to all food or specifically with <em>thareed</em>[1] only?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh al-Albaani </em>(<em>rahimahullaah</em>) answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There isn’t, in the <em>Sunnah</em> mentioned from the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa aalihi wa sallam</em>), that which will help us to answer this question. All there is, is that the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa aalihi wa sallam</em>) used to eat with three fingers; but that which is necessary for us to say about this <em>hadeeth</em> with regard to its<em> fiqh</em> (understanding) is that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Firstly, <strong>this <em>hadeeth</em> does not mean to determine that it is not permissible for the Muslim to eat by other means like the well-known spoons today</strong>. Rather, it only means that if the Muslim eats a food that can be eaten with three fingers, then he (should) not show that he is greedy with the food such that he eats with the whole handful while he is able to eat like the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa aalihi wa sallam</em>) used to eat, with three fingers. Secondly, it is known that gravy of meat, for example, cannot be eaten with three fingers; so there it is necessary (to use) other means to eat it. And this is from the worldly affairs and not from the affairs of the religion, which the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa aalihi wa sallam</em>) was assigned that he conveys all the rulings of the religion to the people. He (<em>‘alayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>) has said (regarding) worldly affairs: ‘You are more knowledgeable about your worldly affairs than me.’”[2]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: “Is it allowed for a resident to combine Dhuhr and `Asr prayers without any excuse?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Imaam Muslim reported in his Saheeh<i> </i>the <i>hadeeth</i> from<i> </i>Ibn `Abbaas who said: ‘The Messenger of Allaah ﷺ combined Dhuhr with `Asr and Maghrib with<i></i>`Ishaa in Madeenah without being in a state of traveling or the presence of rain.’ They said: ‘Why did he do that O Abu l-`Abbaas?’<a>[1]</a> This was `Abdullaah bin `Abbaas’s <i>kunyah</i>. He replied: ‘So he would not put his <i>ummah</i> to difficulty.’’<a>[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is apparent from the <i>hadeeth</i> is that it is permissible to combine two prayers while being a resident and without the excuse of rain, as rain is a Legislated excuse that allows the combining of two prayers. And here Ibn `Abbaas says that the Prophet ﷺ combined while he was a resident and combined without the excuse of rain, and he confirmed that when he was asked the previous question ‘Why did he do that?’ by saying: ‘So he would not put his<i>ummah</i> to difficulty.’ This is the <i>hadeeth</i> and it is in Saheeh Muslim, not al-Bukhaari. The same meaning is found in al-Bukhaari: that he combined prayers in Madeenah as eight <i>rak`ah</i>s,<a>[3]</a> but it does not have this detail that Imaam Muslim reported from Ibn `Abbaas which contains this important subtlety – i.e. his <sub>رضي الله عنه</sub> statement ‘So he would not put his <i>ummah</i> to difficulty’ in answer to that question.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So some scholars of both old and recent times hold that this combining is permissible for a resident without any excuse, and I don’t consider this correct because<strong> the narrator of the <i>hadeeth</i> justifies the Messenger’s ﷺ combining without an excuse with another excuse: which is to legislate and explain to the people, as Ibn `Abbaas said, ‘So he ﷺ<sub> </sub>would not put his <i>ummah</i> to difficulty.’</strong>This means that the ruling of combining as a resident is restricted to the presence of difficulty if one were to not combine. So when there is difficulty in performing the prayers in their known appointed times, it is permissible to combine to avoid the difficulty, which Allaah عز وجل negated in the likes of His Statement: {He has not placed upon you in the religion any difficulty}.<a>[4]</a> But if there is no difficulty, it is obligatory to maintain performing the five prayers, each prayer in its time, because there is no difficulty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, I am sitting here and I hear the <i>adhaan</i> there in the nearby mosque and I am able to go out without any difficulty, then it is not permissible for me to combine. And vice versa: when I came on this trip I found that this electric elevator wasn’t working, and it is very difficult for me as you see because of a pain in my knees to go down or up by way of stairs. So some prayers went by and I didn’t go out to the mosque. But when the electric elevator was fixed and saved me the difficulty of going up and down, it became obligatory upon me to pray every prayer in the mosque because I did not find this difficulty that I had found when I just settled here. Therefore combining is only allowed to avoid difficulty; and when there is no difficulty, there is no combining. <strong>They are two inseparable matters: when there is no difficulty, there is no combining; when there is<i></i>difficulty, there is combining.</strong> And this is the best that can be said to reconcile between this authentic <i>hadeeth</i> and the <i>hadeeth</i>s clearly stating that every prayer is to be prayed in its appointed time and that it is not allowed to distract oneself from it – especially since in most circumstances, combining necessitates leaving prayer with the congregation, as I described to you my previous situation.”</p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Dogs of Hell</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Aḥmad, Ibn Mājah, and al-Ḥākim recorded a Ḥadīth from Ibn Abī Awfá, and Aḥmad and al-Ḥākim also recorded it from Abū Umāmah that the prophet ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">الخَوَارِجُ كِلابُ النَّارِ<br />
“The Khawārij are the dogs of Hell.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Khawārij are a sect of people who innovate and follow beliefs and practices foreign to Islam. They are called that (derived from the Arabic root verb: خَرَجَ &#8211; meaning to exit or rebel against) for their leaving the religion and for their rebellion against the best Muslims (prophet Muhammad’s companions).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Khawārij used to renounce ‘Uthmān (the third Caliph of Islam) for several things and they declared themselves free of him announced their disassociation from him. The origin of that was that some of the citizens of Iraq criticized the behavior of some of ‘Uthmān’s relatives, so they blamed ‘Uthmān for that. Those people were known as “Reciters” for their diligence in reciting the Quran and for their worship. Yet, they used to twist and misinterpret the Quran from its intended meanings. They used to persist on their own personal opinions, and they used to appear very strict and devout in their humility, their renouncement of worldly things, and other things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After ‘Uthmān was killed, they fought alongside ‘Alī. They believed ‘Uthmān was a disbeliever and whoever follows him. They considered ‘Alī’s leadership to be legitimate and considered anyone who fought against him to be disbelievers – those who fought him during the Battle of the Camel when their leaders were Ṭalḥah and al-Zubayr. [2] Yet when ‘Alī made a peace agreement regarding the leadership with Mu’āwiyah, they then declared ‘Alī to be a disbeliever and revolted against him, so he fought them.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;">They are the Worst of People, the Worst of All Creatures</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aḥmad, Muslim, and Ibn Mājah recorded a Ḥadīth from Abū Dharr who narrated that Allah’s messenger ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إِنَّ بَعْدِي مِنْ أُمَّتِي أَوْ سَيَكُونُ بَعْدِي مِنْ أُمَّتِي قَوْمٌ يَقْرَءُونَ الْقُرْآنَ لا يُجَاوِزُ<br />
حَلاقِيمَهُمْ يَخْرُجُونَ مِنْ الدِّينِ كَمَا يَخْرُجُ السَّهْمُ مِنْ الرَّمِيَّةِ ثُمَّ لا يَعُودُونَ<br />
فِيهِ هُمْ شَرُّ الْخَلْقِ وَالْخَلِيقَةِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There will definitely be a people after me from my nation who recite the Quran yet it will not even reach beyond their throats. They will pass through the religion as an arrow passes through a target, then they will not return back to it. They are the worst of people, the worst of all creatures.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Ṣāmit, who narrated the Ḥadīth from Abū Dharr, said, “I met Rāfi’ Ibn ‘Amr al- Ghifārī and asked him about this Ḥadīth of Abū Dharr. He said, “I (too) heard it from Allah’s messenger ( [3] ”.(صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Anti-Christ Will Emerge Among Them</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mājah recorded a Ḥadīth from Ibn ‘Umar ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُمَا ) that the messenger of Allah صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">يَنْشَأُ نَشْءٌ يَقْرَءُونَ الْقُرْآنَ لا يُجَاوِزُ تَرَاقِيَهُمْ كُلَّمَا خَرَجَ قَرْنٌ قُطِعَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There will arise a group of people who will recite the Quran but it will not reach beyond their throats. Every time a new generation of them rises, they will then disappear.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Umar said, “I heard Allah’s messenger ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) say, ‘Every time a new generation of them rises, they will then disappear,’ more than twenty times and then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">حَتَّى يَخْرُجَ فِي عِرَاضِهِمْ الدَّجَّالُ<br />
“Until the Anti-Christ finally appears among them.” [4]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;">They are the Worst of People Killed; The Best are Those Whom they Kill</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mājah recorded a Ḥadīth in which Abū Umāmah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">شَرُّ قَتْلَى قُتِلُوا تَحْتَ أَدِيمِ السَّمَاءِ وَخَيْرُ قَتِيلٍ مَنْ قَتَلُوا كِلَابُ أَهْلِ النَّارِ قَدْ<br />
كَانَ هَؤُلَاءِ مُسْلِمِينَ فَصَارُوا كُفَّارًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“(They are) the worst people killed under the sky, and the best people killed are those whom they kill. They are the dogs of Hell. These people used to be Muslims but they became disbelievers.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Abū Ghālib, one of the narrators) asked, “Abū Umāmah, is this something only you yourself are saying?” He replied, “No, rather I heard it from the messenger of Allah ( صَلَّى 5 ”.(اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Their Distinguishing Signs on the Day of Nahrawān</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Bukhārī and Muslim both recorded a Ḥadīth from Abū Sa’īd al-Khudrī ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) who said, “We were with Allah’s messenger ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) while he was distributing some wealth. Dhu al-Khuwaṣirah, a man from the Tamīm tribe, came to him and said, ‘Messenger of Allah, be fair!’ The prophet replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَيْلَكَ وَمَنْ يَعْدِلُ إِذَا لَمْ أَعْدِلْ قَدْ خِبْتَ وَخَسِرْتَ إِنْ لَمْ أَكُنْ أَعْدِلُ<br />
“Beware. And who would be fair if I was not? You would be ruined if I were not just.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Umar said, “Messenger of Allah, allow me to strike his neck.” He replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">دَعْهُ فَإِنَّ لَهُ أَصْحَابًا يَحْقِرُ أَحَدُكُمْ صَلاتَهُ مَعَ صَلاتِهِمْ وَصِيَامَهُ مَعَ صِيَامِهِمْ<br />
يَقْرَءُونَ الْقُرْآنَ لا يُجَاوِزُ تَرَاقِيَهُمْ يَمْرُقُونَ مِنْ الدِّينِ كَمَا يَمْرُقُ السَّهْمُ مِنْ<br />
الرَّمِيَّةِ يُنْظَرُ إِلَى نَصْلِهِ فَلا يُوجَدُ فِيهِ شَيْءٌ ثُمَّ يُنْظَرُ إِلَى رِصَافِهِ فَمَا يُوجَدُ فِيهِ<br />
شَيْءٌ ثُمَّ يُنْظَرُ إِلَى نَضِيِّهِ وَهُوَ قِدْحُهُ فَلا يُوجَدُ فِيهِ شَيْءٌ ثُمَّ يُنْظَرُ إِلَى قُذَذِهِ فَلا<br />
يُوجَدُ فِيهِ شَيْءٌ قَدْ سَبَقَ الْفَرْثَ وَالدَّمَ آيَتُهُمْ رَجُلٌ أَسْوَدُ إِحْدَى عَضُدَيْهِ مِثْلُ<br />
ثَدْيِ الْمَرْأَةِ أَوْ مِثْلُ الْبَضْعَةِ تَدَرْدَرُ وَيَخْرُجُونَ عَلَى حِينِ فُرْقَةٍ مِنْ النَّاسِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Leave him. He will certainly have companions (from his progeny) whom one of you would belittle his own prayer when compared to their prayer and his fasting compared to their fasting. They will recite the Quran but it will not go beyond their throats. They will pass through the religion as an arrow passes through a game animal. One could then look at the arrowhead and not see a thing remaining on it. He could look at the binding which attaches the arrowhead to the rod and not see a thing. He could look at the rod and not see a thing. He could look at the feathers and not see a thing. It would go straight through the bowels and blood. Their sign is that of a black man. One of his limbs will appear like a woman’s breast or a disfigured lump of flesh. They will emerge when the people are disunited.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abū Sa’īd said, “I testify that I indeed heard this Ḥadīth from Allah’s messenger ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ), and I testify that ‘Alī Ibn Abī Ṭālib fought them while I was with him. He instructed that we search for that man. He was found and ‘Alee was brought to him. I saw that man exactly as the prophet ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) described him.” [6]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;">They Murder the People of Islam and Ignore the People of Idol-Worship</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Bukhārī, Muslim, Abū Dāwūd, and al-Nasā`ī all recorded a Ḥadīth from Abū Sa’īd al- Khudrī ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alī ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) sent some gold to the prophet ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) so divided and distributed it among four groups: al-Aqra’ Ibn Ḥābis al-Ḥanẓalī, al-Mujāshi’ī, ‘Uyaynah Ibn Badr al-Fazārī, and Zayd al-Ṭā`ī; a man from the Nabhān tribe and ‘Alqamah Ibn ‘Ulāthah al-‘Āmirī; then a man from the Kilāb tribe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Muslims of) Quraysh and the residents of Medina became upset and said, “He gives to the noble one from Najd and leaves us?” The prophet ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ<br />
وَسَلَّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إِنَّمَا أَتَأَلَّفُهُمْ<br />
“I am only trying to unite their hearts.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then a man with sunken eyes, thick cheeks, a high forehead, a thick beard, and a shaven head came up and said, “Fear Allah, Muhammad!” He replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">مَنْ يُطِعْ اللَّهَ إِذَا عَصَيْتُ؟ أَيَأْمَنُنِي اللَّهُ عَلَى أَهْلِ الأَرْضِ فَلا تَأْمَنُونِي؟</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Who would obey Allah if I were disobedient (to Him)? Allah trusts me with regards to the people of the earth but you don’t trust me?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man then asked to kill him – I think it was Khālid Ibn al-Walīd – but the prophet صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) ) forbade him from doing so. After the man left, he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إِنَّ مِنْ ضِئْضِئِ هَذَا أَوْ فِي عَقِبِ هَذَا قَوْمًا يَقْرَءُونَ الْقُرْآنَ لا يُجَاوِزُ حَنَاجِرَهُمْ<br />
يَمْرُقُونَ مِنْ الدِّينِ مُرُوقَ السَّهْمِ مِنْ الرَّمِيَّةِ يَقْتُلُونَ أَهْلَ الإِسْلامِ وَيَدَعُونَ أَهْلَ<br />
الأَوْثَانِ لَئِنْ أَنَا أَدْرَكْتُهُمْ لأَقْتُلَنَّهُمْ قَتْلَ عَادٍ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“From the progeny of this man,” or he said, “From the offspring of this man, there will come a people who will recite the Quran but it will not go beyond their throats. They will go through the religion like a arrow going through a target. They will murder the people of Islam while ignoring the people of idol-worship. If I were to reach them (their time), I would destroy them like the people of ‘Ād were destroyed.” [7]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Their Sign is Their Shaven Heads</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Aḥmad, al-Bukhārī, and Muslim recorded a Ḥadīth from Sahl Ibn Ḥanīf who narrated that the messenger of Allah ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">يَخْرُجُ مِنَ المَشْرِقِ أَقْوَامٌ مُحَلَّقَةٌ رُءُوسُهُمْ، يَقْرَءُونَ الْقُرْآنَ بِأَلْسِنَتِهِمْ لا يَعْدُو<br />
تَرَاقِيَهُمْ، يَمْرُقُونَ مِنْ الدِّينِ كَمَا يَمْرُقُ السَّهْمُ مِنْ الرَّمِيَّةِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“A people will emerge from the East having shaven heads. They will recite the Quran with their tongues but it will not pass beyond their throats. They will pass through the religion just as an arrow passes through a target.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aḥmad and al-Bukhārī record a Ḥadīth from Abū Sa’īd al-Khudrī that Allah’s messenger صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">يَخْرُجُ نَاسٌ مِنْ قِبَلِ الْمَشْرِقِ وَيَقْرَءُونَ الْقُرْآنَ لا يُجَاوِزُ تَرَاقِيَهُمْ يَمْرُقُونَ مِنْ<br />
الدِّينِ كَمَا يَمْرُقُ السَّهْمُ مِنْ الرَّمِيَّةِ ثُمَّ لا يَعُودُونَ فِيهِ حَتَّى يَعُودَ السَّهْمُ إِلَى<br />
فُوقِهِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“People will emerge from the East who will recite the Quran but it will not go beyond their throats. They will pass through the religion as an arrow passes through a target, and they will not return to it until an arrow returns to its bow.” It was asked, “What is their distinguishing sign?” He answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">سِيمَاهُمْ التَّحْلِيقُ<br />
“Their sign is shaven heads.” [9]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">They Recite the Quran with Only Their Tongues</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Ṭabarānī recorded a Ḥadīth from ‘Uqbah Ibn ‘Āmir from Sahl Ibn Ḥanīf who narrated that Allah’s messenger ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">سَيَخْرُجُ قَوْمٌ مِنْ أُمَّتِي يَشْرَبُوْنَ القُرْآنَ كَشُرْبِهِم اللَّبَن</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There will arise a people from my nation who will drink [10] the Quran just as they drink milk.” [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many other Ḥadīth to this same effect. Some of them have been mentioned so there is no need to repeat them.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">They are Mostly People of Talk, Not Action</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abū Dāwūd, and al-Ḥākim recorded a Ḥadīth narrated by both Abū Sa’īd and Anas in which the messenger of Allah ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">سَيَكُونُ فِي أُمَّتِي اخْتِلافٌ وَفُرْقَةٌ ، قَوْمٌ يُحْسِنُونَ الْقِيلَ وَيُسِيئُونَ الْفِعْلَ ،<br />
يَقْرَءُونَ الْقُرْآنَ لا يُجَاوِزُ تَرَاقِيَهُمْ ، يَمْرُقُونَ مِنْ الدِّينِ مُرُوقَ السَّهْمِ مِنْ<br />
الرَّمِيَّةِ لا يَرْجِعُونَ حَتَّى يَرْتَدَّ عَلَى فُوقِهِ ، هُمْ شَرُّ الْخَلْقِ وَالْخَلِيقَةِ ، طُوبَى<br />
لِمَنْ قَتَلَهُمْ وَقَتَلُوهُ ، يَدْعُونَ إِلَى كِتَابِ اللَّهِ وَلَيْسُوا مِنْهُ فِي شَيْءٍ ، مَنْ قَاتَلَهُمْ<br />
كَانَ أَوْلَى بِاللَّهِ مِنْهُمْ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There will appear within my nation differences and division – people who will perfect their speech and make evil their actions. They will recite the Quran but it will not pass beyond their throats. They will pass through the religion just as an arrow passes through a target and they will not return until it (the arrow) returns back to its bow. They are the worst of people, the worst of all creatures. Tūbá (a tree in paradise, success) is for whoever kills them or they kill him. They will call to the book of Allah yet they have nothing to do with it. Whoever fights against them has more right upon Allah than they do.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The companions asked, “What is their sign?” He replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">التَّحْلِيقُ<br />
“Shaven heads.” [12]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Their Religious Actions Amaze Some People</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Bukhārī, Muslim, and Ibn Mājah recorded a Ḥadīth from Abū Sa’īd al-Khudrī ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) who said that he heard Allah’s messenger ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">يَخْرُجُ فِيكُمْ قَوْمٌ تَحْقِرُونَ صَلاتَكُمْ مَعَ صَلاتِهِمْ وَصِيَامَكُمْ مَعَ صِيَامِهِمْ<br />
وَعَمَلَكُمْ مَعَ عَمَلِهِمْ وَيَقْرَءُونَ الْقُرْآنَ لا يُجَاوِزُ حَنَاجِرَهُمْ يَمْرُقُونَ مِنْ الدِّينِ<br />
كَمَا يَمْرُقُ السَّهْمُ مِنْ الرَّمِيَّةِ يَنْظُرُ فِي النَّصْلِ فَلا يَرَى شَيْئًا وَيَنْظُرُ فِي الْقِدْحِ<br />
فَلا يَرَى شَيْئًا وَيَنْظُرُ فِي الرِّيشِ فَلا يَرَى شَيْئًا وَيَتَمَارَى فِي الْفُوقِ (هَلْ عَلَّقَ بِهِ<br />
مِنَ الدَّمِ شَيْء)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There will emerge among you people whom you would belittle your prayer when compared to their prayer, your fasting compared to their fasting, and your deeds compared to theirs. They will recite the Quran but it will not reach beyond their throats. They will pass right through the religion just as an arrow may pass right through a target (game animal). One may look at such an arrowhead and see nothing remaining. He may look at the arrow rod and see nothing remaining. He may look at the feathers and see nothing. And he may look at the end-notch (to see if anything of blood stuck to it).” [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abī ‘Āṣim recorded in “Kitāb al-Sunnah” a Ḥadīth narrated by Anas Ibn Mālik ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) in which he said: It was narrated to me that Allah’s messenger ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">يَخْرُجُ فِيْكُمْ – أَوْ يَكُوْنُ فِيْكُمْ – قَوْمٌ يَتَعَبَّدُوْنَ وَيَتَدَيَّنُوْنَ حَتَّى يُعْجِبُوْكُمْ<br />
وَتُعْجِبُهُمْ أًنْفُسُهُمْ يَمْرُقُونَ مِنْ الدِّينِ كَمَا يَمْرُقُ السَّهْمُ مِنْ الرَّمِيَّةِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There will emerge among you – or (he said) there will be among you &#8211; a people who will worship and be religious so much that they will amaze you and amaze themselves. They will pass right through the religion just as an arrow may pass right through a target.” [14]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;">They are the Māriqūn (They Pass Right through the Religion)</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Bazzār recorded, as did Ibn Abī ‘Āṣim in “Kitāb al-Sunnah,” a narration that ‘Alī Ibn Abī Ṭālib ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) said on the Day of al-Nahrawān:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">أُمِرْتُ بِقِتَالِ المَارِقِيْنَ، وَهَؤُلاءِ المَارِقُوْنَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I have been ordered to fight the Māriqūn, and these people are the Māriqūn.” [15]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Closer of the Two Parties to the Truth Will Defeat Them</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim and Abū Dāwūd recorded a Ḥadīth from Abū Sa’īd al-Khudrī ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) who said that the messenger of Allah ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">تَمْرُقُ مَارِقَةٌ عِنْدَ فِرْقَةٍ مِنَ المُسْلِمِيْنَ، يَقْتُلُهَا أَوْلَى الطَّائِفَتَيْنِ بِالْحَقِّ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“A group of Māriqah will renegade when the Muslims will split (the party of ‘Alī and that of Muā’wiyah); the closer of the two parties to the truth will kill them (the Māriqah).” [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in a narration recorded by Muslim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">تَكُوْنَ فِي أُمَّتِي فِرْقَتَانِ، فَتَخْرُجٌ مِنْ بَيْنِهِمَا مَارِقَةٌ، يَلِي قَتْلَهُمْ أَوْلاهُمْ بِالْحَقِّ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There will be in my nation two parties. Between them, a group of Māriqah will emerge. The closer of the two parties to the truth will kill them.” [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Nawawī said in his explanation of Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“These narrations are explicit in that ‘Alī ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) was correct, and the other party, the companions of Muā’wiyah ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ), were mistaken in their interpretations. And in these narrations, it is clear that both parties still remained believers; they did not, because of their fighting one another, leave their faith nor are they considered wicked.” [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Tamiyyah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And we know that ‘Alī Ibn Abī Ṭālib ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) was better and closer to the truth than Muā’wiyah and those who fought against him with Muā’wiyah. This is confirmed by the narration in Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī and Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim that Abū Sa’īd al-Khudrī ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) said that the prophet ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">تَمْرُقُ مَارِقَةٌ عِنْدَ فِرْقَةٍ مِنَ المُسْلِمِيْنَ، يَقْتُلُهَا أَوْلَى الطَّائِفَتَيْنِ بِالْحَقِّ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“A group of Māriqah will renegade when the Muslims will split; the closer of the two parties to the truth will kill them (the Māriqah).” [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And in this Ḥadīth, there is evidence that both parties had something of truth with it, but that ‘Alī ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) was closer to the truth.” [20]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Encouragement of Allah’s Messenger صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم to Defeat them &amp; the Reward for Doing So</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Bukhārī, Muslim, and Abū Dāwūd recorded a narration in which ‘Alī ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“When I speak to you, narrating to you something that Allah’s messenger ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) said, I would rather fall from the sky than to lie upon him. And if speak to you about what is happening between you and I, then surely in war there may be misleading strategy. Yet, I heard the messenger of Allah ( (صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">يَأْتِي فِي آخِرِ الزَّمَانِ قَوْمٌ حُدَثَاءُ الأَسْنَانِ، سُفَهَاءُ الأَحْلامِ، يَقُوْلُوْنَ مِنْ قَوْلِ خَيْرِ<br />
البَرِيَّةِ، يَمْرُقُوْنَ مِنَ الإِسْلامِ كَمَا يَمْرُق السَّهْمُ مِنَ الرَّمِيَّةِ، لا يُجَاوِزُ إِيْمَانُهُم<br />
حَنَاجِرَهُم، فَأَيْنَمَا لَقِيْتُمُوْهُم فَاقْتُلُوْهُم، فَإِنَّ قَتْلَهُمْ أَجْرٌ لِمَنْ قَتَلَهُم يَوْمَ القِيَامَةِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There will come towards the end of time a people who will be young in age, having reckless and deficient intellects. They will speak with the statements of the best of creation, yet they will pass through Islam just as an arrow passes through a target. Their faith will not even reach beyond their throats. Wherever you find them, kill them, for whoever kills them will have a reward on the Day of Resurrection. [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Muslim also narrated that Salamah Ibn Kuhīl said: Zayd Ibn Wahb al-Juhanī told me that he was among the army under the command of ‘Alī ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) that went out to fight the Khawārij. ‘Alī ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh people, indeed I heard Allah’s messenger ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">يَخْرُجُ قَوْمٌ مِنْ أُمَّتِي يَقْرَءُوْنَ القُرْآنَ، لَيْسَ قِرَاءَتُكُم إِلَى قِرَاءَتِهِم بِشَيْءٍ، وَلا<br />
صَلاتُكُم إِلَى صَلاتِهِم بِشَيْءٍ، وَلاصِيَامُكُم إِلَى صِيَامِهِم بِشَيْءٍ، يَقْرَءُوْنَ القَرْآنَ،<br />
يَحْسِبُوْنَ أَنَّهُ لَهُم وَهُوَ عَلَيْهٍم، لاتُجَاوِزُ صَلاتُهُم تَرَاقِيَهُم، يَمْرُقُوْنَ مِنَ الإِسْلامِ<br />
كَمَا يَمْرُقُ السَّهْمُ مِنَ الرَّمِيَّةِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There will arise a people from my nation, those who will recite the Quran; your recitation is nothing (insignificant) compared to theirs, your prayer is nothing compared to theirs, and your fasting is nothing compared to theirs. They recite the Quran believing it is evidence in support of them yet it is actually against them. Their prayers will not even go beyond their throats. They will pass through and out of Islam just as an arrow passes through a target.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(‘Alī continued:) “If the army that is to encounter them were to know what (rewards) have been assured to them upon the tongue of their prophet, then they would almost rely solely upon that deed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their (the Khawārij) distinctive mark is that there will be among them a man with one upper-arm having no forearm. Its end will resemble a breast (of a woman) and there will be white hair upon it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You will march towards Muā’wiyah and the people of al-Shām, leaving them (the Khawārij) behind with your children and wealth! By Allah, I hope that these are those people (that the prophet informed of), for they have shed blood that was to be held sacred and have raided and attacked people. So go in the name of Allah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Salamah Ibn Kuhīl said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zayd Ibn Wahb was with me at every point until we came to the bridge. That day, ‘Abdullah Ibn Wahb al-Rāsibī was at the head of the Khawārij. He (‘Abdullah) said to his army, “Throw your spears and draw your swords from their sheaths, for I fear that they will confront you in the way they did on the Day of Ḥarūrā.” So they went back, let loose their spears and drew their swords. The people fought against them with spears, stabbing them and killing them one after another. And no one was killed that day (from ‘Alī’s army) except two men. ‘Alī ( (رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Search among them (the casualties) for the deformed one.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the people searched but did not find him. ‘Alī then stood and began searching himself until he came to a group of people who had been killed. He said: “Search everyone of these to the last (of them).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they found him at the bottom, on the ground. ‘Alī said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allah is the greatest! Allah told the truth and His messenger conveyed it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abīdah al-Salmānī stood before him and asked, “Oh Chief of the Believers, by Allah other than whom there is no god, did you in fact here this Ḥadīth from Allah’s messenger ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم )?” He replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Yes, by Allah other than whom there is no god.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (‘Abīdah) asked him (‘Alī) to swear three times and he did swear. 22 al-Nawawī said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“‘Abīdah al-Salmānī, may Allah have mercy on him, asked ‘Alī to swear three times. He only asked him to swear for the others present to hear and so that it would be emphasized and that it be made known the miracle that Allah’s messenger ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) informed about. And he wanted to make it wellknown to the people that ‘Alī and his companions were the closer of the two parties to the truth and that he was correct in fighting them.” [23]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;">They Consider Their Rebellion to be a Form of Migration for the Sake of Allah</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aḥmad recrded a narration as did Ibn Abī ‘Āṣim recorded in “Kitāb al-Sunnah” – and the<br />
wording is his – that Abī Ḥafṣ said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I heard from ‘Abdullah Ibn Abī Awfá when they were fighting the Khawārij. He used to have a young man (that served him, helped him, etc.) but he joined the Khawārij. So we called to him (the young man), ‘Oh Fayrūz! Fayrūz, this is ‘Abdullah Ibn Abī Awfá.’ He replied, ‘A great man if he only made Hijrah (migration)!’ ‘Abdullah asked, ‘What is Allah’s enemy saying?’ He was told what he said. So he (‘Abdullah) said, ‘A Hijrah after the Hijrah I made with the messenger of Allah ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم )? I surely heard Allah’s messenger ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">طُوْبَى لِمَنْ قَتَلَهُمْ وَقَتَلُوْهُ<br />
Tūbá (a tree in Paradise, success) is for he who kills them or they kill him. [24]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;">‘Alī’s Attempt to Return Them to the Truth Before Fighting Them</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jarīr recorded in his “al-Tārīkh” that Ismā`īl Ibn Samī’ al-Ḥanafī narrated that Abū Zarīr said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the issue of al-Taḥkīm (before ‘Alī’s battle with the Khawārij) took place, ‘Alī returned from Ṣiffīn and those who split from him (the Khawārij) also returned. When they reached the river, they established themselves there. ‘Alī entered Kufa (in Iraq) along with the people and they (the Khawārij) were at Ḥarūrā. ‘Alī then sent ‘Abdullah Ibn ‘Abbās to them but he returned without accomplishing much. So, ‘Alī went out to them and spoke to them until he and they were pleased and mutually content. They all then entered Kufa and a man came to him (‘Alī) and said, “The people are saying that you returned back from your disbelief because of them.” So, he addressed the people after the noon prayer and mentioned the affair. They began criticizing him and gathered near the mosque, saying, “There is no rule except the rule of Allah!” Then a man faced him (‘Alī) and recited:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَلَقَدْ أُوحِيَ إِلَيْكَ وَإِلَى الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِكَ لَئِنْ أَشْرَكْتَ لَيَحْبَطَنَّ عَمَلُكَ <br />
 وَلَتَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it was already revealed to you and to those before you that if you should associate (anything) with Allah, your work would surely become worthless, and you would surely be among the losers. [al-Zumar, 39:65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alī replied, reciting:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> فَاصْبِرْ إِنَّ وَعْدَ اللَّهِ حَقٌّ وَلا يَسْتَخِفَّنَّكَ الَّذِينَ لا يُوقِنُونَ </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So be patient. Indeed, the promise of Allah is true. And do not let those who have no certain faith worry you. [al-Rūm, 30:60] [25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim and al-Nasā`ī recorded a narration in “Khaṣā`iṣ ‘Alī رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ” in which ‘Ubayd Allah Ibn Abī Rāfi’ said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, the Ḥarūriyyah, before they rebelled, they were with ‘Alī ( .(رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ Then they began saying, “There is no rule except the rule of Allah!” ‘Alī said: “A word of truth, but intended therewith falsehood. Indeed, Allah’s messenger صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) ) described a people and I certainly recognize their description within these people. They speak the truth with their tongues, but it does not reach beyond here (and he pointed to his throat) from them. They are form the most hated to Allah of His creation. Among them will be a black man with one arm that will resemble a sheep’s teat or a breast.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, after ‘Alī Ibn Abī Ṭālib ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) killed them, he said, “Search (for the deformed man).” They searched but found nothing. He then said, “Return (and search again) for by Allah, I did not lie nor was I lied to.” He repeated this two or three times. They then found him among the ruined remains and brought him in front of ‘Alī.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ubayd Allah (the narrator) then said, “I was present at that time among them and heard ‘Alī’s statements about them.” [26]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 1771 – From Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was brought some milk that was blended with water and on his right was a Bedouin and on his left was Abu Bakr, so he drank from it then he gave it to the Bedouin and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘On the right on the right.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration: ‘those on the right, those on the right, you should give it on the right hand side.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 1771</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawood]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘In this hadeeth, the one who was serving the drinks began with the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>because the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>was the one who requested a drink. Therefore, it is not correct to use this hadeeth as an evidence to prove that the Sunnah is to essentially begin with the eldest of the people as is widespread nowadays.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can this be the case when the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>himself did not do this, on the contrary the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>gave the drink to the Bedouin who was on his right hand side and not to Abu Bakr who was on his left hand side, then the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>explained by saying: ‘On the right hand side then the next one after him.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666699;">From the <em>Manhaj</em> of the <em>Muhaddith</em>, Shaykh, <em>Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Nasiruddeen al-Albaani </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Concerning Boycotting the People of <em>Bida’<br />
</em>Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part One</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>The Issue of giving Advice before Spreading a Refutation</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘What branches off from this[previous question: mentioning the good deeds of an individual while refuting him] is the statement of some of the people or more correctly should I say, the condition set by some of the people who say that in the case of refutations it’s necessary before it being printed, that a copy is sent to the one being refuted so that they can look into it.  They say that this is from the <em>Manhaj</em> of the Salaf?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This is not a condition, however if it’s easy to do, and it is hoped from this practice to bring that person closer without making the case well-known between the people, then there is no doubt that this matter is good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for firstly making it a condition, and then secondly making it a general condition then this is not at all from wisdom in any circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people, as you all know, are of different natures, like the natures of gold and silver.  So the one whom you know from him that he is with us on the path and methodology and that he would accept the advice, wherein you can at least write to him without making his mistake public as you see it, then this is good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, this is not a condition, even if this was a condition it’s not a possible matter, where can you get that person’s address? How can you contact him? Then, will you get a response from him or not? These are matters which are absolutely speculative.. . . . implementing this condition is very difficult, that is why this point is not conditional.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from the cassette entitled: ‘al-Muwwazanaat Fee Naqd’ Side A from the ‘Silsilah al-Huda wa Noor’ No.638]</p>
<h2 id="jp-post-flair" class="sharedaddy sd-like-enabled" style="text-align:justify;"> Part Two</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Making (Hajr) Boycotting the Ahl-ul-Bida’</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Questioner: Regarding what is connected to boycotting the <em>Mubtadi’</em> (person of<em>Bida’</em>) O Shaykh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh: Go ahead.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner: What appears from what I heard is that you have a regard for the benefit of the <em>Mubtadi’</em> himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh: Yes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner: And you do not reject the principle of boycotting?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh: I do not deny the principle of <em>Hajr</em>, this is obligatory, this <em>Hajr</em> is. .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner: O Shaykh as you notice we see the opinion of the impermissibility of the<em>Hajr</em> of the <em>Mubtadi’</em> – we take into consideration the benefit for this <em>Mubtadi’</em>.  Do we not see the general benefit for those who might become misguided due his effecting them, then there’s another thing…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh: Leave the other issue until we’ve looked into the first issue.  This issue in reality my brother, from a practical view needs precise knowledge and precise practical action, so just now you gave an example of a scholar who mixes with a <em>Mubtadi’</em> and the general people think that there is good in this <em>Mubtadi’</em>, do you view this scholar as one who flatters people?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner: No.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh: Okay, so if you view the opposite of this, as I hoped then it is possible for me to say, that you hold the opinion, that this scholar criticizes them for this <em>Bida’</em>[they practice], he advises them, and he admonishes them.  So if this is the case, then from where will the danger come to the general people when they hear him, when he advises them and reminds them etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner: Yes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh: So this danger which you notice and indicate towards is regarding the one who flatters people and not regarding the one who criticizes the <em>Bida’</em>, this is also better, so there is a difference between one scholar and another scholar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner: May Allaah reward you with good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh: I mean, in other words, the one who goes along with them and remains quiet about their <em>Bida’</em> and their misguidance and is over-looking, then we criticize this and it is necessary to make it clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from sahab.net/forums/showthread.php?t=363847]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part Three</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Is it permissible to defame a companion of Bida’ or to speak against him and criticize him?</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of <em>Bida’</em> are of two kinds:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Either he conceals it to himself – or he is well known amongst the people. As for the first instance then there is no need to make it well know, because his misguidance is limited to his own self.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the other type then it is necessary to defame him and warn against him, so that the people who live amongst him are not deceived by him; And this is not backbiting at all – like some of the obstinate ones presume – and the hadeeth Of Backbiting: ‘you mentioning about your brother that which he dislikes to be mentioned’  this hadeeth is from those that are general and which is specific.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have mentioned to you the saying of some of the Scholars in two lines of poetry, which gathers the type of backbiting which is exempted from being <em>Haram</em>, so they say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">القدح ليس بغيبةٍ في ستةٍ ……….متظلم ومعرِّفٍ ومحذرٍ<br />
ومجاهر فِسقاً ومستفتٍ ومـن…… طلب الإعانة في إزالة منكر</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Defamation is not backbiting regarding six types of people**</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The oppressed and for <em>recognition</em> and the one warned against***</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who openly sins and the one who necessitates a verdict***</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who seeks aid in removing an evil***</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Mutathalumin : being oppressed – Mua’arafin: recognition – Muhadeerin: Warning against Mujahir fisqan : One who openly sins – Mustaftin : Inquiring a fatwaa</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Istee’ana fee Ezzalatin Munkarin : seeking assistance in changing the evil</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So defaming the <em>Mubtadi’</em> enters into this definition and it also enters into warning against him; this is why the Scholars of hadeeth –May Allaah reward them with goodness-  are agreed upon characterizing many of the narrators of hadeeth with what they had innovated into the <em>Deen</em>. The scholars of hadeeth mention all of this due to them standing up with the obligation of clarifying it for the people; So that it would be known who is the strong narrator and his ‘<em>Aqeedah</em> is accepted. The narrator who is a<em>Mubtadi’</em> is abandoned along with his deviated ‘<em>Aqeedah</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘Why do you ask?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man replied: ‘Indeed I heard in this cloud from which is this rain; ‘water so and so’s garden’ with your name, so what is it that you do with it once you have cultivated the land?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘If you say that is the case, then indeed what I do is divide it into three pats, I make one third for me and my family, a third I return back into the garden and a third I place for the impoverished, the needy and the wayfarer.’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 1095 – From Abu Rashid al-Hubraani who said: Abu Umama al-Bahili took me by the hand and said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> took me by my hand and said to me: ‘O Abu Umama! Indeed from the believers are those who soften (with love) their hearts towards me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ahmad]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the meaning of ‘soften their hearts towards me’ is that they are gentle and incline towards me with love and affection and Allaah knows best.  And this cannot be achieved except with <em>Ikhlaas</em> (sincerity) and following the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> more than any other human being, because Allaah Ta’ala singled that out as an evidence to prove that a person really loves Allaah –Azza wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said: &lt;&lt;Say (O Muhammad): ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you and forgive you of your sins.&gt;&gt; [Aal’Imraan:31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it not about time that those who claim to love the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> in their speech and their <em>an-Nasheed</em> (songs), that they return to adhere to the true love which will lead to the love of Allaah Ta’ala, so that they will not be from those whom, the poet said:<br />
تعصي الإله َ وأنتَ تـُظهرُ حـُـبـَّه ُ *** هذا لـَعـَمْرُكَ في القياس ِ بديع ُ<br />
لو كانَ حـُبـُّكَ صادقا ً لأطعتـــَـــه ُ *** إنَّ المـُحـِبَّ لمنْ يُحـِبُّ مـُطيع ُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You disobey your Lord and present your love *** I swear that this action is innovative</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If your love was truthful you would have obeyed Him *** Indeed the one who loves is obedient to the one whom he loves</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center">By the  <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Why the ascription of Salafeeyah? Is it a call to <em>Hizbeeyah</em>?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani (d.1420A.H) <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Why the ascription of Salafeeyah? Is it a call to <em>Hizbeeyah</em>, or a sect, or <em>Madhab</em>, or is it a new group in Islaam?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the word ‘<em>as-Salaf</em>’ is well known in the Arabic language, and in the <em>Sharia’</em>, and what is important to us here is the research from the <em>Sharia’</em> point of view.  It has been authentically reported from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> that he said to Sayyidah Fatima <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> during the illness from which he died:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">فاتقي الله واصبري، ونعم السلف أنا لك</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Fear Allaah and be patient, for indeed I am a blessed <em>Salaf</em> (Predecessor) for you.[1]’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars used this word ‘<em>as-Salaf</em>’ a lot, and it has been used so much more than can be enumerated, it is sufficient for us to use one example, and that is what we need to fight against <em>Bida’</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">كل خير في اتباع من سلف** وكل شر في ابتداع من خلف</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Every good is in the following of the Salaf * and every evil is in the innovations of the Khalaf</strong><strong>[2]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there are those who claim to have knowledge who reject this ascription, claiming that it does not have any foundation, so they say: it is not allowed for a Muslim to say I am a Salafi.  Its as if they say: it is not allowed for a Muslim to say: I follow the Salaf as-Salih of what they are upon from ‘<em>Aqeedah</em>, worship and manners!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that this type of rejection – if this is what they mean – necessitates being free from the correct Islaam which our Salaf as-Salih were upon, and at the head of them is the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>as is indicated in the <em>Mutawatir</em>hadeeth which is in Bukhari, Muslim and in other books, from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">خير الناس قرني، ثم الذين يلونهم ، ثم الذين يلونهم</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The best people are my generation then those who will come after them and then those after them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore it is not allowed for the Muslim to free himself from the ascription to the Salaf as-Salih, whereas if a Muslim freed himself from any other ascription, then it would not be possible for anyone from the people of knowledge to ascribe them to <em>Kufr</em>(disbelief) or <em>Fasooq</em> (openly sinning).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this person who rejects this ascription, don’t you see that he himself ascribes to a<em>Madhab</em> from the <em>Madhahib</em> (plural: <em>Madhab</em>)?! Whether this <em>Madhab</em> was connected to ‘<em>Aqeedah</em> or with <em>Fiqh</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he is either an <em>Ashari</em> or a <em>Matroodi</em>, or either he is from the <em>Ahl-ul-Hadeeth</em>, or<em>Hanafi</em>, or <em>Shafia’i</em>, or <em>Maliki</em>, or <em>Hanbali</em> from those who enter into the title of <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jammah</em>. Even though he who ascribes to the <em>Ashari</em> <em>Madhab</em> or to the four<em>Madhahib</em> then he ascribes to people who are without doubt not infallible, even though there from those scholars who are correct, I wish he had only rejected the likes of these ascriptions to individuals not infallible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who ascribes to the Salaf as-Salih, then he ascribes to that which is in general infallible, and indeed the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> mentioned that from the signs of the <em>Firqat an-Najeeha</em> (the saved sect) that they adhere to that which the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> was upon and what the Companions were upon, so who ever adhered to it is with certainty upon guidance from his Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Without doubt the clear, manifest, distinguished, evident evidence of this title is to say: I am a Muslim upon the Book and the Sunnah and upon the methodology of our Salaf as-Salih, and that is to summarize it by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">أنا سلفي</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">I am a Salafi.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">Taken from Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> by The <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Naasiruddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2595 – From Jabir bin Abdullaah who said that the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>  passed by a man who kept turning over on his back and front out of severe hunger, so the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> asked the people about him.  They said: ‘He is fasting O Prophet of Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> ordered him to break his fast, and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Is it not sufficient that you are in the path of Allaah and with the Messenger of Allaah<em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> that you have to fast.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Ahmad, and its <em>Isnaad</em> is <em>Saheeh</em> upon the conditions of Imam Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘In this hadeeth is a clear evidence that it is not allowed to fast while travelling if it is harmful to the person fasting, and the saying of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> applies to him: ‘It is not from righteousness to fast while travelling.’ Or the Messenger’s <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> saying: ‘Those are the disobedient ones.’ As for anyone else then he has the choice, if he wants he can fast and if he wants he can break his fast. This is a summary of what the hadeeth in this issue  intended, and there is no contradiction between the Ahadeeth, and all praise belongs to Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ vol.6/1 – No. 2595]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani commented on another hadeeth in ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2884 – The hadeeth of Hamzah bin ‘Amr al-Aslami <em>-Radi Allaahu anhu-</em> when he asked the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> about fasting whilst travelling and the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whichever of those is easier for you then do it. i.e. not fasting in Ramadan or fasting while travelling.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Tamam in ‘al-Fawaid’ and its <em>Isnaad</em> is <em>Saheeh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I brought the research of this wording here, firstly to reference this hadeeth to its source, and secondly to include the reason as to why the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> allowed this and let the traveler have the choice of fasting or breaking the fast, and that is the explanation of this issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People are completely different as is witnessed and well known from their different capabilities and their different natures (i.e. Physically and in terms of <em>Taqwa</em>) so for some people it is easier to fast along with the people and not make up for it, when they have finished fasting. And others differ so they do not fast because of the allowance not to, and then they make up the fasts later.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah send His prayers upon the unlettered Prophet to whom it was revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Allaah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you &gt;&gt; [Baqarah: 185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ vol.6/2 – No. 2884]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">Compiled &amp; Translated  by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn Abbas who said the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> used to seek refuge for al-Hassan and al-Hussein, he would say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">‫أعوذ بكلمات الله التامة من كل شيطان وهامة ، ومن كل عين لامة</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I seek refuge for you two with Allaah’s perfect words from every Shaytaan (devil) and poisonous creature and every evil eye.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said that this is how Ibrahim used to seek refuge for Ishaaq and Ismaeel.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari &amp; Tirmidhi with the extra wording, authenticated by Albaani]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>An Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul Ulaa AbdurRahmaan al-Mubarakfooree <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Allaah’s words’:     ‘It has been said that they are the Qur’aan and it has also been said they are Allaah’s names.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Perfect’:               ‘Al-Jazari said: ‘Indeed Allaah’s speech has been described as being Perfect, because it is not permissible for any of His speech to have deficiency or fault like there is in the speech of people.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It has been said that the meaning of ‘Perfect’ here is that it benefits the one seeking refuge with these ‘Perfect words’, and protect him from illnesses and this would be sufficient for him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Poisonous creature’:        ‘Every type of creature that kills with poison. And it is possible that it could mean any crawling animal even if it does not kill, like insects.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Evil eye’:              ‘From every evil type of affliction from the eye.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Tuhfahtul Ahawadhi’ an explanation of Sunan at-Tirmidhi]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>How to Seek Refuge from the Evil Eye for Children</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’  </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani <em>-Rahimullaah-</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani was asked over the phone:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Phone rings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:       yes!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Caller:                  <em>Aslaamu alaykum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:       <em>Wa alaykum as-Salaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Caller:         O Shaykh regarding ‘I seek refuge for you two with Allaah’s perfect words from every Shaytaan (devil) and poisonous creature and every evil eye.’ Is this said three consecutive times or just once?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:       No, it is mentioned once, however if it appears to the one saying this <em>Dua’</em>that he needs to repeat it without specifying three times, then there is no problem with that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Caller:         and should he place his hand on the head of the one sought refuge for?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:       Yes, yes!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Caller:         Even in congregation, if it is a group of children together, how can he place his hand upon all of them?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:       He should place his two hands on two of the children, then repeat this on the rest of the children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Caller:         Right hand and left hand, with both hands?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:       Yes, yes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Caller:                  Regarding the hadeeth that the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">would not sleep until he recited <em>Soorah</em> Mulk, al – Isra, Zumar, and Sajdah, is this when he lies down on his bed at night, or before he lies down?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:       What is important is that he recites before he falls asleep, whether it is whilst he is sitting or lying then it is up to him’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">An Explanation By Muhammad bin Umar Bazmool</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> of the book  ‘<em>Sifat</em> <em>as-Salah</em>’ By <em>Shaykh Muhadith Nasir as-Sunnah </em>Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> Translated by Umm Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani Wrote:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">The Imam Saying <em>Ameen</em> Aloud After Reciting <em>Fatiha</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Messenger of Allaah  had completed his recitation of <em>Surah</em> Fatiha he would say: ‘<em>Ameen</em>’ raising his voice and he would elongate it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would command those praying behind him to say <em>Ameen</em> loudly just after the Imam said it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet  would say: ‘If the Imam recites: <strong>&lt;&lt;</strong> not of those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray. <strong>&gt;&gt; </strong> then say: ‘<em>Ameen</em>, for verily the Angels say<em>Ameen</em> and verily the Imam says <em>Ameen</em>,’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in other wording: ‘If the Imam says <em>Ameen</em> then say <em>Ameen</em>, whoever says it and it coincides with the <em>Ameen</em> of the Angels, (and in other wording if one of you says<em>Ameen</em> in his prayer and it coincides with the other) all his previous sins will be forgiven.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another Hadeeth: ‘Say <em>Ameen</em> and Allah will love you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Messenger of Allaah  also said: ‘The Jews do not envy you about anything more than they envy you of saying <em>Salaamu</em> <em>alaykum</em> (salutations) to each other and saying <em>Ameen</em> behind the Imam’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">______________________</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad bin Umar Bazmool explained:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This chapter of saying <em>Ameen</em> has a few issues, which will be discussed below.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The linguistic meaning of ‘<em>Ameen’</em> is ‘O Allaah respond / answer.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has also been said it means ‘<em>Subhanaka</em> <em>Ya</em> <em>Allaah’</em> (How far you are from imperfection) and it has been said it means ‘O Allaah’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when one who prays behind the Imam hears the Imam recite <em>Surah</em> Fatiha and reaches the part that says: <strong>&lt;&lt;</strong> not of those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray. <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong>  Then it is the Sunnah for him to say <em>Ameen</em> after this, as the Messenger of Allaah would say. This is due to the general statement of the saying of the Prophet : ‘Pray as you have seen me praying.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying of <em>Ameen</em> is Sunnah for the Imam and those following him. It is the Sunnah for the Imam in those prayers that are audible and he says <em>Ameen</em> audibly/ with a raised voice after he recites Surah Fatiha. It is also the Sunnah for those praying behind him to say <em>Ameen</em> after he finishes reciting <strong>&lt;&lt;</strong> not of those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray. <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars -may Allaah have mercy upon them- have mentioned that this is the point at which the saying of the word ‘<em>Ameen’</em> of both the Imam and those following him coincide.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Shaykh Al-Albaani -may Allaah have mercy on him- during his visit to the Kingdom in the year 1410 A.H. regarding the matter of the Imam saying <em>Ameen</em> and those who follow him, and the Shaykh -may Allaah have mercy on him- said that it is upon those who are following the prayer to say <em>Ameen</em> just after the Imam, to the count of one or two letters, as the saying of <em>Ameen</em> will then be after the Imam and they will join in saying some of the letters of the word. Therefore, if the Imam says<em>Ameen</em> then those following say it in order for some of the letters of the word to coincide with one another, and at the same time the Imam will precede in one or two letters of the word. Thus in this manner the Imam saying <em>Ameen</em> and the followers will coincide in some of the letters and the end result will be that the saying of <em>Ameen</em> by the follower will be just after the <em>Ameen</em> of the Imam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The virtue of saying ‘<em>Ameen’</em>. The author -may Allaah have mercy on him- mentions from the Messenger , that if the Imam says <em>Ameen</em> and the Angels say <em>Ameen</em> and those following say <em>Ameen</em>, and they coincide with one another Allaah will forgive them all their previous sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another virtue is that Allaah &#8211;<em>Subhanahu</em> <em>wa</em> <em>Ta’ala</em>&#8211; answers your saying of the word ‘<em>Ameen’</em> because it means ‘O Allaah answer \ respond.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third virtue is what the Messenger  mentioned in his saying: ‘The Jews do not envy you about anything more than they envy you of saying <em>Salaamu</em> <em>alaykum</em> (salutations) to each other and saying <em>Ameen</em> behind the Imam.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why it is incumbent upon us, to ensure we say <em>Ameen</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourthly</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to what is mentioned with regard to the coinciding of saying <em>Ameen</em> of the Imam and those following him in prayer necessitates that those following are attentive in their prayer whilst following the Imam and the Imam’s recitation to ensure that he does not miss saying <em>Ameen</em> in the correct place. If he misses saying <em>Ameen</em> he loses great reward and recompense, which is mentioned in this hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this summons the presence of the heart and humility of the soul and the body whilst in prayer behind the Imam, and Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifthly</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I would like to bring to attention that which is relevant to this discussion of saying ‘<em>Ameen’</em>, which is, once one is aware of the meaning of the word ‘<em>Ameen’</em>, (O Allaah answer or O Allaah). Some people, whilst the Imam reads <em>Qunoot</em> and Exalts Allaah, Praises Him –<em>Subhanahu</em> <em>wa</em> <em>Ta’ala</em>&#8211; and glorifies Him, stop saying ‘<em>Ameen’</em>, replacing it by saying ‘<em>Subhanak’</em> (Glory be to You) or similar words. This clearly opposes the Sunnah as the word ‘<em>Ameen’</em> is sufficient for all supplication regardless of whether it is<em>Dua’</em> praising Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> or <em>Dua’</em> of asking from Him or declaring Allaah’s Majesty and Greatness.</p>

<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 – 1175 – From Hudayfah that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Do not say: whatever Allaah wills and whatever so and so wills, but you should say: whatever Allaah wills then whatever so and so wills.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 137</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- 1176 – From Sahl bin Haneef that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>narrated to him, where he said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said to me:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘You are my messenger to Makkah; so convey my <em>Salam</em> to them, and tell them: that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> orders you with three things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Do not swear by your fathers –[and in another narration: with other than Allaah]– and if you relieve yourselves then do not face the <em>Qiblah</em> nor face your back to it, and do not clean yourselves using bones, nor with dung.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 3953</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – 1178 – From Abdullaah bin Buraidah from his father who said the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever swears by a trust then he is not from us, and whoever causes a wife to hate her husband or a slave to hate his master then he is not from us.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 325</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – 1180 – From Abu Umamah bin Thalabah who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah<em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever acquires wealth of a Muslim by swearing a false oath; then it will be a black speck on his heart, and nothing will change it until the Day of Judgement.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 3364</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 – 1183 – From Abdullaah bin ‘Amr bin al-Aaas: that the wife of Abu Dharr came on (al-Qaswa, the camel) the ride of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>, until the camel knelt down at the Masjid, and she said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah! I took an oath that if Allaah saved me/delivered me upon this, then I would eat from its liver and its hump!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘What a wretched reward you have given it, this is not an oath, indeed an oath is what is done desiring the Face of Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said this about the wife of Abu Dharr who had taken an oath, that if she was saved from the kuffar upon the ride of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> then she would slaughter it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No.3309</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – 1184 – From Thabit bin ad-Dhihaak who said: a man at the time of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> took an oath that he would slaughter an animal at<em>Boowana</em> (a certain place), when the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>came he said: I have taken an oath that I would slaughter at <em>Boowana</em>, so the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Was there an idol from the idols of <em>Jahileeyah</em> worshipped there?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘No.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger asked: ‘Was there an <em>Eid</em> (a day of celebration) from the days of celebration at that place?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘No.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Fulfil your oath, indeed an oath is not fulfilled in sinning against Allaah, nor in breaking relations, nor in that which the son of Adam does not possess.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2872</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 – 1185 – From Ibn Abbas <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> from the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There are two types of vows, firstly, that which was for Allaah, so its expiation is fulfilling it. Secondly that which was for Shaytaan then there is no fulfilment of that but the expiation is the penalty of the unfulfilled vow.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 479</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8 – 1186 – From Abu Hurairah from the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Allaah -Azza wa Jal- said: Making a vow does not earn anything for the son of Adam except that which I have destined for him.  Rather, making a vow is something which makes a miserly person give.  He comes to Me with that which he would not offer due to his miserliness.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 478</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9 – 1187 – From Uqbah bin ‘Aamir al-Jahnee who said: my sister made an oath that she would walk to the <em>Ka’aba</em> barefooted, and with her head uncovered, when the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> saw her he asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘What is wrong with her?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They answered that she took an oath that she would walk to the <em>Ka’aba</em> barefooted, and with her head uncovered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Order her to get a ride, and cover herself, perform the <em>Hajj</em> and slaughter a sacrificial animal.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2930</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10 – From Ibn Abbas: that a man came to the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and said: last night I saw in a dream, shaded clouds trickling with clarified butter and honey, and I saw people taking handfuls from it, there were those who were taking a lot and there were those who were taking a little and there was a rope connected from the earth to the sky.  I saw you take it and ascend with it, then another man took it and ascended with it, then another man took it and ascended with it, then a man took it and it was cut off, then connected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr said O Messenger of Allaah! May my father be sacrificed for you, I swear by Allaah if you allow me I will interpret it for you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said to him: ‘Go ahead interpret it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘As for the shaded clouds then that is Islaam, as for the trickling of clarified butter and honey, then that is the Qur’aan and its sweetness trickles for the one who reads a lot of Qur’aan and for the one who reads a little of the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the connected rope from the sky to the earth, then that is the truth which you are upon so you take it then Allaah caused you to ascend, then another man held on and ascended, then another man took it and ascended, then another man took it then it cuts off, then it connects and ascended with it, so tell me O Messenger of Allaah – may my father be sacrificed for you – was I right or wrong?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said: ‘You were right in some of it and wrong in some.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Abu Bakr said: ‘I swear by Allaah that you will narrate to me of that which I made a mistake in.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said: ‘Do not take an oath.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No.121</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;">The Messenger’s <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> Supplication For Anas <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu<br />
</em>Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ </span><br />
<span style="color:#808000;">By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’  </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#808000;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">140 – From Qatada who said: I heard Anas saying: I heard Umm Sulaym who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O Messenger of Allaah! Make <em>Dua</em>’ to Allaah for Anas’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: <strong>‘O Allaah increase his wealth and offspring and bless him in what you have provided for him.’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Bukhari and Tirmidhi</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">141-  From Thaabit, from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> came to Umm Haraam and she brought him some dates and margarine but the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Return this to its container and the other to its jug, since I am fasting.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he stood and led us in a two <em>Rakah </em>optional prayer and Umm Haraam and Umm Sulaym stood behind us.  He made me stand on his right hand side – and according to Thaabit – Anas continued: He led us in an optional prayer on a mat. When he finished his prayer, Umm Sulaym said: I have a specific request, make <em>Dua</em>’ to Allaah for your young servant Anas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> never left anything of good from the<em>Duniya </em>and the Hereafter except that he supplicated it for me, then he <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>O Allaah increase his wealth and offspring and bless it for him.’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘My daughter informed me that I had been provided with some ninety odd offspring from my loins. There was not a man from amongst the Ansaar who had more wealth than me, then Anas said: ‘O Thaabit, I do not own any gold or silver except for my ring.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Abu Dawood, I say that this <em>Isnaad</em> is Saheeh upon the conditions of Muslim. It is also collected by Ahmad &amp; Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the narration of Ahmad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Then the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> supplicated for Umm Sulaym and her family.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the narrator mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Anas mentioned that his eldest daughter Ameenah informed him that there were more than one hundred and twenty from his offspring buried when Hajjaj appeared.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Albaani said: that this <em>Isnad</em> of three narrators is authentic upon the conditions of Bukhari &amp; Muslim.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Albaani Commented:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘From the benefits of the hadeeth and its <em>Fiqh</em>:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many benefits in this hadeeth, I will mention some of them briefly, except where detail is necessary:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- That supplicating for increase in wealth and offspring is something which is legislated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari has a chapter heading for this hadeeth: ‘Chapter: Supplicating for blessings in having lots of wealth and offspring.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- And that wealth and offspring are a blessing and goodness if Allaah -Tabaraka wa Ta’ala is obeyed in respect to them. How misguided is the one who tries to limit how many children they have, using so many different means, like birth control or regulating it, let alone aborting the foetus and for the most insignificant reasons, and obtaining <em>Fatawa</em> to make their actions permissible! !</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- Allaah answered the <em>Dua’</em> of His Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> for Anas, and it became reality, until he became the one with the most wealth and offspring from amongst the Ansar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- That it is allowed for the one fasting an optional fast, when he visits a person and food is presented to him that he does not have to break his fast, but he supplicates for the host with goodness. And from the chapters of Bukhari: ‘Chapter whoever visits a people and does not break his fast with them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- That if a man is led in prayer by another man, he should stand on the right of the one leading the prayer.  What is evident is that he stands right next to him, not forward nor just behind him, because if anything like this ever occurred then the narrator would have narrated it, especially since the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> repeatedly led individual companions in prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a hadeeth of Ibn Abbas regarding this in Saheeh Bukhari and Muslim, and Bukhari brought a chapter heading for the hadeeth of Ibn Abbas, and Muslim brought it from Jabir. The chapter which Bukhari mentions is: ‘Chapter: if there are two people praying then one stands <strong>equal next </strong>to the one leading the prayer.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafidh said in ‘al-Fath’ (2/160):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Regarding the saying of Bukhari: ‘equal’ means that he does not stand forward from the Imam and nor just behind him, it is as if the compiler (Bukhari) indicates to what occurs in some of the narrations from Ibn Abbas with the wording: <strong>‘So I stood next to him’</strong> and that apparently means equal to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And AbdurRazzaq narrates from Ibn Juraij  who said: I said to ‘Atta:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘A man prays along with another man, where should he stand?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘On his right hand side.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I asked: ‘Does he stand equal to him so that he is in line with him and one is not ahead of the other?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked: ‘Do you like it that they stand equal so there is no gap between them?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In ‘al-Muwatta’ from Abdullaah bin Utbah bin Mas’ood who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I entered upon Umar bin al-Khattab during the morning before <em>Dhur</em> and I found him in<em>Ruku</em> (bowing in the prayer) I stood in prayer behind him, but he brought me forward until he placed me next to him on his right side.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Albaani) say: This Athar in ‘al-Muwatta’ with an authentic chain from Umar <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em>, along with the previously mentioned Ahadeeth are strong proof of the previously mentioned issue of standing equally in the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the saying that it is recommended that the single person following the Imam should stand slightly behind the Imam, as is mentioned by some of the <em>Madhahib</em>(schools of thought), with some of them elaborating about this issue – along with there being no evidence for it from the Sunnah likewise, it also opposes what is apparent from these Ahadeeth, and this narration of Umar, and the previously mentioned statement of ‘Atta and he is the Imam, the noble <em>Taba’ee</em> (Follower of the Companions) Ibn Abee Rabah and likewise it opposes the other statements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is more befitting for the Believer to leave those statements of the <em>Madhahib</em> (schools of thought) to their founders, believing that they are rewarded for it, because they endeavoured and formulated an opinion intending the truth, and it is upon the believer to follow what is established in the Sunnah, since indeed the best guidance is the guidance of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ vol.1 hadeeth no. 219  p.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His Praise and Blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his  companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">By <em>Shaykh Muhadith Nasir as-Sunnah </em>Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding refuting the book ‘Sunnah Nabaweeyah Bayn Ahl-ul-Fiqh wa Ahl-ul-Hadeeth’ [By Muhammad Ghazali] since there are flaws concerning the hadeeth, many of the scholars have refuted it. What is your opinion about the book? What’s your opinion about the refutations?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh Answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This book is very dangerous to the Sunnah, and to the scholars of the Sunnah and the followers of the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that those who refuted it are united upon the truth, even though their methods may differ. From them are those who are strict, from them are those who are easy going and from them are those who are in the middle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This man [Muhammad Ghazali] in addition to not being a critic<strong>,</strong> he is not established upon the knowledge of hadeeth nor upon the foundations of Fiqh principles, and along with that he adds to his use of evidence the opinions of others mockingly.  This is not what someone does whose aim it is to advise the people, so because of this he exposed himself to many, many problems and he is deserving of these problems. It is sufficient that he attacked the Ahadeeth which are present in the ‘Saheeh’ without following the methodology of the scholars and critics as some of them did in the olden days like; Daraqutni, and the likes of Ibn Taymeeyah, and Ibn al-Qayyim, when they would critically examine some of the Ahadeeth. However, they would criticize with knowledge, piety and reflection.  As for this man then he does not criticize except with his own desires from one direction, and with ignorance of hadeeth and its texts from another direction.  Due to this the scope of refuting him is very extensive, so perhaps those who take part in refuting him with their different methods, they took part in that which was obligatory upon them in supporting hadeeth firstly, and the scholars of hadeeth and its followers. This is a brief answer according to what you mentioned.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Questioner continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Do you not see O noble Shaykh, regarding this topic that it is better for the current scholars of Islaam to schedule a meeting and a debate about this subject, this is from one direction. Also<strong>,</strong> do you not see that it is necessary for the noble scholars of Islaam, the likes of yourself to author a refutation against this man, since these great refutations have an effect upon the people. Also<strong>,</strong> do you not see that there should be more refutations against him, more than a lecture and gathering because he has affected the minds of many of the Muslims?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh responded:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This is true, with no doubt or suspicion, however the issue is, as has been said a long time ago:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Not everything a person wishes, can be achieved * A ship does not want a severe storm to blow’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have many works, which unfortunately do not allow me the scope to undertake some of the other religious obligations, this is due to the many projects that I am connected to.  However, perhaps those who have undertaken refuting this person, should form a committee to study these refutations and choose the best of them, then print them and distribute them to the people, to bring this refutation closer to all the people especially those who have been allured by the philosophy of this man and his tongue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for me personally, I am unable and cannot. I indeed held the opinion for example, of at least going to Afghanistan for calling to the Book and the Sunnah, at least amongst the different Arab nationalities, and I excused myself as you can see of my old age.  Otherwise it is necessary to undertake refuting this man, and from those who refuted this person, <strong>the likes of our brother Dr. Rabia’ bin Hadi, the professor of the subject of hadeeth in the university, you may have come across his refutation, indeed he has more knowledge of hadeeth than other than him</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyway, as for your suggestion of forming a committee of scholars to debate this man, then I don’t think that there will be any benefit whatsoever, because you have been trialed before him with some of the Soofeeyah, who supported some Bida’ and the superstitious acts of the Soofeeyah.  It was seen that he could be rectified and be debated but this did not benefit him whatsoever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So perhaps, what is more advisable or better for rectification and beneficial is to form a small committee made up of some of the noble scholars and they choose the strongest and closest from these refutations in understanding, or that they choose from the collection of these refutations, issues which are stronger, and rewrite them with sentences which are clear and understandable for the general people.  This is my opinion, and Allaah knows best.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">By The Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ Muhammad Nasiruddeen al-Albaani </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘A woman went to the hospital and the doctors aborted her four month old fetus, with the argument that the woman had German Measles or measles and if we did not abort it, it would have come out deformed or mentally disabled; what is your opinion?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh Answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I am asked a lot regarding the likes of this situation, and we hold the opinion that you should not respond to these doctors, since their silent expression says: &lt;&lt;we do not think it but as a conjecture, and we have no firm convincing belief (therein).’&gt;&gt; [Al-Jathiyah: 32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have been informed from more than one source that some women had been informed by some doctors the like of this information [of aborting fetuses], but they did not consent to aborting and to miscarrying, and the new-born was delivered naturally, so this confirms that it is nothing but as conjecture.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, every command is in the Hand of Allaah –Tabarak wa Ta’ala- He has the command and He creates everything, so it is not befitting that some doctors participate in the likes of these matters, of which the reality is hidden from all people. Perhaps some people research into some hidden matters more so than others, so it is not allowed to look into the unknown future for all the people, and no-one knows the unseen except Allaah –Tabarak wa Ta’ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a woman … perhaps gives birth to a fetus that is deformed or similar to a deformed child, or like it is said nowadays, that it is disabled etc. . . . so, in respect to us being Muslims believing in Allaah –Azza wa Jal-  and that He is al-Hakeem (The All-Wise) and al-Aleem (The All-Knowing) there is no fault in His creation. So this variance which we generally see between human beings whether it is in skin colour or in height or shortness in stature or in being males or females, or in health and safety, or regarding diseases and illness etc. then all of this is what al-Azeez (The All-Mighty), al-Aleem (The All-Knowing) has pre-destined. Because the Lord –Azza wa Jal- wants to show His slaves that what they regard as good and ugly, then all of that according to Allaah –Azza wa Jal- is good. The way we look at the creation of Allaah – Azza wa Jal- is not the way the Creator Himself –Tabarak wa Ta’ala- views things, because &lt;&lt;there is nothing like unto Him and He is the All-knowing and All-Seeing.&gt;&gt; [Shura:11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At this opportunity it is necessary for me to mention a hadeeth, which I regard as very great concerning this topic and an answer to this question.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> saw a  man from his Companions, walking wearing a long garment and it was trailing below his ankles, so the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said to him: ‘O so and so, raise your garment since it is closer to piety and better to remain cleaner.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah I am bow-legged.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The shaykh continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘So this person lengthened his garment so that he could cover up this deficiency as he had presumed, and he apologized for this reason for having lengthened his garment so the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said to him: ‘O so and so – [the shaykh said: ‘and here is the main point’ ] – ‘All of Allaah’s creation is good. All of Allaah’s creation is good.’ [Saheeh: ‘Silsilah Saheehah’ 1441]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is why, what we see with our human physical eyes, has to be judged immediately that this is a deficient sight. We see, as is mentioned in an old Arabic proverb: ‘Not past his rabbit like nose’ (tip of his nose).  They used to say of old, ‘so and so does not see past his rabbit like nose’ (does not look further than the tip of his nose).  As for looking far ahead then no! In addition to this no matter how far a human being can see, no matter how very far, it is still a deficient sight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Companion from the Companions of the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>saw himself as defective due to being bow-legged and the disability which was in his calves, so he covered it up by lengthening his garment. Because if he raised his garment slightly then some of the disability would have become exposed, so the Prophet &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> brought his attention to this. That what you see as a deficiency is not a deficiency because Allaah is the One Who created you like that, and this is not from your own doing. Just like Allaah –Azza wa Jal- said: &lt;&lt;This is the creation of Allaah. So show Me that which those (whom you worship), besides Him have created. &gt;&gt; [Luqman: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore this child, this fetus, if it is born naturally and it was disabled or was afflicted with an illness which the doctors previously had presumed, then this is the Will of Allaah which is the Destiny that Allaah made so that it can be a lesson for healthy people.  As it has been said: ‘Health is a crown placed upon the head of healthy people which none can see except a person who is ill.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also a very great, noble prophetic instruction, which is: ‘Do not look at those above you but look at those below you, since it is more befitting that you do not belittle the blessings of Allaah upon you.’ [Saheeh Lighayrihi: ‘Saheeh Targheeb  wa Tarheeb 2233]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So perhaps there is a person who has a beautiful form, however there are people who look at themselves and view themselves as ugly and they might say that this person really is beautiful.  So this is the variance in the creation and in beauty and it is the predestination of Allaah al-Azeez (The All-Mighty), al-Aleem (The All-Knowing) al-Hakeem (The All-Wise).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when Allaah created beauty He also created its opposite, as we have said that it is created for an Infinite Wisdom, we can express this with what has been said a very long time ago: ‘Opposites clarify each other.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it was not for ugliness, beauty would not be known. If it was not for illness, health would not be known. If it was not for males there would not be females. If it was not for females there would not be males.  So all this creation that we see, that Allaah created the people upon, it is from the Wisdom of Allaah –Azza wa Jal- this is why it is not befitting to conform to the opinions of doctors concerning matters which have not yet entered the sphere of life, and when it comes into the sphere of life then comes the saying of the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>: ‘O slaves of Allaah seek treatment, since indeed Allaah did not send down a disease except that He sent down the cure.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the hadeeth of Usamah bin Shareek <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em>, it was also narrated by another noble Companion and he is none other than Abdullaah bin Mas’ood <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu- </em>with an extra wording, he said: ‘Seek cure O slaves of Allaah since indeed Allaah did not send down a disease except that He sent down the cure, whoever knew it, knew it and whoever was ignorant of it, was ignorant of it.’ [Saheeh: ‘Silsilah Saheehah’ 451]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, there is nothing to hinder seeking cure later on, however there is a condition which needs to be taken into consideration, which is, that this seeking cure is due to a matter which the new-born is exposed to, i.e. that it is not allowed to change the creation of Allaah –Azza wa Jal, because Allaah –Azza wa Jal- mentions about the accursed Shaytan in the Noble Qur’aan, that the Shaytaan challenged the will of the Lord of the worlds –Azza wa Jal- in respect to Adam and his offspring saying: &lt;&lt; I will order them to slit the ears of cattle, and indeed I will order them to change the nature created by Allaah.&gt;&gt; [Nisa’:119]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not allowed to change the creation of Allaah –Azza wa Jal- and this has examples, very many examples.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2005 – ‘Indeed there people who read the Qur’aan, but it does not go pass their throats, they leave Islaam just like the arrow leaves the prey.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by ad-Darmi</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From ‘Amroo bin Salamah:  We were sitting by the door of Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood before lunch, so that if he came out, we could walk with him to the <em>Masjid</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Moosaa al-Ash’aree came and said: Has Abu Abdur-Rahmaan come out yet?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We said: No.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, he sat down with us, waiting for him to come out, and when he came out, we all gathered towards him, and Abu Moosaa said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O Abu Abdur-Rahmaan! Previously I saw something in the <em>Masjid</em> which I disliked. But,<em>Alhamdulillaah</em>, what I saw, was nothing but good.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: What was it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Moosaa said, ‘If you live, you will see it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Abu Moosaa said, ‘I saw a group of people, sitting in circles waiting for the prayer.  In every circle there was a man and in their hands were small stones and he would say: ‘Say <em>Allaahu Akbar</em> 100 times’ and they would say ‘<em>Allaahu Akbar</em>’ 100 times.  Then, he would say, ‘Say <em>laa ilaha ilAllaah</em> 100 times’ and they would say ‘<em>laa ilaha ilAllaah</em>’ 100 times and he would say, ‘Say <em>SubhaanAllaah</em>’ 100 times and they would say ‘<em>SubhaanAllaah</em>’ 100 times.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood said, ‘So what did you say to them?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘I did not say anything to them, rather I waited for your opinion [or ‘I waited for your command’].’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘Why did you not command them to count their bad deeds [i.e. seek forgiveness from your deeds] and guarantee them that their good deeds would not be lost?!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he walked and we walked with him until he reached one of those circles and he stood there and said, ‘What is this that I see you doing?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘O Abu Abdur-Rahmaan! These are nothing but small stones with which we are counting, saying ‘<em>Allaahu Akbar</em>, <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> and <em>SubhaanAllaah</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, ‘Count your sins; I guarantee that you will not lose anything of your good deeds!  Beware, O <em>Ummah</em> of Muhammad!  How quick you are to your destruction!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here we are, the Companions of your Prophet – abundant, everywhere and here is his clothing which has not been [wasted away] and his utensils have not been broken. I swear by Him in Whose Hand is my soul, <strong>either you are an <em>Ummah</em> more rightly-guided than the <em>Ummah</em> of Muhammad or you are opening the door of misguidance.’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said; ‘We swear by Allaah, O Abu Abdur-Rahmaan, we did not intend anything but good.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘How many people intend good but never achieve it.  Verily the Messenger of Allaah – narrated to us, ‘Indeed there will be a people who read the Qur’aan but it does not pass beyond their throats.’  I swear by Allaah, I do not know. Perhaps most of them are from amongst you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he went away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Amroo bin Salamah said, ‘We saw some of those sitting in those circles fighting on the Day of <em>Nahrawaan</em>, along with the Khawaarij.’<strong>[1]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albaani mentions in the <em>Takreej</em> (research) of the above narration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed there is a lesson to be learnt from this narration, for those who follow <em>Sufi</em>paths and <em>Dhikr</em> gatherings which are against the Sunnah.  When someone forbids an evil action that they perform they accuse him of forbidding <em>Dhikr</em> from its very foundation!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is <em>Kufr</em> which no Muslim in this world should fall into; the evil action which they adhere to, from those forms of <em>Dhikr</em> and gatherings which, were not legislated at the time of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, otherwise why would Ibn Masood <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> disapprove of those who were sitting in their gatherings?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it not, a gathering done on a specific day, and doing an amount of <em>Dhikr</em> which is not indicated by the <em>Sharia’</em> but is listed by the <em>Shaykh</em> of the gathering, and he commands them with the amount of <em>Dhikr</em> that they should do from himself, as if he is a legislator on behalf of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;  Or do they have partners with Allaah, who have instituted for them a religion which Allaah has not allowed. &gt;&gt;[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To add to this, the Sunnah which is established by the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> verbally and practically is to perform the <em>Tasbeeh</em> (remembrance of Allaah) on your fingertips, as it is clear in ‘The refutation against al-Habshee’ and in other places.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the benefits which can be reaped from the hadeeth and this story is; that the importance is not of performing a large amount of worship, but rather, is it according to the Sunnah and far away from <em>Bida’</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Masood <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> also indicated to this point in his saying: ‘sticking to the Sunnah is better than striving in <em>Bida’</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And another benefit is: that a small <em>Bida’</em> leads to a greater <em>Bida’</em>.  Do you not see that those people from these gatherings afterwards became from the Khawaarij who were killed by the rightly guided <em>Khalifah</em> ‘Alee bin Abu Taalib?  So is there anyone who will take heed?!’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">A Detailed Research By Shaykh Muhadith Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani <em>-Rahimullaah-<br />
</em>Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 01</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Contents:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 – A Summary of the Opinion of Shaykh al-Albaani regarding the issue of Placing the Hands Back on the Chest after the Rukoo’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – From the ‘Original Sifat as-Salah’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – From ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ – The Legislation of Placing your Hands on the Chest While Standing in the Prayer Before the Rukoo’ and Not in the Standing After it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – Comments of Shaykh al-Albaani in ‘Saheeh Mawaarid ath-Thamaan’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 – The Comment of Shaykh al-Albaani in ‘Da’eef Jamia’ as-Sagheer’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – From ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ – Pointing with the Finger is Just in the Tashhaud Alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1 –</strong> A Summary of the Opinion of Shaykh al-Albaani regarding the issue of Placing the Hands Back on the Chest after the Rukoo’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>a)</strong> Shaykh al-Albaani said: ‘I do not doubt that placing the hands on the chest in this standing is an innovation and misguidance.  Since it has not been mentioned at all in any of the Ahadeeth of prayer – and there are so many of them! If this issue had a foundation, then it would have been transmitted/conveyed to us even if there was one chain for this action.  What strengthens this opinion, is that not one of the Salaf did this and it was not mentioned by any one of the Imams of hadeeth, as far as I know.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>b) </strong>Shaykh al-Albaani said: ‘As for the statement of Imam Ahmad, which indicates placing of the hands after the Rukoo’ as has been mentioned, is not established in the Sunnah according to Imam Ahmad himself, because indeed he himself chose (optional) between doing it and leaving it!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>c)</strong> Shaykh al-Albaani said: ‘I used to declare in a lot of my lectures and lessons the causes and reasoning regarding this clasping of the hands after Rukoo’ ; that a person is about to introduce a new Bida’ due to relying upon a general hadeeth not knowing that it is specific, and this Bida’ is none other than pointing with the finger in other than the sitting of Tashhaud!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>d) </strong>Shaykh al-Albaani said: ‘The readers should reflect upon how well Wa’il <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> narrates the description of how the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> raised his hands in the opening Takbeer, then how he summarized his words regarding it when he performed the Rukoo’ and standing up from it by saying: ‘he raised his hands likewise’; so if, what some of the respected people ascribe to him, about placing the hands after rising from Rukoo’ was Saheeh then he would have said the likes of: ‘and he placed his right hand over his left hand likewise.’ Or something similar, since this is a time where that explanation would be given as is apparent, so reflect upon this justly.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>e) </strong>Shaykh al-Albaani said: ‘. . . .and that is why the Salaf did not act upon this.’</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 02</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albaani said in the ‘Original Sifat as-Salah’:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Section: Rukoo’ /Prolonging the Rukoo’ and the obligation of being tranquil during it.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> used to order to being tranquil in the Rukoo’; and he said to the person who did not pray properly:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘then raise your head until you are standing straight; [until every bone goes back to its place], (and in a narration: ‘and when rise from Rukoo’; then straighten your back, and raise your head until the bones go back to their joints’)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Messenger <em>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> mentioned: ‘that no one’s prayer is complete, if he does not do that.’(1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">____________________</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) This is from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah, and the extra wording and that which follows it is from the hadeeth of Rifa’ah bin Rafa’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{And the intent of the word ‘bone’ here is: the connected bones of the back and the spine – as is mentioned before in (standing up straight after the Rukoo’…)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Notice:</em></strong> Indeed the intent of this hadeeth is clear and evident and it is to have tranquility during the Rukoo’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for what some of our brothers from the people of Hijaaz and from other than them, use from the hadeeth as proof to show the legislation of placing the right hand on the left in this position of standing after the Rukoo’. Then this hadeeth differs from the collective narrations of the hadeeth – as is well known – amongst the Fuqaha (scholars of Fiqh) entitled ‘the hadeeth of the one who prayed incorrectly’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather this use of evidence is invalid; because this placing of the hands has not been mentioned about the first standing of the prayer in any of the different hadeeth or their wordings.  So how can it be permissible to explain it as the placing of the hands as has been mentioned, by placing the left hand with the right after Rukoo’?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is if he supported that, with the wordings of this hadeeth collectively in this section/topic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how can it be since it indicates clearly in contrast to this?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the placing of hands which they mentioned is not what is immediately understood from the hadeeth at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since the meaning of the word: (bones) is the backbones – as is mentioned – and what supports what has preceded is the action of the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> : ‘……. He stood straight until every bone of the spine returned to its place.’ so reflect upon this objectively.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>I do not doubt that placing the hands on the chest in this standing is an innovation and misguidance.  Since it has not been mentioned at all in any of the Ahadeeth of prayer – and there are so many of them! If this issue had a foundation, then it would have been transmitted/conveyed to us even if there was one chain for this action.  What strengthens this opinion, is that not one of the Salaf did this and it was not mentioned by any one of the Imams of hadeeth, as far as I know.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this does not oppose what Shaykh Tawayjari conveyed in his booklet (p.18-19) from Imam Ahmad <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> that he said: ‘if the person wants; he can leave his hands by the side after coming up from Rukoo’ and if the person wants he can place his hands.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(This meaning is what is mentioned by Salih bin Imam Ahmad in ‘Masaileehi’ (p.90) from his father.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad did not ascribe this to the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, rather he said this with his Ijtihad and his opinion, and an opinion can be wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if there is authentic evidence about an issue being a Bida’ – like this issue that we are dealing with, then just because an Imam said this, then it does not negate it being a Bida’ – just like Shaykhul-Islaam  Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> affirmed in some of his books – ; rather, indeed we find in this statement of Imam Ahmad, that which indicates that  this placing of the hands after the Rukoo’ as has been mentioned, is not established in the Sunnah according to Imam Ahmad himself, because indeed he himself chose (optional) between doing it and leaving it!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So does the noble Shaykh [Tawayjari] think that the Imam also allowed choosing between placing the hands before the Rukoo’ ?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is affirmed that this way of placing of the hands which has been mentioned is not from the Sunnah and that is the intent here.’</p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 03</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albaani said in ‘</strong><strong>Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah</strong><strong>’:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2247- ‘When the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> used to stand in the prayer he would take a hold of his left hand with his right hand.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Yaqoob al-Foosi in ‘al-Ma’rifah’ (3/121) and with the same chain al-Bayhaqi narrates it in ‘as-Sunnan al-Kubra’ (2/28) and Tabraani in ‘al-Kabeer’ (22/9/1) from another chain: Abu Nu’aeem said that Musa bin Umayr al-Anbaree narrated to us who said that ‘Alqama bin Wa’il narrated to me from his father that ‘When the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> used to stand in the prayer he would take a hold of his left hand with his right hand.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I saw ‘Alqama do this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Foosi said: ‘and Musa bin Umayr Koofi is Thiqaah (trustworthy).’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (al-Albaani) said: and other scholars graded him Thiqaah (trustworthy), the rest of the narrators are also trustworthy from the narrators of Muslim, so the Sanad (chain of narration) is Saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been collected by Nisa’ee (1/141) from Abdullaah bin al-Mubarak from  Musa bin Umayr al-Anbaree and Qeess bin Saleem al-Anbaree who both said that ‘Alqama bin Wa’il narrated to us with the previous narration and with something similar to that, without mentioning that ‘Alqama did the action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it was collected by Ahmad (4/316) and Ibn Abee Shaybah in ‘al-Musannaf’ (1/390) that Wakeea’ narrated to us: that Musa bin Umayr al-Anbaree narrated to us this narration with a summary of the narration with the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I saw the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> placing his right hand on his left hand in the prayer.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But he did not mention: while standing in the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it was collected by al-Bagawi in ‘Sharh as-Sunnah’ (3/30) from another chain from Wakeea’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, Ahmad (4/316-319) narrated from other chains from Wa’il bin Hajr without mentioning the standing in prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The researcher can have no doubt in the different chains of this hadeeth that the hadeeth is also summarized – as in the narration of Wakeea’ – from the hadeeth of Wa’il which explains the description of the Prophet’s prayer <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, and the standing in the prayer where he would clasp his hands, which is before the Rukoo’.  This was mentioned from two chains:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first:</strong> From Abdul Jabbar bin Wa’il from ‘Alqama bin Wa’il and their freed slave that they narrated to him from his father Wa’il bin Hajr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That he saw the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> raise his hands opposite his ears when he entered into the prayer and said the Takbeer, as was described by Hammam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he gathered his garment (thobe) around him-self.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he placed his right hand on his left hand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he wanted to perform Rukoo’ he took out his hands from his Thobe and then he raised his hands, then said Takbeer, then performed Rukoo’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then when he said: ‘Sami Allaahu liman Hamida.’ (Allaah Hears the one who praises Him)  he raised his hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he performed Sajda (prostration), he would prostrate between his hands.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Muslim (2/130), Abu Awaanah (2/106-107),  Ahmad (4/317-318) and al-Bayhaqi (2/28 &amp; 71).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second narration:</strong> from ‘Aasim bin Kulayb from his father from Wa’il bin Hajr who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I said: Indeed I want to see the prayer of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> how he used to pray?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> stood and faced the Qiblah, said the Takbeer (Allaahu Akbar) and raised his hands until they were opposite his ears.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he took his left hand by his right one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he wanted to go into Rukoo’ he raised his hands like that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he placed his hands on his knees.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he raised his head from Rukoo’ he raised his hands like that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when he prostrated, he placed his head at that place between his hands, then he sat and spread (iftarasha) his left leg….. and indicated with his index finger….’ Until the end of the Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Abu Daawood, Nisa’ee,  Ahmad and others with an authentic Sanad (chain) and it is collected in ‘Saheeh Abu Daawood’ (716-717) with two other narrations from other Imams from a group of Thiqaat (trustworthy narrators) from ‘Aasim, and some of the narrations have extra wording more than others.  The most complete sequence of wording is that of Za’idah bin Qadamah and Bashr bin al-Mufadal and he is Thiqata Thabt (trustworthy and firm) and the wording is his, and Ibn Majah narrates from him with the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I saw the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> praying and he took his left hand by his right hand.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say (Albaani): If the researcher reflects upon just this sentence alone, and he does not know, or at the very least does not call to mind that it is summarized from the hadeeth, then he understands from it the legislation of clasping the hands in every standing position in the prayer, whether it was before the Rukoo’ or after it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the sequence of the hadeeth illustrates that this is a mistake, since it is clear that this placing of the hands is in the first standing of the prayer, and in the wording of ‘Aasim it is clearer, since he mentioned raising of the hands in the Takbeeratul-Ihraam (the opening Takbeer), then he made Rukoo’ and raised up from it, then he said in those two narrations: this is how he prayed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if Wa’il had memorized that, if the placing of the hands was after Rukoo’ ’, then he would also have mentioned it as is clear, because he mentioned the raising of the hands three times before, but if someone separates that sentence from its sequence in the hadeeth, then it is presumed that it is to place the hands back on the chest after raising from Rukoo’.  This is what some of the present-day noble scholars say, without them having a precedence from the Salaf as-Salih, from what I know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What confirms what we have mentioned is the narration of Ibn Idrees from ‘Aasim with this narration with a summarized wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I saw the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> when he said Takbeer, take his left hand by his right hand.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many people fell into this type of presumption due to some narrators mentioning these narrations in a summarized form, or being precise in narrating this hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I used to declare in a lot of my lectures and lessons the causes and reasoning regarding this clasping of the hands after Rukoo’ ; that a person is about to introduce a new Bida’ due to relying upon a general hadeeth not knowing that it is specific, and this Bida’ is none other than pointing with the finger in other than the sitting of Tashhaud!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed there are two Ahadeeth mentioned in ‘Saheeh Muslim’ about pointing in the sitting of Tashhaud, one of them, the hadeeth of Ibn Umar and the other hadeeth of Ibn az-Zubayr. Both have wordings which are general and specific or summarized and detailed: ‘If the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>would <strong>sit in the prayer</strong> he would put his hands on his knees and raise his right finger which is next to his thumb and made Dua’ during it…’ so here the sitting is general.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the other narration: ‘If he <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> used to <strong>sit in Tashhaud</strong> he would place his left hand on his left knee and he would place his right hand on his right knee….’ Until the end of the Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So here the sitting is specific for Tashhaud. And the wording of the hadeeth of Ibn az-Zubayr is similar to this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in the first wording ‘he sat’ includes all sittings in the prayer, like the sitting between the two Sajdahs and sitting between the second Sajdah and the second Rakah which is well known to the scholars as the sitting for rest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I used to say: we are about to see some of them point with their finger in these two sittings!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And before long, it was said to me that some students point with their finger between the two Sajdahs (prostrations)!  Then I saw this with my own two eyes, when one of the graduates from the Islamic University did this when he visited me in my house in the beginning of the year 1404 A.H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we were waiting for a third Bida’ to be introduced; which was none other than pointing with the finger in the sitting for rest in the prayer! Then what we were waiting for took place and Allaah’s aid is sought!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of this type of presumed summary for the legislation of pointing in the prayer is also in the hadeeth of Wa’il from the narration of ‘Aasim bin Koolayb from his father from Wa’il, which is in ‘Musnad Ahmad’ (4/316-319) from two angles:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First angle: generally pointing in the prayer without restricting it to Tashhaud.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is collected by Imam Ahmad (4/116-117) from the way of Shu’ba from Wa’il with the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘While sitting he <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> spread his left thigh away from his right thigh and he pointed with his index finger.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also collected by Ibn Khuzaimah in his ‘Saheeh’ (1/345/697), however he said at the end of it:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘i.e. in the sitting in Tashhaud.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This explanation is either from Wa’il or from one of his narrators, the first one is the stronger opinion due to what follows.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another wording of Wa’il in ‘al-Musnad’ (4/316) from the narration of AbdulWahid with the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘So when the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> sat he spread his left leg….. and he pointed with his index finger.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad followed him up (4/317 &amp; 318) with Sufyaan Thawaree and Zuhayr bin Muwaweeyah and it was also collected by Tabraani 922/78, 83, 85, 90) from their chains and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second angle: Pointing restricted to the Tashhaud.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is in ‘al-Musnad’ (4/319) from another chain from Shu’abah with the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘So when he sat for Tashhaud… he pointed with his index finger and he linked the index finger in a circular form with the forefinger.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Its Sanad (chain) is authentic, and Ibn Khuzaimah also narrated it (698).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul-Ahwaas followed him up which is in Tahawee in ‘Sharh al-Ma’aani’ (1/152), and Tabraani in ‘al-Mu’jam al-Kabeer’ (22/34/80), with extra wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘then he began supplicating with the other.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zaidat bin Qadaamah followed them up with the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘He <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> made a circular ring, then he raised his finger, and I saw him move it and supplicate with it/during it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Abu Daawood and by others from the collector of the Sunnan, and Ahmad (4/318), Tabraani (22/35/82) and Ibn Khuaimah, Ibn Hibban, Ibn al-Jarood, Nawawi and Ibn al-Qayyim authenticated it, and it is researched in ‘Saheeh Abu Daawood’ (717).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu ‘Awwana followed them up with similar to it and in it is mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘then he supplicated’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Tabraani (22/38/90)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And by Ibn Idrees likewise</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Ibn Hibban (486)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And by Salaam bin Sulaym by Tayalisee (1020).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tahawee said commenting on the previous narration of Abul-Ahwaas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘In this is the evidence that the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was at the end of the prayer.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: and this is clear in the narration of Abu ‘Awwana which was indicated to earlier, since he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Then he made Sajdah (prostration) and placed his head on the floor between his hands, then he prayed another Rakah, then he sat and spread his left leg and then he supplicated and placed his left hand on his left knee, and his right hand on his right knee and supplicated with the index finger.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And its Isnaad is Saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise is the narration of Sufyaan Ibn Uyainyah and his wording is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And if the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> sat in the two Rakah, he would recline his left leg and prop up his right leg, and he placed his right hand on his right thigh and raised his finger for the supplication and he placed his left hand on his left leg.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Nisa’ee (1/173) with an authentic chain and by al-Humaydee (885) similarly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: so what becomes clear from these authentic narrations is that moving or pointing with the finger is indeed in the sitting of Tashhaud and unrestricted sitting as is mentioned in some of the narrations is restricted with the sitting in Tashhaud.  This is what necessitates of the clarity from gathering and combining the narrations. The principle of carrying the unrestricted (Mutlaq) upon the restricted (muqayid) is reported in the science of Usool of Fiqh (science of Fiqh), that is why it has not been mentioned by anyone from the Salaf, of pointing unrestrictedly in the prayer nor in every sitting of the prayer as far as I know.  And similarly it is said about placing the hands upon the chest and indeed it is in the standing in the prayer which is before the Rukoo’ ’, implementing the previously mentioned principle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[The Reply to the narration of AbdurRazzaq]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a person says: that AbdurRazzaq narrated from Thawri from ‘Aasim bin Kulayb with a previous Isnaad from Wa’il ….. and he mentioned the hadeeth and the spreading of his left leg in his sitting and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Then he pointed with his index finger and placing his thumb upon his middle finger making it in a circular form, and he clenched the rest of his fingers, then he prostrated (performed Sajdah) and his hands were opposite his ears (i.e. when he placed his hands on the floor).’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the apparent meaning of the narration it indicates that the pointing was in the sitting between the two Sajdahs, due to him saying after mentioning the pointing:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Then he prostrated…’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: Yes, AbdurRazzaq collected this in his ‘Musannaf’ (2/68-69), Imam Ahmad narrated it upon him (4/317) and Tabarani in ‘al-Mu’jam al-Kabeer’ (2/34-35) and Shaykh Habibur-Rahman al-Azaami claims in his comment upon this narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘That this narration was collected by the four Sunnan (Abu Daawood, Nisa’ee, Ibn Majah &amp; Tirmidhi), except that Tirmidhi and Bayhaqi narrated it in a number of dispersed chapters.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This claim is false, indicating his negligence, that what is obligatory to substantiate.  Since not one of those who narrated it mentioned after pointing: ‘Then he prostrated…’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather this is what AbdurRazzaq narrates from Thawri alone.  And Muhammad bin Yusuf al-Faryyabi opposed him in this and he used to adhere to Thawri and he did not mention the prostration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was collected by Tabarani (22/33/78).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullaah bin al-Waleed followed him in narrating this: Sufyaan narrated to me …… the same narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Ahmad (4/318).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Waleed is truthful but perhaps he made a mistake.  His narration being followed up with the narration of al-Faryyabi for him is stronger than the narration of AbdurRazzaq, especially that they mention in his biography that he has Ahadeeth which are not accepted from him; one of them is from his narration from Thawri, see ‘Tahdheeb’ by Ibn Hajr and ‘Meezan’ by Dhahabi, so these extra wordings are from his erroneous presumptions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed from what emphasizes this, is that a large number from the Thiqaat (trustworthy) Huffaadh (memorizers) followed up Thawri in his narration which is preserved and from amongst those who preserved the narration are AbdulWahid bin Ziyaad, Shu’bah, Za’idah bin Qadaamah, Bashr bin al-Mufadal, Zuhayr bin Muaweeyah, Abul-Ahwaas, Abu ‘Awaanah, Ibn Idrees, Salaam bin Sulayman, Sufyaan bin Uyainyah and other than them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So all of these narrators did not mention this extra wording in the hadeeth of Wa’il, rather one of them mentioned it before pointing, like Bashr and Abu ‘Awaana and other than these two and their wordings have preceded and some of them mentioned it clearly that the pointing was in the sitting of Tashhaud, as is preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is what is correct, that which majority of the scholars from the Muhaditheen (Scholars of Hadeeth) and Fuqaha (Scholars of Fiqh) hold the opinion of.  I do not know anyone who said that pointing with the finger is legislated in the sitting between the two Sajdahs except for Ibn al-Qayyim, since his apparent statement in ‘Zad al-Ma’ad’ corresponding to the hadeeth  of AbdurRazzaq.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps that university student whom I indicated to earlier on, blindly followed him in this, or blindly followed those who blindly followed Ibn al-Qayyim from the present day scholars and I explained to him and other students who visited me the irregularity of the narration of AbdurRazzaq and its fragility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of those students informed me from one of the well-known scholars in some Arab lands that he implements this hadeeth of AbdurRazzaq and uses it as an evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this it indicates that he does not specialize in this knowledge, and this is what has compelled me to write this investigation and research, so if I was correct then it was from Allaah and if I was mistaken then it is from myself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask al-Mawla – Subhana wa Ta’ala – to take us by our hands and guide us to the truth which the people have differed in, indeed He guides who He Wills to the straight path and all praise belongs to Allaah the Lord of all the worlds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">From the Works of The Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ Muhammad Nasiruddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong># Principles of Bida’ 1</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Adhering to general texts which have not been implemented\acted upon is not from the Fiqh of the Salaf.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Nasiruddeen Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Adhering to general texts which have not been acted upon, is not from the Fiqh(understanding) of the Salaf. Indeed every Bida’ which some people regard as being good, is generally taken from a general evidence.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Riyadh Saliheen’ researched by Shaykh Muhammad Nasiruddeen Albaani p.136 H#250]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"># Principles of Bida’ 2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It is not a condition in order to reject every individual Bida’ that we need a narration conveyed with an authentic chain from one of the Salaf.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Nasiruddeen Albaani said during his refutation of Shaykh Al-Habshi, in his debate with him regarding the Bida’ of prayer beads:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘. . . . . And is it a condition with the people of knowledge and intellect in rejecting every individual Bida’ that we should have a narration conveyed with an authentic chain from one of the Salaf rejecting every single Bida’? This is not something a person who has smelt the fragrance of knowledge says.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From: ‘ar-Radd ‘ala Taqeeb al-Hatheeth’ by Shaykh Albaani p.54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"># Principles of Bida’ 3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Nasiruddeen Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Coming closer to Allaah Ta’ala cannot be done except with what Allaah has legislated.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Anas bin Malik who said: I was sitting with Ubayy and Abu Talha, and we had just eaten meat and bread, then I called for water to make Wudu. Ubayy and Abu Talha said to me: ‘Why are you making Wudu?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas said: ‘Because of this food we just ate.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘Do you make Wudu because of good things (food)?! One who was better than you(the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>), did not make Wudu after eating.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ahmad, &amp; Albaani said its Isnad is Jayyid]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Nasiruddeen Albaani commented:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This Athar (narration) indicates that the Companions would reject coming closer to Allaah- Ta’ala- with an action which the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> did not legislate whether with statements or actions, as for Anas being concerned with making Wudu for eating meat, then perhaps the saying of the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> reached him: ‘Make Wudu for that meat which has been cooked on fire’, and it did not reach him that it had been abrogated and Allaah knows best.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From: Mishkat 1\107 #329]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"># Principles of Bida’ 4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Mubtadi’ is he who Exaggerates Worship.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Nasiruddeen Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘No one should presume that when we choose to limit ourselves to the Sunnah with regard to the amount of Rakat prayed during Taraweeh, and the impermissibility of increasing upon that, that we regard those from the preceding scholars and those who came after them as being misguided or that we see them as people of Bida’ because they don’t hold this opinion (of limiting to the Sunnah), as some of the people have presumed and believed that we see them as being misguided and they have then used that to justify attacking us!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This presumption of theirs, necessitates clarity, they assume that just because a matter is not allowed then it is automatically regarded as a Bida’, or that just because everyone who says it is permissible or recommended to pray more [in the Taraweeh prayer] that he is a misguided Mubtadi! We say no, never, this presumption is indeed false, and extreme ignorance. Because the Bida’ which a person is criticized for and the Ahadeeeth which are applied in curbing Bida’ are a result of the definition: ‘An invented way of religion which is similar to the Sharia’ but is not from it, intending to follow that way and exaggerating in the worship of Allaah -Subhanahu.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, whoever innovates a Bida’ and intends by it exaggeration in worship, and he knows it is not from the Sharia’, then he is the type of person upon whom these Ahadeeth are applied. As for the one who falls into Bida’ unknowingly, and he did not intended exaggeration in worship, then those Ahadeeth do not include these people at all, and they do not concern them at all, rather they concern those Mubtada’ who stand in the way of disseminating the Sunnah, and regard all Bida’ as good, without knowledge or guidance, nor a clear Book, not even blindly following the people of knowledge and remembrance, rather they do this following desires and satisfying the common folk!’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">Taken from Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">By <em>Shaykh Muhadith Nasir as-Sunnah </em>Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2823 – From AbdurRahmaan bin Jubair bin Nafeer, from his father who said: we were sitting with al-Miqdad bin al-Aswad one day, when a person passed by him and said: ‘<em>Toobah</em> (a tree in Paradise) for these two eyes which saw the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>: ‘I swear by Allaah that we wish we had seen what you have seen and witnessed what you witnessed.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Miqdad became angry, I became astonished, because they did not say anything but good. Then he turned to the man and said: ‘What makes a person wish that he was present when Allaah has made him absent.  He does not know, if he had witnessed it, how he would have been at that time? I swear by Allaah there were a people that were present at the time of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, who Allaah will throw on their nostrils in the Hell-Fire, because they did not respond to the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> nor did they believe in him. Do you not praise Allaah, for taking you out from your mothers’ wombs not knowing anything except your Lord and believing in that which your Prophet was sent with. Indeed you have been saved from trials by others being trialed instead of you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I swear by Allaah, that Allaah sent the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> in the severest time that any Prophet from among the Prophets was ever sent, in any period of time including the <em>Jahileeyah</em> time period (period of ignorance before Islaam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They would not regard any religion better than the worship of idols, then the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> came with the <em>Furqan</em> (the Criterion) he separated the truth from falsehood with this Criterion, and he separated a father from his son, so much so that a man would see his father and his son or his brother as a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed Allaah opened the lock of his heart with <em>Eemaan</em>, and he knows if he is destroyed he enters the fire, it does not make him happy that his beloved is in the fire. And it is about those that Allaah –Azza wa Jal – said: &lt;&lt;And those who say: ‘Our Lord! Bestow on us from our wives and our offspring the comfort of eyes&gt;&gt;’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Ahmad and Al-Albaani declared the <em>Isnaad</em> to be Saheeh</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Albaani commented saying:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘(Notice): This separating mentioned in this hadeeth has a foundation in ‘Saheeh al-Bukhari’ from the hadeeth of Jaabir bin Abdullaah who said: ‘The angels came to the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> while he was sleeping, some of them said: Indeed he is asleep and some of them said: ‘Indeed the eyes are asleep but the heart is awake…’ to the end of the hadeeth, and in this hadeeth it mentions: ‘So whoever obeys Muhammad <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> then he has obeyed Allaah, and whoever disobeys Muhammad then he disobeys Allaah, and Muhammad separated/divided the people.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Albaani) say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This hadeeth is a clear proof that shows that separating/division is not blameworthy in itself. So, some of the people push the people away from the <em>Dawa’</em> to the Book and the Sunnah, and they regard warning against that which opposes the Book and the Sunnah as being from the innovated matters, or they claim that the time to call to the Book and the Sunnah has not arrived! Their claim is that the Book and the Sunnah pushes people away and divides them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is great ignorance with regard to the truthful <em>Dawa’</em> and what is associated to this<em>Dawa’</em> from differences of opinions and hostility towards this <em>Dawa’</em>, as is witnessed in every time and place.  This is the Sunnah (the way) Allaah has ordained for His creation, and you will never find a change or turning off in the Sunnah (the way) of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And if your Lord had so willed, He could surely have made mankind one <em>Ummah</em>, but they will not cease to disagree,- Except him on whom your Lord has bestowed His Mercy &gt;&gt;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">By The Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ Muhammad Nasiruddeen al-Albaani </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is a summary of what the Shaykh al-Albaani (d. 1420 A.H.) said in the introduction to a book entitled ‘<em>Bidaytus – Sooli Fee Tafdeel Rasool </em><em>-salAllaahu ‘alaihi wassalam</em><em> as-Sharraffa w­­a Karrama</em>’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed I firmly believe that it is upon every Muslim who is sincere in his Islaam, to familiarize himself abundantly with a good amount of manners, which Allaah has honoured His Prophet with, in addition to the virtues that Allaah placed upon the Prophet in order for him to excel above all the worlds, from the Jinn and all of mankind altogether, rather even above those Angels who are close to Allaah Ta’ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This familiarization can be attained through the established evidences from the Book and the Sunnah, researching them and having the correct understanding of them, because indeed that is what will, – without any doubt – increase the Muslim in <em>Eemaan</em>, and sincere love for the Prophet  <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Love for the Prophet  <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> which is a primary principle that becomes firm in the heart of the believer is also connected to the love of Allaah<em>Ta’ala</em>, Who out of His Excellence sent us His Messenger, and blessed us – and Allaah Posses all blessings – with the Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Tabarak</em> <em>wa</em> <em>Ta’ala</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; He it is Who sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger from among themselves, reciting to them His Verses, purifying them, and teaching them the Book and <em>Al-Hikmah</em> (<em>As-Sunnah</em>). And verily, they had been before in manifest error &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is why the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There are three characteristics, whoever has them finds the sweetness of <em>Eemaan</em>: that Allaah and His Messenger are more beloved to him than other than them; that when he loves a person he loves him only for Allaah’s sake and that he hates to return to disbelief after Allaah has saved him from it just as he hates to be thrown into the Hell-Fire.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this love continues to rise in his heart until the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, becomes more beloved to him, more beloved than every respected person he knows.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘None of you truly believes until I am more beloved to him than his son, his father and all mankind.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know O brother Muslim, that it is not possible for anyone to rise to this level of love for Allaah and His Messenger except with the <em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> in His worship Alone [rather than to any other than Him].  And singling out the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, by following him from amongst Allaah’s slaves, due to the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; He who obeys the Messenger, has indeed obeyed Allaah &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Say: ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘No, by Him in Whose Hand is my soul, even if Moosa was alive today he would have no recourse except to follow me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Albaani) say:  so if it is not granted even for the likes of Moosa whom Allaah spoke to, to follow other than the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, then would it be granted for anyone other than Moosa?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is from the unequivocal/absolute proofs of the obligation of singularly following the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.  It is from the necessities of the testimony of ‘Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah.’ And this is why Allaah <em>Tabarak wa Ta’ala</em>stated it in the preceding Ayah, that following the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>alone is a proof of Allaah loving a person. And there is no doubt that whoever is loved by Allaah, then Allaah will be with him in all that he does, as is mentioned in the authentic <em>hadeeth</em> <em>al</em>&#8211;<em>Qudsi</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And My slave does not come closer to Me except with that which is more beloved to Me than what I have made obligatory upon him, My slave continues to come closer to Me with the optional deeds until I love him, if I love him I will be his hearing with which he hears, and the sight with which he sees, and his hand with which he grips and the leg with which he walks, and if he asks Me I will definitely give it, and if he seeks refuge then I will definitely give him sanctuary . . ..  ’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this is the divine concern that Allaah has for his beloved slave, then it is obligatory upon every Muslim to take those means which make him more beloved to Allaah. And this is done by no other way than singularly following the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8211; as opposed to anyone else. Only by doing this alone will one be granted the special concern from ones Master [Allaah] <em>– Tabaarak wa Ta’ala –</em>do you not see that there is no path to knowing that which is obligatory and distinguishing that from optional worship except by following the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>alone?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt, that when a Muslim becomes more knowledgeable about the biography of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, and knows more of his beautiful qualities and his excellence, then his love for the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8211; would be more, and thus his following of him <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>would be more extensive and more comprehensive.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What drove me to research and distribute this blessed booklet was for me to help my Muslim brothers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In reality my only goal in this life, after fulfilling the obligatory rights that Allaah has upon me, is to familiarize the Muslims through educating, lecturing and writing about the authentic <em>Seerah</em> of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, from all its different angles according to my capability. And to encourage them to take the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>as the only example to be followed, just as Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>encouraged them in doing so, in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a good example to follow for him who hopes in (the Meeting with) Allaah and the Last Day and remembers Allaah much. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and therein lies their happiness in the <em>Dunyaa</em> and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last piece of work that I worked on was about a year ago (1401 A.H.) when I summarized the book ‘<em>Shammail al-Muhammadeeyah</em>’ by <em>Imam</em> Tirmidhi.  I distinguished between the hadeeth being <em>Saheeh</em> and <em>Da’eef</em> by commenting upon them, this was while I was staying in my new place of migration ‘Amman’ [capital of Jordan], during a time of afflictions that interrupted me, simultaneously I was preoccupied with buying land and building my home.  After staying there for a few months, an event caused disruption resulting in my leaving my home and my family and travelling to the first place I migrated to: ‘Damascus’ where I went back and stayed for two days, and then from there to Lebanon in spite of a lot of turmoil and chaos making it a difficult place to reach.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed I then preceded to complete this book [<em>‘Bidaytus &#8211; Sooli Fee Tafdeel Rasool</em> <em>-salAllaahu ‘alaihi wassalam</em> <em>as-Sharraffa wa Karrama’</em>] despite great problems during this work, and with very upsetting news which caused me much pain, namely the death of my elder brother Muhammad Naajee Abu Ahmad during the season of Hajj, I continued completing this book whilst seeking mercy for my brother, being patient upon this affliction, due to his death. He was the best of my brothers and was the most sincere towards me, and the strongest from amongst them in response to my <em>Dawa</em>’ and he held a great concern for it. He was enthusiastic in calling to the <em>Dawa</em>’ may Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> bestow his abundant mercy upon him.  We were patient, my brothers and his children and his grandchildren and his in-laws with this affliction. May Allaah grant them someone good as he was a good predecessor for them, may Allaah gather us all with him under the banner of the master/leader of the son of Adam, Muhammad <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>&lt;&lt;The Day when there will not benefit [anyone] wealth or children But only one who comes to Allah with a sound heart.&gt;&gt; [26:88-89] and indeed we belong to Allaah and indeed to him is our return.  O Allaah reward me for my affliction and compensate it for me with better than that. O Allaah forgive Abu Ahmad and raise his rank amongst those who were guided to Islaam to the best of creation (the Prophet), and place someone to look after those still alive after him, and forgive us and him O Lord of all the worlds, and make his grave spacious for him, and make light in there for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed I have digressed a lot from what we were dealing with. Everything that happens to humans is protection under the Will of Allaah and His Compassion, so we return to what we were discussing, so I say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you can comprehend that which has preceded in that <strong>Allaah’s Love cannot be attained except by following His Prophet, you should therefore be concerned with following his Sunnah</strong>, and one should spend in that cause, strive with oneself completely. He should not be deceived by that which some of the deceived, misguided people are upon, from amongst the <em>Soofeeyah</em> and frivolous people, those who have taken their religion to be play and amusement, with <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Nasheed</em> (songs) and tunes. <strong>By which they claim that they please Muhammad </strong><strong><em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em></strong>with that which they call ‘religious <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Nasheed</em>’ and they play them constantly for their<em>Dhikr</em> (meetings for remembrance of Allaah) and in their gatherings, which they organize on innovated Eids like the <em>Eid</em> of <em>Mawlid</em> (celebrating the Prophet’s birth) etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed they are –and I swear by Allaah– clearly misguided, and are deviated from the truth.  How can they not be in clear misguidance since they have mixed up the <em>Deen</em>with false amusements, and they have blindly copied shameless singers, with their rhythmical musical tunes, <strong>and they adhere to this in their <em>Soofi</em> paths which kill the hearts</strong>, and divert them from the remembrance of Allaah and the recitation of the Qur’aan.  The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘He is not from us who does not recite the Qur’aan in a beautiful way.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is especially because they add singing to musical instruments and clapping thus completing the resemblance between the two different groups. That is then broadcasted by some foreign radio stations, not only the Arab radio stations. Trying to please the people in the name of <em>Dhikr</em> (remembrance of Allaah) or religious <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Nasheed</em>!  And regretfully some of the religious radio stations have began to follow their footsteps for which Allaah’s aid is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has even reached me that some of the visual broadcasters (Television) have presented some of these <em>Dhikr</em> (remembrances of Allaah) or religious <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Nasheed</em>, as if it is from Islaam, and that it is from the characteristics of sincerity in which Muslims call to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will never forget, once a long time ago I visited a centre from some of the Islaamic organizations, and I was shocked to hear the sound of the <em>Adhaan</em> chanted with musical instruments!  So I questioned them regarding it?  It was said:  ‘It is some Muslim youth from some Arab countries who have come as guests to this organization, and one of them lets them hear the <em>Adhaan</em> with a musical chant,’ and now this is what we hear from many of the Islaamic radio stations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was finally brought to the attention of some Muslim youth, concerning that which those <em>an-Nasheed</em> contain of evil and deviancy opposing the Islaamic <em>Sharia’</em>, so they modified it to a different type of <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Nasheed</em> which talked about enthusiasm, strength and reminders of Islaamic heroism, and they would also adhere to some musical chanting and some of them have even added some musical instruments like the <em>Duff</em>(Arabic drum) etc. to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, I heard it, with my own ears in some music stores, something of the like, so I spoke with them, due to that which is obligatory in the <em>Deen</em> by way of advising them and reminding them that it is not allowed, especially since many of them have begun listening to <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Nasheed</em> as a habit, and it has busied them from reciting Qur’aan or listening to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this is from the evil of the deviancy of keeping away from the <em>Salaf</em>, indeed I am certain that this was not from their practice, even though they used to sometimes recite poetry in wars and battles. This practice is one thing and taking that and applying to it a musical chant and making it a habit and resembling the practice of the people of evil and mere amusements, then that is something else, and it is not hidden from the people of knowledge and insight.  May Allaah have mercy upon the one who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Every good is in the following of the <em>Salaf</em> * and every evil is in the innovations of the <em>Khalaf</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summary: Indeed I advise everyone who reads this book, that they do not suffice with the knowledge in it but follow that up with hopeful consequences which is to sincerely follow this great Messenger, which necessitates the love of Allaah, and His Forgiveness for ones sin, &lt;&lt;and this is the great success&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘We ask Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> that He makes us from them.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Consequence of the One who Does not Believe in the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;<br />
</em>Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;">By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’  </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 157 – From Abu Hurairah from the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘By Him in whose Hand is my soul; there is not a person who hears about me from this<em>Ummah</em>, not a Jew, nor a Christian, then does not believe in me, except that he will be from the people of the Hell-Fire.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ibn Munda in ‘Tawheed’ and Muslim in his Saheeh, likewise Abu ‘Awaanah and Ahmad]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">‘The hadeeth is clear in that whoever hears about the Prophet  <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and what he was sent with, and then it reaches that person in the way that Allaah revealed it to the Messenger  <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>, and does not believe in the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> then his path is to the Hell-Fire.  There is no difference in this between a Jew, or a Christian, or a fire-worshipper, and the atheist.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">My belief is that if many of the non-Muslims were granted the opportunity to become acquainted with the principles, beliefs and worship that Islaam came with, then they would hasten to enter into Islaam in crowds, as it occurred in the beginning of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">If only some of the Islaamic countries would send callers to the western countries, from those who have knowledge of Islaam and know its reality, and that they know what has attached itself to Islaam from superstitions, <em>Bida’</em> (innovations) and lies. So that the one who calls to Islaam will be able to present it in a good manner to those he is calling, and this requires the caller to have knowledge of the Book and the authentic Sunnah, and he knows some of the common foreign languages. This is a matter which is honourable and it is something nearly lost.  So this issue requires keen preparation, so perhaps they will begin this preparation.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from Silsilah Ahadeeth as-Saheehah  by Shaykh al-Albaani (vol 1/157)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 3093 From Sa’eed bin Jubair <em>Mursal</em> that the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">‘There is no-one who hears about me from this <em>Ummah</em>, not a Jew, nor a Christian, then does not believe in me, except that he will be from the people of the Hell-Fire.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Sa’eed bin Jubair said: ‘I began to say: Where is the confirmation of that in the Book of Allaah?!’ Sa’eed continued: ‘It was very rare that I heard a hadeeth from the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> except that I found a confirmation for that in the Qur’aan; until I found this <em>Ayaah</em>: &lt;&lt; وَمَنْ يَكْفُرْ بِهِ مِنَ الْأَحْزَابِ فَالنَّارُ مَوْعِدُهُ &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;but those of the sects (Jews, Christians and all the other non-Muslim nations) that reject it (the Qur’aan), the Fire will be their promised meeting-place &gt;&gt; includes all the different nations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Tabari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">‘It is possible to include this hadeeth to be from what is a clarification and explanation of the saying of Allaah Ta’ala: &lt;&lt; وَمَا كُنَّا مُعَذِّبِينَ حَتَّى نَبْعَثَ رَسُولًا &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning).&gt;&gt; along with the point where the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>said: ‘hears of me’ i.e. that he hears about the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> upon reality as a human, a Messenger, a Prophet.  So whoever hears about the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>upon other than what he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>was upon, other than what he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>was upon from guidance, light and excellent manners; due to some of the ignorant Muslims, or the misguided callers from the Christian evangelists and atheists, who present the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>to their people in other than his real way that he was well known for.  So the likes of these people have not heard of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>, and the<em>Dawa</em> has not reached them, so the warning mentioned in the hadeeth does not include them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">And this is like the saying of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>: ‘Whoever sees me in his sleep then it is as if he sees me in his wakeful state, since indeed Shaytaan cannot resemble me.’ [Silsilah Saheeh No.1004]  i.e. sees him in this real form and his characteristics which he was upon in his lifetime.  So whoever really claims that he saw an old Shaykh with a white beard, then he has not seen the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>; because this characteristic opposes that which the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>was upon, from that which is known from his characteristics <em>SallAllaahu Ta’ala alayhi wa Alahi wa sallam</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>Taken from the  ‘Original <em>Sifat</em> <em>as-Salah</em>‘ By Shaykh Muhadith Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani</strong><br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And ‘the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em> sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> used to raise his hands.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">_________________________________</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Summary:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani mentions the Narration of Anas bin Malik when the Qur’aanic recitors were killed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Anas said: I never ever saw the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>painfully agitated about anything as I saw him agitated over them. Indeed I saw the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> in the early morning prayer raising his hands and he supplicated against those who killed them.  [And in another narration: supplicating against them.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Ahmad (3/137)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>Isnaad</em> is authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At-Tabraani narrated in ‘Sagheer’ also from Anas with the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed I saw the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> whenever he would pray the early morning prayer, he would raise his hands supplicating against them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This portion was narrated by al-Bayhaqi (2/211) and Nawawi (3/500) said: ‘Its <em>Isnaad</em>is <em>Saheeh</em> or <em>hasan</em>’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a recommendation in this hadeeth of raising the hands while supplicating the<em>Qunoot</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Farj the freed slave of Abu Yusuf said: ‘I saw my master Abu Yusuf, if he would enter into the <em>Qunoot</em> for the <em>Witr</em> he would raise his hands in the <em>Dua</em>.’ From ‘Sharh al-Hidayah’ (1/306)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise Ahmad holds this opinion and so does Ishaaq.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The raising of the hands is established from the Ameer-ul-Mumineen Umar bin al-Khattab <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> as is narrated by Bukhari in ‘Rafa’ al-Yadain’ (23), Ibn Nasr (134) and al-Bayhaqi (2/212) on the authority of Abu Uthmaan an-Nahdi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Umar would perform the <em>Qunoot</em> with us in the early morning prayer, and would raise his hands, so much that the side of his body under his arms would be seen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for wiping the hands on the face after ending the <em>Dua’</em> in the prayer, then this is not established with an authentic narration, nor an authentic statement, nor by analogy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a <em>Bida’</em>, as for outside the prayer, then it is not authentic, and everything that is narrated regarding this is weak, some of it is more severe in its weakness than other narrations; I have researched it in ‘Da’eef Abi Dawood’ (262) and ‘al-Hadeeth as-Saheehah’ (597), this is why al-Izz bin Abdus-Salaam said in some of his <em>Fatawa</em>: ‘None does this except an ignorant person.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is foremost that it should not be done, and restricting to what the Salaf <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhum</em><em>&#8211;</em> did, of raising the hands in the <em>Dua’</em> without wiping the face in the prayer. And success lies with Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘the Original Sifat as-Salah’ vol 3 p.957-959]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Raising of the hands in the <em>Qunoot</em> for a problem afflicting the Muslims is established from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> when he made <em>Dua’</em>against the <em>Mushrikeen</em>, those who killed seventy of the recitors of the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was narrated by Imam Ahmad (3/137) and by Tabraani in ‘as-Sagheer’ (p.111) from the hadeeth of Anas with an authentic chain, and it is also established from Umar and others in the <em>Qunoot</em> of <em>al-Witr</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Irwaa al-Ghaleel’ (2/181)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>41- The Ruling of Raising the Hands in the <em>Dua’</em> of </strong><em><strong>al-Witr</strong><br />
</em>By Shaykh, <em>Allaama Mufti</em> of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Abdul Azeez bin Abdullaah Bin Baz</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is the ruling of raising the hands in <em>al-Witr</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Raising the hands in the <em>Qunoot</em> of <em>al-Witr</em> is legislated; because the <em>Qunoot</em> is from the same type as the <em>Qunoot</em> when new hardships occur for the Muslims, and this is indeed established by the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, that he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> raised his hands when he made <em>Dua’</em> in the <em>Qunoot</em> when new hardships occur for the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was collected by al-Bayhaqi <em>–Raheem’ullaah-</em> with a authentic chain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Majmoo Fatawa wa Maqalaat Mutafariqa’ vol.30 p.51 ]</p>

</em></strong>Collected by Zakareeyah bin Ghulam Qadir</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) From Abu Uthmaan who said: ‘Umar used to read the <em>Qunoot</em> with us after <em>Rukoo’</em>and he would raise his hands so much so that the side of his body would be seen, and his voice could be heard from the back of the <em>Masjid</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ibn Abee Shaybah (3/316), Bayhaqi (2/212) &amp; Ibn al-Mundhir (5/213)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b) From Ibn Abbas that he prayed the <em>Qunoot</em> with the people at <em>Fajr</em> in Basrah, and he raised his hands so much so that the side of his body was raised up.’</p>
