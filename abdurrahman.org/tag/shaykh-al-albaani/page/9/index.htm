		<p style="text-align:justify;">Author:Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee<br>
Source:Qiyaam Ramadaan (pg. 34-41)<br>
Translator:Al-Manhaj.Com Staff</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>It&#8217;s Prescription:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. &#8216;Itikaaf (secluding oneself in the masjid) is a recommended act in Ramadaan as well as any other day in the year. The source for that is found in Allaah&#8217;s saying: <b>&#8220;&#8230;while you are making &#8216;Itikaaf in the masaajid.&#8221;</b> And there are also many authentic ahaadeeth about the Prophet&#8217;s (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) &#8216;Itikaaf and narrations from the Salaf about it also. They are mentioned in the Musannafs of Ibn Abee Shaybah and &#8216;Abdur-Razzaaq.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is authentically reported that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) made &#8216;Itikaaf in the last ten days of Shawaal,[1] and that &#8216;Umar (raa) said to the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam): <b>&#8220;I made an oath (to Allaah) in the Days of Ignorance that I would make &#8216;Itikaaf for one night in the Masjid Al-Haraam, (should I do it)?&#8221; The Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) responded: &#8220;Fulfill your oath.&#8221; So he made &#8216;Itikaaf for one night.</b> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Observing it in Ramadaan is established in the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah (raa): <b>&#8220;Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) would make &#8216;Itikaaf for ten days in every Ramadaan. But when it was the year in which he died, he made &#8216;Itikaaf for twenty days.&#8221;</b> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The best time to do it is in the last part of Ramadaan because the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) would make &#8216;Itikaaf during the last ten days of Ramadaan until Allaah took his soul (in death). [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>It&#8217;s Conditions:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. It&#8217;s observance is not legislated except in the masaajid, based on Allaah&#8217;s saying: <b>&#8220;And do not have intercourse with them (your wives) while you are making &#8216;Itikaaf in the masaajid.&#8221;</b> [5] And &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (raa) said: <b>&#8220;The Sunnah for the one doing &#8216;Itikaaf is that he should not go out (of the masjid) except for some need that he must fulfill. He should not witness a funeral, nor should he touch his wife, or have intercourse with her. And there is no &#8216;Itikaaf except in a masjid that establishes the Jamaa&#8217;ah (congregational prayer). And the Sunnah for the one doing &#8216;Itikaaf is that he should be fasting (on the day he makes &#8216;Itikaaf).&#8221;</b> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The masjid should also hold the Jumu&#8217;ah prayers so that he is not forced to leave the masjid to pray the Jumu&#8217;ah prayer. This is because going out for it is an obligation, based on &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah&#8217;s saying in one of the narrations from the previous hadeeth: <b>&#8220;&#8230;and there is no &#8216;Itikaaf except in a masjid that holds the Jumu&#8217;ah prayer.&#8221;</b> [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, I came upon an authentic hadeeth that clearly specifies the <b>&#8220;masaajid&#8221;</b> mentioned in the previous ayah to mean the three masaajid: Masjid Al-Haraam, Masjid An-Nabawee and Masjid Al-Aqsaa. The hadeeth is: <b>&#8220;There is no &#8216;Itikaaf except in the three masaajid.&#8221;</b> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to what I came across, those among the Salaf who held this opinion were Hudhayfah Ibn Al-Yamaan, Sa&#8217;eed Ibn Al-Musayyib and &#8216;Ataa. However, he (&#8216;Ataa) did not mention Masjid Al-Aqsaa. Others held the opinion that it was any congregating masjid (in which the Jumu&#8217;ah prayer is held), without restriction. And yet others disagreed saying it can even be done in the masjid of one&#8217;s home. And there is no doubt that adhering to what complies with the hadeeth about it is what deserves to be followed. And Allaah, Glorified and Exalted, knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. It is from the Sunnah for the one making &#8216;Itikaaf to observe fasting, as has been stated by &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (raa). [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>What is permissible for the person making &#8216;Itikaaf:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. It is permissible for him to leave the masjid in order to fulfill a need. It is also permissible for him to stick his head out of the masjid to have it washed and combed. &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (raa) said: <b>&#8220;The Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) entered his head in my presence while he was making &#8216;Itikaaf in the masjid, and I was in my apartment. So I would comb his hair, [and in one narration: I would wash it, even though there was the threshold between me and him, and I would be menstruating], and he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) would not enter the house unless he had a [human] need, while making &#8216;Itikaaf.&#8221;</b> [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. It is permissible for the one making &#8216;Itikaaf and others to make wudoo (ablution) in the masjid, based on the saying of a man who would serve the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam): <b>&#8220;The Prophet would make a light wudoo (ablution) in the masjid.&#8221;</b> [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. He may set up a small tent in the back of the masjid in which to make &#8216;Itikaaf. This is since &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (raa) would set up a <i>khibaa</i> [12] (tent) for the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) when he would make &#8216;Itikaaf. And this was from his (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) command. [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And one time he made &#8216;Itikaaf in a small tent that had a mat covering its doorway. [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Allowance of a woman to make &#8216;Itikaaf and visit her husband (who is making &#8216;Itikaaf) in the masjid:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. It is permissible for a woman to visit her husband while he is making &#8216;Itikaaf. And he may walk with her to bid her farewell up to the door of the masjid, based on the saying of Safiyyah (raa):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;The Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) was making &#8216;Itikaaf in the masjid during the last ten days of Ramadaan, so I went to visit him one night, and his wives were with him. So I spoke to him for an hour, then I got up to leave and he said: &#8216;Don&#8217;t rush, I&#8217;ll go out with you.&#8217; So he got up with me to escort me out.&#8221; And her dwelling used to be in the home of Usaamah Ibn Zayd. Then they walked until they reached the door of the masjid, which was by the door of Umm Salamah. Then two men from the Ansaar passed by and when they saw the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam), they rushed away. So the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: &#8216;Slow down! This is (my wife) Safiyyah Bint Huyai&#8217; So they said: &#8216;SubhaanAllaah, O Messenger of Allaah.&#8217; He (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: &#8216;Verily, the Devil flows through the human like the flowing of blood. And I feared lest he put some evil into your hearts.'&#8221; [Or he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: &#8220;something into your hearts.&#8221;]</b> [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In fact it is even permissible for a woman to make &#8216;Itikaaf along with her husband in the masjid or by herself, based on the statement of &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (raa): <b>&#8220;One of the wives of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) made &#8216;Itikaaf with him while she was in the state of Istihaada (bleeding between periods) [in another narration it states she is Umm Salamah] and she would see red (blood) or yellowish traces (come out of her). And sometimes we put a tray beneath her when she offered the prayer.&#8221;</b> [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And she also said: <b>&#8220;The Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) would observe &#8216;Itikaaf during the last ten days of Ramadaan, until he died. Then his wives observed &#8216;Itikaaf after him.&#8221;</b> [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is proof in this that it is permissible for the women to make &#8216;Itikaaf also. And there is no doubt that this is on the condition that their guardians grant them permission to do that. And it is also on the condition that the place is free from any <i>fitnah</i> and intermingling with men, based on the many evidences for that and also on the Fiqh principle: <b>&#8220;Preventing an evil takes precedence over bringing about a good.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Having sexual intercourse nullifies one&#8217;s &#8216;Itikaaf, based on Allaah&#8217;s saying: <b>&#8220;And do not have sexual relations with them (your wives) while you are making &#8216;Itikaaf in the masaajid.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (raa) said: <b>&#8220;If the person making &#8216;Itikaaf has sexual relations then he nullifies his &#8216;Itikaaf and must start it over again.&#8221;</b> [18] There is no recompense (<i>kaffaarah</i>) that is binding upon him due to a lack of anything being mentioned about that by the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) and his Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim and Ibn Khuzaimah (2223) and it is referenced in Al-Irwaa (966) and Saheeh Abee Dawood (2125)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Surat-ul-Baqarah: 187. Imaam Al-Bukhaaree used this ayah as evidence for hat we have stated above. Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr said: &#8220;The point of evidence found in this ayah is that if it were correct to do &#8216;Itikaaf in someplace other than a masjid, the forbiddance of having sexual relations would not be specifically mentioned, because sexual intercourse is forbidden during &#8216;Itikaaf according to the consensus of the scholars. So it is understood through the mentioning of <b>&#8220;masaajid&#8221;</b> that the meaning is that &#8216;Itikaaf is not correct except in it the masaajid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Reported by Al-Baihaqee with an authentic chain, and Abu Dawood with a sound chain. The following narration from &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah RAA is also form Abu Dawood, and it is referenced in Saheeh Aee Dawood (2135) and Al-Irwaa (966)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] Al-Bayhaqee reported on Ibn &#8216;Abbaas that he said: <b>&#8220;Verily, the most hated of things to Allaah are the innovations. And verily from the innovations is making &#8216;Itikaaf in the masaajid that are located in the houses.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] Reported by At-Tahaawee and Al-Isma&#8217;eelee and Al-Baihaqee with an authentic chain of narration on Hudhaifah Ibn Al-Yamaan RAA. And it is referenced in As-Saheehah (no. 2786) along with the narrations from the Sahaabah that comply with it, and all of them are authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] Reported by Al-Baihaqee with an authentic chain of narration and Abu Dawood with a sound chain of narration. Imaam Ibn Al-Qayyim said in <i>Zaad Al-Ma&#8217;aad</i>: &#8220;It is not reported on the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) that he made &#8216;Itikaaf while not fasting. Rather, &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (raa) said: &#8216;There is no &#8216;Itikaaf except with fasting.&#8217; And furthermore, Allaah did not mention &#8216;Itikaaf except with the fast. And the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) did not do it unless he was fasting. So the correct opinion is in the evidence, which the majority of the scholars adhere to: that fasting is a condition for &#8216;Itikaaf. And this is the opinion that Shaikh-ul-Islaam Abul-&#8216;Abbaas Ibn Tamiyyah favored.&#8221; And he adds to this that it is not legislated in the Religion that one who goes out to the masjid for prayer or other than that is supposed to make an intention for the amount of time he will spend in &#8216;Itikaaf. This is what Shaikh-ul-Islaam clarified in his <i>Ikhtiyaaraat</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Reported by Al-Bukhaaree, Muslim, Ibn Abee Shaybah, and Ahmad, and the first addition belongs to these last two (mentioned). It is referenced in Saheeh Abee Dawood (2131-2132)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] Reported by Al-Bayhaqee with a good chain and Ahmad (5/364) in abridged form with an authentic chain of narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] A khibaa is one type of house of the Arabs made from fur or wool, and it is not from hair. And it is set up on two or three props. See An-Nihaayah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim from the hadeeth of &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah. Her doing it is stated in the report of Al-Bukhaaree and his commanding it is stated in the report of Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] It is part of a hadeeth narrated by Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree, reported by Muslim and Ibn Khuzaimah in their Saheehs. It is referenced in Saheeh Abee Dawood (1251)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim and also Abu Dawood, and the last part of it is form him (Abu Dawood). And I referenced it in Saheeh Sunan Abee Dawood (2133 &amp; 2134).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16] Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and it is referenced in Saheeh Sunan Abee Dawood (2138). The other narration is from Sa&#8217;eed Ibn Mansoor, as is I stated in Fath-ul-Baaree (4/281). However, Ad-Daarimee (1/22) says that she is Zaynab, and Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17] Reported by Al-Bukhaaree, Muslim and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18] Reported by Ibn Abee Shaybah (3/92) and &#8216;Abdur-Razaaq (4/363) with an authentic chain of narration. And what is meant by his saying: <b>&#8220;must start it over&#8221;</b> is that he must redo his &#8216;Itikaaf.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Foreword by the translator</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, Lord of all the worlds, May His prayers and blessings be upon the final Prophet Muhammad, his Family, his Companions and all those who follow his way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From amongst the greatest blessings of Allaah Ta&#8217;aala upon this Ummah is that He has placed wisdom in the hearts of the people of knowledge. Just as one of the Salaf said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever has many Aathaar (narrations), then he speaks with wisdom.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from amongst the people of knowledge of our time was the great Muhadith, Faqih, Allaama ash-Shaykh Muhammad Nasir ud-Deen al-Albaani – May Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book is an amended transcript of one of the many, many sittings with the illustrious Shaykh, where he was asked about the issue of Takfeer. The sitting took place in Jordan. The transcript was amended by the Shaykh to make it suitable for print.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask our Lord Azza wa Jal to make this work a beacon of light, illuminating the path for those who have lost the way. We also ask Him to reward our noble Shaykh al-Albaani and place him in the hereafter among the ranks of the Prophets, the truthful, the martyrs, and the righteous, and they are the best of companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Abbas Abu Yahya</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To Proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed all Praise belongs to Allaah, we praise Him, we seek His aid, and we seek His forgiveness. We seek refuge in Him from the evil of our selves, and the evil of our actions. Whom ever Allaah guides, there is none to misguide him, and who ever Allaah leaves astray then there is none that can guide him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah Azza wa Jal, Alone without any partner, and I testify that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the issue of Takfeer generally, is not only for the rulers, but it is also for the ruled. It is an old and extensive fitnah that was germinated by a sect from the Islaamic sects of old who were known as the khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is with great sadness that – some of the callers to the Deen or those who are too enthusiastic &#8211; have fallen outside the realm of the Book and the Sunnah! But in the name of the Book and the Sunnah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason for this goes back to two points:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first reason is them being shallow in knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second reason is &#8211; and this point is very important &#8211; that they never understood the regulations of the Sharia&#8217;. The Sharia&#8217; is the foundation of the Authentic Islaamic Dawah. All those who are outside the Authentic Islaamic Dawah are regarded as being from the deviated sects away from the Jamaa’aah which the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; praised in more than one hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding this Jamaa’aah which even our Lord Azza wa Jal mentioned, and explained that whomsoever went outside this Jamaa’aah has indeed broken away from Allaah and His Messenger. That is the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And whosoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been clearly shown to him and follows other than the path of the believers. We shall keep him in the path he has chosen and burn him in Hell – what an evil destination.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So indeed Allaah Ta’ala, in a matter, that has a very clear command according to the people of knowledge – did not summarize His statement by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And whosoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been clearly shown to him . . . We shall keep him in the path&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The clearest evidence here is that Allaah associated contradicting and opposing the Messenger with following a way other than the believers&#8217; path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And whosoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been clearly shown to him and follows other than the path of the believers. We shall keep him in the path he has chosen and burn him in Hell – what an evil destination.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Principle of Understanding the Book &amp; the Sunnah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, following or not following the path of the Believers is a very important matter in relation to complying or denying that path. So whosoever follows the path of the Believers, then he is successful with the Lord of the worlds and whosoever differs from the path of the Believers, then Hell is sufficient for him – and what an evil destination.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this point, numerous groups, old and new deviated because they never sufficed themselves to adhering to the path of the Believers. Instead, they rode on their own intelligence. Instead, they followed their own desires in trying to understand the Book and the Sunnah. Then they built upon their desires, their very dangerous results, and with that they left what the Salaf-As-Saalih – may Allaah be pleased with all of them- were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; emphasized this section of the noble Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;follows other than the path of the believers&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; emphasized it by using an eloquent emphasis, in more than just one authentic prophetic ahadeeth. These ahadeeth, which I will indicate to and mention some of, are known amongst the general Muslims, let alone the scholars of the Muslims. But what is unknown about these ahadeeth, is that they direct one towards the obligation and necessity of adhering to the path of the Believers in their understanding of the Book and Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This point has been forgotten – and its importance and its necessity have been forgotten by many of the specific people, not to speak of those who have become known – in these modern times &#8211; as &#8216;Jama’at Al- Takfeer &#8216;! Or by some of those kinds of groups who ascribe themselves to Jihaad, whereas in reality they are the scattered, defeated remnants of Takfeer! !</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From amongst these types of people, there may be some who may very well in the depths of their hearts be righteous and sincere people. However, this alone is not sufficient for its possessor to be successful and for one to prosper with Allaah Azza wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this it is necessary for the Muslim to combine two points:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">•Having truthful sincerity in ones intention, with Allaah Azza wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">•Following correctly what the Prophet &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; was upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not only sufficient for a Muslim to be sincere and serious in respect to acting with the Book and the Sunnah and calling towards it. But, in addition to this, his methodology should be correct, good and upright; and his methodology cannot be complete in itself except by following what the righteous Salaf of this Ummah were upon – may Allaah be pleased with them all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From these well known and established ahadeeth &#8211; that build a foundation for what I have said – as I indicated previously it is the hadeeth of the 73 sects, and it is none other than the saying of the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Jews had split up in to 71 sects and the Christians had split up into 72 sects, and my nation will split up into 73 sects all of whom will be in the fire except one. The Companions asked, ‘Which one O Messenger of Allaah?’ He replied: The Jamaa’aah.” In another narration: “What I am upon and my Companions are upon.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we find the Prophet&#8217;s answer, agreeing perfectly with the previous Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Follows other than the path of the Believers&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, those who primarily enter into the generality of this Ayah are: the Companions of the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, since the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; was not content in this hadeeth with just saying: “What I am upon…..”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps this would actually be sufficient for the Muslim who truly understands the Book and the Sunnah. But he &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – adapted practically Allaah’s saying, when Allaah characterized His Prophet that he was:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;For the Believers he is full of pity, kindness, and mercy&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is from his &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – perfect kindness and his complete mercy for his Companions and his followers, that he &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – clearly illustrated for them the distinction of the saved sect. Which implies that the are people and companions of the saved sect are upon what the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – was also upon, and what his Companions were upon after him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is not allowed – for the Muslims generally and the callers to Islaam specifically &#8211; to be content with just understanding the Book and Sunnah using the means of understanding which are well known. Such as knowledge of the Arabic language, the knowledge of abrogated and abrogative texts and other such rules. But it is necessary, primarily to return in all of this back to what the Companions of the Prophet &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -were upon, because they were – which is clear from their traditions and their biographies – the most sincere to Allaah Azza wa Jal in worship. They had more of an understanding of the Book and the Sunnah than us, and many other praise worthy characteristics with which they were shaped, and cultivated with its exquisite manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What resembles this hadeeth perfectly – in respect to its fruits and benefits &#8211; is the hadeeth of the Rightly Guided Khulafaah, which is narrated in the books of as-Sunnan from the narration of al-Irbaad bin Saireeyah &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with him. He said that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -gave us an admonition which caused hearts to tremble, and eyes to shed tears.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we said, “It is as if this is a farewell speech, so advise us O Messenger of Allaah!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: “I advise you to hear and obey, even if an African slave rules over you, and indeed whomsoever from you lives will see many differences, so hold on to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Khulafaah after me, bite on to it with your molar teeth……………….” To the end of the hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof from this hadeeth is also the same evidence from the answer of the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -about the previous question (about the 73 sects). In as much as he compelled his nation to follow the characteristics of his Companions due to their adherence to his Sunnah, and he did not limit it to just that, but rather he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“……And the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Khulafaah after me.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is necessary for us – and this being our situation &#8211; to constantly repeat always and forever this fundamental principle. If we intend to understand our Aqeedah, understand our worship, and understand our manners and behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is necessary for us to return to our Salaf-us-Saalih to understand all these matters, which are necessary for a Muslim, so that he can actualize in himself &#8211; with sincerity – that he is from the Saved Sect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this point many of the sects of old and new have deviated, when they did not pay heed to the evidence in the previous Ayah, and to the significance of the hadeeth of the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Khulafaah, and likewise the hadeeth of the splitting of the Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it was completely natural that they deviated like those who deviated previously from the Book of Allaah, and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; and the manhaj of the Salaf-us-Saalih.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From those who deviated were the Khawaarij of old and of recent times!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the foundation of the fitnah of Takfeer in this era &#8211; rather, since a long time &#8211; is surrounding the Ayah, which they themselves always keep mentioning, which is none other than His Ta&#8217;alaa saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And whosoever does not judge with what Allaah has revealed are the kuffaar&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they take this Ayah without a deep understanding, and they present it without detailed knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We know that this noble Ayah has been repeated and ends with three different wordings:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;so they are kuffaar&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;so they are oppressors&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;so they are transgressors/sinners&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is from complete ignorance that those who reason with just this Ayah with its first wording which is : &#8220;so they are kuffaar&#8221; that they have not become acquainted with – at the very least &#8211; with some of the other texts of the Sharia&#8217;, whether from the Qur&#8217;aan or the Sunnah, in which the word (al-kufr ) is mentioned. Instead they have taken it – without any understanding to mean exiting from the Deen, and that there is no difference between the one who fell into kufr, and between those mushrikeen from the Jews and the Christians and followers of the other faiths outside the faith of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas the word al-kufr in the language of the Book and the Sunnah does not – always &#8211; carry this meaning, which they constantly repeat, and attempt to impose their wrong and erroneous understanding.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The matter of this word (al-kufr ) whereas it does not direct to one meaning, is also the matter of the other two words &#8220;the oppressors&#8221; and &#8220;the transgressors/sinners&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just like the one who is characterized as an oppressor or sinner does not necessarily mean that he is someone who has apostated from the Deen, so the same goes for the one characterized that he is a kaafir, that it does not necessarily mean that he is someone who has apostated from the Deen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This diversity in the meaning of one word, that is indicated by the language, and the Sharia&#8217; came with the Arabic language; the language of the Noble Qur’aan. Due to this, it is obligatory on those who want to issue judgment on the Muslims; &#8211; regardless if it is the ruler or the ruled &#8211; that they be upon knowledge of the Book and Sunnah and in the light of the Salaf Saalih.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not possible to understand the Book and the Sunnah – and also what is contained within it- except with the path of the Arabic language and its literature, knowing it specifically and precisely. If the student of knowledge has a deficiency in the understanding of the language, what will help him in rectifying this deficiency is returning to the understanding of the scholars before him. Especially if they are the people from the first three generations that have been certified with goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A Kufr less than Kufr</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now we return to this Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;and whosoever does not judge with what Allaah has revealed so they are the kaafiroon.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is the intent of the word (al-kufr ) here? Does it take one outside of the Muslim Ummah or does it mean something else?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: It is necessary to have precision in understanding this Ayah. The Ayah could mean the kufr of action and that is leaving off some of the actions from the rulings of Islaam. In addition, what helps us in this understanding is the scholar of the Ummah and the interpreter of the Qur’aan, Abdullah bin Abbas -may Allaah be pleased with him. He was from the Companions that all Muslims are in agreement – except those who are from the deviant sects – that he is an Imaam in tafseer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is as if he heard in those days, the likes of what we hear today exactly, that there are people who understand the Aayaat on its apparent meaning without its explanation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abbas &#8211; may Allaah be please with him &#8211; said: “It is not the kufr which you understand to mean, indeed it is not the kufr which takes you outside the fold of the Ummah, it is a kufr less than kufr.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps he means the khawaarij &#8211; who rebelled against, the Ameer ul-Mumineen Ali &#8211; may Allaah be please with him – and as a result of that they spilled the blood of the Believers, and they did to the Believers what is not done even by the Mushrikeen. Ibn Abbas said: “The matter is not like what they have said or what they presume but indeed it is a kufr less than kufr.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the clear, precise answer from the explainer of the Qur’aan. The explanation of the Ayah, from which it is not possible to have an understanding other than this (i.e. kufr less than kufr) from the texts of the Qur’aan and the Sunnah, this is what we indicated towards previously in the beginning of this speech.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the word al-kufr, which is mentioned in many Quraanic texts and ahadeeth, is not possible to explain – regarding all these texts &#8211; that the meaning is equal to exiting outside of the Ummah. Like this is the example of the well-known hadeeth which is in the two authentic books of hadeeth (Saheeh Bukhari and Saheeh Muslim) on the authority of Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ood -may Allaah be pleased with him &#8211; said that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Cursing a Muslim is fassooq (sinful) and killing him is kufr.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the kufr mentioned here is sinning and it is disobedience, and the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – who is regarded as the most eloquent in expression &#8211; was intense in expressing rebuke, and he said: “…….. and killing him is kufr.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From another angle we can question, is it possible for us to understand from the first section of this hadeeth – “Cursing a Muslim is fassooq…………” with the same word fisq (sin) which is mentioned in the previous Ayah with the third wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whosoever does not judge with what Allaah has revealed so those are the fasiqoon&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer is; it could mean that the word fisq also corresponds in its meaning to the word kufr which means going out of the Ummah. It could be that the word fisq also corresponds in meaning to the word kufr which does not mean going out of the Ummah, but indeed it means just what the explainer of the Qur’aan said: It is the kufr lesser than kufr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth emphasizes that the kufr here could be with this meaning; because Allaah Azza wa Jaal mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And if two parties among the believers fall into fighting, then make peace between them both, but if one of them rebels against the other, then fight against the one that which rebels till it complies with the command of Allaah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed here our Lord has mentioned the rebel sect which fights the truthful believing sect, and along with this Allaah did not judge upon the rebel sect that they were kuffar, even though the hadeeth says: “. . . killing him is kufr.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore killing him is a kufr lesser than kufr, exactly like Ibn Abbas said in the explanation of the previous Ayah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Muslim killing a Muslim is oppression and aggression against him, and evil and kufr, but this meaning of kufr, could be kufr of action, and perhaps could be kufr of belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From here comes the precise detailed exposition whose explanation and commentary was given by the Imaam in truth, the Shaykh of Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him &#8211; and then after him his devoted student Ibn Qayeem al-Jawzeeyah who took on this responsibility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since they were blessed in making aware and explaining the division of kufr into these two divisions, whose banner was raised by the explainer of the Qur’aan with those concise and complete words. Ibn Taymeeyah &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him- and his student and companion Ibn al-Qayeem always repeatedly mentioned the necessity of distinguishing between the kufr of action and kufr of belief. Otherwise the Muslim would fall into, without knowing, the fitnah of rebelling against the community of Muslims, into which fell the khawaarij of old and some of their adherents of today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The summary of this is: indeed his &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; saying, “… killing him is kufr” does not mean, &#8211; in absolute terms &#8211; going out of the Ummah. There are many hadeeth regarding this. All these hadeeeth are irrefutable evidence upon those who only hold their own deficient understanding of this previous Ayah, and cling to the explanation that this is kufr of belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For now, this hadeeth is sufficient for us, because it is a definitive proof that a Muslim killing his brother Muslim is kufr with the meaning: kufr of action and it is not the kufr of belief!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now, if we return to the &#8216;Jamaat al- Takfeer &#8216; – or to those who branched off from them &#8211; and their accusation of the rulers and of those who live under their custody, and those who live under their leadership and those appointed by them, of kufr and apostasy!! Then this is built upon their evil view, which is they say: that these people have perpetrated a sin, so they have become kuffar because of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Relationship between Takfeer &amp; Rebellion</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the general matters which are beneficial to mention and narrate: I met some of those who used to be from Jamaaat al- Takfeer then Allaah Azza wa Jaal guided them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to them: here you call some of the rulers kuffar, so what do you think, for example of making the imams of masaajid kuffar, and those who give the khutbah, and those who give the adhaan in the masaajid, and those who render service to the masaajid?! What do you think about making Takfeer of the teachers of the knowledge of the Sharia&#8217; in schools, and other places, for example?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: they are kuffar because they are pleased with the rule of the rulers who judge without what Allaah has revealed!!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to them: If this &#8216;being pleased&#8217; was in agreement with the heart (i.e. belief), judging without what Allaah has revealed, then the kufr of action is altered to the kufr of belief. So, any ruler, who rules without what Allaah has revealed, and sees and believes that this ruling, is the appropriate ruling to be applied in this time! And that the ruling of the Sharia&#8217; from the text of the Book and Sunnah is not appropriate to be applied, then there is no doubt that this kufr of this ruler is the kufr of belief and is not the kufr of action alone, and whoever is pleased with this, and believes it, then he also falls into the same group.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I said to them: Firstly, it is not possible for you to make a judgment upon every ruler who rules with the western kufr laws or with even some of them, and that if they were questioned about judging with other than what Allaah has revealed?! They would answer; that ruling with these rules is the truth and correct in this time! And it is not allowed to rule with the rules of Islaam!! Otherwise, if they say this, they would – truly- become kuffar without doubt or suspicion!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, if we came down to the people who are ruled, and from amongst them there are the scholars, amongst them are the righteous people etc. So how can you judge upon them with kufr just because you see them living under the rule, which includes them just as it includes you exactly! But you declare them to be kuffar, and apostates and that ruling with what Allaah has revealed is obligatory! Then you make an excuse for yourselves and contradict yourselves: that differing with the judgments of the Sharia&#8217; with mere actions does not deem necessarily the ruling on the one who differs with the Sharia&#8217; that he is an apostate from his Deen!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is exactly what the people other than you are saying, whether you accuse them – wrongly – with the ruling of Takfeer and apostasy!!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from amongst the general discussions which show their mistakes and uncover their deviation, is saying to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When is a judgment given upon a Muslim that he has apostated from his Deen? A Muslim who testifies that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and perhaps he prays.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it sufficient just one time? Or is it obligatory to be announced that he has apostated from the Deen?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They would not know the answer! They will not be guided to the truth!! So we are forced to give them the following example; we say to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A judge, judges with the Sharia&#8217;; this is his usual practice and this is his system, but in one judgment he misjudged, and gave a judgment against the Sharia&#8217;, i.e. he gave the right to the oppressor and prohibited it from the oppressed, so this is – most certainly &#8211; judging without what Allaah has revealed! So do you say that his kufr is the kufr of apostasy?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will say: No, because this happened to him one time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We say: What if the same judgment was issued from him a second time or a different judgment in which he also differed with the Sharia&#8217;, so has he committed kufr?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we repeat this to them: he does this &#8216;three times!&#8217; or &#8216;Four times!&#8217; when do you say that he has committed kufr? It is not possible for them to place a limit on the number of his judgments in which he has gone against the Sharia&#8217;, by which he can be declared a kaafir!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The opposite of this is completely possible if it is known from him that he, in his first judgment deemed it correct to judge without what Allaah has revealed, &#8211; believing it is permissible to do so &#8211; and disapproved of judging with the Sharia&#8217;, then it would be correct to judge him with apostasy, even for this first judgment!<br>
Contrary to this, if we saw several judgments from him in a number of decisions in which he went against the Sharia&#8217;, and if we were to ask him why did you judge without what Allaah has revealed?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would reply saying: I was frightened and afraid for myself! Or I was bribed for example and that is worse than the first example, but along with this, it is not possible to say he is a kaafir until he declares what is in his heart, that he does hold the view of judging without what Allaah Azza wa Jaal has revealed, and only then is it possible to say that he is a kaafir, the kufr of apostasy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A summary of the speech: it is necessary to know that kufr, like fisq(sinning) and oppression is divided into two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Kufr and fisq and oppression which places one outside the Ummah, and all of these return to making it permissible by the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-The other does not place one outside of the Ummah; and all of these return to making it permissible by actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Making Takfeer of Sinners is not Allowed</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So every type of sin and specifically what is widespread in this time from what is regarded as permissible actions, such as interest, illegal sexual relations, drinking alcohol amongst them, all of these are kufr of action. So it is not allowed for us to make Takfeer of the sinners- who have been deceived by some of these sins &#8211; just because they have perpetrated a sin and regarded it as permissible actions for themselves! Except if it becomes apparent to us – with certainty – and it is unveiled with what is in the depths of their ownselves that from their Aqeedah they do not prohibit what Allaah and His Messenger have prohibited. So, if we know they have fallen into this opposition with their hearts, then we can judge that they have committed kufr, the kufr of apostasy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if we don’t know this, then there is no way for us to judge them with kufr, because we fear we will fall into the threat of the saying of his &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; : “If a man says to his brother: ‘Oh kaffir! Indeed it returns to one of them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many ahadeeth mentioned with this meaning. I will mention a hadeeth, which is a great evidence. It is in the story of that Companion who killed one of the mushrikeen .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the mushrik saw that he was about to come under the blow of the sword of the Muslim Companion, he said, “I testify that none is worthy of worship except Allaah!!” The Companion took no interest in that and killed him!! When the news reached the Prophet &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; he disapproved of it severely. The Companion mentioned an excuse that he did not say what he said except from the fear of being killed, but the answer of the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; was:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Did you open up his heart?!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore the kufr of belief does not have a fundamental connection with just actions, but it has a connection with the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is not possible for us to know what is in the heart of the faasiq (sinner) or the adulterer or the thief or the one who is a fornicator nor the one who takes interest, etc. Except if he confesses with his tongue what is in his heart. As far as his action is concerned then it is notification that he has opposed the Sharia&#8217;, with a differing of action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, we say: without doubt you have opposed the Sharee&#8217;ah! and indeed you have committed fisq(a sin)! and adulterated! But we do not say: &#8216;Indeed you have become a kaafir and apostated from your Deen&#8217;, until there manifests from him something which will be an excuse for us with Allaah Azza wa Jaal in judging him regarding apostasy and following that comes the well know ruling in Islaam which is none other than the saying of the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -:“Whoever changes his Deen then kill him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I said and I continue to say to those who constantly make Takfeer of the Muslim rulers: let’s suppose the kufr of these rulers is the kufr of apostasy! And suppose there was a ruler who was above them, then it would be obligatory – in this situation &#8211; on that higher ruler to implement the Islaamic punishment on them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, how do you benefit yourselves practically if we agree for the sake of argument that all of these rulers are kuffar, and their kufr is the kufr of apostasy?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What can you possibly do and establish?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the Takfeer is say: for the sake of &#8216;al Walaa wa al Baraa&#8217;, loyalty to the believers and disassociation from the kuffar!! Then we reply to them: loyalty and disassociation are connected to friendship and hate – by the heart and by actions -, and it is dependent on capability, therefore it is not conditional that you proclaim Takfeer, and declare apostacy, just because &#8216;al Walaa wa al Baraa&#8217; are present. Rather, friendship and hate could both take place in an innovator, sinner, or an oppressor!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I say to these people, here we have the kuffar, and they have occupied the many lands of Islaam! We are with sadness being trialed with the occupation of Palestine by the Jews. What is possible for us and for you to do about it? Is it important to stand – alone – against those rulers whom you think and claim are kuffar?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If only you had left this issue alone, and started laying down the foundation for the structure, on which the foundations of an Islaamic government stands, which is following the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -, this is how he educated his Companions, and they built from this source its system and its foundation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We mention this a lot, and we emphasize it a lot: that it is necessary for all Muslim organizations to work in truth, in order to bring back the rule of Islaam. Not only in the Islaamic lands, but on the whole earth, and that is the fulfillment of His Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;aala saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It is He who has sent His Messenger with the guidance the Deen of Truth, to make it superior over all other religions even though the Mushrikeen hate it&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What has been mentioned by prophecies in some of the prophetic hadeeth is that this Ayaat will be realized at a later time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For it to be possible for the Muslims to implement this Qur’aanic text and this divine promise, it is necessary to follow an evident path and a clear way. Will this evident path be by announcing a revolution against these rulers of whom it is thought that their kufr is the kufr of apostasy?! Then along with their suspicion, which is wrong and a suspicion which is mistaken, they cannot do anything!!<br>
So what is the methodology? What is the path?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No doubt that the correct path, which is an exemplary path, is what the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; used to constantly talk about and remind his companions about in every khutbah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammed &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam .&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is upon all the Muslims without exception and specifically those who busy themselves with the return of Islaamic rule, that they begin from where the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – began. We have labeled this in two concise words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Purification and Education</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because we know the firmly established reality, which is being neglected or more accurately purposely neglected, by those extremists who do not have anything except that they proclaim Takfeer of the rulers, and then nothing else!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they continue to proclaim Takfeer of the rulers then nothing stems from them, or about them, except discord and strife!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The calamities in these past few years which have been by the hands of these people, beginning from the discord (fitnah) of the Haraam of Makkah to the dissension in Egypt and the killing of Sadaat. Finally, in Syria and now in Egypt and Algeria- a sight that everyone can see; the shedding of the blood of many of the innocent Muslims because of these fitn, tribulations, and the occurrence of many trials and calamities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this because they opposed many of the texts from the Book and the Sunnah and the most important of which is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a good example to follow, for him who hopes in the meeting with Allaah and the Last Day and remembers Allaah much.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we really want to establish the rule of Allaah on the earth – in reality not just in a claim &#8211; then do we start with making Takfeer of the rulers while it is not possible for us to confront them – let alone fighting them &#8211; or do we start – with the obligation &#8211; the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; started with?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the answer is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a good example to follow……&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But what did the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -begin with?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is known – with certainty &#8211; to anyone who has smelt the fragrance of knowledge that he began with the Daw’ah between individuals whom he thought were ready to accept the truth. Then whoever was ready to respond to him, from the individuals of the noble Companions responded to him &#8211; as it is well known in the prophetic biography. Then the punishment and the severity befell these Muslims in Makkah. After that came the command for the first migration and the second until Allaah Azza wa Jal consolidated Islaam in al-Madeena al-Munnawara. From there began the skirmishes and the opposition. Also, the fighting between the Muslims and the kuffaar on one side and the Jews from the other.……etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore it is necessary for us to begin by teaching the people the true Islaam; like the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; had begun. Now we cannot just confine ourselves to teaching alone, because things have entered into Islaam which are not from it, and has no association with Islaam, from the bida&#8217; and innovations which were the reason for the clear downfall of the lofty status of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of this it is obligatory upon those inviting to Islaam to begin with purification of Islaam from what has entered into it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first principle – “Purification”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second principle – “Education”<br>
The education that is associated with this purification is the education of the young active Muslims on this pure Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we study the reality of the Islaamic groups which have existed, for nearly a generation, and their ideas and the practice of these ideas. We would find that many of them have not benefited themselves, nor have they benefited others with anything that can be remembered! Despite their outcry and noise, that they want an Islaamic government!! Which was a reason of spilling blood of the innocent with this baseless argument!! Without them having realised anything from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We continue to hear from their beliefs which are opposed to the Book and Sunnah and actions which are negated by the Book and Sunnah, let alone them trying, again and again with futile attempts which oppose the Sharia&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally I say: there is a statement which one of the propagators of Islaam said, which I used to hope that his followers would adhere to it and fulfill it, which is: &#8216;Establish the Islaamic state in your heart it will be established for you on the earth.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because If a Muslim corrects his Aqeedah built upon the Book and Sunnah, then there is no doubt that from this he will correct his worship, correct his behavior and his manners etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But, with regret, these fine words have not been acted upon by these people, they persist with an outcry to establish the Islaamic state but without any benefit! and it is said about them – and I swear by Allaah to this &#8211; what the poet said is true:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You hope for success and you do not follow its path<br>
Indeed a ship does not sail on dry land.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps in this what I have mentioned is persuasive enough for every just person, and a termination for every oppressor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We seek Allaah&#8217;s help.</p>

</span>Al-Ibaanah Magazine Issue No.1 &#8211; Dhul-Qa’dah 1415H / April 1995</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>What Benefits the Dead</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abû Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> “The likeness of wealth, family and the actions of the son of Âdam is of a man who has three companions. One of the man’s companions says: I am with you as long as you live; when you die, you have taken your share of yourself and you have taken your share of me &#8211; this is his wealth. The second companion says: I am with you until you reach that tree; you have had your share of yourself and your share of me &#8211; this is his family. The third companion says: I am with you in life and in death.”</i> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above authentic hadîth is in fact like the following hadîth in meaning and in subject matter. Anas said that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> “The dead person is followed (to his grave) by three: His family, his wealth and his actions. Two of them return and only one remains. His family and wealth return, but his actions remain.”</i> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These two ahâdîth show that actions alone endure and enter the grave with their doers. Both these ahâdîth also affirm the fact that anything other than actions &#8211; such as wealth, servants or relatives &#8211; are of no benefit at all. Rather, they all return (to this world). His wealth becomes the property of his inheritor, whilst his relatives and family do not grant him anything from Allâh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These ahâdîth intend to direct Muslims to be concerned with actions which will stay with them forever; and not to strive for wealth and position for the sake of relatives, family and servants. Apparently, the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> wanted to show us the value of good actions when he related these ahâdîth to us, (which can be found) in the books of <i>Zuhd</i> (renouncement of the world). He pointed out to us that because actions will last rather than wealth, you have to make your actions righteous. Part of making ones actions righteous is through good wealth that is earned lawfully and spent in a good manner. Then one gains the rewards of <i>’amalus-sâlih</i> (a righteous action).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Acceptable Action</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, in these ahâdîth, the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> encouraged us to make our actions righteous, whether gaining wealth or other things. However, we must remember a certain fact about this action, a fact that many people neglect. The explanation of this fact should actually be a complete lesson in itself; and it is that only a <i>righteous action</i> is beneficial, not just any action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what are the conditions that a Muslim must fulfill in order for the action to be righteous? This is shown in the statement of Allâh &#8211; <i>the Exalted and Sublime</i>: <b>“Say (O Muhammad): Verily I am only a man like yourselves, but revelation has been revealed to me that the One whom you should worship is only One Deity. And whoever hopes to meet his Lord, let him do righteous actions; and in the worship of your Lord, do not associate anyone along with Him.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Two Important Conditions</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Scholars of <i>Tafsîr</i> have said that the end of this verse is an indication that there are two conditions for an action to be righteous and acceptable: [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>Firstly</i></b>: That the action must be in accordance with the Sunnah. Therefore, if the action is done as an act of worship, but is not in accordance with the Sunnah, it is not a righteous action. The reason is that compliance with the Sunnah is one of the conditions for the action’s righteousness. The proofs of this are many, but it is enough to state one: The hadîth of the Prophet <i>sallallâhu </i> <i>’alayhi wa sallam</i> in which he said: <i> “Whoever innovates in this matter of ours what is not upon it, it shall be rejected.” </i>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, any action that was not part of Islâm when Allâh revealed it upon the heart of the Prophet Muhammad <i>sallallâhu </i> <i>’alayhi wa sallam</i> is not a righteous action. About this, Allâh &#8211; the Most High &#8211; says: <b> “This day I have perfected your Dîn for you and completed My favour upon you and I have chosen Islâm as your Dîn.”</b> [7] It must be remembered that <i>Bid’ah</i> (innovation) [8] is not divided into five categories, as some Scholars say. A proof for this is that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu </i> <i>’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> “Every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Hellfire.”</i> [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>Secondly</i></b>: That after being in accordance with the Sunnah, the action has to be sincere, purely seeking the Face of Allâh &#8211; <i>the Most High</i> &#8211; because Allâh says at the end of the aforementioned verse: <b> “And in the worship of your Lord, do not associate anyone along with Him.”</b> This means that the person seeks, by his righteous action, only the Face of Allâh &#8211; <i> the Exalted and Sublime</i>. However, if he seeks other than Allâh, then he has setup partners with Allâh (made shirk with Allâh), therefore his action is rejected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is confirmed by Allâh in an authentic hadîth Qudsî: <i>“I am so self-sufficient that I am in no need of having any partners. Thus, whosoever does an action for the sake of someone else as well as Me, will have that action rejected by Me, to him whom he associated with Me.” </i>[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consequently, if the action is righteous but not sincere for the sake of Allâh’s Face, it is rejected. Moreover, if the action is purely for the sake of Allâh’s Face, but not in accordance with the Sunnah, it is likewise not accepted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Worthless and Sinful Action</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these arc the two conditions for every action to be a righteous action. If one of these conditions is not present, the action does not become a righteous action, rather, it becomes an evil one. Had the person not done this action, it would have been better for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a man prays two <i> rak’ât </i> of prayer at night, while others sleep, then even if he prays them according to the Sunnah &#8211; without addition or deletion &#8211; but he does this so that people may talk about him and say: “This Person is a righteous man. He prays at night when the people are asleep,” then his action becomes <i> bâtil</i> (null and void), since he did not sincerely seek the Face of Allâh alone, but rather he sought the praises of people, thus becoming sinful by associating partners with Allâh in his action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if his action only became null and void, then the following hadîth would apply to him; and he would not be punished for this action: <i>“How many fasting people obtain nothing from their fasting except hunger and thirst. And how many people who stay up at night (praying), obtain nothing from their being awake except sleeplessness and tiredness.”</i> [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But this is not the case, for this person’s action has changed into a sin. The two <i> rak’ât</i> that this person performed without intending to seek only the Face of Allâh &#8211; <i>the Exalted and Sublime</i> &#8211; are the same as if he had disobeyed Him, that is to say: He will be punished for these two <i> rak’ât </i> because he associated others along with Allâh &#8211; <i> the Exalted and Sublime</i> &#8211; in his action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a man prays eleven <i> rak’ât</i> at night with the intention, in this worship, that his brothers would say about him: “This man is correctly following the Prophet; he does not add to the Sunnah,” his action becomes null and void; and his action changes to a sin against him. Rather, he must pray according to the Sunnah but sincerely seeking only the Face of Allâh &#8211; the Most High. He must be absolutely free of seeking the pleasure of others along with Him in this worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This has been but a summary about the action that does not leave the person but enters the grave with him &#8211; whether the action was good or bad &#8211; and that what is of benefit is the person’s righteous action. What is a righteous action and what are its conditions? The two conditions are:- <i><b>Muwwâfaqah</b></i> (compliance) with the Sunnah; and <i><b>Ikhlâs</b></i> (sincerity and purity of intention) to Allâh. Therefore, one must remember these two conditions and act upon them so that one may become righteous and pious.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Safeguarding against Insincerity</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many people unfortunately neglect the first condition (complying with the Sunnah) because they are astray and believe that <i> bid’ah</i> (innovation) is good in the religion.[12] But there are those upon whom Allâh has granted His favour, by guiding them to the Sunnah of the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>. They are those who know the reality of this condition and adhere to it the best they can. Yet they must pay attention to the second condition, which either group may fail to fulfill, and that is <i>riyâ’</i> (insincerity and showing-off). No one is exempt from <i>riyâ’</i> and all people are susceptible to it in their actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This matter is a very serious one and must be stressed here, so that we may know that we are in need of making our actions correct and purely for the Face of Allâh &#8211; <i> the Exalted and Sublime</i>. Part of this is that we are tested even while making <i> Da’wah</i> to the Qur‘ân and the Sunnah, for trials are not only in evil matters, but also in the good matters:<b> “And We test you with evil and good, by way of <i>fitnah</i> (trial).”</b> [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <i>da’wah</i> has been neglected by Muslims throughout the world so that the <i>du’ât</i> (the callers) have become strangers. Not only are they strangers in foreign countries, but they are strangers even in their own countries; amongst their relatives and brothers. This makes them praiseworthy, but they must not stand up to be praised for this <i>da’wah</i>. This is the reality, for the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>“Verily Islâm started as something strange and it will return as something strange, so Tûbâ is for the Strangers.”</i> [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Tûbâ and the Strangers</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of <i>Tûbâ</i> in the Arabic language is: “Praise and thanks.” The meaning according to the <i>Sharî’ah</i> refers to a tree in Paradise, which would take a rider a hundred years to traverse its shade. [15] This hadîth gives glad tidings to the newcomers of Paradise in which there is: <i>“What no eye has never seen, no ear has ever heard, and no heart has ever imagined.”</i> [16] This tree is mentioned in the Qur’ân in the statement of Allâh: <b>“<i>Tûbâ</i> is for them, and the best abode.”</b> [17] Therefore, <i>Tûbâ</i> is for the Ghurabâ (the Strangers), but who are they? The answer to this is in the reply of the Prophet: <i>“Those who correct [themselves and others], when the people have become corrupt.”</i> [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Need for Care</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These Strangers call the people to the revival of the Sunnah and eradication of all that differs from it. However, they must still pay attention to the second condition of the righteous action: To be sincere in their <i>da’wah</i>. They must neither seek fame, pride, nor arguments from their <i>da’wah</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They must not seek anything that <i>an-Nafs ul-Amârata bis-Sû’</i> (the soul that calls them to evil) orders them to do. Whatever they call to is as a result of Allâh &#8211; <i>the Most High </i> &#8211; having ordered them to make <i> da’wah</i> to the Qur’ân and the Sunnah and to make<i> da’wah</i> to what the Muslims have neglected. They must take care of this <i>da’wah</i>. However, they stand in danger. It can happen that one may say a word seeking only to have fingers of praise pointed at him, not sincerely advising the people and desiring to guide them. Rather, to do that for fame.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here we mention a saying of some <i>Sûfîs</i>, who have some wise sayings that can not be denied: “The love of fame breaks backs.” Therefore, I insist, that we who make <i> Da’wah</i> to the Sunnah be sincere in our actions so that when our actions enter the grave with us, it will help us to answer correctly when we are asked: “Who is your Lord? Who is your Prophet? What is your religion?” If the deed is evil, when the person enters the grave, he will deny it. His deed will come to him in the worst of forms. He will ask it: “Who are you?” It will say: “I am your deed.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Wealth &#8211; its Reality and Purpose</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The next Hadîth is also authentic. Abû Hurayrah said that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>“The servant says: My wealth! My wealth! However, he gets from his wealth three things: What he eats and finishes. What he wears and makes shabby; and what he gives away and pleases others with. Whatever else is besides this, goes and is left for the people.”</i> [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Hadîth also emphasises the subject of the previous ahâdîth. It shows us the care taken by people in amassing wealth. Allâh pointed this out in the Qur‘ân by His statement: <b>“And for the love of good he is strong.”</b> [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet depicted the nature of mankind for us in his saying: <i>“The servant says: My wealth! My wealth!”</i> Nevertheless, what is the amount that remains left over for him from his wealth? Is all his wealth for him? No! He gains from his wealth only the examples that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> specified. The first is defined by the Prophet’s statement: <i>“What he eats and finishes.”</i> From his wealth is that which is necessary for him to survive and that which enables him to accomplish the rights of Allâh. These rights are the rights of His <i> Tawhîd</i> (singling out Allâh alone for worship), as Allâh said: <b> “And I have not created the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.”</b> [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second is what a person wears until it becomes shabby. Add to this that which he volunteers and does good with, which is mentioned in the statement of the Prophet: <i>“Or what he gives away and pleases others with.”</i> He got rid of his wealth by giving it away to another in charity. Therefore, the wealth that is for the servant is the amount that he eats and the amount that he wears in order to survive. However this is not an end in itself. Rather, one exists solely to accomplish the obligation of worship, as we pointed out previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third kind of wealth that returns with a benefit is not only the obligatory charity, but it also includes non-obligatory charities. Then the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> explained what is left after these categories. He said: <i>“And other than that is gone, and is left, for the people.”</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The relation of this Hadîth with the previous one is: Why do people exhaust themselves in amassing wealth, when this is the reality of wealth? They do not benefit from there wealth except the amount that they eat, drink and with which they help other people. All else will be left and it will remain for the people who inherit it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following Hadîth is also <i>Sahîh</i> (authentic). Abdullâh ibn ash-Shikhkhîr said: I came to the Prophet whilst he was reciting: <b>“Seeking increase diverted you.” </b> The Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<i> “The son of Âdam say My wealth! My wealth! What do you obtain, O son of Âdam, from your wealth except that which you eat and consume, or wear until it becomes shabby, or what you give as charity and accomplish.”</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadîth is also similar in meaning to the previous one, though some of its words are different; and was recorded by Muslim, at-Tirmidhî and an-Nasâ‘î. This hadîth is clear in its wording, however, the statement of the Prophet at the end of the hadîth: <i>“or what you give as charity and accomplish.”</i> may not be clear to some people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Generosity and Miserliness</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This statement aims at drawing one’s attention to the fact that what is intended for charity is that which he actually gives away. It is not sufficient that a person should just make out a will, that he should give such and such to the poor, or such and such for a specific masjid. However, the Prophet calls our attention to the fact that benefit is in that wealth which a person actually gave away during his lifetime, since he did not really know what would happen with his wealth after he died, if he had made a will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">with this word, the Prophet points to a hadîth in the <i> Sahîh</i> of al-Bukhârî &#8211; the meaning of which is that the miser is one who when death comes to him makes a will and says: “Give so and so such amount and for so and so such and such amount.” The Prophet said: <i>“This was already for so and so and so and so.”</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> meant was that the deceased did not own anything anymore. He had left this <i>dunya</i> (life of this world ) and had entered into the <i>Âkhirah</i> (the Hereafter) and his inheritance will remain for those people who are still alive. Then should not the person have made his will earlier? Should he not have given charity whilst he was strong, hoping to be rich and fearing poverty?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the nature of the people today, they say: “Hoard your white Dirham for your black day.” They hoard this money for themselves for when they become old. They are covetous of this wealth. The generous person is the one who gives away his own wealth when his own soul is attached to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who is on the brink of death and who says: “Give so and so such and such amount,” he is a miser and is not generous. Rather, a truly generous person is one who gives charity whilst he holds onto his life and also whilst he loves this wealth very much.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Insignificance of this World</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The next hadîth is narrated by Jâbir ibn ’Abdullâh: The Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> passed by the market place coming from the direction of ‘Âliyah and people were around him. He passed by a dead kid goat (i.e. a baby goat) which had very short ears. He held it by its ears and said: <i>“Who amongst you would like to have this for a dirham?”</i> They (the Companions) said: We would not want it even for less than that! What can we do with it? He said: <i>“Do you wish to have it (for any price)?”</i> They said: By Allâh, even if it were alive it (we would not want it), as it has very short ears, let alone now when it is also dead! The Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> “By Allâh, this world is more insignificant to Allâh than this (goat) is to you all.”</i> [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let us return to the hadîth. He passed by the market place <i> “and the people were around him.”</i> Here I would like to pause a little in order to remind people about some of the guidance of the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> that most of the Shaykhs of today have neglected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykhs of today walk with their students behind them. This was not the way of the Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>. The ahâdîth describing this are many and the following is from them: “He used to walk side by side with Abû Bakr and side by side with Abû Hurayrah; and they all walked with each other.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, it is authentically proven that the Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> used to say to his Companions <i>radiallâhu ’anhum</i>, when he used to walk with them: <i> “Walk in<br>
front of me and leave my back for the angels.”</i> [24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here he highlights two matters from one saying. People do not see angels, they see only people. Therefore, if anyone saw the Messenger <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> walking, they would only see people walking in front of him. The Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said in the authentic hadîth: <i> “He who humbles himself for the sake of Allâh, Allâh will raise him.” </i>[25] His humbleness raised him to a degree whereby the angels walked behind him. Therefore, is a noble person one behind whom people &#8211; good or bad &#8211; walk; or is he the one who is followed by those described by Allâh in the following verse: <b> “They do not disobey what Allâh ordered them to do and do precisely what they are commanded.”</b> The nobility of the Prophet manifested itself in a visible and an invisible side. The visible side is that the Companions used to walk in front of the Prophet and not behind him. The invisible side is that the angels walked behind him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Of course, the first phenomenon is the one in which we are ordered not to act proudly with our companions and our brothers in faith, even those who may be less than us in knowledge, morals, worship and righteousness. This is enough for us, because Allâh says: “Do not sanctify yourself. He knows best the ones who are pious.” [26] It is sufficient for us at least, to walk with people side by side. Whosoever intentionally goes against this Sunnah, without doubt, does not truly love the Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>. This is because one’s degree of love from him, is based upon following him. This is established in the Qur’ân by the statement of Allâh: <b> “Say (O Muhammad): If you do love Allâh then follow me; Allâh will love you and forgive you your sins.”</b> [27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if this was the case with the Prophet who was infallible and protected from the whispering of the <i>Shaytân</i> and this was an indication of the level with his Companions, then what can we say about ourselves? We are not infallible and are not protected from the <i>Shaytân</i>. We must adhere to this Sunnah as if it were obligatory. It is better for us to walk with people around us than to walk looking with our eyes at the backs of their shoulders. The statement of the Prophet, at the end of the hadîth: <i>“By Allâh, this world is more insignificant to Allâh than this (goat) is to you all,”</i> is to be reflected upon by people of intellect!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The next authentic hadîth is similar to the previous hadîth. Ibn ’Abbâs said: The Prophet passed by a dead goat that had been thrown away by its owners. He said: <i>“By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, this world is more insignificant to Allâh than this is to its owner.”</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sahl ibn Sa’d said that the Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>“If this world was worth as much to Allâh as the wing of a mosquito, He would not have given a disbeliever even a sip of water.” </i>[28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Salmân said: Some people came to the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> and he asked them: <i>“Do you have food?”</i> They said: Yes. He asked: <i>“Do you have drink?”</i> They said: Yes. He said: <i>“Verily their outcome is like the outcome of this world, one of you stands behind his house holding his nose from their bad smell.”</i> This is the similitude of this world. What is the eventual outcome of food and drink? They change to stool and urine. Therefore, a person hates the smell for himself. This is the similitude of the outcome of this World.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following hadîth has the same meaning. Ubayy ibn Ka’b said that the Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>“Indeed the food of the son of Âdam is like the example of the world. Even if he puts spices and season into it, see what becomes of it.” </i>[29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is the eventual outcome of spices and seasoning in his food? Look at what it becomes! Likewise, this world becomes a similar thing except that which is for Allâh. The next hadîth explains this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abû Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> “The world and all that it contains is cursed, except for the remembrance of Allâh and what supports it; or a Scholar and a student.” </i>[30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>In Conclusion</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the reality of this world in the <i> Sharî’ah</i>, it has no value. The similitude of this world is like good food and drink: its outcome is decay. The exceptions arc those things which are done for Allâh whether remembrance of Allâh, knowledge or even food because it helps to support the worship of Allâh. These things are among the deeds of man that endure in this fleeting life. The goal behind these <i> ahâdîth</i> is that a person should not be overly concerned about this world, except with which is sufficient to keep him alive and strong; and sufficient enough to be able to accomplish the worship of his Lord. For if his wealth is greater than this, it will only benefit him by the amount of good that he does by helping others; otherwise, he is going to leave this wealth behind and it will not benefit him at all. However, what will benefit him are the righteous actions that he has done.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allâh not to put love of this world in our hearts, but to guide us to earn in this life what helps us to worship and obey Him. And all praise is for Allâh, Lord of the Worlds.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Author:Imaam Muhammad </span><strong style="line-height:1.5em;">Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee<br>
</strong>Source:Al-Asaalah (Issue #6) [E-Book: Fataawaa of Shaikh Al-Albaanee]<br>
Translator:isma&#8217;eel alarcon</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong> What is the religious ruling concerning buying in installments?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Answer:</strong> First of all, buying in installments is an innovation of the actions that was not known to the Muslims in every preceding generation. Rather it is from the aspects that have been passed onto them from the disbelievers, those who, in the past, took over their lands, colonized them and governed over them with their rules of disbelief. Then when they departed from the lands&#8217; major districts, they left behind their evil and misguided traditions. And, today, the Muslims live upon those practices and acts that the disbelievers imposed on them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is another concern – which is the most important – and it is as the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <strong>&#8220;I have not left anything that would bring you closer to Allaah, except that I have commanded you to do it. And I have not left anything that would distance you from Allaah, while bringing you closer to the Hellfire, except that I have forbidden you from doing it.&#8221;</strong> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this, we see that he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) forbade from that which today is called <strong>&#8220;buying in installments.&#8221;</strong> Therefore, this kind of business transaction is an innovation, which the Muslims of the past did not know of. I also want to say that this name is an innovation (in itself) for there is nothing found in the books of Fiqh with the name &#8220;buying in installments.&#8221; Rather, there is found in the Muslim books, that which is called <em>Ad-Dain</em> (debt) and that which is called <em>Al-Qard-ul-Hasan</em> (a goodly loan). This (latter) has become, in the daily affairs of Muslims, just a name without any form and reality to it. This is in spite of the Prophet&#8217;s (peace be upon him) incitement towards giving goodly loans and his going to great extents in that, to the extent that he regarded the lending of two dollars to be as if you gave one dollar away in charity. This means: If you lend your Muslim brother two dollars, it is as if you have taken a dollar out of your pocket and given it for charity. Just as he (peace be upon him) encouraged these goodly loans, he forbade from taking extra money in exchange for delaying your brother&#8217;s payment of his end of the deal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <strong>&#8220;Whoever makes two business transactions out of one, then he gets either the lowest of the two or the interest.&#8221;</strong> And in another hadeeth, he <strong>&#8220;forbade that two business transactions be made for one (transaction).&#8221;</strong> The reporter of this hadeeth was asked about the meaning of this forbiddance, so he responded: &#8220;It is that you say: &#8216;I will sell you this thing for such and such amount of money in cash, and for such and such (more) money in delayed payment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will sell you this appliance for 100 dollars in cash directly, and for 105 dollars in installments, meaning as a debt. He (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <strong>&#8220;Whoever makes two business transactions out of one, then he gets either the lowest of the two or the interest.&#8221;</strong> This means that if he takes the exra money, then it is interest, as is seen in the example of the appliance that was sold for 105 dollars, five dollars more in exchange for the delay.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If there were an Islaamic rule for individuals and rulers, this buyer who was deceived and had five extra dollars taken from him in exchange for the businessman&#8217;s waiting on the delay, he would have the right to take hold of him and complain about him to the people of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the understanding of this hadeeth. The thing being sold is one, however the offer is in two transactions: In cash directly for this amount and in delayed payment for that amount. So the increase of money for the delay in paying at once was labeled as interest by Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaani was born in the Ashkodera, capital of Albania in 1914 C.E. While he was young his parents migrated with him to Damascus, Syria. From an early age he became fascinated by the sciences of Hadith and thereafter spent his time devoted to seeking the knowledge. In later life he was given professorship of Hadith at the Islamic University of Madinah. He is well known to students and scholars for his knowledge and writings. He has many well-known students and has visited places throughout the MiddleeEast and Europe. He was forced to migrate to Syria to Jordan, then to Syria, then to Lebanon, then to the Emirates, then finally back to Jordan. He has been of enormous service to the Prophetic Hadith, taking great pains to check and sort out the authentic from the weak and fabricated narrations. He has produced many pamphlets and books, some of them running into many volumes &#8211; on topics of great importance to Muslims &#8211; and has fully checked many of the famous books of Hadith &#8211; the Sunan of Tirmidhee, Aboo Daawood, An-Nasaa&#8217;ee and Ibn Maajah, along with Suyootis huge &#8216;Jaami su-Sugheer&#8217; and Mishkat ul-Masaabeeh&#8217;. He is the foremost scholar of Hadith and related science of this age.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Text of Translation</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily all praise is for Allaah, we praise Him and seek His aid, and we ask for His forgiveness, and we seek refuge in Allaah from the evils of our own selves and from our evil deeds. Whomsoever Allaah has guided, none can misguide him, and whomsoever Allaah has mis- guided, none can guide him, and I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, without any partner, and I testify that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily the desire to make Knowledge easily accessible to the public has called me to explain the rites of Hajj and to do that by extracting these from my original book: <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>&#8220;the Hajj of the Prophet as narrated by Jaabir radhi Allaahu anhu &#8220;</strong></span> &#8211; in the same way that I produced an abridgement of my book on the Prophet&#8217;s manner of Prayer &#8211; except that I have here in included many important additions not found in the original &#8211; and I have been careful to record their source and authenticity &#8211; along with other additions with I have added in accordance with the method used in my other books as regards quoting the standard Hadith along with its source &#8211; in abridged form &#8211; while usually referring the reader to my other books &#8211; some of which have been published and some of which have not. As for what is to be found in my original book on Hajj, then I have not quoted the sources in full herein &#8211; regarding it as sufficient that reader should refer back to the original as it is widely available to the honorable readers &#8211; so anyone who wishes to check on such a point will find it easy to refer back to and I will refer to it as <strong>&#8216;The Original&#8217;</strong>. And to add to the usefulness of the book I have ended it with a brief mention of the innovations connected with Hajj and visiting Madinah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I have called it <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>&#8220;The Rites of Hajj and &#8216;Umrah&#8221; from the Book and the Sunnah and Narrations from the Pious Predecessors</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah the Blessed and Most High to make all my work good and sincerely for His Face and that should be no sharer in that with Him.</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Advice for those about to perform Hajj</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are some pieces of advice and useful points which I offer to our brothers about to make Hajj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Firstly.</b> The pilgrim must <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>fear his lord</strong></span> by obedience to Him, and must be very careful not to fall into that which Allaah has forbidden as Allaah ta&#8217;la says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">For Hajj are the months well-known. If anyone undertaken that duty therein, let there be no obscenity nor wrangling in the Hajj</span></strong>.&gt;&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Surat-al-Baqarah ayah 197]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He who performs Hajj and does not speak obscenely or commit evil then he returns from his sins just as the day his mother gave birth to him</strong></span>&#8220;,</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and if he did so then his Hajj would be accepted and Rasoolullaah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<strong>The accepted Hajj &#8211; there is no less a reward for it than Paradise&#8221; </strong></span>(1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he must be aware of what many are affected by because of their ignorance or misguidance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(A) Directing any form of worship to other than Allaah (<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>shirk</strong></span>). And we have seen many of the people falling into shirk &#8211; like praying fro the removal of distress or aid from the Prophets and the pious instead of from Allaah alone, and their taking oath by them in veneration of them &#8211; so by their actions they completely nullify their Hajj. As Allaah ta&#8217;ala says:(Soorat-ul-Zumar ayah 65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If you were to join gods with Allaah, truly fruitless will be you work (in life)</strong></span>.&gt;&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(B) Some men <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>shaving off their beards</strong></span> &#8211; as it is a sinful deed &#8211; and doing it involves four separate sins &#8211; as I have explained in &#8216;The Original&#8217;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(C) The wearing of <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>gold rings by men</strong></span> &#8211; and this is Haraam &#8211; even more so those which are known as <strong><span style="color:#000000;">wedding-rings</span></strong> as that includes the further sin of imitating the Christians.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Secondly.</b> Everyone who intends to make Hajj and has not brought the sacrificial animal (Hadee) with him (2) then he should intend to perform Hajj of Tamattu&#8217; [see the Glossary] &#8211; as the Prophet ordered his companions to do in the end, and as he became angry when some did not immediately carry out this order to change the intention from Hajj to an &#8216;Umrah and he صلى الله عليه و آله وسلم said: &#8220;I have entered the `Umarah into the Hajj until the Day of Resurrection&#8221;, and when some of the Companions asked whether he had done that only for that year or forever, the Prophet joined his fingers together and said: &#8220;I have entered the &#8216;Umrah into the Hajj until the Day of Resurrection, not just for a time, rather forever.(3) And because of this he ordered Fatimah and also all his wives &#8211; may Allah be pleased with them all &#8211; to leave the state of iHraam after finishing the &#8216;Umrah, and therefore Ibn &#8216;Abaas رضي الله عنه used to say: Whomsoever makes tawaaf of the House &#8211; then he has left iHraam &#8211; the Sunnah of your Prophet &#8211; even if you are averse to it.(4) So everyone who has not brought the sacrificial animal with him, should call out that he is going to make &#8216;Umrah &#8211; in the three months of Hajj, and he who has declared his intention to do Hajj Mufrad (Hajj on its own) or Hajj Qaarin then hears of the Prophet to change it &#8216;Umrah &#8211; then he should quickly obey even after reaching Makkah and Sa&#8217;ee between Safaa and Marwah &#8211; then he should leave the state of iHraam &#8211; then declare the intention for Hajj on the Day of Tarwiyyah &#8211; the 8th of Dhul Hijjah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who believe! Give you response to Allaah and His Messenger, when He calls you to that which will give you life&#8230;</strong></span>&gt;&gt;[Soorat-ul-Anfal ayah 24].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Thirdly.</b> You must not leave off <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>staying the night at Mina</strong></span> on the night before &#8216;Arafah as it is obligatory (waajib) &#8211; the Prophet did it and ordered it with his saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Take from me your rites of pilgrimage</span></strong>.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you must also <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>stay the night at Muzdalifah until you pray Fajr prayer</strong></span>, and if you miss this staying then you must at least pray Fajr there &#8211; as that is even more obligatory &#8211; rather it is one of the rukn (pillar) of Hajj according to the most correct saying according to the scholars &#8211; except upon the woman and the weak &#8211; for it has been allowed for them to leave after half of the night has passed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Fourthly.</b> And be very careful not <strong><span style="color:#000000;">to walk directly in front of anyone praying in the Haraam</span> </strong>mosque, not to speak of other mosques and prying places as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;If the one walking between the hands of one praying knew what were upon him then it would be better for him to stand still for forty (&#8230;) than that he should walk between his hands. </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Maalik, al-Bukhaaree, Muslim, the 4 Sunan of Abu Juhaim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is a general text covering everyone walking in front, and everyone praying &#8211; and there is no authentic Hadith to make any exception for the one doing so in the Haraam Masjid &#8211; and you should pray therein like any other place towards a sutrah &#8211; according to the general nature of the Hadith regarding that &#8211; and there are also some narrations from the Companions particularly about the Masjid-ul-Haraam &#8211; which I have mentioned in &#8216;The Original&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Fifthly.</b> The people of knowledge should <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>teach the pilgrims the rites of Hajj and its commands according to the Book and the Sunnah</strong></span> whenever meeting with them, and that should not stop them from calling to Tawheed which is the essence of Islaam and was the reason for sending of the Prophets, and the sending down of revealed books, as most of the people whom we have met &#8211; even some of those who are supposed to be seeking knowledge &#8211; we have found to be in complete ignorance of the real meaning of oblivious to the necessity of the return of the Muslims &#8211; upon their differing madhabs (schools of thoughts) and various parties &#8211; to unification and joining ranks upon the basis of the Book and the Sunnah, &#8211; in belief (Aqeedah) and Regulations (Ahkaam) and transactions, and behaviour, and politics and economic affairs and all other aspects of life. And they must remember that any voice raised or any movement made to reform which is based upon any foundation other than this firm splitting and weakening of the Muslims &#8211; and will increase their shamefulness and humiliation &#8211; and the present state of affairs is the greatest proof of that &#8211; and Allaah is the One Whose help is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is nothing wrong with debating in the best way &#8211; when required, as the kind of argumentation that is forbidden in Hajj is useless argument which is also forbidden outside Hajj, just like the eveil-doing that is forbidden in Hajj &#8211; for that is not the debating which is commanded in Allaah ta&#8217;ala&#8217;s saying [Soorat-un-Nahi aya 125].</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Invite (all) to the way of your Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching, and argue with them in ways that are best and most gracious..</span></strong>.&gt;&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, it should be noticed that if it appears that there is no benefit in the discussion because of the other persons blindly sticking to his madhab or own opinion &#8211; and if he were to continue then there is fear of going into that which is not permissible &#8211; then it is better to leave that argument with him as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;I am a claimant for a house in the outskirts of Paradise for one who leaves off arguing even if he is in the right&#8230;&#8221;</strong> </span>(6)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>No Difficulty</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the one who is inviting to the truth should always make things easy for the people in general and the pilgrims in particular as this making things easy is one of the principles of the kind of Sharee&#8217;ah &#8211; as is known &#8211; as long as there is no text against the point, for when there is a specific text then it is not permissible to make things easy by opinion. And this is the just and middle way which it is binding for every caller to the truth to adopt. And there is no need to take any notice to the people&#8217;s objecting after that and saying: He is too strict, he is too lenient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are various actions which are <b>permissible</b> for the pilgrims which they have become used to avoiding due to some people&#8217;s fatawa going against the aforementioned principle. So I decided to make note of those:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Bathing</strong></span>, without need to because of (e.g.) wet dreams (iHtilaam), even if it involves rubbing the head &#8211; as it is authentically reported from the Prophet in Bukhaaree and Muslim and others from the narration of Aboo Ayyoob rahimahullaah (7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Scratching the head</strong></span>, even if some hair falls out as shown by the preceding hadith of Aboo Ayyoob &#8211; and it is the saying of Shaikhul-Islaam Taimiyya (rahimahullaah ).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Cupping/Blood-letting (iHtijaam)</strong></span> even if some of the hair is shaved off in the place required, as the Prophet had it done on the center of his head while in iHraam &#8211; and that is not possible without shaving some of the hair. And this is also the saying of Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; and the Hanbali scholars also &#8211; however, they say that he must make a sacrifice to make up for it, and they have no proof of this. Rather that is rejected by the Prophet&#8217;s cupping &#8211; and had he made a sacrifice because of having done that then the narrator would have reported that &#8211; and his not having done so shows that it did not happen &#8211; so the correct position is the saying of Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah ).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Smelling sweet smelling plants</strong></span> and <strong><span style="color:#000000;">pulling off broken nails</span></strong> &#8211; and there is narrations about that mentioned in &#8216;The Original&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Taking the shade of a tent, or upheld garment</strong></span> &#8211; as this is proven from the Prophet, and in the same way using the camel-litter in the old days or an umbrella or car &#8211; even sitting inside &#8211; these days. And making it obligatory to make up for that with a sacrifice is a harshness for which there is no proof, rather there is no difference between seeking the shade of a tent which is proven from the Sunnah and seeking shade from the camel-litter &#8211; and its like, and this is a narration from Imaam AHmad as occurs in &#8216;Manaar us-Sabeel&#8217; (1/2460). And what some people do regarding removing the roofs of their cars is entering into religion something that the Lord of the worlds has not allowed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Wearing a belt around the izaar</strong></span> and tying it when necessary, and <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>wearing rings</strong></span> &#8211; as occurs in some narrations. And like it is wearing a <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>watch</strong> </span>or <strong><span style="color:#000000;">spectacles</span> </strong>and <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>money-pouch</strong></span> around the neck.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of those things fall under the aforementioned principle &#8211; furthermore some of them also being supported by hadith from the Prophet, or by narrations from the Companions &#8211; and Allaah ta&#8217;ala says: [Soorat-ul-Baqarah ayah 185].</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He (Allah) intends every facility for you, He does not want to put you into difficulties</strong></span>.&gt;&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And all praise is for Allaah Lord of the worlds.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Assuming Iharaam</b> (Ihraam is the state entered into at the Meeqat in which certain acts and types of clothing are forbidden).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. It is mustaHabb for anyone going for Hajj or &#8216;Umrah to take a <strong>ghusl</strong> (bath) for iHraam &#8211; even if a woman is in her period or in after-birth confinement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Then the men may wear whatever clothes he wishes that are not made in the shape of the body &#8211; and these clothes are called by the fuqahaa (religious scholars) &#8220;<strong>ghair al mukheet (unstitched)</strong>&#8220;. So he wears a ridaa (upper garment) and izaar (lower garment) or whatever, and sandals or any footwear that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">does not cover the ankle-bone</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. He does not wear a <strong>hat or an &#8216;imaamah (turban)</strong> or anything like that which fits onto and covers the head &#8211; this referring only to men. As for the women &#8211; she does not remove anything of the clothes that are prescribed for her in the Shari&#8217;ah, except that she should not tie on the <strong>niqaab</strong> (8) (face-veil) or the burqa&#8217; or the lithaam (lower face cover, up to the eyes) or handkerchief and she should not wear <strong>gloves </strong>(9). And the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و آله وسلم) said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The muHrim should not wear the shirt, or the &#8216;imaamah, or the hooded cloak, or trousers, or garment touched by wars (dyes with saffron) or saffron; or leather socks &#8211; unless he cannot find sandals) then in that case he may wear leather socks),(10)&#8221; </span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The woman muHrim should not affix a face veil and should not wear gloves(11). </span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is permissible to for the women to cover her face &#8211; even if it touches her face according to the correct opinion &#8211; however, she should not tie it on, as Ibn Taymiyyah says.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. He may put on the <strong>clothing of iHraam before the meeqat</strong> even in his own house as the Prophet and his Companions did. And this makes it easier for those making Hajj by aeroplane for whom it is not possible to put on iHramm at the meeqat &#8211; so it is permissible for them to embark on the plane in iHraam, but they do not make the <strong>intention of iHramm</strong> until very shortly before the meeqat &#8211; in order that they do not go past the meeqat without iHraam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. He may use <strong>body oil and perfume himself</strong> with any perfume he please which was has <strong>odor but not color</strong>, however, women use that which has color not but no odor &#8211; and all this to be before he makes intention of iHraam at the meeqat &#8211; after that is Haraam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Ihraam and Niyya (intention)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. So when he comes t the meeqat it becomes waajib (obligatory) for him to assume iHraam &#8211; and the mere wish and intention to perform Hajj is not sufficient as that has been with him since leaving his own land &#8211; rather he must perform by word and action what will cause him to be muhrim. So when he recites `talbiyyah&#8217; intending to enter into iHraam then his iHraam is concluded &#8211; as agreed upon by the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. And he does not say anything more than the <strong>talbiyyah</strong> such as their saying: &#8220;O Allah, I intend to make Hajj or `Umrah so make it easy for me and accept it from me&#8230;&#8221; as none of this is reported from the Prophet &#8211; just like speaking with the intention for wudoo and salaat and Fasting &#8211; all of this being from the newly invented matters and is well-known the Prophet said: &#8220;&#8230;for every newly invented matter is an innovation, and every innovation is a going astray and every going astray is in HellFire.&#8221; [Tirmidhee &#8211; saHeeh]</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Meeqaats</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. The meeqaats (places for assuming iHraam) are five: Dhul Hulaifah, Al-Juhfah, Qarn-ul manaazil, Yalamlam and Dhaatu `Irq. They are for those who live there and those who pass by them intending Hajj or &#8216;Umrah. And he whose house is nearer than them to Makkah then he makes iHraam from his house, the people of Makkah making iHraam from Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">DHUL HULAIFAH is the place for the people of Madinah and is a village six or seven miles away &#8211; and it is the furthest meeqaat from Makkah &#8211; being ten riding stations away &#8211; or less depending on the route, there being many routes from there to Makkah as Ibn Taimiyyah points out. And it is called ((<strong>waadi ul `Aqeeq</strong>,)) and its masjid is called ((<strong>Masjid-ush-shajarah</strong>)) (mosque of the Tree), and there is spring there called `<strong>the spring of `Ali</strong>&#8216; by the ignorant masses &#8211; believing that `Ali : killed a jinn there &#8211; and that is a lie.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And AL-JUHFAH is a village between Madinah and Makkah &#8211; about three travel stages away. It is the meeqat for the people of Madinah if they come by this route. Ibn Taimiyyah said: &#8220;It is the meeqaat for those who make Hajj from the direction of the west, like the people of Shaam (Greater Syria) and Egypt and the rest of the West. And it is today ruined and deserted, therefore the people now go into iHraam before it in the place called &#8220;<strong>Raabigh</strong>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Qarn UL MANAAZIL &#8211; which is also called &#8220;Qarn-uth-Tha&#8217;aalib&#8221; is near Makkah &#8211; being a day and night&#8217;s journey away &#8211; and is the meeqaat for the people of Najd.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And YALAMLAM is a place two nights distant from Makkah, thirty miles away and is the meeqaat for the people of Yemen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And DHAATU TRQ is a place out in the desert, marking the border between Najd and Tihaamah, being forty-two miles from Makkah. It is the meeqaat for the people of Iraq.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Prophet&#8217;s order to perform Hajj UT-TAMATTU</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. So when he wishes to make iHraam and is making Hajj-ul-Qirran, having brought the sacrificial animal with him, he should say: <b>labbaikallaahumma bi-hajjah wa umrah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Here I am O Allah making Hajj and `Umraah). So if he hasn&#8217;t brought the sacrificial animal &#8211; and that is better &#8211; then he says talbiyyah for `Umrah only and that he must do, saying <b>labbaikallaahumma bi-`umrah</b>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if he has already made talbiyyah for Hajj only, he cancels that and makes it into an `Umrah &#8211; as the Prophet ordered that and also said: &#8220;I have entered the Hajj until the Day of Judgment&#8221; and he joined his fingers together (as in the Hadith that has preceded).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said: &#8220;O family of Muhammad &#8211; whoever from you makes Hajj, then let him say talbiyyah of an &#8216;Umrah in Hajj(12)&#8221; and this is At-Tamattu&#8217; of `Umrah with Hajj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Making condition</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. And if he wishes when making talbiyyah he may state a condition to Allah fearing that which may prevent him (from completion of the Hajj) whether illness or fear &#8211; saying as the Prophet taught: <b>allaahumma mahillee haithu habastanee</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Allah my place is wherever you prevent me).(13) So if he does that and is then prevented or becomes ill &#8211; then he may leave iHraam of the Hajj or `Umrah &#8211; and there is no recompensatory sacrifice due upon him and he does not have to do the Hajj again, except and unless it was his first Hajj &#8211; then he has to repeat it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. There is no special prayer for iHraam, however if it is time for prayer before iHraam, then he should pray and then put on iHraam following the example of the Rasoolullah who put on iHraam after prying zuhr.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Prayer in waadee ul&#8217;aqeeq</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. However he whose meeqaat is Dhul Hulaifah &#8211; then it is mustahabb for him to pray there, not for iHraam, but because of the place and its being blessed. As al-Bukhaari has narrated from Umar &#8211; may Allah be pleased with him &#8211; who said : &#8220;I heard the Rasoolullah say in waadi ul &#8216;Aqeeq:&#8221; &#8220;Someone came to me this night from my Lord and said: Pray in this blessed valley, and say `Umrah with Hajj(14)&#8221; And Ibn &#8216;Umar narrates from the Prophet: &#8220;&#8230;that he saw, when alighting for sleep at the end of the night in Dhul Hulaifah in the center of the valley, one saying to him: you are in the blessed stony ground.&#8221;(15)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Talbiyyah and raising the voice</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. then he said he should stand(16) facing the Qiblah, and say talbiyyah for `Umrah or Hajj as has preceded, and say:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>allaahumma haadhihi hajjah, laariyaa&#8217;a feehaa wa laa sum&#8217;ah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(O Allah this is a Hajj, there being no ostentation in it or hypocrisy).(17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. And he should say the talbiyyah of the Prophet:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) <b>labbaikallaahumma labbaika labbaika laa shareeka laka labbaika-innal hamda wan na&#8217;mata laka wal mulka-la shareeka laka</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Here I am O Allah, here I am, there is no partner for You, here I am, Verily all praise for You, and every bounty is from You, and all dominion is Yours &#8211; You have no partner.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) And he also said: <b>labbaika ilaahal haqq</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Here I am O God of Truth.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15. And it is better to stick to the talbiyyah of the Prophet, even though it is permissible to increase upon it &#8211; as the Prophet approved of those who did so, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;labbaika dhal ma&#8217;aarij, labbaika dhal fawaadil&#8221;.<br>
(of the Ways of Ascent, Here I am Owner of Excellence.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibn `Umar used to also say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;labbaika wa sa&#8217;daika wal khairu biyadaika war-raghabaa&#8217;u ilaika wal `amalu&#8221;<br>
(Here I am and blessed by You, and all good is in Your Hands, and desire and action are directed towards You.)(18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16. And the one saying the talbiyyah is ORDERED to <strong>raise his voice</strong> with it, as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Jibreel came to me and ordered me to ordered my companions and those with me to raise their voices with talbiyyah.&#8221;</strong></span>(19)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;the best Hajj is shouting out and spilling blood&#8221;</strong></span> (20)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore the companions of the Prophet when they entered into iHraam, by the time they reached `arRauhaa&#8217; their voices had tired out.(21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;It is as if I am looking at Musa, upon whom be peace, descending from the mountain pass raising his voice with talbiyyah&#8230;&#8221;</strong></span>(22)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17. And women, as regards the talbiyyah, are like men &#8211; as the two preceding hadith are general &#8211; so they should raise their voices as long as their is no fear of fitnah. And `Aa&#8217;ishah used to raise her voice until the men could hear her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu `Atiyyah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I heard `Aa&#8217;ishah saying: Verily I know how was the talbiyyah of Rasoolullah, then I heard her after that saying: Labbaikallaahumma labbaika&#8230;&#8221;(23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Qaasim ibn Muhammad said: Mu&#8217;aawiyyah went out at night and heard the voice of someone making talbiyyah, so he said: `Who is that?&#8221; It was said: &#8220;`Aa&#8217;ishah, Mother of the Believers, making `Umrah from at-Tan&#8217;eem.&#8221; So that was mentioned to `Aa&#8217;ishah so she said: &#8220;If he had asked me I would have told him.&#8221;(24)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18. And he <strong>continually repeats the talbiyyah</strong> as it is &#8220;from the signs of Hajj&#8221;(25) and because of the Prophet&#8217;s saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;There is no one who makes talbiyyah except that whatever is on his right and left &#8211; trees and stones also make talbiyyah until the earth resounds from here and here &#8211; meaning &#8211; on his right and left.&#8221;</strong></span>(26)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Especially whenever he ascends a high place or descends a valley &#8211; according to the hadith which has preceded: &#8220;It is as if I am looking at Musa &#8211; upon whom be peace &#8211; coming down from the mountain pass&#8230;.loudly reciting talbiyyah&#8221; and in the other hadith: &#8220;It is if I am looking towards him when he descends in the valley reciting talbiyyah&#8221;.(27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19. And he may also <strong>recite along with it &#8220;La ilaaha illallaah&#8221;</strong> and talbiyyah according to the saying of Ibn Mas&#8217;ood may Allaah be pleased with him &#8211; &#8220;I went out Rasoolullah and he did not leave off the talbiyyah until he stoned Jamrat-ul&#8217; Aqabah &#8211; except when he mixed it with reciting talbiyyah or &#8220;La ilaaha illallaah&#8221;.(28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20. So when he reaches the haram of Makkah and sees the houses of Makkah he leaves off the talbiyyah to concentrate on the following actions:(29)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Taking Ghusl for entring Makkah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21. And whoever can talk a ghusl (bath) before entering Makkah then he should do so. And he should enter Makkah in the day following the example of Rasoolullah.(30)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">22. And he should enter from the upper part of Makkah which today has Bab ul Mi&#8217;laah as the Prophet entered from the upper pass (Kadaa&#8217;)(31) above the graveyard, and he entered the masjid from Bab Bani Shaibah as that was the nearest way to the Black Stone (Al-Hajrul-Aswad).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">23. And he is allowed to enter by any path as the Prophet said: All of the mountain passes of Makkah are a pathway and place for slaughter and in another hadith, All of Makkah is a pathway. He enters from here and leaves from here.(32)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">24. So if you enter the masjid do not forget to enter by the right foot,(33) and say:(34)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>allallhumma salli `alaa muhammadin wa sallim &#8211; allaahumma aftah lee abwaaba rahmatika</b> or <b>a&#8217;oodhu billaahil `azeemi wa biwajhihil kareem wa sultaanihil qadeemi minash shaitaanir rajeem.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">25. And when he sees the Ka&#8217;bah he raises his hands if he wants to &#8211; as it is established from Ibn `Abbaas.(935))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">26. And there is no du&#8217;aa established from the Prophet at this point. So he may make du&#8217;aa with Whatever he can if he wishes with the du&#8217;aa which is established from `Umar:(36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>allaahumma anta salaamu wa minkas salaamu fahayyinaa rabbanaa bissalaam</b></p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Tawaaf of Quadoom (arrival)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">27. Then he should go straight to the Black Stone and facing it make takbeer. And he may say `Bismillah&#8217; before it &#8211; as it is authentically reported from Ibn `Umar, although not from the Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">28. Then he touches the Black Stone with his hand and kisses it also, and makes sajda upon it also &#8211; as Rasoolullah did that, and `Umar, and Ibn `Abbaas.(37)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29. If he is not able to kiss it then he touches it with his hand then kisses his hand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">30. Then if he cannot touch it he should make a sign towards it with his hand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">31. And he does that in every circuit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">32. And he should not push and crowd to get to it according to the Prophet&#8217;s saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>O`Umar, you are a strong man, so do not harm the weak, and when you wish to touch it, then when it become free then touch it, and if not then face it and say takbeer</strong>.(38)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">33. And there is in touching the Black Stone a great excellence as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;Allaah will raise up the Stone on the Day of Judgement, and will have two eyes with which it will see, and a tongue which it talks with, and it will give witness in favor of everyone who touched it in truth.&#8221;</strong>(39)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Touching the Black Stone and the Yemeni corner removes sins.&#8221;</strong>(40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;The Black Stone is from Paradise, and it used to be whiter that snow, but the sins of the idolaters turned it black.&#8221;</strong>(41)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">34. Then he should begin making tawaaf around the Ka&#8217;bah &#8211; it being to his left &#8211; and he goes around past the Stone seven times &#8211; from the Stone to the Stone being one, wearing the iHraam under his right armpit and over the left (called al-idtibaa&#8217;)(42) throughout the tawaaf. And walking quickly and with boldness (ramal &#8211; a strong walk in which the shoulders are thrust forwards) in the first three, from the Stone to the Stone &#8211; then he walks normally in the rest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">35. And he touches the Yemeni corner with his hand each time he passes and does not kiss it, and if he is not able to touch it then he should not make any sign towards it with his hand at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">36. And he should say between the two corners:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O Allaah gives us good in this life, and good in the Hereafter and save us from the Punishment of the Fire.&#8221;</strong>(43)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Rabbanaa aatinaa fid-dunyaa hasanatan wa feel aakhirati hasanatan wa qinaa &#8216;adhaaban naar</strong><br>
[Soorat-ul-Baqarah ayah 201]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Our Lord! Give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter, and defend us from the torment of the Fire.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">37. And he does not touch the two shaami corners at all following the sunnah of the Prophet.(44)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Iltizaam Between The Corner And The Door</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">38. And he may cling to the place between the corner and the Door &#8211; placing his chest and face and forearms upon this place.(45)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">39. And there is no particular dhikr for tawaaf &#8211; so he may read Qur&#8217;an or say any dhikr he pleases, according to the Prophet&#8217;s saying :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tawaaf around the House is prayer, except that Allah has allowed speech in it, so he who speaks then let him not say except, good things and in a narration : so let him limit his talk in it.&#8221;</strong>(46)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">40. And it is forbidden for a naked person or a mentruating woman to make tawaaf of the House, as he said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A naked person may not make tawaaf of the House.&#8221;</strong>(47)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying to &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah when she came to make &#8216;Umrah in the final Hajj :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Do as anyone making Hajj does, except do not make tawaaf of the House (and do not pray) until you become clean.</strong>(48)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">41. So when he finished the seventh round he covers his right shoulder and moves to the Place of Ibrahim and recites:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Wattakhidhoo min-maqaami ibraaheema musalla</strong> [Soorat-ul-Baqarah ayah 125]<br>
<strong>(And take you the Station of Abraham as a place of prayer.)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">42. And he places the Maqaami Ibraheem (Place of Abraham) between himself and the Ka&#8217;bah and then prays two rak&#8217;ahs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">43. And he recites therein Surat-ul-Kaafiroon and Surat-Qul Huwallaahu Ahad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">44. And he should not walk between the hands of any praying person there, nor allow anyone to walk in front of him while he is praying &#8211; as the ahadith forbidding that are general &#8211; and there is no established exception for the Haram Masjid, let alone the rest of Mukkah.(49)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">45. Then after praying he goes to Zamzam and drinks thereof,and pours some of the water onto his head, as he said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Zamzam water is for what it drunk for&#8221;</strong>(50)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and he said</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;It is blessed and it is a food and a cure for illness&#8221;</strong>(51)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and he said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The best water upon the face of the earth is Zamzam water, in it is nourishment and a cure from illness.</strong>(52)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">46. Then he returned to the Black Stone, says takbeer and touches it &#8211; as before.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Sa&#8217;ee Between Safaa And Marwah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">47. The he goes off for sa&#8217;ee between Safaa and Marwah (two small hills). And when he reaches the foot of Safaa he reads Allaah ta&#8217;ala&#8217;s saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Innas-safaa wal marwata min sha&#8217;aa&#8217;irillaahi faman hajjal baita &#8216;awi`tamara falaa janaaha &#8216;alaihi an yattawwafa bihimaa wa man tatawwa&#8217;a khiran fa&#8217;innallaaha shaakirun &#8216;aleemun</strong> [Soorat-ul-Baqarah ayah 158]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Behold! Safa and Marwa are among the Symbols of Allah. So if those who visit the House in the Season or at other times should compass them round, it is no sin in them, and if any one obeys his own impulse to good, be sure that Allaah is He Who recognizes and knows.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Nabda&#8217;u bimaa bada&#8217;allaahu bihi<br>
</strong><strong>(We begin with what Allaah began with.)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">48. Then he begins with as-Safaa &#8211; climbing upon it until he can see the Ka&#8217;bah.(53)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">49. Then he faces the Ka&#8217;bah &#8211; and makes tauheed of Allaah and takbeer, saying :(54)</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allaahu akbar allaahu akbar allaahu akbar &#8211; laa illaaha illallahu wahdau laa shareekalahu &#8211; lahul mul ku wa lahul hamdu &#8211; yuheeu wa yumeetu wa huwa &#8216;alaa kulli shai&#8217;in qadeer &#8211; laa ilaaha illallahu wahdahu laa shareekalahu &#8211; anjaza wa&#8217;dahu wa nasara &#8216; abdahu wa hazamal ahzaaba wahdahu</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saying that three times and making du&#8217;aa after each time.(55)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">50. Then he descends for sa&#8217;ee between Safaa and Marwah, as Rasoolullah said : Make sa&#8217;ee as Allah has prescribed sa&#8217;ee for you.(56)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">51. So he walks till he reaches the green sign-post &#8211; on the right and left &#8211; then runs quickly till he reaches the next sign-post. And this place was in the time of the Prophet a dried river bed covered with small stones, and the Prophet said:(57)</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> (The river bed is not crossed except with vigour.) </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he walks up to Marwah and ascends it and does upon it as he did upon as-Safaa &#8211; facing the Qiblah, saying takbeer and tahleel and making du&#8217;aa(58) and that forms one complete circuit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">52. Then he returns till he ascends as-Safaa &#8211; walking in the place for walking, and running in the place for running &#8211; and that is a second circuit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">53. Then he returns to Marwah &#8211; and so on till he completes seven circuits finishing upon Marwah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">54. And it is permissible for him to go between Safaa and Marwah While riding. However the Prophet preferred to walk.(59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">55. And if he makes du&#8217;aa in sa&#8217;ee, saying :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Rabbighfir warham innaka antal a&#8217;azzul akram<br>
</strong>(O lord forgive and have mercy,verily You are the Most Mighty, Most Noble)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">then there is no harm as it is authentically reported from a group of the Salaf.(60)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">56. Then when he finishes from the seventh circuit upon al-Marwah he shortens the hair of his head(61) thus ending the &#8216;Umrah &#8211; and everything that became forbidden to him upon entering iHraam now becomes permissible again &#8211; and he remains in the state of hill (being out of iHraam) until Yaum ut-Tarwiyyah (8th Dhul-Hijjah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">57. And he who made iHraam not intending to make &#8216;Umrah before the Hajj &#8211; and not having brought the hadi (sacrificial animal) from outside sacred precincts then should also leave the state of iHraam in obedience to the Prophet&#8217;s order and in avoidance of his anger. Those, however, who have bought the sacrificial animal with them remain in iHraam and do not leave that state until after the stoning on the Day of Sacrifice (Yaum-un-Nahr) (10th Dhul-Hijjah).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Ihlaal (Calling Aloud With Tal-Biyyah) For Hajj On Yaum Ut-Tarwiyyah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">58. So when it is Yaum ut-Tarwiyyah and that is the 8th of Dhul Hijjah &#8211; he puts on iHraam and calls out with the talbiyyah of Hajj, and does as he did when assuming iHraam for &#8216;Umrah which he did from the meeqaat &#8211; as regards bathing and putting on perfume, and wearing the ridaa and izaar (upper and lower garments) and reciting talbiyyah &#8211; which he does not cease to do until he has stoned Jamrat ul-Aqaha (on 10th Dhul-Hijjah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">59. And he assumes iHraam form the place he is resident in &#8211; the people resident in Makkah doing so from Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">60. Then he goes off to Minaa and prays there the Zuhr prayer and remains there, spending the night there and praying the rest of the five daily prayers &#8211; shortening them (to two ra&#8217;kahs) but without combining them.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Proceeding To &#8216;Arafah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">61. So after the sun rises on the Day of &#8216;Arafah (10th Dhul-Hijjah) &#8211; he moves off towards &#8216;Arafah (a large plain to the south-east of Makkah), while reciting talbiyyah of takbeer &#8211; as both of these were practised by the Companions of the Prophet while making Hajj with him &#8211; and he did not critize either (those reciting tal-biyyah of those reciting takbeer.) (62)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">62. Then he stops at Namirah (63) &#8211; and it is a place near to &#8216;Arafah but not forming part of it &#8211; and he remains there until noon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">63. So When the sun passes its zenith he moves to &#8216;Uranah and settles there,(64) and it is next to &#8216;Arafah &#8211; and here the Imaam should give an appropriate Khutbah to the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">64. Then he prays with the people Zuhr and &#8216;Asr shortening and combining them in the time of the Zuhr prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">65. And one adhaan is given and two iqaamahs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">66. And he does not pray anything between the two prayers.(65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">67. And he who is not able to pray along with the Imaam &#8211; then he prays them in the same way on his own &#8211; or with those in similar situation around him.(66)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Standing In &#8216;Arafah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">68. Then he goes off to &#8216;Arafah and if able stands upon the rocks beneath the Mount of Mercy (Jabal ur-Rahmah) and if not then all of &#8216;Arafah is place of standing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">69. And he stands facing the Qiblah, raising his hands making du&#8217;aa and reciting talbiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">70. And he recites much &#8216;La ilaha illallaah&#8217; as it is the best du&#8217;aa on the Day of &#8216;Arafah as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The best thing that I and the Prophets have said on the evening of &#8216;Arafah is :<br>
<strong>Laa ilaha illallaahu wahdahu laa shareeka lahu lahul mulk wa lahul hamdu wa huwa &#8216;alaa kulli shay&#8217;in qadeer</strong>.(67)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">71. And if he adds in the talbiyyah occasionally (all good is the good of the Hereafter) then that is permissible.(68)</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Innamaal Khairu Khairul Aakhirati</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">72. And it is sunnah for the one standing in &#8216;Arafah not to fast that day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">73. And he remains in that state, remembering Allaah reciting talbiyyah, making du&#8217;aa as he wishes &#8211; hoping from Allaah that He will make him one of those whom He boasts of (those whom He frees from Fire) to the Angels as occurs in the hadith :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;There is no day on which Allaah frees more of His slaves from Fire than the Day of &#8216;Arafah, and He verily draws near then boasts of them before the angles, saying :&#8217;What do they seek?&#8217; &#8220;</strong>(69)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and in another hadith :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Verily Allaah boasts of the people of &#8216;Arafah before the people of heaven (the angels), saying : &#8216;Look to my servants who have come to Me dishevelled and dusty.'&#8221;</strong>(70)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and he remains in that state until the sun sets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Leaving &#8216;Arafah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">74. So when the sun has set he leaves &#8216;Arafah for Muzdalifah &#8211; going with calmness and tranquility, not jostling or pushing the people with himself or his riding beast or his vehicle, rather whenever he finds room then he goes faster.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">75. And when reaching Muzdalifah he gives adhaan and iqaamah then prays the three ra&#8217;kahs of Maghrib, then gives iqaamah and prays &#8216;Ishaa &#8211; shortening it &#8211; and joining the two prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">76. And if he separates the two prayers for some necessity then there is no harm in that.(71)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">77. And he does not pray anything between them or after &#8216;Ishaa.(72)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">78. Then he sleeps until Fajr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">79. Then when the dawn first appears he prays Fajr in the first part of its time with adhaan and iqaamah.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Fajr Prayer In Muzdalifah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">80. And all of the pilgrims pray Fajr prayer in Muzdalifah (a place between &#8216;Arafah and Minaa) except the weak and the women &#8211; it being permissible for them to leave after half of the night has passed for fear of the crush of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">81. Then he comes to the <strong>Mash&#8217;ar al-Haraam</strong> (a small mountain in Muzdalifah) and climbs upon it and faces the Qiblah &#8211; then recites tahweed,takbeer, tahleel &#8211; and declares Allaah&#8217;s Unity and makes du&#8217;aa until the sky becomes very bright.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">82. And all Muzdalifah is a place of standing &#8211; so wherever he stands then it is permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">83. Then he leaves for Minaa before the sun rises, calmly while reciting talbiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">84. So when he comes to the river <strong>valley of Mu-Hassir</strong> he hurries if possible &#8211; and it is a part of Minaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">85. Then he takes the middle road which takes him to the Jamrat ul Aqabah.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Stoning (Ar-Ramee)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">86. And he picks up in Minaa stones with which he intends to do the stoning of Jamrat-ul-&#8216;Aqabah &#8211; and it is the last of the Jamraat and the nearest one to Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">87. And he faces the Pillar (Jamrah), having Makkah to his left and Minaa to his right.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">88. Then he stones it with seven small stones, like the Stones of Khadhf &#8211; which are slightly longer than the chick-pea.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">89. And he recites takbeer while throwing each stone.(73)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">90. And he ceases reciting talbiyyah when throwing the last stone.(74)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">91. And he he does not perform this stoning until after sunrise, even the women or weak who were allowed to leave Muzdalifah after half the night, as this is one thing and the stoning is something else.(75)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">92. And he may perform this stoning after noon even up to the night if he finds difficulty in performing this stoning before noon as is established in the hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">93. So when he has stoned the Jamrah everything becomes lawful for him again except women, even if he has not sacrificed or shaved his head &#8211; so he may wear his clothes and use perfume.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">94. However he should perform Tawaaf-ul-Ifaada on the same day (before Maghrib) if he wishes to continue in his state of having left iHraam &#8211; otherwise, if he has not made Tawaaf before the evening (before Maghrib) then he returns to the state of iHraam as he was before the stoning &#8211; so he should remove his clothes and put on iHraam according to the Prophet&#8217;s saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Verily on this day has been allowed for you, when you have stoned the Jamrah, that was prohibited for you except women (sexual intercourse). Verily on this day everything that you were prohibited from (by iHraam) has been allowed for you, when you have stoned the Jamrah, except the women (sexual intercourse) &#8211; so if evening comes upon you before you have made Tawaaf of this House then you revert to the state of iHraam as you were before stoning the Jamrah &#8211; until you make the Tawaaf.</strong> (76)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Sacrifice</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">95. Then he comes to the place of sacrifice in Minaa and sacrifices his animal &#8211; and that is the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">96. However, it is permissible for him to slaughter in any other part of Minaa or Makkah as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>I have slaughtered here and all of Minaa is a place for slaughtering, and all of the mountain pass approaches, so slaughter on your place of stopping.</strong>(77)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">97. And the Sunnah is to do the dhabh (slaughter by a horizontal cut through the throat) or Nahr (slaughter by a vertical movement of the spear to the lower part of the throat) with own hand if possible, and if not, then to depute someone else to do it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">98. And he should make the animal face the Qiblah when slaughtering(78), making it lie down on its left side and putting his right foot upon its right side.(79)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">99. As for the camel then he should slaughter it by means of Nahr..while it is standing having its left leg tied, standing on its others(80) with its face towards the Qiblah.(81)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">100. And he says when slaughtering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Bismillaahi Wallaahu Akbar Al-Laahumma Inna Hadha Minka Wa Laka(82) Al Lahumma Taqabbal Minnee(83)<br>
</b>(In the name of Allah and Allah is greater. O Allah this is from You and for You. O Allah accept it from me.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">101. And the time for slaughter is the four days of &#8216;Eid &#8211; Yaum-un-Nahr, and that is called &#8216;Yaum ul-Jajj-ul-Akbar&#8217; (Day of the greatest Hajj)(84) and the three days of Tashreeq, as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Allthe days of Tashreeq are for sacrifice.&#8221;</strong> (85)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">102. And he may eat from the meat of his sacrificial animal and take some back with him to his land as the Prophet did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">103. And he should give some it to feed the poor and the needy as Allah ta&#8217;ala says:(86)</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(The sacrificial camels We have made for you as among the Symbols from Allah: in them is (much) good for you: then pronounce the name of Allah over them as they line up (for sacrifice): when they are down on their side (after slaughter), eat ye thereof, and feed such as (beg not you) live in contentment and such as beg with due humility.)</strong>[Soorat-ul-Hajj ayah 36]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">104. And seven people may share in one camel or cow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">105. And he who cannot afford a sacrificial animal should fast three days in Hajj and seven when he returns to his family.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">106. And he may fast the three days of Tashreeq according to the hadith of &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah and Ibn &#8216;Umar &#8211; may Allah be pleased with them &#8211; who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;No permission was given for us to fast the days of Tashreeq except for those who could not afford a sacrificial animal.</strong>(87)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">107. Then he shaves all of his hair off or shortens it. &#8211; and the first is better as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O Allah have mercy on those who save their heads. They (the people) said &#8216;And those who shorten their O Rasoolullah.&#8217; He said: O Allah have mercy on those who save their heads. They said: &#8216;And those who shorten their hair O Rasoolullah&#8217; He added on the fourth time: And those who shorten their hair&#8221;</strong>(88)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">108. And the Sunnah is for the barber to begin with the right side of the head as occurs in the hadith of Anas.(89)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">109. And shaving the hair is just the for men and not for the women &#8211; they have to shorten only as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;There is no shaving of the hair for women, verily upon women is shortening of the hair.&#8221;</strong>(90)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So she should together her hair and shorten it by the length of a finger-joint.(91)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">110. And it is Sunnah for the Imaam to give a khutbah on the Day of Sacrifice in Minaa(92) between the Jamaraat(93) in the forenoon(94) to teach the people to rites of Hajj.(95)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Tawaaf ul Ifaadah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">111. The he goes off that day to the House and makes Tawaaf &#8211; seven times around &#8211; as has preceeded in the Tawaaf of arrival &#8211; <span style="color:#ff0000;">except that he does not wear iHraam under his right shoulder &#8211; nor does he perform raml</span> in this Tawaaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">112. And it is from the Sunnah to pray two ra&#8217;kahs behind the Station of Ibrahim &#8211; as Az-Zuhree(96) said, and Ibn &#8216;Umar did so(97), and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;For every seven times around there are two ra&#8217;kahs.&#8221;</strong>(98)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">113. Then he walks and runs between Safaa and Marwah as before &#8211; except for one doing Hajj of Qiraan or Ifraad &#8211; the first sa&#8217;ee being enough for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">114. And after this tawaaf everything again becomes lawful for him that became unlawful due to iHraam &#8211; even the woman (sexual intercourse).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">115. And he prays Zuhr at Makkah, and Ibn &#8216;Umar says: At Minaa.(99)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">116. And he comes to Zamzam and drinks from it.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Staying Overnight At Minaa</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">117. Then he returns to Minaa and remians there for the days of Tashreeq and their nights.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">118. And he stones the three Jamaraat with seven small stones in each of those days, after noon, as has preceeded concerning the stoning on the Day of Sacrifice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">119. He begins with the first Jamrah, which is the nearest to <strong>Masjid &#8211; al-Khaif</strong>, and after stoning it he moves onward and stands facing the Qiblah for a long while making du&#8217;aa while raising his hands.(100)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">120. Then he comes to the second Jamarah and stones it in the same way, then he moves to the left and stands for a long while facing the Qiblah making du&#8217;aa while raising his hands.(101)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">121. The he comes to the third Jamarah and it is Jamrat al-Aqabah &#8211; and he stones it in the same way &#8211; standing so that Ka&#8217;bah is to his left and Minaa to his right and does not stand there (making du&#8217;aa) afterwards.(102)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">122. Then on the second day he repeats this stoning and on the third day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">123. An if he leaves after stoning on the second day not remaining for the third day&#8217;s stoning, then that is permissible as Allaah ta&#8217;ala says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Celebrate the praises of Allah during the Appointed Days, but if anyone hastens to leave in two days, there is no blame on him, and if anyone stays on, these is no blame on him if his aim is to do right,) </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However remaining for the third day&#8217;s stoning is better as it is the Sunnah.(103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">124. And the Sunnah is to do the previous actions of Hajj in order: the stoning, then slaughter, then shaving the head, then Tawaaf of Ifaadah, the Sa&#8217;ee for the one doing Hajj at-Tamattu&#8217;; however if he brings something forward in the order or delays something in the order (doing things out of order) then that is permissible as the Prophet said: &#8220;There is no harm, there is no harm.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">125. And regarding stoning, the following is allowed to those who have a valid excuse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) The permission not to have to spend the night in Minaa according to the hadith of Ibn &#8216;Umar: &#8220;Al &#8216;Abbaas sought permission of Rasoolullah to spend the night of Minaa in Makkah as he was responsible for supplying Zamzam water there, so he gave him the permission.&#8221;(104)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) To combine two days&#8217; stoning in one day, according to the hadith of &#8216;Aasim ibn &#8216;Adiyy who said: &#8220;Rasoolullah made concession for the camel drivers in Bairootah that they could stone on the Day of Sacrifice, the combine two days&#8217; stoning after that &#8211; performing it in one of the two days.&#8221;(105)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(c) To perform the stoning at night as the Prophet said: The shephered may stone at night, then look after his flock in the daytime.(106)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">126. And it is lawful for him to visit the Ka&#8217;bah and make Tawaaf during each of the nights of Minaa as the Prophet did so.(107)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">127. And the pilgrim during the Days of Minaa must take care to pray the five daily prayers with the congregation &#8211; and it is best to pray the Masjid of Khaif if he is able to, as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Seventy Prophets have prayed in the Masjid of Khaif</strong>.</span>(108)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">128. So after completing the stoning on the second day or third day of the days of Tashreeq &#8211; then he has completed the rites of Hajj and therefore returns to Makkah &#8211; and remains there for as long as Allaah has written for him to remain &#8211; and he should take care to perform the prayer with the congregation &#8211; especially in the Masjid-ul-Haraam, and <strong>a single prayer in the Masjid-ul-Haraam is better than a hundred thousand prayers in other mosques</strong>.(109)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">129. And he should perform much of prayer and Tawaaf at any time he pleases of the day or night as the Prophet said about the two corners &#8211; the Black Stone and Yemeni corner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Touching them takes away sins, and he who performs Tawaaf does not raise or lower his foot (while walking) except that Allaah writes it for him as a good deed, and wipes off bad deed for him, and writes for him an extra rank and whoever does it even times round [check Sharh of at-Tirmidhee] it is as if he had freed a slave.&#8221;</strong>(110)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;&#8221;O tribe of &#8216;Abd Manaaf! Do not prevent anyone from making Tawaaf of this house or from prayer at any hour of the day or night he pleases.&#8221;&#8221;</strong>(111)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Farewell Tawaaf (Tawaaf ul Wadaa)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">130. So when he has finished all that he has to do and has decided to travel then he has to make a farewell Tawaaf of the house, as Ibn &#8216;Abbas narrated: &#8216;The people used to head off in every direction so the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;None of you should depart until he makes as his last act Tawaaf of the House.&#8221;</strong>(112)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">131. And the menstruating woman was at first ordered to wait until she became clean of it in order to make Tawaaf ul Wadaa'(113) then it was permitted for her to leave without waiting according to the hadith of Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;That the Prophet gave concession for the menstruating women that she should depart before (Farewell) Tawaaf as long as she had made Tawaaf of Ifaadah.&#8221;</strong> (114)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">132. And he may carry away with him whatever he can of Zamzam water because of the blessing therein, as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Rasoolullah used to carry it with him in water skins and containers &#8211; and he used to pour (it) upon the sick and give it to them to drink.&#8221;</strong></span>(115)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Before Makkah was conquered he used to send the message to Suhail ibn &#8216;Amr: that he should bring Zamzam water for us and not leave it &#8211; so he would send to him two large bag fulls.&#8221;</strong>(116)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">133. So when he finishes the Tawaaf he leaves the mosque like the rest of the people &#8211; not walking backwards &#8211; and he leaves putting out his left foot first(117), saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Allaahuma salli &#8216;alla muhammadin wa sallim &#8211; allaahumma innee &#8216;as&#8217;aluka min fadhlika<br>
</b>(O Allaah send blessings and peace upon Muhammad. O Allaah I ask You for Your bounty.)</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">source:<em> Silsilat ul-ahaadeeth us-saheeha</em> – the series of authentic narrations – <em>hadeeth </em>no. 43<br>
assaheeha translations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “O <em>‘Aaisha</em>, if your people had not recently been polytheists (and new converts to <em>Islaam</em>), and if I had enough means to reconstruct it, I would have spent the treasure of the <em>Ka’bah</em> in the way of Allaah, and I would have demolished the <em>Ka’bah</em> and made it at a level with the ground. Then I would have rebuilt it on its original foundations laid by <em>Ibraaheem</em> (Abraham) and made two doors for it – a door facing the east, for the people to enter, and a door facing the west, for their exit… And I would expand (the <em>Ka’bah</em>) by six cubits (around three meters) of area from <em>al-Hijr</em> (the unroofed portion of the <em>Ka’bah</em> which is at present in the form of a semi-circular, wall-surrounded area in the north side of the <em>Ka’bah</em>); (in [another] narration: I would have included the space of <em>al-Hijr</em> in it ), for when the <em>Quraish</em> had rebuilt the<em> Ka’bah</em>, they reduced its (area). And if your people would take initiative after me in rebuilding it, then come along with me so that I could show you what they have left out of it.” He [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] showed her about seven cubits (three and a half meters) of area (from the side of <em>al-Hijr</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In [another] narration from her (<em>‘Aaisha</em>), she said: “I asked the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) about the wall (i.e., <em>al-Hijr</em>): ‘Is it regarded as part of the House (the <em>Ka’bah</em>)?’ He [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] replied, ‘Yes.’ I said: ‘Then why did they not include it in the House?’ He [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] said, ‘Your people ran short of the means/money (to do so).’ I said: ‘Why is it that the level of its door is raised high?’ He [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] said, ‘Your people did it to admit whomever they liked, and prevent whomever they disliked; (in [another] narration: (They did it) out of vanity so that (they might be in a position) to grant admittance to only whom they wished. So when a person intended to enter it, they called him to climb (the stairs), and when he was about to enter, they pushed him and he fell down). Were your people not close to the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance (i.e. they have recently embraced<em> Islaam</em>) and were I not afraid that their hearts might deny (my action), then surely I would have included the (area of the) wall inside (the building of) the House and I would have made its gate touch the ground.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, when <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> ruled, he demolished it and made two doors for it. (In [another] narration: That was what urged <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr </em>to demolish (the <em>Ka’bah</em>). <em>Yazeed bin Rumaan</em> said: ‘I saw <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> when he demolished it, rebuilt it and included <em>al-Hijr </em>in it. And I saw the original foundations of <em>Ibraaheem</em> (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) which were of stones joined together resembling the humps of camels.’)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>*</strong>the translation of the above <em>hadeeth</em>, for the most part, was taken directly from the already translated text of <em>saheeh al-bukhaari </em>and<em> saheeh muslim</em><strong>*</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>shaykh al-albaani </em>(<em>rahimahullaah</em>) summarizes a number of benefits from the above narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This <em>hadeeth</em> indicates two things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First: that it is obligatory to delay carrying out rectification, if an evil greater than [its good] results from it. And from it, the scholars of <em>fiqh</em> took their famous principle: ‘<strong>Repelling the evil [comes] before bringing the good</strong>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: that the honorable <em>Ka’bah</em> is now in need of the reconstructions that the <em>hadeeth</em> includes, due to the disappearance of the reason for the sake of which the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) left that – and (the reason) is that the hearts of those who were recently polytheists in his time (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) would have a dislike [for it]. And <em>Ibn Battaal </em>has reported from some of the scholars that: ‘the dislike that he (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) feared was that they would accuse him of boasting by himself over them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible to list those reconstructions in what follows:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>1- Expanding the <em>Ka’bah</em> and building it upon the foundation of <em>Ibraaheem </em>(<em>‘alayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>), and that is by adding approximately six cubits (three meters) of <em>al-Hijr</em></li>
<li>2- Leveling its ground with the surface of the <em>Haram</em> (<em>Al-Masjid ul-Haraam</em>)</li>
<li>3- Opening another door for it from the Western side</li>
<li>4 – Making the two doors low with the ground to organize and facilitate entering it and exiting from it for everyone who wishes</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed,<em> ‘Abdullaah bin uz-Zubayr </em>(<em>radi Allaahu ‘anhumaa</em>) had carried out the fulfillment of this reconstruction completely during his rule in <em>Makkah</em>, but the unjust political administration returned the <em>Ka’bah</em> after him to its previous state!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the<em> shaykh </em>then mentions the following <em>hadeeth</em> as narrated by <em>Muslim</em> and <em>Abu Nu’aym</em> on the authority of <em>‘Ataa</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The House was burnt during the time of <em>Yazeed bin Mu’aawiya</em> when the people of <em>Shaam</em> had fought (in <em>Makkah</em>), and it happened with it (the<em> Ka’bah</em>) what was (in store for it). <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> left it (in the same state) until the people came in the season (of <em>Hajj</em>) – he wanted to encourage them or urge them on (to war) against the people of <em>Shaam</em>. When the people had arrived, he said to them, ‘O people, advise me about the <em>Ka’bah</em>. Should I demolish it and then build it from its very foundation, or should I repair whatever has been damaged of it?’ <em>Ibn ‘Abbaas</em> [<em>radi Allaahu &#8216;anhu</em>] said, ‘An idea has occurred to me, according to which I think that you should only repair whatever has been damaged for it, and leave the House (in the same state) in which people embraced<em> Islaam</em>, (and leave) the stones (in the same state) in which people embraced<em> Islaam</em> and upon which the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) was sent.’ So, <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr </em>said, ‘If the house of any one of you was burnt, he would not be pleased until he had reconstructed it, then how about the House of your Lord (which is far more important than your house)?! Indeed, I will seek good advice from my Lord thrice and then I will make up my mind about this affair.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After seeking good advice thrice, he made up his mind to demolish it. The people were suspicious and fearful that calamity might fall from heaven on those persons who would be first to climb over it (for the purpose of demolishing it), until a man climbed it and threw down one of its stones. When the people saw no calamity befalling him, they followed him and demolished it until they leveled it to the ground. Then, <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> erected pillars and hung curtains on them until the walls were raised. And <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr </em>said, ‘Indeed I heard<em> ‘Aaisha </em>say that the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: (he then mentioned the first portion of the <em>hadeeth</em> [mentioned in the beginning], then he said) – I today have the means to spend and I don’t fear the people (that they would protest against this change).’ So he expanded it by five cubits (around two and a half meters) of area from the side of <em>al-Hijr</em> until it appeared as the original foundation (upon which <em>Ibraaheem</em> had built the <em>Ka’bah</em>), and the people saw it; and it was upon this foundation that he raised the wall. The length of the <em>Ka’bah</em> was eighteen cubits (around nine meters), and when he had expanded it, he found it to be short (since the addition was made to its width, so naturally the length appeared to be small compared to its width). Therefore, he expanded its length by ten cubits (around five meters). He also constructed two doors, one of which (was meant) for entrance and the other one for exit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, when <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> was killed, <em>al-Hajjaaj </em>wrote to <em>‘Abd ul-Malik bin Marwaan </em>informing him about it, and telling him that <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> had built (the<em> Ka’bah</em>) on the very foundation (which was laid by <em>Ibraaheem</em>) and which reliable persons among the people of <em>Makkah</em> had seen. Then, <em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em> wrote to him: ‘Indeed, we are not concerned with disgracing <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> in anything. As for what he added in the side of its length, keep it intact; and as for what he added from the side of <em>al-Hijr</em>, return it to its (previous) foundation, and close up the door which he opened.’ Thus, he (<em>al-Hajjaaj</em>) demolished it (that portion) and rebuilt it on its (previous) foundation.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>*</strong>the translation of the above <em>hadeeth</em>, for the most part, was taken directly from the already translated text of <em>saheeh</em><em> muslim</em><strong>*</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>shaykh al-albaani</em> continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“That is what <em>al-Hajjaaj</em> the oppressor did by the command of<em> ‘Abd ul-Malik</em> the mistaken one, and I don’t think that his regret later on clears him of his mistake. <em>Muslim</em> and <em>Abu Na’eem</em> have also narrated from <em>‘Abdullaah bin ‘Ubayd</em> who said: <em>Al-Haarith bin ‘Abdillaah</em> came to <em>‘Abd ul-Malik bin Marwaan</em> as an envoy during his <em>Khilaafa</em> (Caliphate), and<em> ‘Abd ul-Malik</em> said, ‘I don’t think that<em> Abu Habeeb</em> (i.e., <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em>) heard from<em> ‘Aaisha</em> that which he claimed to hear from her.’ <em>Al-Haarith</em> said: ‘But yes, I [myself] heard it from her.’ He (<em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em>) said, ‘You heard her saying what?’ He (<em>Al-Haarith</em>) said, ‘She said: the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: (he then mentioned the <em>hadeeth</em>).’ <em>‘Abd ul-Malik </em> said to <em>Al-Haarith</em>, ‘You heard her saying this?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ Then, he (<em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em>) scratched the ground with his staff for a while and then said, ‘I wish that I had left it and not changed [the reconstructions carried out by<em> Ibn uz-Zubayr</em>].’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is in [another] narration from them both (<em>Muslim and Abu Na’eem</em>) from <em>Abu Qaz’ah </em>that: While <em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em> <em>bin Marwaan </em>was going around the House, he at that time said, ‘May Allaah fight <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> since he uttered a lie upon the mother of the believers, saying: I heard her say: (he then mentioned the <em>hadeeth</em>).’ So, <em>Al-Haarith bin ‘Abdillaah bin Rabee’ah</em> said, ‘Don’t say this O leader of the believers, for I [myself] heard the mother of the believers saying this.’ He (<em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em>) said, ‘If I had heard it before I demolished it (the <em>Ka’bah</em>), I would have left it upon what <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> had built.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (<em>Shaykh al-Albaani</em>) say: it was (obligatory) upon him, before the demolition, to verify and to <strong>ask the people of knowledge</strong> about that, whether it was allowed for him to criticize <em>‘Abdullaah bin uz-Zubayr</em> and accuse him of uttering a lie upon the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>). And his truthfulness (<em>radi Allaahu ‘anhu</em>) became clear to<em> ‘Abd ul-Malik</em> by <em>Al-Haarith</em>‘s agreeing with it, as many a group from <em>‘Aaisha</em> (<em>radi Allaahu ‘anhaa</em>) agreed with it. And I have collected their narrations…in this <em>hadeeth</em>, and the <em>hadeeth</em> is detailed from<em> ‘Aaisha</em>. Therefore, I indeed fear that <em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em> had prior knowledge about the <em>hadeeth</em> before he demolished the House, but he pretended that he did not hear about it except through <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em>. So when <em>Al-Haarith bin ‘Abdillaah</em> opposed him, that he also had heard it (the <em>hadeeth</em>) from <em>‘Aaisha</em>, he (<em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em>) showed regret at what he had done, [but] it was too late for regrets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, it has reached us that there is an idea or plan to expand the area of <em>tawaaf </em>(circumambulation) around  the <em>Ka’bah</em> and transfer the <em>Maqaam Ibraaheem</em> (the Standing Place of <em>Ibraaheem</em>) (<em>‘alayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>) to another place. So in relation to this, <strong>I suggest to those responsible (for the <em>Ka’bah</em>) that they hasten to expand the <em>Ka’bah</em> before everything (else) and rebuilt it upon the foundation of <em>Ibraaheem </em>(<em>‘alayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>)</strong>, fulfilling the noble, honorable Prophetic wish in this<em> hadeeth</em>, and saving the people from the problems of crowding at the door of the <em>Ka’bah</em> which is witnessed every year, and from the domination of the guard over the door who prevents whoever he wishes from entering and allows whoever he wishes, for the sake of a few dirhams!”</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Iltizaam Between The Corner And The Door</b> ( from Rites of Hajj and Umrah &#8211; by Shaik Nasiruddin Albanee )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">38. And he may cling to the place between the corner and the Door &#8211; placing his chest and face and forearms upon this place.(45)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is narrated by two isnaads from the Prophet by which the hadith reaches the level of hasan &#8211; and is increased in strength by the fact that a group of the Sahaabah acted on it &#8211; from them Ibn &#8216;Abbaas &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with him &#8211; who said: &#8220;<strong>This is the Multazam between the Corner and the Door</strong>. And it is authentically narrated from &#8216;Urwah ibn az-Zubair also &#8211; see &#8216;As-Sahaabah, no.2138.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibn Taimiyyah said in his &#8216;Mansak&#8217; (p.387): &#8220;And if he wishes to come to the Multazam &#8211; and that is what is between the Black stone and the Door &#8211; and he places upon it his chest and face and forearms and hands &#8211; and makes du&#8217;aa &#8211; and he asks Allaah for whatever he needs &#8211; then he may do so. And he may do so before the Farewell Tawaaf there being no difference in this being at that time or any other &#8211; and the Sahaabah used to do so when they entered Makkah &#8211; and if he stands near the Door making du&#8217;aa without iltizaam of the House then that is also good, and when he leaves he does not stand or turn or walk backwards.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen</strong> (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a matter concerning which the scholars differed, although it was not narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (i.e. that was not narrated in a saheeh hadeeth, as the ahaadeeth that were narrated concerning this were deemed to be da’eef or weak). Rather it was narrated from some of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them). So is iltizaam (clinging) Sunnah? When should it be done – upon arrival or when about to leave, or at any time?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason for this difference of opinion among the scholars is that it is not narrated in the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), rather the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) used to do that when they arrived in Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fuqaha’ said: He (the pilgrim) should do that when about to leave, and should cling to the multazam, which is the area between the corner where the Black Stone is located and the door…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on this, there is nothing wrong with iltizaam (clinging to the Ka’bah in this area) so long as that does not involve annoying others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 7/402, 403.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.5em;">In Hadeeth and Fiqh literature, this term refers to the Companion mentioned in the following hadeeth of Saheeh al-Bukhaaree (Book of Prayer, English translation by Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan); many other narrations of this incident are found in the various collections of hadeeth, and provide an important source of instructions from the Prophet (sal-Allaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam) regarding the correct way to pray:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Hurayrah (radhi-yAllaahu `anhu):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (sal-Allaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam) entered the mosque and a person followed him. The man prayed and then went to the Prophet (sal-Allaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam) and greeted him; he returned the greeting and said (to him):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">«Go back and pray, for you have not prayed.»</span> The man went back and prayed in the same way as before, and then returned and greeted the Prophet (sal-Allaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam), who said</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">«Go back and pray, for you have not prayed»,</span> three times. The man said: &#8220;By Him Who sent you with the Truth, I cannot do so any better than this, so please teach me.&#8221; He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">«When you stand for the Prayer, say takbeer and then recite what is easy for you from the Qur.aan (from what you know by heart); then bow until you <span style="text-decoration:underline;">feel at ease</span> in rukoo`; then raise your head and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">stand up straight</span>, then prostrate until you <span style="text-decoration:underline;">feel at ease</span> in sajdah; then sit with calmness until you <span style="text-decoration:underline;">feel at ease</span>, and do likewise in all your prayers.»</span></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Author:Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee<br>
Source:Al-Asaalah Magazine: Issue 13-14 (Contained in the E-Book: Fataawaa of Shaikh Al-Albaanee)<br>
Translator:isma&#8217;eel alarcon</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Question:</b> What is the religious ruling concerning holding a second congregational prayer in the masjid?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer:</b> The scholars of Fiqh have differed with regard to the ruling on holding the second congregational prayer. However, before we mention the difference of opinion and clarify which is the most correct of them, we must first identify the type of congregation that they differ on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The subject of disagreement is with regard to the congregation that is established in a masjid that has a regular employed Imaam and mu’adhin. As for the congregations that are established in any other place, be it in ones home, a masjid built on the road (i.e. musalla) or a store, then there is nothing that prevents one from having repeated congregations in those places.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars who hold the opinion that it is disliked to have numerous congregations in the above type of masjid, the one that has a regular Imaam and a regular mu’adhin, derive their ruling from two evidences. The first is textual and comes from the Divine Legislator, while the other is theoretical and it is a contemplation of the narrations and the wisdom behind the prescription of the prayer in congregation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the textual evidence, then they have investigated and found that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) went throughout his life leading the people in congregational prayer in his masjid. Nevertheless, whenever any individual from his Companions entered the masjid and found that the congregational prayer had finished, he would pray alone and he would not wait (for others to come). Nor would he turn towards his left or right, as the people do today, looking for one or more people so that one of them can pray with them as an Imaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Salaf never used to do any of this. So when one of them would enter the masjid and find that the people had prayed, he would pray by himself. This is what Imaam Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee concluded in his book <i>Al-Umm</i>, and his discussion on this topic is from the moist comprehensive of talks that I have seen from the discussions of the Imaams on this issue, such that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If a group of people enter a masjid and find that the Imaam has already prayed, then they should pray individually. But if they pray in a congregation, then their prayer is acceptable and correct, however, I hate that they do this for it was not from the customs of the Salaf.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said: &#8220;As for the masjid that is on the highway, which doesn&#8217;t have a regular employed Imaam and mu&#8217;adhin, then there is no harm in holding numerous congregational prayers in it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said: &#8220;And we have memorized that a group from the Prophet&#8217;s Companions missed the congregational prayer, so they prayed individually. Even though they had the ability to congregate and pray together a second time, they did not do this because they hated to hold the (same) congregational prayer in the masjid twice.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the saying of Imaam Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee. And what he mentioned that the Companions used to pray individually when they would miss the congregational prayer, has been mentioned as a ta&#8217;leeq narration in shortened form. And Al-Haafidh Abu Bakr Ibn Abee Shaybah transferred that to his famous book <i>Al-Musannaf</i>. He reported it with a strong chain of narration on the authority of Al-Hasan Al-Basree that when the Companions would miss prayer in congregation, they would pray individually.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Al-Qaasim related this understanding in his <i>Mudawwanat-ul-Imaam Maalik</i> on a group of the Salaf, such as Naafi&#8217; the servant of Ibn &#8216;Umar, Saalim Ibn &#8216;Abdillaah and others, that when they would miss the prayer, they would pray individually and they would not establish the congregation a second time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Imaam At-Tabaraanee reported in his <i>Mu&#8217;jam Al-Kabeer</i> with a good chain of narration from Ibn Mas&#8217;ood that he went out one day with two of his companions from his house to the masjid in order to pray in the congregation. But when they got there, they found the people leaving the masjid for they had finished the prayer. So he returned to his home and led them in prayer. So this returning of Ibn Mas&#8217;ood &#8211; being who he was due to his accompaniment of the Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) and his knowledge and understanding of Islaam &#8211; if he knew the prescription of praying numerous congregations in one masjid, he would have entered with his two companions and prayed in congregation with them. This is since he knew the saying of the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam): <b>&#8220;The best prayer of a man is the one he performs in his house, except for the obligatory prayer.&#8221;</b> So what was it that prevented Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (raa) from praying this obligatory prayer in the masjid? &#8211; his knowledge that if he prayed it in the masjid, he would have to pray it alone. So he held that if he congregated in his home that would be better than if he and those with him prayed individually by themselves in the masjid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a collection of the quotes that support the point of view of the majority of the scholars that have disliked numerous congregations held in the described masjid in the manner mentioned previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereafter, people will not miss finding other evidences, while doing some deduction and precise investigation. Thus, the two Imaams, Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim, have reported from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah (raa) that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said, <b>&#8220;I felt a strong desire to command a man to lead the people in prayer. Then command some men to fetch firewood, then go to the people who have left off praying in congregation and set their houses on fire. By the One in whose hand the soul of Muhammad is, if one of them knew that he would find two good hunted game in the masjid, he would surely come to witness the two.&#8221;</b> In this hadeeth, the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) threatened those who refrained from attending the congregational prayer in the masjid with burning them with fire. I believe that this hadeeth alone informs us of the previously mentioned ruling or it informs us of what Imaam Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee has stated and what Ibn Abee Shaybah has related. And that was that the Companions would not repeat the prayer in congregation in the masjid. This is since, if we were to assume that the second and third congregations were legislated in the masjid, then there came this severe threat from Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) to those who refrained from the congregational prayer, which congregation is it that they are refraining from? And for which congregation that they refrained from attending was this severe threat intended?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is said: &#8220;For the first congregation&#8221;, then it must said: These other congregations are not legislated. And if it is said: &#8220;This severe threat only applies to the one who refrains from every congregation, however many even if their number is continuous. So then in this case, the argument of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) against anyone of those people who refrained from any of the congregations would not be established at all. This is since if he were to surprise one of them, after having put someone in charge to lead the prayer, by going to his house and finding him spending leisure time with his wife and children. And so he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) would reprimand him for this, saying: &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go pray in congregation?&#8221; He would simply reply to him: &#8220;I will pray with the second or third congregation.&#8221; So will the Messenger&#8217;s (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) argument be established against him? Due to this, the Messenger&#8217;s strong desire to authorize someone to take his place and for him (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) to surprise those who refrained from attending the congregational prayer and burn their houses down, is the greatest proof that there is no second congregation at all. This is with respect to the textual reports that the scholars have relied on for support.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the investigation, then it is from the following angle: There are many ahaadeeth reported that state the virtue of the prayer in congregation. From them is the Prophet&#8217;s (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) saying: <b>&#8220;Prayer in congregation is better than praying alone by twenty-five &#8211; and in one report &#8211; by twenty-seven degrees.&#8221;</b> So this great virtue was only stated for the prayer in congregation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is stated in other ahaadeeth that: <b>&#8220;The prayer of a man along with another man is more purer in the sight of Allaah, than his praying alone. And the prayer of a man along with two other men is purer in the sight of Allaah than his praying with one man.&#8221;</b> This is because every time the congregation increases in its number of individuals, its reward multiplies with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if we keep this understanding in mind and then look at the consequences of the opinion that allows the holding of numerous congregations in the masjid that has a regular Imaam, then it has the worst consequences. This is because the opinion for holding repetitive congregations will lead to the minimizing of the amount of people who attend the first congregation. And this contradicts the incitement that we find in the hadeeth: <b>&#8220;The prayer of one man along with another man is purer that his praying alone&#8221;</b> since this hadeeth encourages that there be many people in the congregation. And holding the opinion that the congregations can be repeated in the masjid, by necessity, leads towards a minimization of the amount of people in the prescribed first congregation and a division of the Muslims&#8217; unity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is something else that requires careful examination. And it is that we must remember that the hadeeth of Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (raa) in Saheeh Muslim, similar to the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah (raa): <b>&#8220;I strongly desired to command a man and so he would lead the people in prayer.&#8221;</b> It was stated with respect to those who refrained from performing the Jumu&#8217;ah prayer. So when we know that Ibn Mas’ood (raa) placed a threat, of a specific type, on every person that refrains from attending the Jumu’ah and the congregational prayer, then we realize that these two prayers are with regard to their link to the congregation. For indeed, this threat means that there is to be no second congregation after any of these two prayers. Thus, the Jumu’ah prayer &#8211; until now &#8211; is preserved in its singularity and there is no opinion held stating that it is prescribed to have numerous (Jumu’ah) prayers in one masjid. All of the scholars, in spite of their differences agree on this. Due to this, we can see the masjids crowded with people on the day of Jumu’ah. And if it doesn’t escape out minds, we must remember that from the causes of the masjids being filled on the day of Jumu’ah is that there are those who attend Jumu’ah yet do not attend any of the other (regular) prayers. However, there is no doubt that the cause for the masjids being filled with people on the day of Jumu’ah is that the Muslims do not practice &#8211; and all praise is for Allaah &#8211; the act of repeating the Jumu’ah prayer (continuously) in the same masjid. So if the Muslims were to treat the congregational prayer like they treat the Jumu’ah prayer and like the way the matter was during the time of Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam), the masjids would be filled with people. This is since every person that constantly prays in congregation will always have in his mind that if he misses the first congregation, he will not be able to attain it after that. So this belief will serve as an incentive for him to closely guard his attending of the congregational prayer. And the opposite is true also. If a Muslim holds inside that if he misses this first congregation, then he can always find a second one or a third one or sometimes even a tenth one, then this is from the things that weaken his enthusiasm and aspiration in attending the first congregation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are two things that remain before us:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First we must clarify that those who held the view that the second congregation, according to the particularization mentioned previously, was not legislated, and who said that doing it was disliked, they are the majority of the Imaams of the Salaf. Amongst them are the three Imaams &#8211; Abu Haneefah, Maalik and Ash-Shaafi’ee. Imaam Ahmad is also amongst them according to one report. However, this report is not well known amongst his followers today, even though one of his most specialized students, Abu Dawood As-Sijistaanee mentioned it. Thus, he reported from him in his book <i>Masaa’il Al-Imaam Ahmad</i> that he (Ahmad) said: &#8220;Repeating the congregational prayer in the two sacred masjids (i.e. of Makkah and Madinah) bears the highest level of disapproval (<i>kiraaha</i>).&#8221; So this, from the aspect of preference, indicates to us that there also exists the disapproval of repeating the congregations in other masjids as well. However, it (the level of disapproval) is more severe in the two (sacred) masjids. So in this report, Imaam Ahmad is in conformity with the other three Imaams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly, the other report on Imaam Ahmad &#8211; the one which is more known to his students &#8211; he (rahimahullaah) and those interpreters who followed him, base their support for it on a hadeeth reported by At-Tirmidhee, Imaam Ahmad and others. It is the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudree, in which he said: <b>&#8220;A man entered the masjid when the Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) had already prayed and his Companions were gathered around him (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). This man wanted to pray, so the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: ‘Is there not a man who can give charity to this person by praying with him?’ So a man stood up and prayed with him.&#8221;</b> And in the report of Abu Bakr Al-Baihaqee, which is found in his Sunan Al-Kubraa, it is stated that this man was Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq. However, this report has weakness in its chain. The report that is authentic doesn’t name the man in it. So these (scholars) have used this hadeeth as evidence and say: &#8220;The Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) has approved of the second congregation!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The response to the use of this evidence is that we must consider that the congregation, which the hadeeth talks about, is not the same congregation that is being indicated in the question. This is since the congregation that the hadeeth refers to the congregation of a man who enters the masjid after the first congregation has finished and wants to pray alone. But the Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) incited those of his Companions who had prayed with him already to let one of them get up and volunteer and pray a voluntary prayer. So someone did it and that is the way it occurred. So this congregation consists of two people: The one leading the prayer (imaam) and the one being led (ma’moom). The Imaam is praying his obligatory prayer, while the ma’moom is praying a voluntary prayer. So who is the one who put this congregation together? If it were not for the one praying voluntarily, there would be no congregation. So therefore, this is a supererogatory and voluntary congregation, and not an obligatory congregation. And the differing (mentioned in the question) is only with regard to the second obligatory congregation. So due to this, using the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudree as evidence for this area of dispute is not correct. And what further confirms this is the fact that the hadeeth states: <b>&#8220;Is there not a man who can give charity to this person by praying with him?&#8221;</b> In this incident that occurred, there was someone who gave charity and there was someone who received charity. So if we were to ask a person with the least amount of knowledge and understanding: &#8220;Who is the one giving the charity and who is the one receiving the charity in this situation, which the Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) has approved of?&#8221; The answer would be: &#8220;The one giving the charity is the person praying the voluntary prayer, who had already prayed the obligatory prayer behind Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam), while the one who is receiving the charity is the person who arrived late.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now if we were to throw this same question on the congregation that is in dispute right now: for example six or seven people enter the masjid, and find that the Imaam has already prayed. So one of them leads the prayer and the rest follow him in a second congregation. So who is the one giving the charity amongst these people? And who is the one receiving the charity? No one can give the same answer as in the first example. So this congregation (of people) that has entered after the Imaam finished praying, all of them are praying their obligatory prayer. There is no one giving charity, nor is there anyone receiving charity. On the contrary, this obscurity is quite obvious and clear in the first example. The one giving charity is the person who is praying the voluntary prayer, who already prayed behind Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). His prayer was recorded as twenty-seven levels (of reward). So because of that, he is rich and therefore able to give away in charity to others. And the one who leads the prayer &#8211; and if it were not for that person giving charity, he would have prayed alone &#8211; he is poor and in need for someone to give him charity. This is since he did not earn what the person who is giving him charity earned (from reward).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the reason for this person being the one giving the charity and that person being the one receiving the charity is clear. As for the scenario that is in dispute now, then the scenario is not clear, for all of the people (praying) are poor, since they have all missed out on the virtue of the first congregation. So the saying of Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) <b>&#8220;Is there not a man who can give charity to this person by praying with him&#8221;</b> doesn’t apply here. Therefore, in a situation like this, it is not valid to use this incident (mentioned in the hadeeth) as evidence. Nor can it be used in reference to this issue, which is the area of our discussion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We will link this to another evidence they use as proof, which is the Prophet’s (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) saying: <b>&#8220;Praying in the congregation is more virtuous than praying alone by twenty-seven degrees.&#8221;</b> So they use the generality (in the hadeeth) as evidence, meaning they understand that the word &#8220;the&#8221; before the word congregation is for a general inclusion (of all congregations). This means that (according to them) every congregational prayer is more virtuous than praying alone. We respond by saying, basing it on the previously mentioned evidences that &#8220;the&#8221; is not for a general inclusion, but rather it is for a specific designation. This means that the congregational prayer &#8211; which the Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) prescribed, incited towards, ordered the people to attend, threatened those who abandoned it with burning their houses and which those who abandoned it were described as being hypocrites &#8211; is the prayer in congregation that is more virtuous than praying alone. And it is the first congregational prayer. And Allaah, the Most High, knows best.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Pulling someone back from the complete row to avoid praying alone</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">If you enter the masjid and the first row of prayer is complete, can you pull someone from it behind so that he can pray with you (in the second row) or should you just pray by yourself?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the hadeeth about pulling someone back from the first row so that one would not pray alone in the second row were authentic, it would be obligatory to base the opinion on it. However, its chain of narration is not authentic, as I have explained in <em>Irwaa-ul-Ghaleel</em> and <em>As-Silsilah Ad- Da&#8217;eefah</em> (second volume).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore so long as this hadeeth is not authentic, then the person who enters the masjid and the row of prayer in front of him is complete, he must try to squeeze into the row that is before him. This is possible in most cases, during this era in which a majority of Muslims have abandoned the act of joining tightly (by squeezing together) in the lines of prayer, for many of them do not stand close together in the lines of prayer. So if he finds that the row is complete, he should try his best to find an empty space in it, even if he has to gesture to the one he wants to pray next to, to make some space for him to enter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if he is not able to do this, either because the people in the row are closely packed together or because some of the people praying do not make room for him, then he could stand in the second row by himself, and his prayer will be valid. This is because the Prophet&#8217;s saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">There is no prayer for the one who prays in the row by himself</span>&#8221; is only in reference to the extent of one’s ability and adequacy to perform all the rest of the acts of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We know, for example, that standing for the obligatory prayer is a pillar (of the prayer). Therefore, if one prays sitting while he has the ability to stand, his prayer is not valid. However, if he is not able to stand, then he could pray sitting, as the Prophet, <em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, said: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Pray standing. But if you are not able to, then sitting. But if you are not able to, then on your bed.</span>&#8221; This goes the same for the case of the individual who prays behind the row by himself, in that his condition is that he is not able to join into the row that is before him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the hadeeth, &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">There is no prayer for the one who prays alone behind the row</span>&#8220;, is most likely applicable to the person that takes this issue lightly or to the one who turns away from this legal ruling. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As has been done by many people, especially those <em>mu&#8217;addhins</em> who do not join into the rows, but rather pray by themselves in places near to the door (of the masjid). So these individuals are the ones whom the hadeeth is directed to</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the man who enters the masjid and tries to join into the row but is not able to, nor does anyone come that will join him (in the second row), then he can pray by himself. And Allaah does not burden a soul with a responsibility, except that He has given it the ability to fulfill the responsibility. And this is the view of Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">The Origins of Shirk [1]<br>
Al-Ibaanah Magazine , Issue No.3 &#8211; Dhul-Qa’dah 1416H / April 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From that which has been established in the Sharee&#8217;ah (prescribed law) is that mankind was &#8211; in the beginning &#8211; a single nation upn true Tawheed, then Shirk (directing any part or form of worship, or anything else that is solely the right of Allaah, to other than Allaah) gradually overcame them. The basis for this is the saying of Allaah &#8211; the Most Blessed, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;Mankind was one Ummah, then Allaah sent prophets bringing good news and warnings.&#8221;</strong> (Soorah Baqarah 2:213)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbaas &#8211; radiallaahu &#8216;anhu &#8211; said: &#8220;Between Nooh (Noah) and Adam were ten generations, all of them were upon Sharee&#8217;ah (law) of the truth, then they differed. So Allaah sent prophets as bringers of good news and as warners.&#8221; [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Urwah al-Hanbalee (d.837 H) said: &#8220;This saying refutes those historians from the People of the Book who claim that Qaabil (Cain) and his sons were fire-worshippers.&#8221; [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: In it is also a refutation of some of the philosophers and atheists who claim that the (natural) basis of man is Shirk, and that Tawheed evolved in man! The preceeding aayah (verse) falsifies this claim, as do the two following authentic hadith:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Firstly: His (the prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) saying that he related from his Lord (Allaah) : <em> &#8220;I created all my servants upon the true Religion (upon Tawheed, free from Shirk). Then the devils came to them and led them astray from their true Religion. They made unlawful to people that which I had made lawful for them, and they commanded them to associate in worship with Me, that which I had sent down no authority.&#8221;</em> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly: His (the prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) saying: <em> &#8220;Every child is born upon the Fitrah [5] but his parents make him a jew or a christian or a magian. It is like the way an animal gives birth to a natural offspring. have you noticed any born mutilated, before you mutilate them.&#8221; </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah said: Recite if you wish: <strong> &#8220;Allaah&#8217;s fitrah with which He created mankind. There is to be no change to the creation (Religion) of Allaah.&#8221;</strong> (Soorah ar-Rum 30:30) [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After this clear explanation, it is of the upmost importance for the Muslim to know how Shirk spread amongst the believers, after they were muwahhideen (people upon Tawheed). Concerning the saying of Allaah &#8211; the most perfect &#8211; about the people of Nooh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;And they have said : You shall not forsake your gods, nor shall you forsake Wadd, nor Suwaa&#8217;, nor Yaghooth, nor Ya&#8217;ooq, nor Nasr.&#8221;</strong> (Soorah Nooh 71:23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been related by a group from the Salaf (Pious Predecessors), in many narrations, that these five deities were righteous worshippers. However, when they died, Shaytaan (Satan) whispered into their people to retreat and sit at their graves. Then Shaytaan whispered to those who came after them that they should take them as idols, beautifying to them the idea that you will be reminded of them and thereby follow them in righteous conduct. Then Shaytaan suggested to the third generation that they should worship these idols besides Allaah &#8211; the most high &#8211; and he whispered to them that this is what their forefathers used to do!!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah sent to them Nooh alayhis-salaam, commanding them to worship Allaah alone. However none responded to hiscall except a few. Allaah &#8211; the mighty and majestic &#8211; related this whole incident in Soorah Nooh Ibn &#8216;Abbas relates: &#8220;Indeed these five names of righteous men from the people of Nooh. When they died Shataan whispered to their people to make statues of them and to place these statues in their places of gathering as a reminder of them, so they did this. However, none from amongst them worshipped these statues, until when they died and the purpose of the statues was forgotten. Then (the next generation) began to worship them.&#8221;[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The likes of this has also been related by Ibn Jareer at-Tabaree and others, from a number of the salaf (Pious Predecessors) &#8211; radiallaahu &#8216;anhum. In ad-Durral-Manthoor (6/269): &#8216;Abdullaah ibn Humaid relates from Abu Muttahar, who said: Yazeed ibn al-Muhallab was mentioned to Abu Ja&#8217;far al-Baaqir (d.11H), so he said: He was killed at the place where another besides Allaah was first worshipped. Then he mentioned Wadd and said: &#8220;Wadd was a Muslim man who was loved by his people. When he died, the people began to gather around his grave in the land of Baabil ( Babel ), lamenting and mourning. So when Iblees (Satan) saw them mourning and lamenting over him, he took the form of a man and came to them, saying : I see that you are mourning and lamenting over him. So why don&#8217;t you make a picture of him (i.e. a statue) and place it in your places of gatherings so that you maybe reminded of him. So they said: Yes, and they made a picture of him and put in their place of gathering; which reminded them of him. When Iblees saw how they were (excessively) remembering him, he said : &#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t every man amongst you make a similar picture to keep in your own houses, so that you can be (constantly) reminded of him.&#8221; So they all said &#8220;yes&#8221;. So each household made a picture of him, which they adored and venerated and which constantly reminded them of him. Abu Ja&#8217;far said: &#8220;Those from the later generation saw what the (pevious generation) had done and considered that&#8230;&#8230;..to the extent that they took him as an ilah (diety) to be worshipped besides Allaah. He then said :&#8221; This was the first idol worshipped other than Allaah, and they called this idol Wadd&#8221;[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus the wisdom of Allaah &#8211; the Blessed, the Most High &#8211; was fufilled, when he sent Muhammed sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam as the final prophet and made his Sharee&#8217;ah the completion of all divinely Prescribed Laws, in that He prohibited all means and avenues by which people may fall into Shirk &#8211; which is the greatest of sins. For this reason, building shrines over graves and intending to specifically travel to them, taking them as places of festivity and gathering and swearing an oath by the inmate of a grave; have all been prohibited. All of these lead to excessiveness and lead to the worship of other than Allaah &#8211; the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This being the case even more so in an age in which knowledge is diminishing, ignorance is increasing, thre are few sincere advisors ( to the truth) and shaytaan is co-operating with men and jinn to misguide mankind and to take them away from the worship of Allaah alone &#8211; the Blessed, the Most High.</p>

The meaning is that mankind were born upona disposition and a nature which is ready to accept the true Religion. So if he were to be left upon this, then he would continue upon it. However, those who deviate from this do so due to following human weaknesses and blind following of others&#8230;..&#8221; Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajar said in Al-Fath (3/248): &#8220;The people differ concerning what is meant by al-Fitrah and the most famous saying is that it means Islaam. Ibn &#8216;abdul-Barr said: That is what was well known with most of the salaf (pious predecessors), and the scholars of tafseer are agreed that what is meant by the saying of Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; &#8220;Allaah&#8217;s fitrah wiht which He created mankind.&#8221; is Islaam</p>

However, no biography could be found for him, neither in ad-Dawlaabee&#8217;s al-Kunaa wal-Asmaa, nor Muslim&#8217;s al-Kunaa, nor any one elses. And the hidden defect here is that he is from the Shee&#8217;ah, but his biography is not included in at-Toosee&#8217;s al-Kunaa &#8212; from the index of Shee&#8217;ah narrators.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Translated by Dawud Burbank rahimahullaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Muhammad Naasiruddeen al-Albaanee was asked, &#8220;Our Shaikh, may Allaah bless you, the scholars of the Salaf, may Allaah have mercy upon them, mention that Tawheed is of three types: &#8216;ar-Ruboobiyyah,&#8217; &#8216;al-Uloohiyyah&#8217; and &#8216;al-Asmaa was-Sifaat,&#8217; so is it correct for us to say that there is a fourth Tawheed that is &#8216;Tawheedul-Haakimiyyah&#8217; or &#8216;Tawheed of Judgement?&#8217; So he replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8216;Al-Haakimiyyah&#8217; is a branch of the branches of Tawheedul-Uloohiyyah, and those who focus their attention upon this newly invented saying in the present age use it as a weapon not to teach the Muslims the Tawheed that all of the Prophets and Messengers came with, but rather as apolitical weapon. So if you wish I will establish for you what I have just said, even though this question has repeatedly been answered by me, many times &#8211; or if you wish we will continue upon our topic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have said in similar circumstances, as support for what I have just said, that usage of the word &#8216;al-Haakimyyah&#8217; is part of the political da&#8217;wah that is particular to some of the parties present today; and I will mention here something that occurred between myself and someone who gave the khutbah in one of the mosques of Damascus. So on the day of Jumu&#8217;ah he gave a khutbah which was all about judgement/decree being for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. But this person made an error with regard to a matter of fiqh. So after he had finished the prayer I went forward to him and gave him &#8216;salaam,&#8217; and said to him, &#8216;O my brother, you did so and so, and that is contrary to the Sunnah.&#8217; So he said to me, &#8216;I am a Hanafee, and the Hanafee madhhab says what I have done.&#8217; So I said, &#8216;Subhaanallaah! You have given khutbah that judgement/decree is just for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, but you only use this word to attack those rulers whom you think are Unbelievers because they do not rule according to the Islamic Sharee&#8217;ah. But you have forgotten about yourselves &#8211; that Allaah&#8217;s decree/judgement covers every Muslim. So why, when I say to you that the Messenger did so and so, why do you say, &#8216;But my madhhab is such and such.&#8217; Then you have contradicted that which you call the people to.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if it were not for the fact that they use this saying as a tool for political propaganda of theirs, then we would say, &#8216;This is our merchandise that has been returned to us.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the da&#8217;wah that we call the people to contains &#8216;al-Haakimiyyah&#8217; and other than &#8216;al-Haakimiyyah&#8217;: Tawheedul-Uloohiyyah and Tawheed of worship &#8211; that which you concentrate upon enters within it. We are the ones who propagated what you mention whilst you are focusing upon &#8216;al-Haakimiyyah,&#8217; the hadeeth of Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan, that when the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa-sallam) recited this ayah to his noble Companions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They (the Jews and the Christians) took the Rabbis and learned men as lords besides Allaah. Soorah at-Tawbah (9):31</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">then &#8216;Adiyy ibn Haatim at-Taa&#8217;ee said, &#8216;By Allaah, O Messenger of Allaah, we did not take them as lords besides Allaah.&#8217; So he said, &#8216;When they made something lawful forbidden for you, had you not used to declare it forbidden; and when they made lawful something forbidden, had you not used to take it as being lawful?&#8217; He said, &#8216;As for that, then it did used to happen.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Then that is your taking them as lords besides Allaah.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we are the ones who propagated this hadeeth, and then it reached the others. Then they advanced one part of Tawheedul-Uloohiyyah or worship, with this innovated title for political aims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I do not see anything (wrong) in a terminology such as this if only they had not left it as mere propaganda without their acting as it requires. So it is, as I have just mentioned, a part of Tawheed of worship &#8211; but you will see them worshipping Allaah in whatever manner each of them feels like, and if it is said, as we have just mentioned in the incident of the man who gave the khutbah, &#8216;that someone is acting contrary to the Sunnah,&#8217; or &#8216;this is something contrary to the saying of the Messenger (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa-sallam),&#8217; then he says, &#8216;My madhhab is such and such.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That judgement/decree is for Allaah alone is not just a proof against the Unbelievers and the mushriks, but also against anyone who transgresses against Allaah by contradicting what came from Allaah in His Book, and from His Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa-sallam) in his Sunnah. This is what I have as a reply to the likes of this question.&#8221;</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Al-Asaalah, Issue #21<br>
Translator: isma&#8217;eel alarcon</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One thing the Muslim scholars do not differ about at all is the fact that Islaam is established upon two magnificent and great fundamental principles. Indeed they are</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) worshipping only Allaah apart from others and<br>
2) following and taking our example from only the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) apart from others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, what I want to discuss here only concerns the principle that states: A Muslim’s Eemaan does not become complete until he believes that Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) is the Messenger of Allaah. And that if any person on the face of this earth were to bear witness to Allaah’s Oneness according to the three categories (of Tawheed), then he will not be a believer until he adds to that his belief that Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) is His slave and messenger. So if it is this way, then it is required for every Muslim to learn the meaning of this beautiful statement (of Tawheed): <strong> “So know that Laa Ilaaha Illaa Allaah (there is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah)” [Surah Muhammad: 19]</strong> and to acknowledge the true sense of its meaning in two parts. First, to believe in it and second, to put it into actuality in himself, his worship and his belief in Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, it is an obligation upon every Muslim to know the meaning of “And I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and messenger.” This testimony (of bearing witness that Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) is Allaah’s slave and messenger) completes the first testimony (of bearing witness that there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah). So due to this, the testimony (of Faith) does not become complete unless the Muslim believes in this (second) testimony &#8211; understanding, believing and accepting it firstly, and then applying it in the affairs of his life secondly. So our saying: “And I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and messenger” requires, among other things, that we believe that Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) conveyed the message and that he carried out his task in its complete and perfect form, such that no one that comes after him, however high or elevated he may be, can correct or amend some part of it. Our Lord, may He be Glorified and Exalted, indicated this fact in his saying: <strong> &#8220;This day I have completed your Religion for you, and I have perfected My favor upon you, and I am pleased with Islaam as a Religion for you.&#8221; [Surat-ul-Maa’idah: 3] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why it is authentically reported on the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) from numerous paths of narration that he said: <strong>“I have not left anything that will bring you closer to Allaah and distance you from the Hellfire, except that I have commanded you with it. And I have not left anything that will bring you closer to the Hellfire and distance you from Allaah except that I have forbade you from it.” </strong>So there has not been left any room for amending anything from it, whether it be a simple or a trivial thing being amended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why it is reported on the Imaam of Daar-ul-Hijrah (Madeenah), Imaam Maalik Ibn Anas, may Allaah have mercy on him, that he said: &#8220;Whosoever introduces into Islaam an innovation, which he deems is good, then he has claimed that Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) has betrayed (the trust of conveying) the Message. Read the saying of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic: &#8216;This day I have completed your Religion for you, and I have perfected My favor upon you, and I am pleased with Islaam as a Religion for you.&#8217; [Surat-ul-Maa’idah:3] So whatever was not (part of) the Religion on that day, is not (part of) the Religion on this day. And the last part of this ummah (nation) will not be rectified, except by that which rectified its first part.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was from the understanding of Imaam Maalik, the Imaam of Daar-ul-Hijrah, such that he plainly stated in a clear Arabic language that whoever introduces into Islaam just one innovation and then claims that it is something good, he has in fact claimed that Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) betrayed the Message. And whoever makes this claim, he does not believe (truly) that “Muhammad is His slave and messenger.” As is very clear in the words of this noble Imaam, it (the innovation) is “not (part of) the Religion on this day.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is upon the Muslim to implement his Ittibaa’ (following of the Prophet), such that he could be truthful in (his declaration that) Muhammad, Allaah’s Messenger, is His slave and messenger. And that he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) brought the complete and pure message, without adding to it or subtracting from it. If this is the case, then every Muslim must acknowledge his extent and stop at the points where his Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) has placed limits for him, such as the acts of worship and deeds of obedience (to Allaah). This is because the pen has dried with what was revealed previously (i.e. no more revelation after Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). And there was no room left open to approve of an act of worship that didn’t exist previously in the first days (i.e. of the Prophet). Consequently, our pious predecessors (Salaf As-Saalih) have come and gone all acknowledging the extent of the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) in that he first fulfilled his mission and conveyed the Message, as you know. And (second) that he was the best worshipper amongst Allaah’s worshippers and the most fearing of Allaah. So there is no room to correct him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. From the standpoint of legislating (revealed matters) into the Religion, as you have heard the ayah and Imaam Maailk’s comments about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Such that it can be claimed that there is someone who is a better worshipper and more worshipping (of Allaah) than Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). This is impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever understands these two facts, which are related to one’s belief that Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) is Allaah’s slave and messenger, he will limit the worship he performs for Allaah to only that which has been reported on the Prophet (in the ahaadeeth). And he will not put any example or role model before him other than the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). Nor will he ever claim this second point, meaning it is impossible that it can get into the mind of any believer that he is more dutiful to Allaah or more fearing of Allaah or more worshipping of Allaah than him (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). This is something impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We will mention what has been reported in the two Saheeh collections on the authority of Anas Ibn Maalik (raa) that a group of people went to see the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) but asked his wives because they were not able to find him. So they asked his wives about the Prophet’s worship – about his standing in prayer at night, his fasting during the day and about his relations with his wives. So they mentioned to them what they knew about his guidance regarding that &#8211; and his guidance is the best guidance on the face of this earth as is stated in the khutbah al-Haajah: <strong>“And the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad.”</strong> The wives of the Prophet mentioned to these men that he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) would fast and break his fast, and that he would pray at night and also sleep and that he would marry women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas (raa) said: “When they heard that from the wives of the Prophet, they found his (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) worship to be little.&#8221; They thought it to be little because of what had settled in their minds that the Prophet must pray the whole night and that he must fast all the time and that he was a monk and did not go near his wives. So they were shocked to find something that was not in compliance with their notions. So they assumed that the reason for this was because Allaah had forgiven all of the Prophet&#8217;s past and future sins. So it is as if they said: “The Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) only minimized in his worship &#8211; which they thought to be little &#8211; because Allaah had forgiven his sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there wasn&#8217;t left any obstacle preventing him from increasing in the worship of his Lord.” This was a mistake on their part without a doubt. This is since they didn’t know that this worship which they thought to be little, was in fact worship that could not be fulfilled by even the best worshipper amongst mankind, not even Dawood (as) about whom it is authentically reported in Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <strong> “Dawood was the best worshipper amongst mankind.” </strong>This group of people did not know that the Prophet was the best worshipper amongst mankind with this worship (of his) and that not even the best worshipper amongst mankind was able to perform his worship, as I have mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that was from the things that he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) was asked about when some people – who were well aware of his habits not like that group of people that was ignorant of his habits – found him, and they felt compassion for him (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam), because they saw him standing in prayer until his feet had become swollen. So they said to him: “O Messenger of Allaah! Allaah has forgiven your past and future sins.” They meant by this: “Have pity on yourself, O Messenger of Allaah! Be easy in the worship, for your feet have become swollen.&#8221; And his response was: <strong> &#8220;Should I not then be a grateful servant?&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a refutation of the false reasoning employed by that small band of people, who said the reason for the Prophet&#8217;s little worship was because Allaah had forgiven his past and future sins. They were not aware that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) would stand in night prayer until his feet would become swollen. So when it was said to him: “O Messenger of Allaah! Allaah has forgiven your past and future sins”, he responded: &#8220;Should I not then be a grateful servant?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Basing on what they imagined was little worship on the part of the Prophet and what they knew of Allaah having forgiven his past and future sins, each person in this small group assumed that they were obligated to exceed in worship and that they must surpass what they heard about the Prophet&#8217;s worship with regard to his fasting, praying at night and relations with women. So they made the following pledges to themselves: The first person said &#8220;I will pray all night and won&#8217;t sleep.&#8221; The second one said: &#8220;As for me, I will fast all the time and never go a day without fasting.&#8221; And the third person said: &#8220;I will not marry women.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why? Because they assumed that marriage was a distraction and turned one away from perfecting one&#8217;s worship to Allaah. But they did not know &#8211; and Allaah knows best but it seem to me that they were new (reverts) to Islaam who did not learn yet of the Commands and Rulings of Islaam &#8211; that marriage was itself worship, as is found in the famous hadeeth, when a group of poor people came to the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The people with much wealth and income have surpassed us &#8211; they pray like we pray, they fast like we fast, and they make Hajj like we make Hajj. And they give money in charity but we don&#8217;t give away anything in charity!&#8221; So the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said to them: &#8220;Shall I not direct you to something, which if you do, you will surpass those in front of you and those behind you will never be able catch up to you (in reward), except for those who do the same as you?&#8221; So the representative of the poor people went back to his companions among the poor folk and related to them the good news that came from the Prophet. So they became very happy at hearing it. However, it was not long before their representative went to Allaah&#8217;s Messenger again to tell him: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah! What you told us was conveyed to the rich folk and so they have begun to do what we are doing.&#8221; So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: &#8220;That is the bounty of Allaah, which He gives to whom He pleases.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the narration of Imaam Muslim found in his Saheeh. In another narration of the hadeeth, it is reported that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said to them: &#8220;Verily in every tasbeehah (saying SubhanAllaah) there is charity for you. And in every tahmeedah (saying Al-Hamdulillaah) there is charity. And in every takbeerah (saying Allaahu Akbar) there is charity. And in every tahleelah (saying Bismillaah) there is charity. Commanding good is charity and forbidding evil is charity. And removing a harmful obstacle from the road is charity.&#8221; Then the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) continued to mention many noble characteristics. Then he said at the end of the hadeeth: <strong> &#8220;And in your having relations with your wife, there is charity.&#8221;</strong> They said in amazement: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, will one of us fulfill his desire (with his wife) and get rewarded for that?&#8221; So the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: &#8220;Don’t you see that if one fulfills it in a forbidden way, that he will have a burden (of sin) for it?&#8221; They said: &#8220;Of course, O Messenger of Allaah.&#8221; So he said: <strong> &#8220;Then likewise, if he fulfills it in a lawful way he will be rewarded for it.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they were not aware of the likes of this hadeeth and other hadeeths in which there is found an incitement to get married and especially in producing children and progeny, as is reported in the authentic hadeeth: &#8220;Marry the fertile and loving woman, for indeed I will compete with other nations by you, as regards to who has the most followers, on the Day of Judgement.&#8221; So the one who marries and keeps himself chaste and keeps his wife chaste, he will be rewarded for that. This group was ignorant about this, so there was one among them who made a pledge binding on himself that he would not marry, saying: &#8220;As for me, I will not marry women.&#8221; Then that group left and when the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) returned home, his wives informed him of what they heard from that group of people and the pledges they made to themselves. So the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) gave a khutbah about this in his masjid, saying: &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with these people who say such and such&#8221; (?) &#8211; repeating to the audience what these individuals who came to his house had said. &#8220;This last person will not marry women. The second said he would fast everyday and not go a day without fasting. And the other one said that he will pray all night and not sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However it was from the Prophet&#8217;s etiquettes when admonishing, reprimanding and teaching the people that he would hide the faults of those who committed errors or sinned (by not mentioning their names). So he would not expose them but rather make such statements like the one you just read above: &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with these people who say such and such?&#8221; This is because there is no benefit in mentioning the (name of the) person who erred, unless his error involves a large group of people and he is present (for the reminder). But if the people leave and he leaves, the opportunity for reminding them goes away. So in this situation, one must mention that to the people publicly. And it is not like that which is thought by some people who know about wisdom and gentleness when commanding good and forbidding evil, for they do not realize that gentleness does not nullify manifesting the criticism of one who errs if his error involves a group of people. The stories of our Salaf (predecessors), all praise be to Allaah, are filled with reports bearing witness to this fact. It is sufficient for me to just mention what the two Shaikhs (Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim) reported in their Saheehs from the hadeeth of &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn &#8216;Umar who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8216;Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab, rady Allaahu &#8216;anhu, was giving the Friday khutbah &#8211; naturally in the Prophet&#8217;s masjid &#8211; when a man from the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger entered &#8211; and in one narration it states that it was &#8216;Uthmaan Ibn &#8216;Affaan. So &#8216;Umar stopped his khutbah and turned towards this person that had come late and had missed coming early to hear the dhikr and to hear the Jumu&#8217;ah khutah. So the man responded, saying: &#8216;O Commander of the Believers, I did not do anything except hear the Adhaan, make wudoo and then come to the masjid.&#8217; So he said to him reprimanding him in a disapproving interrogating manner: &#8216;The wudoo also, for I heard Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) say: Whoever goes to (pray) Jumu&#8217;ah, then he should take ghusl (bath).'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point we derive from this report is that he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) reprimanded &#8216;Uthmaan Ibn &#8216;Affaan publicly in front of a large gathering of witnesses because he came late to the Jumu&#8217;ah khutbah and prayer. So therefore: The principle of teaching and reminding someone is based on the foundation of: Hiding the faults of people, unless there is a benefit that requires that it be done in public. This is the principle that the Messenger of Allaah implemented when he gave the khutbah regarding that group of people that had come to his house. So he said: &#8220;What is wrong with these people who say such and such&#8221; making an indication of them but not naming anyone of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point is that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: &#8220;As for me…&#8221;, which is a refutation of the essence of what was stated by those people who claimed the reason that the Prophet, had little worship was due to Allaah having forgiven his past and future sins. So he said: &#8220;As for me, then I am the most fearing amongst you of Allaah, and the most dutiful amongst you towards Allaah. As for me, then indeed I fast and I don&#8217;t fast&#8221; &#8211; meaning I don&#8217;t fast all the time. &#8220;And I pray at night and I also sleep&#8221; &#8211; meaning I do not stay up the whole night, as is done by those extremists amongst worshippers who increase and try to surpass the worship of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). This is why &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah said, as is recorded in Saheeh Muslim: &#8220;The Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) never stayed up a whole night in worship.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said, reminding us that the Religion is moderation and that worhsip is moderation &#8211; neither exaggeration nor negligence: &#8220;As for me, then I am the most fearing amongst you of Allaah, and the most dutiful amongst you towards Allaah. As for me, then indeed I fast and I don&#8217;t fast. And I pray at night and I also sleep. And I marry women. So whoever turns away from my Sunnah then he is not from me.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet&#8217;s Sunnah, as it came to us from Islaam, is that which all the Muslims are obligated to adhere to. And I guarantee that if Dawood, who was the best worshipper amongst mankind according to the testimony of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, came after the Prophet&#8217;s being sent with this complete and perfect Islaam, he would not be able to encompass doing all of the Prophet&#8217;s acts of worship. This means all of the acts of worship that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger brought whether through speech, actions or silent approval. Due to this, there remain no grounds for any Muslim to add an act of worship after Allaah completed His Religion by sending His Prophet with this perfect Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after realizing that the Prophet is the best worshipper amongst mankind and the most dutiful and fearing of Allaah amongst them, there should not be anything but following of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). We are upon certainty that we will never be able to encompass the worship of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, except for occasionally or at brief periods of time. So we are completely incapable of following and tracing the footsteps of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger in his worship. This is impossible &#8211; with respect to every individual amongst mankind after the Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, there remains nothing before us except that we all strive for two things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. To learn the Sunnah of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger in all matters that came to us from Islaam &#8211; whether in Creed or in Worship or in characteristics and manners. And as I said before, we will never be able to do more than just imitate him, as it is said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;So imitate (them) if you are not like them,<br>
Verily, imitating the righteous ones is success.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not for us to imitate anyone amongst mankind except him, because he is the most perfect of humans according to unanimous agreement. And everyone that imitates him after he has gone will be overwhelmed by his ocean of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. This is the first thing &#8211; that we must know the Sunnah of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger according to the wide and extensive meaning. This is since the Prophet&#8217;s saying concerning that group of people: &#8220;So whoever turns away from my Sunnah, then he is not from me&#8221;, this sentence in this general hadeeth does not refer to the abandonment of the recommended sunnah acts, for example, that this person is not from the Prophet. This is not what is meant by the hadeeth. Rather, the meaning of the hadeeth is: &#8220;Whoever turns away from my Sunnah&#8221; meaning from my Way and from my Methodology in all affairs of my religious life. This is the kind of person that is not from him. And this kind of person varies with regard to his remoteness from following the Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Sunnah has two meanings:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. A religious Arabic language-based one, and it is that which the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) and those who followed his way were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. That which has occurred in the custom of the Fuqahaa in dividing the worship into two types &#8211; Fard (Obligation) and Sunnah (Recommended). The Sunnah here according to their definition of it is: &#8220;That which the one who does it will be rewarded for and which the one who abandons it will not be punished for.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the person that abandons the Messenger&#8217;s Sunnah, with its first meaning &#8211; i.e. his way and methodology &#8211; then this person is in misguidance. And his deviance can either be large or little depending on his closeness or remoteness to following Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). So based on this, we should find ourselves as having no need for amending and introducing a &#8220;good innovation&#8221; (bid&#8217;ah hasanah) into Islaam, claiming that there is nothing wrong with this innovation. This is because we should find ourselves as falling short and being incapable of following the noble Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) in everything that has been reported to us concerning his worship, whether it is related to supplications, remembrances or prayers. So it is sufficient for us to just follow him, according to our abilities. Here, I would like to mention a story reported by Al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh so that you can realize the worth of Allaah&#8217;s saying: ”This day I have completed your Religion for you, and I have perfected My favor upon you, and I am pleased with Islaam as a Religion for you.” [Surat-ul-Maa’idah: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhaaree reported that one of the Jewish Rabbis went to &#8216;Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab during the time of his Khilaafah and said to him: &#8220;O Commander of the Believers! There is an ayah in the Book of Allaah that if it had been revealed unto us &#8211; a gathering of Jews &#8211; we would have taken the day it was revealed as a day of &#8216;Eid (holiday).&#8221; So he asked: &#8220;Which ayah is it?&#8221; So the Rabbi mentioned the ayah: &#8220;This day I have completed your Religion for you…&#8221; So &#8216;Umar said: &#8220;This ayah was indeed revealed on a day of &#8216;Eid, on the day of Jumu&#8217;ah while the Allaah&#8217;s Messenger was in &#8216;Arafaat (meaning in his farewell pilgrimage). So this ayah was indeed sent down on a very great day in which there is a combination of two virtues and two &#8216;Eids &#8211; the &#8216;Eid of Jumu&#8217;ah and the &#8216;Eid of &#8216;Arafaat.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why did this Jew say: &#8220;Had it been revealed unto us, we would have taken the day it was revealed as a day of &#8216;Eid?&#8221; It is because he was aware of the greatness of this blessing, which Allaah bestowed upon His servants. But what about us Muslims today? Unfortunately, we do not give this great blessing its due weight in worth. This is why you find many people in the past &#8211; in previous generations &#8211; who have filled the Muslims with prayers, words of remembrance and supplications that the Prophet did not come with. What has come to us from the Prophet is truly sufficient and adequate, in fact it is more than our human capabilities can grasp. However, each one of us takes from this worship what he is able to and what conforms to his capability and capacity.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Innovations of Hajj, Umrah and visiting Medina</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I decided to add an appendix, setting forth the innovations regarding Hajj and visiting Madinat-ul-Munawwara, and Bait-ul-Maqdis (Jerusalem) (118) as many people do not know these things and so fall into them &#8211; so I wished to advise them by explaining and warning them against these things &#8211; as Allaah the Blessed and Exalted does not accept any action unless it fulfils two conditions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Firstly: That it done sincerely for the Face of Allaah, the Honored, the Exalted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly: That it is correct &#8211; and it is not correct until it is in accordance with the Sunnah, not at variance with it &#8211; and as the people of knowledge have agreed &#8211; everything claimed by the people to be part of worship which Rasoolullah did not prescribe by his saying, nor drew nearer to Allaah by performing it &#8211; then that is at variance with his Sunnah as his Sunnah is of two kinds:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) Sunnah of action (Sunnah Fi&#8217;liyyah &#8211; actions which he did) and<br>
(b) Sunnah of neglect (Sunnah Tarkiyyah) &#8211; acts which he did not do)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those things pertain to worship, the Prophet did not do &#8211; then it is from the Sunnah to leave them &#8211; for example: calling Adhaan for the &#8216;Eid prayers and for burying the dead, even though it is a means of making mentioning of Allaah and glorifying Him, it is not permissible do it as a means of drawing nearer to Allah, the Exalted, the Glorious &#8211; and that is only because it is something which Rasoolullah refrained from doing &#8211; and this point was understood by his companions &#8211; so they often warred against innovation in general &#8211; as is mentioned in its proper place &#8211; and Hudhaufah ibn al Yamaan (ra) said: &#8220;Every worship that has not been done by the companions of Rasoolullah, then do not do it.&#8221; And Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (ra)said: &#8220;Follow (the Sunnah) and do not innovate, and that is enough for you &#8211; stick to the old way.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how fortunate is the one to whom Allaah gives the good fortune of making his worship sincerely for Him and following of the Sunnah of His Prophet (sas) in it &#8211; not mixing it with innovation &#8211; for such a one then let him have good tidings of Allaah&#8217;s acceptance of his obedience &#8211; and his admission to His Paradise. May Allah make us those who bear the word and follow the best of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you should know that these innovations are traceable to the following factors:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) Weak (da&#8217;eef) Ahaadith &#8211; which are not permitted to be used as evidence, nor is it, according to your saying, permissible to act on them &#8211; as I have explained in the introduction of &#8216;Sifat-Salaat un-Nabee&#8217; (The Prophet&#8217;s Manner of Prayer) &#8211; and this is the position of a group of the people of knowledge &#8211; from them Ibn Taimiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) Fabricated (maudoo&#8217;) Ahaadith &#8211; or narrations which have no basis &#8211; some scholars remaining unaware of their true nature &#8211; and therefore basing religious verdicts upon them &#8211; their being the core of innovation and novelties!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(iii) The decisions of some scholars or their regarding certain things to be commendable &#8211; especially the later scholars &#8211; not basing these on any proofs (from the Qur&#8217;an of Sunnah), rather treating them as indisputable matters &#8211; until they become Sunnahs adhered to and followed. And it will not remain hidden from one who has insight into his religion &#8211; that it is not correct to follow such things -as nothing is part of the Sharee&#8217;ah except what Allaah has prescribed &#8211; and it is enough for the one who makes something desirable &#8211; if he is mujtahid &#8211; that it is permissible for him to act according to what he sees as desirable &#8211; and that Allaah will not punish him for that &#8211; But as for other people taking that as something prescribed and as Sunnah &#8211; then not definitely not! And how can that be when some of these things conflict with the Sunnah &#8211; as will be noted later of Allaah wills?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(iv) Customs and superstitions which have no evidence from the Sharee&#8217;ah, and are not even supported by the intellect &#8211; even if some ignorant people act upon them and take them to be part of the sharee&#8217;ah &#8211; sometimes finding support from others &#8211; sometimes from some people claiming to be from the people of knowledge &#8211; and actually having their appearance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then you should know that the danger of these innovations is not of one level &#8211; rather they are of different degrees. Some of them being clear shirk and kufr &#8211; as you will see, and some of them are less than that &#8211; however, you must be aware that the slightest innovation that someone brings into the religion is haraam (forbidden) after it is exposed as an innovation &#8211; as there is no innovation that is only makrooh (disapproved), as some people think &#8211; and how can that be when Rasoolullah (sas) said: &#8220;Every innovation is a going astray. And every going astray is in the Fire&#8221;. That is the one who does it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Imaam ash-Shaatibee has fully explained this point in his important book &#8216;Al I&#8217;tisaam&#8217; &#8211; and because of this the innovation is something very dangerous &#8211; and most people remain heedless of this, except for a small group of the people of knowledge and enough as a proof of the seriousness of innovation is the saying of the Prophet : &#8220;Verily Allah has refused to admit the repentance of anyone committing an innovation, until he gives up the innovation&#8221;. Narrated by Tabraanee and ad-Diyaa-ul-Maqdisee in &#8216;al Ahaadith ul-Mukhtaarah&#8217; and others &#8211; with saheeh isnaad &#8211; and was declared by al-Mundharee to be hasan. (119)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I complete this with word of advice which I convey to the readers from a great Imaam from the first scholars of the Muslims &#8211; Shaikh Hasan ibn &#8216;Ali al Barbahaaree &#8211; one of the companions of Imaam Ahmad &#8211; and died in the year 329 H, he &#8211; may Allaah be please with him &#8211; said: &#8220;And beware of the smallest of the newly-invented matters, as the small innovations due to repetition become large innovations, and in that way every innovation introduced in this Ummah began as a small innovation &#8211; resembling something correct and thus is the one who falls into it enticed &#8211; then he is not able to leave it &#8211; some of it grows and becomes part of the religion, practiced as such. So examine &#8211; may Allaah have mercy upon you &#8211; everything that people of your time say and do not made haste (in accepting it) until you ask and find out: Did any of the companions of the Prophet or any of the people of knowledge speak about it? So if you find a narration from the, then accept it and do not leave it for anything &#8211; and do not prefer anything- and do not prefer anything over it and thus fall into the Fire. And you should know &#8211; may Allaah have mercy upon you &#8211; that a worshipper&#8217;s Islaam is not complete until he is follower (of proof), consenting and submitting (to the Truth). So whoever claims that anything remains of Islaam which the companions of Rasoolullah did not fully explain to us &#8211; then he has invented a lie against them, and that is enough for him that he has reviled them &#8211; so he is an innovator, misguided and misguiding, introducing into Islaam what does not belong to it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Al-Albaani) say : And may Allah have mercy upon Imaam Maalik who said : &#8220;The last part of this Ummah will not be corrected except by that which corrected its beginning, so that which was not part of the religion then &#8211; is not part of the religion today.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And may Allah send blessing upon our Prophet (sas) who said : &#8220;I have not left any thing that will draw you nearer to Allah &#8211; except that I have enjoined it upon you. And I have not left anything that will take you away from Allah and draw you to the Fire except that I have forbidden it for you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And all praise is for Allaah by Whose blessing Good actions are completed.</p>

Ibn al-Hajj&#8217;s saying in &#8220;al-Madkhal&#8221; (1/259) that: &#8220;One should not mention with his tongues his needs or need forgiveness of sins when visiting the grave of the Prophet&#8221; because he knows his needs already and what is of benefit to him!!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">2. As is the case with most pilgrims these days &#8211; and it is very rare for one of them to bring the sacrificial animal along with him as the Prophet did. So he who does so, then there is no blame upon him &#8211; however one who does not bring it with him and still does Hajj Qaarin or Faarid &#8211; then he has gone against the Prophet&#8217;s action and his command &#8211; even though the people may be averse to this point. As Ibn Abbas said- reported by Muslim(4/58) and AHmad(1/278,342).</span></p>

And his basis for saying that is the saying of the Prophet: Verily Allaah has entered the &#8216;Umrah into this Hajj of yours, so when you come &#8211; then he who has made tawaaf of the House and between Safaa and Marwah &#8211; then he has become Halaal(left iHraam) except he who had the sacrificial animal with him.(Sahih A.D., nos.1573,1580).</span></p>

And that does not negate what is narrated from &#8216;Umar and others that Hajj Muffrad is better because of what I have stated in the Original.

If she pulls it up to her eyes then it is called &#8216;Al-Waswasah&#8217; or &#8216;Al-Burqa&#8217;. If she pulls it down to below the eye socket then it is &#8216;Al-Niqaab&#8217;, and if it is upon the end of her nose it is &#8216;Al-Lukfaam&#8217;. It is called the woman&#8217;s niqaab because it hides her colour of the niqaab (Lisaan ul &#8216;Arab 2/265-266).</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">42. Al-Idtibaa&#8217; is bid&#8217;ah before this tawaaf, and after it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">43. Abu Dawud and others. Authenticated by many scholars. See Saheeh Abi Dawud,(no.1653).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">44. Shaikh ul Islaam ibn Taimiyyah says: &#8220;As for the other parts of the House, and the Place of Ibraheem, and whatever is in the rest of the world mosques and their walls, and the graves of the prophets and good people &#8211; like the room of our Prophet, and cave of Ibraheem, and the place where our Prophet used to pray &#8211; and all other such places, and the rock at Jerusalem, then none of these are to be touched at all or kissed &#8211; by total agreement of the scholars. And as for tawaaf of these things &#8211; then it is one of the greatest and most forbidden bid&#8217;ahs &#8211; and he who takes that as part of his religion should be asked to repent &#8211; and if he refuses he killed&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">And &#8216;Abdur Razzaaq (no.8945) and AHmad and al-Baihaqi port from Ya&#8217;laa ibn Umayyah who said: &#8220;I made tawaaf with Umar ibn ul-Khattaab ( and in a narration: with &#8216;Uthuzza) &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with him &#8211; so when I came to the corner of the Door I started to touch it so he said &#8216;Have you not made tawaaf with Rasoolullaah?&#8217; I said: Yes. He said: &#8216;Then did you see him touch it?&#8217; I said: No. He said: &#8216;Then do likewise for there is for you in Rasoolullah a good example'&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">45. This is narrated by two isnaads from the Prophet by which the hadith reaches the level of hasan &#8211; and is increased in strength by the fact that a group of the Sahaabah acted on it &#8211; from them Ibn &#8216;Abbaas &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with him &#8211; who said: &#8220;This is the Multazam between the Corner and the Door. And it is authentically narrated from &#8216;Urwah ibn az-Zubair also &#8211; see &#8216;As-Sahaabah, no.2138. And Ibn Taimiyyah said in his &#8216;Mansak&#8217; (p.387): &#8220;And if he wishes to come to the Multazam &#8211; and that is what is between the Black stone and the Door &#8211; and he places upon it his chest and face and forearms and hands &#8211; and makes du&#8217;aa &#8211; and he asks Allaah for whatever he needs &#8211; then he may do so. And he may do so before the Farewell Tawaaf there being no difference in this being at that time or any other &#8211; and the Sahaabah used to do so when they entered Makkah &#8211; and if he stands near the Door making du&#8217;aa without iltizaam of the House then that is also good, and when he leaves he does not stand or turn or walk backwards.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">46. At-Tirmidhee and others, and the other narration is Tabraanis. And it is Saheeh: See also &#8216;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.21). Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah said: &#8220;And there is no particular dhikr narrated from the Prophet, not by his order, or his saying, or by his teaching, rather he should make du&#8217;aa with any authentic du&#8217;aas &#8211; and the particular du&#8217;aas which many people mention like that for below the water-spout, etc. &#8211; there is no basis for them.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">48. Bukharee and Muslim from &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah, and Bukharee from Jaabir &#8211; and the addition is his. See &#8216;Al-Irwaa'(no.191).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">49. See the Introduction and the Original Book, (pp.21,23 and 135).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">50. Saheeh hadith &#8211; as a number of scholars have said. see &#8216;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.1123) and &#8216;as-Saheehah&#8217; (no.883).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">51. Saheeh hadith narrated by at-Tayaalisee and others. See &#8216;as-Saheehah&#8217; (no.1056).</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">53. It is not easy these days to see the Ka&#8217;bah except from certain points on as-Safa; it can be seen from the pillar which supports the second storey of the mosque, so he who is able to do so has attained the Sunnah, and if not then let him try his best and there is no harm.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">54. (An-Nawawi) adds in &#8216;Al-Adhkaar&#8217;: Laa ilaaha illallaahu walaa na&#8217;budu illaa iyyaahu, and I do not find this addition in any narration of the hadith- either Muslim or anyone else who records the hadith&#8230;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">55. That is after the tahleels &#8211; making du&#8217;aa for whatever he wishes from the good of this world and the Hereafter &#8211; and the best thing is that it should be something reported from the Prophet or the pious predecessors (ssalaf ul-Saalih).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">56. And contrary to what some mistakenly say it is a sahih hadith. See &#8216;Al-Irwaa'(no.1072).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">57. Reported by an-Nasaa&#8217;ee and others &#8211; see &#8216;Al-Hajj ul-Kabeer. Note:The following text appears in &#8216;al-Mughnee&#8217;of Ibn Qudaamah al-Maqdisee (3/394): &#8220;And all the woman&#8217;s tawaaf and sa&#8217;ee is done walking, Ibn al-Mundhir says: Scholars are agreed that there is no reaml(walking quickly) upon the women around the Ka&#8217;bah or between Safaa and Marwah &#8211; nor uncovering the right shoulder (idtibaa&#8217;). And that is because the principle of it is uncovering the skin &#8211; and that is not desired from women &#8211; what is required from them is to cover &#8211; and in walking quickly (raml) and idtibaa&#8217; uncovering occurs.&#8221; And in &#8216;Al-Majmoo&#8217; of an-Nawawee(8/75) there appears what shows that there is difference of opinion in the matter between the Shafi&#8217;i scholars, he says:&#8221; There are two sayings in that. Firstly, and this is correct upon which the Jumhoor (majority) of scholars agree: That she should not run at all &#8211; but walk whether in the night or day. Secondly, that it is mutahabb for her to run at night when there is no one around (to see her) in the place of running &#8211; just as for men.&#8221; I (Al-Albanee) say: &#8220;And perhaps that is more cprrect &#8211; as the origin of sa&#8217;ee (running) is the sa&#8217;ee of Haajar mother of Imaa&#8217;eel &#8211; seeking water for her thirsty son as occurs in the hadith of Ibn &#8216;Abbaas: &#8220;And she found as-Safaa to be the nearest hill to her so she stood upon it, then turned towards the river-bed to see if she could see anyone &#8211; so she went down from as-Safaa till she reached the river-bed, raising up the border of her dress &#8211; and running fast till she crossed the river-bed then she came to Marwah and stood upon it to see if she could see anyone, and she could not see anyone &#8211; and she did that seven times. Ibn &#8216;Abbaas said: The Prophet said:&#8217;And that is the sa&#8217;ee of the people between these two'&#8221;. (Narrated by Bukharee in the Book of the Prophets)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">58. As for seeing the Ka&#8217;bah &#8211; it is not possible now because of the building between it and the Ka&#8217;bah &#8211; so should try his best to face the Ka&#8217;bah and not do as the confused people do, who raise up their eyes and hands to the sky!</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">60. Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaibah(4/68.69) from Ibn Mas&#8217;ood and Ibn &#8216;Umar &#8211; May Allah be pleased with them &#8211; with two sahih isnaads. And from Al-Musayyib ibn Raafi&#8217; al-Kaahilee and &#8216;Urwah ibn az-Zubair. And at-Tabraani narrates it from the Prophet but its isnaad is da&#8217;eef (weak) &#8211; &#8216;Al-Mujmi'(3/248).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">61. Or shaves it if there is sufficient time between his &#8216;Umrah and Hajj for his hair to grow enough (see Fath ul Baari,3/444).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">62. Narrated by Bukharee and Muslim</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">63. 64. 63,64. This stopping and that after it may be difficult to perform these days due to the crowd of people, so if he goes past it to &#8216;Arafah then it is alright insh&#8217;allah. Shaikh ul Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah says in &#8216;al-Fataawaa&#8217; (26:128): As for that which is from the sunnah of Rasoolullah &#8211; staying in Minaa on Yaum -ut-Tarwiyyah and for that night, then stopping at &#8216;Urahah&#8217;, which is between the Mash&#8217;ar ul Haraam and going from there to &#8216;Arafah, and the giving of Khutbah and the two prayers on the way in the middle of &#8216;Uranah&#8217;- then this is as agreed upon by scholars &#8211; whereas many writers do not bring it to notice &#8211; and most people do not know due to the prevalence of invented practices.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">65. I say: &#8220;And also it is not reported that the Prophet prayed anything before Zuhr or after &#8216;Asr in this place &#8211; or in any of his journeys &#8211; and it is not established that he prayed any supplementary prayers in any of his journeys except the two sunnahs of Fajr and the Witr.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">66. Bukharee narrates it from Ibn &#8216;Umar with mu&#8217;allaq isnaad. See &#8216;Mukhtasar-al-Bukhari'(3/89/25).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">67. Hasan or Sahih hadith. With more than one isnaad &#8211; refer to &#8216;As-Saheehah,(no.1503)&#8217;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">68. As that is established from the Prophet &#8211; as is explained in the Original.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">69. Narrated by Muslim and others. See &#8216;At-Targheeb'(2/129).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">70. Narrated by AHmad and others &#8211; and authenticated by a number of scholars &#8211; as I have explained in &#8216;Takhreej ut-Targheeb&#8217;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">71. This was said ny Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah, its being established from the Prophet and his companions, in al-Bukhari (25/94/801) (Mukhtasar al-Bukhari).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">72. Ibn Taimiyyah says: &#8220;And when he reaches Muzdalifah he prays Maghrib before making the camels kneel down if possible, then after making them kneel they pray &#8216;Ishaa &#8211; and if they delay the &#8216;Ishaa somewhat then there is no harm.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">73. As for the addition &#8220;Allahummaj&#8217;alhu Hajjan mabrooran&#8230;.&#8221; which some writers mention &#8211; it is not established from the Prophet as I have explained in &#8216;Ad-Daee&#8217;fah&#8217; (no.1107).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">74. Narrated in Ibn Khuzaimah&#8217;s &#8216;Saheeh&#8217; &#8211; where he says: Hadith saheeh, and explaining with this narration what is unclear in others and that what is intended by &#8216;until he stoned Jamrat ul &#8216;Aqabah&#8217; is &#8216;finished stoning it&#8217; (Fath ul Baaree, no.1426).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">75. And this point has been fully explained in the Original &#8211; so refer to that if you wish to receive the proof of the matter (p.30).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">76. And this hadith is sahih and has been authenticated by a number of scholars, from among them Ibn ul Qayyim, as I have explained in &#8216;Sahih Abi Dawud&#8217; (no.1745). And when some of the distinguished scholars came upon this hadith before the spread of this treatise- they regarded it as something strange &#8211; some of them quickly declaring it to be weak &#8211; as I myself did in some of my earlier works &#8211; based upon Abu Dawud&#8217;s isnaad &#8211; eventhough Ibn ul Qayyim strengthened it in his &#8216;Tahdheeb&#8217; of Abi Dawud, and as did Al-Haafiz (Ibn Hajr) in &#8216;At-Talkhees&#8217; &#8211; by keeping silent about it. And I have found other chains of narration for it which will convince anyone looking into the matter of its being raised from the level of da&#8217;eef to level of its being saheeh. However due to there being in a reference work not in common use by the large majority &#8211; and that is Imaam at-Tahaawis &#8216;Sharh Ma&#8217;aanee ul &#8216;Athaar&#8217;- these people quickly declared its something strange or being da&#8217;eef and they were encouraged in this by the fact that they found that some of the earlier scholars had said: &#8216;And I do not know any scholar who has ruled according to that.&#8217; And that is a negation of something &#8211; it is not a piece of definite known amongst the scholars that lack of knowledge of something does not mean absence of knowledge of it. So when a hadith is established to have come from Rasoolullah and is a relevant proof &#8211; as this is &#8211; then it is obligatory to act upon it straight away, not waiting to see if the scholars know of it or not, just as Imaam ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee said &#8220;A narration is to be accepted as soon as it is confirmed even if none of the scholars are acting upon it like the narrations which they accept &#8211; for the hadith of Rasoolullah is confirmed on its own not by anyone&#8217;s acting on it afterwards.&#8221; I say: So the hadith of Rasoolullah is above needing to be attested to by the actions of scholars according to it, as it is a source (of knowledge) by itself, judging not being judged. And along with that, indeed, some of the scholars have acted upon this particular hadith &#8211; from them &#8216;Urwah ibn az-Zubair &#8211; the greatest Taabi&#8217;ee &#8211; so can there remain any excuse for anyone to leave action according to this hadith: So verily therein is a warning for any who have a perceptive heart or listens attentively. And this is more fully explained in the Original. And you should be aware that the stoning of the Jamrah is for the pilgrims as the &#8216;Eid prayer for the rest of the people, therefore, Imaam AHmad liked that the time for the &#8216;Eid prayer in different parts should be that of the time of sacrifice in Minaa, And the Prophet gave Khutbah on the Day of Sacrifice after the stoning just as he used to give the Khutbah in Madinah after &#8216;Eid prayer &#8211; so some people holding it as being desirable to offer &#8216;Eid prayer in Minaa, taking as their evidence the word of general profs or analogy &#8211; is a mistake and neglect of the Sunnah &#8211; As neither the Prophet nor the khulafaa after him ever prayed the &#8216;Eid prayer at Minaa. See &#8216;Fatawaa Ibn Taimiyyah'(26:180).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">77. I say: And there is in this hadith two great allowancesfor the pilgrims &#8211; and a solution for most of the problems of the piling up of slaughtered animals in the slaughter- house &#8211; which has led to those in control there to have to bury some in the earth &#8211; and he who wishes to see the matter more fully laid out should return to the Original (pp.82-988).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">78. And there is a hadith from the Prophet narrated by Jaabir &#8211; reported by Abu Dawud and others &#8211; see &#8216;AL-Irwaa'(no.1138) and another by Baihaqee (9/289). And it is narrated from Ibn &#8216;Umar that he liked the animal to be made to face the Qiblah when slaughtered. And Abdur-Razzaaq(no.8585) narrates with sahih isnaad from ibn &#8216;Umar, that he disliked to eat from an animal slaughtered facing other than the Qiblah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">79. Al-Haafiz (Ibn Hajr) says (10/16): &#8220;That it will be easier for the one slaughtering to take the knife in his right hand, and to hold its head with his left.&#8221; I say: And causing it to die down and placing the foot on its side is what is narrated by Bukharee and Muslim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">80. Sahih Abi Dawud (no.1550). And there is after it a supporting hadith from Ibn&#8217;Umar like it &#8211; narrated by Bukharee and Muslim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">81. Narrated by Maalik with sahih isnaad reaching Ibn &#8216;Umar and Bukharee brings it in a chapter heading while signifying its authenticity Mukhtasar of Bukharee no.330).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">82. Reported by Abu Dawud and others narrated by Jaabir &#8211; and it has support from the hadith of Abu Sa&#8217;eed al Khudnee reported by Abu Ya&#8217;laa &#8211; as occurs in &#8216;al-Majma&#8217; (4/22) &#8211; see &#8220;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.1118).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">83. Reported by Muslim and others from &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah &#8211; see &#8216;AL-Irwaa&#8217; &#8211; and Ibn Taimiyyah in his book &#8216;Al-Mansik&#8217; added: &#8220;&#8230;&#8230;..(As You accepted from Ibrahim whom You took as a chosen friend)&#8221;, and I cannot find it in any of the books of Sunnah which are with me.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">84. Reported by Bukharee with mu&#8217;allaq isnaad (see Glossary). Its isnaad is joined by Abu Dawud and others. See Sahih Abi Dawud (nos.1700,1701).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">85. Reported by AHmad, authenticated by Ibn Hibbaan, and I hold it to be authentic due to its multiple lines of transmission. See &#8216;As-Saheehah'(no.2476).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">86. Al Qaani&#8217; is the one who asks. And Al Mu&#8217;tarr is the one who begs by displaying the weakness of his body.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">87. Narrated by Bukharee and others. See &#8216;Irwa ul Ghaleel&#8217; (no.964). As for Ibn Taimiyyah&#8217;s saying (p.388) &#8220;And the Mutamatti&#8217; must fast part of the three days before putting of the iHraam for Hajj on the Day of Tarwiyya&#8221; &#8211; I do not know any proof for it. Rather it seems to go against the clear meaning of the ayah and hadith, and Allah knows best.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">88. Reported by Bukharee and Muslim and others from the hadith of Ibn &#8216;Umar and others &#8211; see &#8216;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.1084).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">89. Reported by Muslim and others, see &#8216;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.1089), and Sahih Abi Dawud (no.1730). And this is one of those matters in which Ibn al Hammaam the Hanaafi scholar agrees that the Hanaafi scholars have gone against the Sunnah. So what have the blind followers to say of that?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">90. Sahih hadith &#8211; &#8216;Al Ahaadith us-Saheehah&#8217; (no.605), Sahih Abi Dawud (no.1732).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">91. Ibn Taimiyyah says: &#8220;And if he shortens it he draws it together and shortens it up to the length of a finger joint or less &#8211; or more, and the woman does not shorten in excess of that &#8211; as for the man he may shorten it as much as he pleases.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">92. Report by Bukharee and Abu Dawud from a number of the companions &#8211; see Sahih Abi Dawud (nos.1705,1707,1709,1710) and &#8216;Mukhtasar ul-Bukharee&#8217; (no.847).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">93. Narrated by Bukharee with mu&#8217;allaq isnaad &#8211; connected by Abu Dawud. See Sahih Abi Dawud (no.1700) and &#8216;Irwaa ul Ghaleel&#8217; (no.1064).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">94. 95. 94,95. Narrated by Abu Dawud and others. See Sahih Abi Dawud (no.1710)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">96. Narrated by Bukharee with mu&#8217;allaq isnaad. Connected by Ibn Abi Shaibah and others. See &#8216;Mukhtasar al Bukharee&#8217; (no.319,1/p.386).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">97. Narrated by Bukharee with mu&#8217;allaq isnaad. Connected by Abdur-Razzaaq. See &#8216;Mukhtasar al Bukharee'(no.318).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">98. Narrated by &#8216;Abd ur-Razzaaq (no.9012) with sahih isnaad from Ibn &#8216;Umar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">99. I say: And Allaah knows better which of them Rasoolullah did &#8211; and it may be that he prayed twice with them &#8211; the first being Fard and the second nafl as he did in some of his battles.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">100. 101. 102. 100,101,102. All of this is established in the hadith of Ibn Mas&#8217;ood reported by Bukharee and Muslim and others &#8211; and as for what occurs in some Hajj books that he should face the Qiblah upon stoning Jamrat-ul-Aqabah, then that contradicts this authentic hadith &#8211; and whatever contradicts it is shaadh (Glossary), or rather munkar (Glossary) as I have explained in &#8216;Ad-Da&#8217;eefah'(no.4864).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">103. Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah says: &#8220;So if the sun sets and he is still in Minaa &#8211; then he must remain for the stoning on the third day&#8221;. I say: And the great majority of scholars agree on that &#8211; contrary to what Ibn Hazm says in &#8216;Al-Muhallaa&#8217; (7.185). And An-Nawaawi drives proof for them(the majority) from what is understood from Allaah ta&#8217;alas saying: faman ta&#8217;ajjala fee yaumaini falaa ithma &#8216;alaihi (8:283): &#8220;And the day (al-Yaum) is a name for the daytime not including the night&#8221;. And using what is confirmed from &#8216;Umar and his son &#8216;Abdullah who both said : &#8220;Whoever is at Minaa on the second day and the evening comes upon him &#8211; then let him stay until the next day and leave together with the people.&#8221; And the wording of &#8216;Al-Muwatta&#8217; from Ibn &#8216;Umar is: &#8220;Then let him not leave until he has stoned the Jamaraat on the next day.&#8221; And Imaam Muhamad in his Muwatta (p.233) narrates it from Imaam Maalik and says: &#8220;And that is what we accept, and it is the saying of Abu Hanifah and people in general.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">104. Reported by Bukharee and Muslim and others &#8211; see &#8216;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.1097). And I have pointed out there that my narrating it as being from the hadith of Ibn &#8216;Abbaas in the Original is a mistake.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">105. Reported by Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasaa&#8217;ee and Ibn Maajah &#8211; and authenticated by a group of the scholars. See &#8216;Al-Irwaa'(no.1080).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">106. Hadith hasan reported by Al-Bazzaar and Al-Baihaqi and others from Ibn &#8216;Abbaas &#8211; Ibn Hajr declaring its isnaad to be hasan, and it has supporting narrations which I have quoted in &#8216;As-Saheehah&#8217; (No.2477).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">107. Reported with Mu&#8217;allaq isnaad by Bukharee (Mukhtasar al Bukharee, no.287) joined by a number of scolars whom I have named in &#8216;As-Saheehah&#8217; (no.803).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">108. Reported by Tabraani and Diyaa-al-Maqdisee in &#8216;Al-Mukhtara&#8217; and &#8216;Al-Mundhari&#8217; declares its isnaad to be hasan. And it is as he said as it has another chain of transmission as I have shown in &#8216;Tahdheer us-Saajid&#8230;&#8217; (pp.106-107 2nd edition).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">109. Reported by AHmad and others from the hadith of Jaabir from the Prophet with saheeh isnaad &#8211; and authenticated by a number of scholars whom I have mentioned in &#8216;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.1129).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">110. Reported by Tirmidhee and others &#8211; authenticated by Ibn Khuzaimah and Ibn Hibbaan and al-Haakim and others &#8211; see &#8216;Al-Mishkaat&#8217; (no.258) and &#8216;at-Targheeb&#8217; (no.2/120,122).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">111. Reported by Abu Dawud, Tirmidhee, an-Nasaaiee Ibn Maaja and others &#8211; authenticated by Tirmidhee and al-Haakim and adh-Dhahbee &#8211; see &#8216;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.481).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">112. Reported by Muslim and others &#8211; and a similar hadith by Bukharee. see &#8216;Al-Irwaa'(no.1086) and &#8216;Saheeh Abi Dawud&#8217; (no.1747).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">113. Established in the hadith of al-Haarith Ibn &#8216;Abdullah Ibn Aus, reported by AHmad and others. See Sahih Abi Dawud (no.1749)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">114. Reported by AHmad with a sahih isnaad to the standard of Bukharee and Muslim &#8211; who also both narrate a similar hadith &#8211; see &#8216;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.1086). And they also narrate a witness to it from the hadith of &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah &#8211; see Sahih Abi Dawud (no.1748).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">115. Reported by Bukharee in his &#8216;Taareeq and Tirmidhee who declared it to be hasan &#8211; from the hadith of &#8216;Aa&#8217;isha &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with her &#8211; see &#8216;Al-Ahaadeeth-as-Saheehah&#8217; (no.883).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">116. Reported by Baihaqi with a good sahih isnaad from Jaabir &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with him. And it has an authentic mursal narration as a witness to it reported by &#8216;Abd-ur-Razzaaq in his &#8216;Musannaf'(no.9127). And Ibn Taimiyyah narrates that the salaf used to transport it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">117. See note 24.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">118. May Allaah return it and the rest of the Muslim land to them, and may Allah inspire them to work with the rulings of the religion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">119. See &#8216;Silsilat-ul-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah&#8217; (no.1620)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">120. And this innovation was stopped many years ago-al-hamdulillah-however the one after it remains in its place and in Al-Baajoorees explanation of Ibn ul-Qaasim (1/41) there occurs: &#8220;And it is forbidden to go for a pleasure trip to see the carrying of the Ka&#8217;bahs covering and the coverings of the Station of Ibrahim,etc.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">121. And this and the one after it are some of the most wicked innovations because of what they contain regarding use of tricks to get around the shaaree&#8217;ah and the risk of falling into shameful actions as is obvious.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">122. see 121.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">123. And it is authentically reported from &#8216;Umar &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with him &#8211; that he saw some people while on the way to Hajj going to a certain place, so he said: What is this? So it was said: A place where Rasoolullah prayed. So he said: In this way where the People of the Book destroyed. They took the places connected with there Prophets as a place of prayer. Whomsoever of you reaches such a place at the time of prayer then let him pray, otherwise he should not do so.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">124. This appears to refer to wiping the face and chest with the two hands resembling a cross.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">125. For the greeting for the Haraam Mosque is tawaaf, then the praying behind the Station of Ibrahim and has preceded from the Prophet, from his action. And see &#8216;Al-Qawaa&#8217;id an-Nooraneeyah&#8217; of Ibn Taimiyyah (pg.101)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">126. What has been authentically reported as a practice of Ibn Mas&#8217;ood and Ibn &#8216;Umar is the same that has preceded (see point no.55).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">127. This du&#8217;aa besides being a novelty also contains that which contradicts the sunnah and that is using as a means of approach to Allaah the &#8216;right of the Mush&#8217;ar-ul-Haraam and the ka&#8217;bah &#8230;&#8217;but rather than one should use Allaahs names and attributes as a means of approach (wasilah) to Him. And the Hanafi scholars have declared that is hated to say: &#8220;Allaah I ask You by the right of the Mash&#8217;aral Haraam&#8230;etc&#8221; As occurs in &#8216;Haashiyat Ibn &#8216;Aa-bideen&#8217; and other books. see &#8216;at-Tawassul&#8217; Anwa&#8217;uhu wa ah-kaamuhu&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">128. And this is one of the worst innovations because of what it involves regarding twisting the shari&#8217;ah which is clearly shown in the Book and Sunnah merely on account of opinion. And the chief responsibility for the lack of total use of the meat lies upon the pilgrims themselves, because they do not when sacrificing take account of the directions of the Wise Legislator &#8211; as is shown in the Original (pg.87-88)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">129. And the Sunnah is to go to visit the mosqe as the Prophet said: do not journey accept to three mosques&#8230;so when he reaches it and prays upon entering then he may go to the grave. And it should be known that traveling to visit his grave &#8211; peace and blessings be upon him &#8211; and other graves is one thing, and visiting without traveling is something else &#8211; contrary to what has become widespread amongst the later people &#8211; among them holders of doctorates who have confused the two &#8211; and have further declared that Ibn Taimiyyah in particular and the salafis in general deny the authenticity of visiting the Prophets graves &#8211; and this is a clear untruth. See the matter fully explained in our refutation of Doctor Bootee who produced a succession of such sayings in the magazine &#8216;Islamic civilization&#8217;. Then I produced a particular treatise called &#8216;in defense of the Prophetic hadith&#8230;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">130. And al-Ghazali-may Allaah have mercy upon him-did well in speaking against this kissing (1/244) and said: &#8220;it is a habit of Christians and Jews&#8221; So is there anyone to take heed?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">131. And what is correct is to say: &#8220;assalaamu&#8217;alaika yaa rasoolullaahi wa rahmatullaahi wa barakaatuhu &#8211; assalaamu &#8216;alaika yaa abaa bakr &#8211; assalaamu &#8216;alaika ya &#8216;umar&#8221; as Ibn &#8216;Umar used to. And if he adds something slight as he feels at the time &#8211; not always doing it &#8211; then it is alright insha&#8217;Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">132. And this is in addition to its being an innovation and exaggeration in religion, and in contradiction to the Prophet&#8217;s saying: Do not take my grave as a festival, and send blessings upon me and it is a reason for many Sunnahs being lost and many benefits &#8211; and that it is the dhikr after the prayer recited after giving salaam &#8211; for they leave all of these and hurry to this innovation So may Allaah have mercy upon the one who said: &#8220;No innovation is brought to life except that a Sunnah is killed off &#8220;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">133. And there is absolutely no benefit in these two as they were only put there for decoration and to charm the people &#8211; and they have lately been removed &#8211; alhamdulillaah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">134. And the hadith about that id da&#8217;eef &#8211; and cannot be an evidence for it is as I have explained in &#8216;Ad-Ad-Da&#8217;eefah&#8217; (no.364). So it is not permissible to act on it as it is Sharee&#8217;ah &#8211; especially as it may cause trouble to some pilgrims as I myself once found &#8211; thinking that the hadith about it was authentic &#8211; and he might miss some prayers and thus be a hardship &#8211; which Allaah has delivered him from. And one honorable person holds this hadith to be strong &#8211; based upon the attestation of Ibn Hibbaan in favour of one of its unknown narrators &#8211; and the scholars of Hadith criticism do not accept this type of attestation. Among them the aforementioned honorable person as he himself has stated in his refutation of Shaikh al-Ghumaaree in the &#8216;Journal of the Salafi University&#8217; which comes from India. See the Book of Shaikh &#8216;Abd-ul-Rabee&#8217;aan in reply to him, as he has written well and is of benefit and explains the mistakes regarding supporting this hadith and the contradictions involved.</span></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee<br>
Al-‘Aqeedah At-Tahaawiyyah – Sharh wa Ta’leeq (pg. 39-40)<br>
Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) informed his ummah in many ahaadeeth, advising and cautioning them, that there would be many imposters (Dajjaaleen) after him. In some narrations, he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Everyone will claim to be a prophet, whereas I am the seal of the prophets – there being no prophet after me.”</b> [Reported by Muslim and others; See <i>al-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah</i>: no. 1683]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Amongst these imposters was Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Al-Qadiyani who claimed prophethood for himself. He has followers spread throughout India, Germany, England and America. And they have masaajid which they use to misguide the Muslims. There were some individuals amongst them in Syria as well, but Allaah uprooted them and eradicated them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They have many vile beliefs apart from their belief that prophethood continued after Muhammad (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>). The one who preceded them in this belief is Ibn ‘Arabee, the Sufi. They have authored a treatise on this subject in which they have collected statements from him that serve as support for this afore-mentioned belief of theirs. And the mashaayikh were not able to refute it because it was from that which Ibn ‘Arabee said (!!) even though they asserted with certainty that they were disbelievers. There is no room to mention their beliefs here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No doubt they are the ones whom the Messenger of Allaah intended when he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said in the hadeeth that has been authentically reported from him: <b>“There will be lying impostors during the Last Days that will bring you narrations, which neither you nor your forefathers heard of. So beware and let them beware, lest they misguide you and bring calamity upon you.”</b> [Reported by the author (i.e. At-Tahaawee) in <i>Mushkil-ul-Athaar</i> (4/104). It is also found in <i>Saheeh Muslim</i> (1/9)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From their most distinguishing signs is that when they begin speaking about their Call (i.e. beliefs), before everything, they start out with affirming the death of ‘Eesaa (Jesus). When they are able to accomplish this – according to their perception – they proceed onto the next level, which involves mentioning the ahaadeeth that talk about the descent of ‘Eesaa, and make it clear that that they believe in these narrations. However, they then quickly move on to distorting their meanings by claiming that what is meant by them is the descent of someone similar to ‘Eesaa (Jesus), since they have already established and confirmed – according to their views – that ‘Eesaa (Jesus) died. So they claim that this person was Ghulam Ahmad Al-Qadiyani!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They have many, many other examples of distorting texts similar to this, which leads us to believe that they are a group from amongst the heretical Baatinees. We will point out some of their deviant beliefs soon by the Will of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the misguided beliefs of the Qadiyanis is that they reject the Jinn as being a creation apart from mankind. So they distort the apparent meaning of all the ayaat and ahaadeeth that clearly prove their existence and their distinction from mankind amongst creation, instead claiming that these texts refer to humans themselves or a specific group from amongst mankind. This is even the case with Iblees (i.e. the Devil) himself as they allege that he was a human being that was evil! So how misguided they are!!</p>

<p>&#8211; Other Fatwas &#8211;</p>
<p><b>Al-Qadianiyyah order</b></p>
<p><b>The third question of Fatwa no.</b><b> 1615</b></p>
<p>Q 3: What is the ruling on this new faith and its followers, I mean Al-Ahmadiyyah faith? Callers to this faith warn against memorizing any Ayahs from the Qur’an or the Names of Allah and prohibit invoking blessings upon the Prophet (peace be upon him). Where and when did this faith originate? What is the ruling on those who avoid it?</p>
<p><b>A: </b>The<span id="ContentParagraph"> Pakistani </span>government, the Muslim World League in<span id="ContentParagraph"> Makkah Al-Mukarramah </span>and the Organization of Islamic Conference held in the League in 1394 A.H. issued a declaration that this (Qadiani) sect is outside the fold of Islam. The Conference published a report on the origin of this sect, when and how it was founded, and many other details disclosing its reality.</p>
<p><span id="ContentParagraph"><b>In conclusion, </b>it is a sect claiming that the Indian leader Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (born in the thirteenth century) was a prophet who received revelation and that anyone who disbelieves in him is not considered a true Muslim. Allah (Exalted be He) states in His Book that our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the Seal (Last) of the Prophets.<a title="Click here"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/margntip.gif" alt="" border="0"></a> Muslim scholars are unanimously agreed upon this. Whosoever claims that after him there is a prophet receiving revelationfrom Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) commits an act of Kufr (disbelief). This is because such a person goes against the Ijma‘ (consensus) of the Islamic Ummah (nation) and denies what is stated in the Qur’an and the authentic Hadith reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) which affirm that Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the Last of all prophets.</span></p>
<p><span id="ContentParagraph">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings of Allah be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</span></p>

<p>—</p>
<p>Q: I hope you can explain the ruling on the Sufi order called Al-Qadyaniyyah and their alleged prophet Ghulam Ahmad Al-Qadyany I ask you kindly to send me any books related to this order as I am very interested in studying it.</p>
<p><b>A: </b>The Prophethood ended with Muhammad (peace be upon him), and there is no prophet after him. This is authentically proved by the Qur’an and the Sunnah, and whoever claims otherwise, or claims Prophethood, then he is a <strong>liar</strong>. Foremost among those people is<span id="ContentParagraph"> Ghulam Ahmad Al-Qadyany </span>whose claim of Prophethood is nothing but falsehood, and so what his followers claim in this regard is also falsehood.</p>
<p>In the light of the above, the Council of Senior Scholars issued a decree regarding<strong><span id="ContentParagraph"> Al-Qadyaniyyah </span>as a Kafir (disbelieving) sect</strong> for their claims.</p>

<p><strong>The difference between the Muslims and Al-Ahmadiyyin</strong></p>
<p><b></b><b>Q 3: </b>What is the difference between the Muslims and Al-Ahmadiyyin ?</p>
<p><b>A: </b><b>The difference between them </b>is that Muslims are people who worship Allah Alone, follow His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him), and believe that Muhammad is the last of all prophets. But<span id="ContentParagraph"> Al-Ahmadiyyun, </span>followers of<span id="ContentParagraph"> Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, </span>are disbelievers and are not Muslims. They claim that<span id="ContentParagraph"> Mirza Ghulam Ahmad </span>is a prophet after Muhammad (peace be upon him). Whoever adopts this faith is a disbeliever according to all Muslim scholars. Allah (may He be praised) says: <img src="https://i2.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0"><a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al­Ahzab, 33: 40" target="_blank" name="Muhammad(صلىاللهعليهوسلم)is"></a>Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allâh and the last (end) of the Prophets.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0"> In addition, it is authentically reported that Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) said: <img src="https://i2.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0"><a name="Iamthesealofprophetsandthere"></a>I am the seal of prophets and there is no prophet after me.<img src="https://i2.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0"></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">[6] </span><strong style="line-height:1.5em;">Question</strong><span style="line-height:1.5em;">: What are the books you recommend a young person that is starting out in his Islaamic studies to read?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he is a novice, then from the books of Fiqh, we advise him to read <strong>&#8220;Fiqh As-Sunnah&#8221; of Sayyid Saabiq</strong>, while seeking assistance from some of its references, such as <strong>&#8220;Subul-us-Salaam </strong>(the ways of Peace &amp; Safety)<strong> &#8220;</strong> (of Imaam As-Sana&#8217;aanee, rahimahullaah). And if he looks into <strong>&#8220;Tamaam-ul-Mannah&#8221;</strong> (of Al-Albaanee) then that will be stronger for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I advise him to read &#8220;<strong>Ar-Rawdat-un-Nadiyyah</strong>&#8221; (of Sideeq Hasan Khaan).<br>
As for the subject of Tafseer, then he should habitually read from the book <strong>&#8220;Tafseer Al-Qur&#8217;aan-ul-&#8216;Adheem&#8221; of Ibn Katheer</strong> – [chm file download ]even though it is somewhat long – for it is the most authentic from the books of Tafseer today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, on the subject of religious exhortation and heart-softening narrations, he should read the book <strong>&#8220;Riyaad-us-Saaliheen&#8221; of Imaam An-Nawawee.</strong> [Daeef hadeeth in Riyadh us Saleheen &#8211; Albanee ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, with regard to the books related to Creed, I advise him to read the book <strong>&#8220;Sharh Al-&#8216;Aqeedat-ut-Tahaawiyyah&#8221; of Ibn Abee Al-&#8216;Izz Al-Hanafee</strong>. And he should seek assistance, also, from my comments and explanations to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, he should make it his customary practice to study from the<strong> books of Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah</strong> and his student <strong>Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyyah</strong>, may Allaah have mercy on them. For I hold them to be from the rare and unique Muslim scholars that have treaded upon the methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih (righteous predecessors) in their understanding, while having Taqwaa and righteousness. And we do not purify anyone over Allaah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">28- On the authority of Hamzah bin Suhaib on the authority of his father who said that Umar said to Suhaib: You are a great man but would that you didn’t have three characteristics!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He asked: And what are they?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: You have taken a kuniya (nickname) but you don&#8217;t have a son. You ascribe yourself to the Arabs but you are from Rome and you waste food.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Suhaib replied: As for your saying: “You have taken a kuniya (nickname) but you don&#8217;t have a son”, rather the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – gave me a kuniya, Abu Yahya.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for your saying: that I ascribed my self to the Arabs and that I&#8217;m not from them but that I&#8217;m from Rome. Rather, I am a person from an-Nimar bin Qaasit and I was taken as a prisoner from Mousil to Rome while I was a child and knew my lineage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for your saying: that I waste food. Rather, I heard the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – saying: &#8216;The best of you are those who feed people.&#8217;<br>
No.44</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29- On the authority of Abdullaah bin &#8216;Amroo on the authority of the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – who said: &#8216;The pleasure of your Lord is in pleasing your father. And the anger of your Lord is in making your father angry.&#8217;<br>
No.516</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">30- On the authority of Abu Huraira, on the authority of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – who said: &#8216;Musa asked his Lord about six characteristics, which he thought were only and purely for him alone and he did not like the seventh one.<br>
1- He asked: &#8216;O my Lord! Which of your slaves are the most pious?<br>
He answered: He who/the one who remembers Allaah and does not forget.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- He asked: &#8216;Which of your slaves are the most guided?<br>
He answered: the one who follows the guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- He asked: Which of your slaves is the best in judgement?<br>
He answered: the one who judges for the people just as he judges for his own self.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- He asked: Which of your slaves is the most knowledgeable?<br>
He answered: The one who is not satisfied and always has a thirst for knowledge, he adds the knowledge of the people to his knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- He asked: which of your slaves are the most honourable?<br>
He answered: The one who has the capability to forgive, then forgives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6- He asked: Which of your slaves is the most content?<br>
He answered: The one who is pleased with what he is given.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7- He asked: Which of your slaves is the neediest?<br>
He answered: The one who utilizes what he has and always requires more.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – said: Satisfaction is not that which is apparent; indeed satisfaction is satisfaction of the self/soul. If Allaah intends good for His slave then He places satisfaction in his soul and his Taqwa (piety) in his heart. And if Allaah intends evil for a slave then He places poverty where ever he turns.&#8217;<br>
No. 3350</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">31- On the authority of &#8216;Alee who said: when I held onto the weapon of Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – I found a slip of paper in the sheath of the sword (scabbard) of Allaah’s Messenger which had on it: &#8216;Keep good relations with the one who breaks away from you. Be good to the one who is bad to you and say the truth even if it is against yourself.&#8217;<br>
No. 1911</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">32- On the authority of Anas who said: There was a man who was with the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – the man&#8217;s son came, he kissed him and sat him on his lap. His daughter came and he just sat her next to him. The Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – said: &#8216;If only you had been just between them!&#8217; No.3098</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">10- On the authority of Anas who said: that the Messenger of Allaah said to a man: &#8216;O such and such! You did this? He answered: &#8216;No, I swear by Allaah other than whom there is no god!&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- knew that he had indeed done that thing, so he said to him: &#8216;Indeed Allaah has forgiven your lying, due to your certainty of &#8216;La illaah illa Allaah.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11- On the authority of Abdullaah who said that the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: &#8216;Verily Allaah has distributed your manners between yourselves just like He distributed your provisions between yourselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah gives the Duniya (world) to the one He loves and the one whom He doesn&#8217;t love, but He doesn&#8217;t give Emaan (faith) except to the one whom He loves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whosoever is too miserly with his wealth to spend it, and is too fearful to fight the enemy, and is too weak to stand the night in prayer, then he should say &#8216;SubhanAllaah, wal-Hamdulillaah, wa la illah ill Allaah, wa Allaahu Akbar.&#8217; a lot.<br>
No. 2714</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12- On the authority of al-Miqdam bin Ma&#8217;adee Karb al-Kindee on the authority of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- who said: &#8216;Indeed Allaah orders you to fulfill the rights of your mothers, then to fulfill the rights of close relatives then those who are after them.&#8217;<br>
No.1666</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13- On the authority of Anas who said: The Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- used to have a she-camel named al-Udbaa&#8217;, and it could not be beaten in a race.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Bedouin came with his camel, and it beat al-Udbaa&#8217;. This was difficult for the Muslims, and they said &#8216;al-Udbaa&#8217; has been beaten!&#8217; On that the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: &#8216;Indeed it is a right upon Allaah, that He does not raise anything in this world except that He lowers it.&#8217;<br>
No.3525</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14- On the authority of &#8216;Aeysha who said: that the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: &#8216;Indeed a man reaches the level of the one who prays the night prayer and fasts during the day, due to his good manners.&#8217;<br>
No.795</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15- On the authority of Umaarah bin Khuzaimah bin Thaabit: that his father said: I dreamt as if I was prostrating on the Messenger of Allaah&#8217;s -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- forehead. I informed the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- of this, and he said: &#8216;Indeed a soul meets another soul [in another narration: sit down, prostrate and do what you saw.]&#8217; The Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- tilted his head like this &#8211; [&#8216;Affaan said: with his head backwards] &#8211; then he placed his forehead on the forehead of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.<br>
No.3262</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16- On the authority of Abu Huraira: that a man mentioned: O Messenger of Allaah! Indeed I have close relatives, I keep good relations with them but they turn away from me. I am good to them but they are bad to me. I&#8217;m gentle to them and they are harsh with me. The Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: &#8216;If it is as you say then it is as if you feed them hot ashes, you will continue to have assistance from Allaah as long as you are upon this way.&#8217;<br>
No. 2597</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17- On the authority of Anas bin Malik who said: some guests from Bahrain came to visit the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam. The Prophet requested for some water for wudu, and he made wudu. They rushed to the water from his wudu, and they drank whatever they could from it. Whatever poured on to the ground, they wiped their faces, heads and chests with it. The Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said to them: &#8216;what made you do this?&#8217; they said: for the love of you, perhaps Allaah will love us O Messenger of Allaah.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said : &#8216;If you love that Allaah and His Messenger will love you, then continue to have three characteristics: truthful speech, fulfilling trusts and being good to your neighbour; if the neighbour is harmed, your good deeds are erased just like the sun melts an ice-berg.&#8217;<br>
No. 2998</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18- The Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: &#8216;Indeed every religion has a characteristic and the characteristic of Islaam is modesty.&#8217;<br>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Muadh said: &#8216;O Prophet of Allaah tell me more.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – said to him: &#8216;If you make a mistake follow it up with a good deed.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muadh said: &#8216;O Prophet of Allaah tell me more.&#8217;</p>

Nor should one person oppress another person.&#8217;<br>
No. 570</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9- On the authority of Rabeeyah al-Asslamee who said : I used to serve the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; and he gave me some land, and he gave Abu Bakr some land, and when it came to dividing the land, we differed over a cluster of dates from a date palm tree. Abu Bakr said: this is on my side of the land! And I said: It is on my side! There used to be a problem between me and Abu Bakr, and Abu Bakr said a statement to me which I hated but he regretted saying it, so he said to me: ‘O Rabeeyah! Say something to me similar to what I said to you, so that it can be requital.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I said: ‘I will not say it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr said: ‘You will say it or I will request the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa salaam – to order you to say it.<br>
So I said: ‘I will not say it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr left that portion of the land for me and went off to the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; and I followed him. The people from my tribe followed us and said to me: ‘May Allaah have mercy on Abu Bakr, why is he going to the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – about you, and he said what he said about you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I said : ‘Do you know who this is?? This is Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq, he is one of the two who were in the cave, he is one who has grown old as a Muslim ( one of the elders of the Muslims), beware he does not turn around and see you assisting me against him and becomes angry and he meets the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, and the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – will become angry due to him being angry, and then Allaah Azza wa Jal becomes angry due to them being angry and then Rabeeyah will be destroyed.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘What do you order us to do?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: ‘Go back.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr &#8211; RadhiAllaahuanhu- went off to the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -, so I followed him by myself, until he reached the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – and he told him the story as it was. The Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – raised his head towards me and said: ‘O Rabiah what’s the matter between you and as-Siddeeq?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said : ‘O Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – such and such happened, and he said a statement to me which I disliked, then he said to me, say something similar to what I said to you so that it can be requited, but I refused.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – said: ‘Yes, do not say a word back to him, but say: May Allaah forgive you O Abu Bakr. May Allaah forgive you O Abu Bakr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hasan said: ‘Abu Bakr turned around and he was crying.’<br>
