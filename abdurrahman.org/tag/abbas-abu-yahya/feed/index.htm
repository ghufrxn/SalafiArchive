<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Imam Sharaf ad-Deen at –Taybee (d. 743 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em></span> </strong>said in his explanation of Mishkat al-Masabeeh (p.739):</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Regarding his  <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> saying: ‘and the prayer is Noor (light)’ it means that the prayer prevents a person from sinning and prohibits evil sexual and horrible deeds, and it guides to what is correct just like light.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been said, that what it means by light, it is the thing with which the one who prays will be guided by on the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah The Most High said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَوْمَ تَرَى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَاتِ يَسْعَىٰ نُورُهُم بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَبِأَيْمَانِهِم بُشْرَاكُمُ الْيَوْمَ جَنَّاتٌ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا ۚ ذَٰلِكَ هُوَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>On the Day you shall see the believing men and the believing women their light running forward before them and by their right hands. Glad tidings for you this Day! Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), to dwell therein forever! Truly, this is the great success!</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [Hadeed: 12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been said that the prayer is light because the prayer is the means that enlighten the lights (Noor) of good deeds, and the delight of the heart, and uncovers realities due to the heart being concerned with the prayer, and turning to Allaah inwardly and outwardly.  And it has been said that: Noor is the sign on the face of the one who prays, due to the effects of prostration.’</p>
<p> [‘Tayseer Rab al-Bariya fee Sharh al-Arba’een an-Nawawi’ p.341]</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaykh Muhammed bin Salih al-Uthaymeen (d.1421 A.H.) said:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Regarding the saying of Messenger <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> ‘and the prayer is light (Noor)’ i.e. that the obligatory and optional prayer is light, Noor in the heart, Noor on the face, Noor in the grave, Noor on the day of <em>Hashr</em>, because the hadeeth is absolute, and the one who experiences this will find that Noor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you prayed the prayer in reality, in that which you bring your heart to attention to, and your limbs to have <em>Khushoo</em>, you will feel that your heart has become enlightened and it has tasted delight, absolute delight, this is why the Prophet <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> said: ‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The sweetness/pleasure of my eyes has been placed in the prayer</strong></span>.’ [Ahmad]</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Chapter 7: The Soul Inclines Towards Evil</strong></span></p>
<p>The saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ النَّفْسَ لَأَمَّارَةٌ بِالسُّوءِ إِلَّا مَا رَحِمَ رَبِّي</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, the </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(human)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> self is inclined to evil, except when my Lord bestows His Mercy </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(upon whom He wills)</span>. &gt;&gt; [Yusuf: 53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is evidence for the description of the essence of the soul &#8211; it does not leave this description of inclining towards evil except with Allaah’s mercy and concern from Him, because the soul is <strong>oppressive</strong> and <strong>ignorant</strong>. Nothing comes from oppression and ignorance except every evil. Therefore, if Allaah has mercy on His slave and blesses him with <strong>beneficial knowledge</strong> and makes him follow a <strong>path of justice</strong> in his manners and his actions, then his soul loses this description, finds tranquility in the obedience of Allaah and His remembrance and does not command its companion except to do good, and this leads to the grace of Allaah and His reward. Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيَّتُهَا النَّفْسُ الْمُطْمَئِنَّةُ  ارْجِعِي إِلَىٰ رَبِّكِ رَاضِيَةً مَّرْضِيَّةً  فَادْخُلِي فِي عِبَادِي  وَادْخُلِي جَنَّتِي</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;">(It will be said to the pious)<strong>: ‘O </strong>(you) <strong>the one in </strong>(complete) <strong>rest and satisfaction! ‘Come back to your Lord, Well-pleased </strong>(yourself)<strong> and well-pleasing unto Him! ‘Enter you, then, among My honoured slaves, &#8220;And enter you My Paradise!’</strong></span>&gt;&gt; [Fajr: 27-30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is upon the slave of Allaah to work on himself to rectify his soul, and to take this despised characteristic out of it, which is that the soul inclines towards evil. This is done by striving and having the best of manners, asking Allaah to be continuous upon that and repeating the following narrated supplication plentifully:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">‘<strong>O Allaah guide me to the best of actions and manners, no-one guides to the best of them except You, and turn me away from evil actions and evil manners no-one can turn me away from their evil except You.</strong>’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Muslim &amp; Tirmidhi]</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[PS: Arabic version of the above supplication is added below by AbdurRahman.Org for memorization of this important supplication]</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>اللَّهُمَّ اهْدِنِي لِأَحْسَنِ الْأَعْمَالِ وَأَحْسَنِ الْأَخْلَاقِ لَا يَهْدِي لِأَحْسَنِهَا إِلَّا أَنْتَ</strong></span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> وَقِنِي سَيِّئَ الْأَعْمَالِ وَسَيِّئَ الْأَخْلَاقِ لَا يَقِي سَيِّئَهَا إِلَّا أَنْتَ</strong></span></h2>

<span style="color:#993300;"> Taken from the book<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">‘The Life of the Greatest Man After the Prophets &amp; Messengers: Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq’</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> Compiled By Muhammad Uthmaan al-Anjaaree</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- On the authority of Abu Huraira -Radi Allaahu anhu- who said the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- prayed the morning prayer, then he faced the people and said: ‘While a man was leading a cow, he began to ride it and beat it. So the cow said to him: ‘we were not created for this, rather we were created for ploughing.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the people said: ‘Subhana Allaah a cow spoke!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: ‘<strong>Indeed I believe this, me and Abu Bakr and Umar.’</strong> Even though they were not present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- continued: ‘While a man was with some sheep, suddenly a wolf attacked them and took away one sheep from amongst them. The shepherd called the sheep as if trying to rescue it from the wolf. The wolf said to him: ‘You want to rescue it from me, so who will protect it on the day when the predatory animal comes, the day when it has no shepherd other than me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the people said: ‘Subhana Allaah, a wolf spoke.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: ‘Indeed I believe this, me and Abu Bakr and Umar.’ Even though they were not present.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* Hafidh Ibn Hajr said: ‘It is possible that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said that due to what he knew of their overwhelming Eemaan and the strength of their certainty.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- On the authority of Abu Huraira -Radi Allaahu anhu- who said the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: There was a man walking wearing a garment whose appearance impressed his own self. Allaah made the ground swallow him up and he kept tumbling down into it until the Day of Judgement.’ Abu Bakr and Umar testified to it, while Abu Bakr and Umar were not present.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- On the authority of Ayyoob who said: that AbdurRahmaan bin Abu Bakr said to his father (Abu Bakr): I saw you on the day of Uhud but I avoided you. So Abu Bakr said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘if I had seen you I would not have avoided you.’</strong></span>[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- On the authority of Umar:<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> ‘If the Eemaan of Abu Bakr was weighed against the Eemaan of the people of the earth, the Eemaan of Abu Bakr would outweigh the others.’</strong></span> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- On the authority of Aa’ishah who said: <strong>‘I swear by Allaah that Abu Bakr left drinking alcohol in pre-Islaamic times and he did not doubt in Allaah after having accepted Islaam.’</strong>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6- On the authority of Ibn Shihaab who said:<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> ‘From the excellence of Abu Bakr is that he never ever doubted in Allaah – Azza wa Jal – even for an hour.’</strong></span>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7- On the authority of Bakr bin Abdullaah who said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Indeed the people did not prefer Abu Bakr because he would pray and fast more than them, rather they preferred him due to something his heart.’</strong></span>[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Aboo Bakr did not have excellence over the people ( lam yafdulin-naasa) on account of praying and fasting more than them, but rather he had excellence over them on account of something which was in his heart.&#8217; -And I think the reference should be Narrated by Imam Ahmad in ‘Fadail as-Sahabah’ with this wording (1:141) no. 118 .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from the book: ‘The Life of the Greatest Man After the Prophets &amp; Messengers: Abu Bakr asSiddeeq’ P.190-191]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>References</strong></span>:</p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3258</strong> – On the authority of Rabeeyah al-Asslamee who said : I used to serve the Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> and he gave me some land, and he gave Abu Bakr some land, and when it came to dividing the land, we differed over a cluster of dates from a date palm tree. Abu Bakr said : this is on my side of the land! And I said : It is on my side! There used to be a problem between me and Abu Bakr, and Abu Bakr said a statement to me which I hated but he regretted saying it, so he said to me: ‘O Rabeeyah! Say something to me similar to what I said to you, so that it can be a requital.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I said : ‘I will not say it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr said : ‘You will say it or I will request the Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> to order you to say it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I said : ‘I will not say it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr left that portion of the land for me and went off to the Prophet <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> and I followed him. The people from my tribe followed us and said to me: ‘May Allaah have mercy on Abu Bakr, why is he going to the Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em>about you, and he said what he said about you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I said : ‘Do you know who this is?? This is Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq, he is one of the two who were in the cave, he is one who has grown old as a Muslim ( one of the elders of the Muslims), beware he does not turn around and see you assisting me against him and becomes angry and he meets the Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> , and the Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> will become angry due to him being angry, and then Allaah Azza wa Jal becomes angry due to them being angry and then Rabeeyah will be destroyed.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said : ‘What do you order us to do?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said : ‘Go back.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> went off to the Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> , so I followed him by myself, until he reached the Prophet <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> and he told him the story as it was. The Prophet <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> raised his head towards me and said: ‘O Rabeeyah what’s the matter between you and as-Siddeeq?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said : ‘O Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> such and such happened, and he said a statement to me which I disliked, then he said to me, say something similar to what I said to you so that it can be requited, but I refused.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> said: ‘Yes, do not say a word back to him, but say: May Allaah forgive you O Abu Bakr. May Allaah forgive you O Abu Bakr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hasan said: ‘Abu Bakr turned around and he was crying.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">Compiled &amp; Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 – <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaykh AbdulMuhsin bin Hamd al-Abbaad al-Badr</strong> </span>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">‘All praise belongs to Allaah the Lord of all the Worlds, and the praise, peace and blessings of Allaah be upon His Messenger and upon his Family and his Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In response to the question about the Asha’irah: Are they from the Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah or not?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: ‘The Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah are the Noble Companions <i>–</i><i>Radi Allaahu anhum</i>, and those who followed their path, just as the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> said in explaining the ‘Firqat an-Najeeyah’ (the Saved Sect): ‘They are those who are upon what I am upon and my Companions.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their belief in the Names of Allaah – the All-Mighty and the Magnificent – and His Characteristics (Sifaat) is that they affirm for Allaah –Azza wa Jal- what is affirmed in the Book and the Sunnah from the Names and Characteristics in the way which they befit Allaah -Subhanahu Ta’ala- without explaining how they are, or resembling them with anything else, or with Tamtheel (to liken Allaah or His Characteristics to that of the creation), or Tahreef (alteration and distortion of wording or meaning), or Ta’weel (metaphorical interpretation) of them or cancelling them.  Just as Allaah -Azza wa Jal- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; لَيۡسَ كَمِثۡلِهِۦ شَيۡءٞۖ وَهُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلۡبَصِيرُ &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; T<strong><span style="color:#008000;">here is nothing like unto Him and He is the All-Hearing the All-Seeing</span></strong>&gt;&gt; [Shura : 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this Ayaah there is the affirmation that Allaah Ta’ala has the two Sifaat (Characteristics) of Hearing and Seeing, which is in His statement: &lt;&lt; <strong>and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.</strong>&gt;&gt;, and not likening Allaah to resembling anyone with Him as is in His statement: &lt;&lt;<strong>There is nothing like unto Him</strong>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Asha’irah are those who ascribe to the Madhab (School of Thought) of Abul-Hasan al-Asha’ari <i>-Rahimullaah-</i> who was born in the year 270 A.H. and died in the year 330 A.H.  That Madhab on which he was before he came back to the Madhab of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah.  That Madhab which was on <em>Ta’weel</em> (metaphorical interpretation) of most of the <em>Sifaat</em> (Characteristics of Allaah), which is opposite to the Madhab of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the Asha’irah are from the deviated Islaamic sects, they are deviated from what Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah are upon.  It is not perceivable to the intellect that the truth was hidden from the Companions, and the Successors but then after that the truth had occurred in following a belief which was born after their time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajr in his book ‘Fath al-Bari’ (13/407) quoted many statements from the Salaf about the authentic Aqeedah which is established upon the Book and the Sunnah and the understanding of the Salaf of the Ummah, he summed it up by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Many quotes have preceded from the people of the third period of time and they are the Fuqaha (scholars) of the different lands, like Thawri, al-Awzaiee, Malik, al-Layth and those who lived at their time, and likewise those who took from them, from the other Imams. So how can a person not trust what the people of the first three generations agreed upon, and they are the best generations, with the testification of the owner of the Sharia?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hajr also quotes from al-Hasan al-Basari that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If what al-Ja’ad is saying is true, then the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </i>would have conveyed it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Ja’ad is Ibn Dirham the founder of the Madhab al-Jahmeeyah.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will say the like of what al-Hasan al-Basari <i>-Rahimullaah-</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If what the al-Asha’irah and other than them from the philosophers say is true, then the Messenger <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> would have conveyed it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Takeed al-Musalamaat as-Salafeeyah’ p. 5]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">2- <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaykh Ahmad Yahya an-Najmi</strong></span> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The truth of which there is no contention about, is that the Asha’irah and Matroodeeyah are from the groups of the Ahl-ul-Bida’.  It is not allowed for anyone to say that they are from the Ahl-ul-Sunnah and whoever claims that these two groups are from the Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah then he has squeezed himself between a grave and serious mistake, and a humiliating danger, and he will be questioned on the Day of Judgement about his statement before he is freed to go on his path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah said in Majmoo’ al-Fatawa in (3/347) after speaking about this issue:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘With that it becomes clear that the people with the most right to be the Firqat Najeeyah (the saved sect) are the Ahl-ul-Hadeeth and Sunnah those who do not have someone they biasedly follow except the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> and they are the most knowledgeable of the people regarding his statements, his situations, and they are the greatest in distinguishing between the authentic and weak of those statements and situations. Their Imams are scholars regarding those statements and situations and they are the people of knowledge of its meanings, and they follow them, with truth, action, love, with loyalty to the one who is loyal to it and have enmity to the one who has hatred to it. . . . [until he said]… and whatever the people differed over in regards to the issues of Sifaat (Characteristics of Allaah), al-Qadr (pre-destiny), al-Waeed (threat of punishment), Names of Allaah, enjoining the good, forbidding evil and other issues, then here they would return those issues to Allaah and His Messenger. They would refer to the Tafseer (explanation) of those general wordings of which the people of sects and differences differed over and whatever was in agreement with the Book and the Sunnah they would affirm that, and whatever was in opposition to the Book and the Sunnah they would regard that as false. They would not follow speculation or what their souls inclined and desired, because following speculation is ignorance, and following one’s desires without guidance from Allaah is oppression, and together that is evil: ignorance and oppression.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">How can those who apply the intellect in issues of al-Eemaan, which are well-established in the Book and the Sunnah be from the Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah, when they accept what they want from the Book and the Sunnah and reject what they want?!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the Asha’irah and Matroodeeyah only affirm seven Sifaat of Allaah from His Sifaat, and they metaphorically interpret all the other Sifaat of Allaah, which in turn leads to cancelling out the Sifaat of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can that person be from the Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah when he metaphorically interprets the saying of Allaah Ta’ala: &lt;&gt; by saying [Isteewa means] Allaah conquered His Throne, so it is as if this person is saying that someone else had taken Allaah’s Throne and then after that Allaah had to conquer it?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">How can that person be from the Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah when he metaphorically interprets the hadeeth that Allaah descends the last third of the night which is established in the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Allaah –Azza wa Jal- descends every night to the heavens of the Dunyaa, at the second half of the night, or at the third of the night and says: who is making Dua’ to Me so that I can respond to him; who is asking of Me so that I can give him it; who is seeking forgiveness from Me so that I can forgive him until Fajr comes in.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ahmad, and it is originally in Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the person who metaphorically interprets this, says it means: ‘Allaah’s command descends,’ [and not Allaah Himself] even though Allaah’s –Azza wa Jal- command descends at every time and moment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can that person be from Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah who metaphorically interprets Allaah’s Two Hands to mean Allaah’s blessings, even though Allaah –Subhana wa Ta’ala- connected/linked/explained that thing which is specific for the hand, which is spending, Allaah –the Most Magnificent- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَقَالَتِ ٱلۡيَهُودُ يَدُ ٱللَّهِ مَغۡلُولَةٌۚ غُلَّتۡ أَيۡدِيهِمۡ وَلُعِنُواْ بِمَا قَالُواْۘ بَلۡ يَدَاهُ مَبۡسُوطَتَانِ يُنفِقُ كَيۡفَ يَشَآءُۚ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<b> </b><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Jews say: ‘Allaah’s Hand is tied up (i.e. He does not give and spend of His Bounty).’ Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for what they uttered. Nay, both His Hands are widely outstretched. He spends (of His Bounty) as He wills.</strong></span> &gt;&gt;[2]  knowing that the blessings which the Noble (Jaleel) Lord confers upon His worshippers are so many they cannot be enumerated?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah the Magnificent said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; وَإِن تَعُدُّواْ نِعۡمَةَ ٱللَّهِ لَا تُحۡصُوهَآۗ  &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;<b> </b><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if you would count the graces of Allaah, never could you be able to count them.</strong></span> &gt;&gt;[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">How can that person be from Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah when he metaphorically interprets the Hadeeth: ‘Allaah does not look at the one who drags his garment below his ankles out of pride.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Agreed upon by Bukhari and Muslim] and other Hadeeth with this meaning; he metaphorically interprets ‘Allaah looking’ in this Hadeeth that the meaning of ‘looking’ is metaphorical for mercy, meaning that Allaah will not have mercy upon them?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are other deviated metaphorically interpretations, which transfer the texts present from Allaah –Azza wa Jal – in His Book or upon the tongue of His Messenger, which comprise of lofty meanings, which are befitting Allaah –Azza wa Jal- and they metaphorically interpret them with a false interpretation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we think about it, what has obligated them to metaphorically interpret the Sifaat like this, then we find that they claim that the condition and state of the intellect is that this is how Allaah should be characterized with those [distorted] characteristics; because they made and took the foundations of the people of Kalam (rationalistic theology &amp; philosophy) as the foundation, and they used this foundation above that of the texts of the Sharia’, which came in the Book of Allaah, and in the Sunnah of the Messenger <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> which affirm for Allaah –Azza wa Jal- Names and Characteristics which befit His Majesty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Asha’irah and Matroodeeyah made those foundations rationalistic theology (Kalam), which was taken from the philosophers, and the people of logic (<i>Mantiq</i>) those who were drowned in knowledge of rationalistic theology, and they spent their time in it, and wasted their lives in it, and their end result was confusion.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Benefits Derived from the Story of Yusuf</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> Chapter 1: The Dream of the Two Young Men</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the dream of the two young men, where one of them said:</p>
<p><strong>وَدَخَلَ مَعَهُ السِّجْنَ فَتَيَانِ ۖ قَالَ أَحَدُهُمَا إِنِّي أَرَانِي أَعْصِرُ خَمْرًا ۖ وَقَالَ الْآخَرُ إِنِّي أَرَانِي أَحْمِلُ فَوْقَ رَأْسِي خُبْزًا تَأْكُلُ الطَّيْرُ مِنْهُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">‘Verily, I saw myself </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in a dream)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> pressing wine.’ The other said: ‘Verily, I saw myself </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in a dream)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> carrying bread on my head and birds were eating thereof.’ </span></strong> [Yusuf: 36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were kind to Yusuf so that he would inform them of the interpretation of their dream. This is due to what they witnessed of his being good to things and to the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yusuf –alayhi sallam- interpreted the dream of the one who saw that he was pressing wine to be that he would be saved from the prison and would return to his status of serving his master, so he would press grapes for his master, resulting in wine. He interpreted the other dream to be that person being killed, then crucified and birds eating from his head. As for the first dream then it came in a literal form. As for the other dream, then it came in the form of a similitude; that he would be killed, and even though he would have been killed, he would still be crucified and would not be buried until birds had eaten from his head.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an amazing insight, which gives precise meanings, as it is the custom that a person who is killed is buried straight away, such that it would not be possible for beasts and birds to eat from him. However, Yusuf –alayhi sallam- understood that this person would be killed and not buried quickly so that he reached this state.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the humiliation of that man, and his despicable, evil worldly destiny which causes the skin to tremble. He knew that this dream was real and would definitely take place. Yusuf said to them:</p>
<p><strong>قُضِيَ الْأَمْرُ الَّذِي فِيهِ تَسْتَفْتِيَانِ<br />
</strong><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>‘Thus is the case judged concerning which you both did inquire.’</strong></span> [Yusuf: 41]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is from his complete knowledge of interpreting dreams, which are not interpreted based on suspicion and delusion, rather they are interpreted upon knowledge and certainty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the appropriateness of the interpretation of this dream, it is that birds do not come close to living things, rather they eat from the deceased if there is no one close to the dead body, and this takes place after the person has been killed and crucified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the perfection of Yusuf, his advice and his amazing intelligence is that he was careful in interpreting their dreams when they narrated them to him and he promised them that he would interpret the dreams at the earliest time. Yusuf said:</p>
<p><strong>لَا يَأْتِيكُمَا طَعَامٌ تُرْزَقَانِهِ إِلَّا نَبَّأْتُكُمَا بِتَأْوِيلِهِ قَبْلَ أَن يَأْتِيَكُمَا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>No food will come to you </strong>(in wakefulness or in a dream) <strong>as your provision, but I will inform </strong>(in wakefulness)<strong> its interpretation before it </strong>(the food) <strong>comes</strong></span>. [Yusuf: 37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He promised them the interpretations before the first meal was to be brought for them from outside the prison so that they would be calm and eager to hear the interpretations. Yusuf did this so he would be able to give them Da’wah before he gave them the interpretations so that they would be more receptive to accepting the Da’wah to Allaah because calling them to Allaah was more important than interpreting their dreams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He called them to Allaah using two means:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Firstly:</strong></span> through his own self, in how he was and in his beautiful description that made him reach this noble station.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yusuf –alayhim as-Salaam- said:</p>
<p><strong>ذَٰلِكُمَا مِمَّا عَلَّمَنِي رَبِّي ۚ إِنِّي تَرَكْتُ مِلَّةَ قَوْمٍ لَّا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَهُم بِالْآخِرَةِ هُمْ كَافِرُونَ</strong></p>
<p><strong>وَاتَّبَعْتُ مِلَّةَ آبَائِي إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ ۚ مَا كَانَ لَنَا أَن نُّشْرِكَ بِاللَّهِ مِن شَيْءٍ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ مِن فَضْلِ اللَّهِ عَلَيْنَا وَعَلَى النَّاسِ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لَا يَشْكُرُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This is of that which my Lord has taught me. Verily, I have abandoned the religion of a people that do not believe in Allaah and are disbelievers in the Hereafter</strong> (i.e. the Kan&#8217;âniun of Egypt who were polytheists and used to worship the sun and other false deities)<strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>‘And I have followed the religion of my fathers, &#8211; Ibraheem, Ishaaq and Ya’qoob, and never could we attribute any partners whatsoever to Allaah. This is from the Grace of Allaah to us and to mankind, but most men are not thankful.</strong></span>[Yusuf: 37-38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second matter:</strong></span> He called them through natural, real evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said :</p>
<p><strong>يَا صَاحِبَيِ السِّجْنِ أَأَرْبَابٌ مُّتَفَرِّقُونَ خَيْرٌ أَمِ اللَّهُ الْوَاحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ</strong></p>
<p><strong>مَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِهِ إِلَّا أَسْمَاءً سَمَّيْتُمُوهَا أَنتُمْ وَآبَاؤُكُم مَّا أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ بِهَا مِن سُلْطَانٍ ۚ إِنِ الْحُكْمُ إِلَّا لِلَّهِ ۚ أَمَرَ أَلَّا تَعْبُدُوا إِلَّا إِيَّاهُ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ الدِّينُ الْقَيِّمُ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">‘O two companions of the prison! Are many different lords </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(gods)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> better or Allaah, the One, the Irresistible? ‘You do not worship besides Him but only names which you have named </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(forged),</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> you and your fathers, for which Allaah has sent down no authority. The command </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(or the judgement)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> is for none but Allaah. He has commanded that you worship none but Him, that is the </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(true)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> straight religion, but most men do not know.</span></strong>  [Yusuf: 39-40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed The One who is singled out with perfection from all angles, and with complete control over all the world, the upper and the lower, The One Who is deserving of complete worship, Who created the creation for His worship and He ordered them to do it, He has the command over His slaves in this world and the Hereafter. He is the One Whom it is necessary to worship Alone, other than Whom there are things that are worshipped which are deficient and of different types &#8211; those things which many people claim divinity for, but they do not have anything of the real meaning of divinity nor are they deserving of worship, rather they are titles which they have defined and names without any meanings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Yusuf saw that calling them to Allaah was foremost rather than the interpretation of their dreams and it was more beneficial for them and other than them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">What Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> said About The Rafidah (Shia)<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a><br />
Compiled &amp; translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1 – Rawafidah (Shia)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Rafidah are  the <em>Munafiqoon</em> (hypocrites) of this Ummah.’<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2- From the Non-Arabs</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed <em>Rafd </em>(the religion of the Shia) came from the non-Arabs, as for the Arabs they were not Rawafid, but after the non-Arabs had mixed with the Arabs there occurred Rawafidah amongst them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason for the spread of ignorance in the 7<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> century amongst the Arabs caused them to be lost, and they became an easy morsel in the hand of the one who wanted them.  However, when they were busy with knowledge it was not possible for anyone to divide them up and overcome them.’<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3 – Zaydeeyah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever investigates the situation of the Rawafidah, will find that no one says what they say except the <em>Kuffar</em>.  The majority of scholars make <em>Takfeer</em> of the Rawafidah. The Zaydeeyah are <em>Mubtadia’</em>(Innovators), the term is not given except to the Zaydeeyah and also whoever becomes a Shi’ee. The Zaydeeyah do not have <em>Asaneed</em> (chains for narrations), rather their reliance is upon books which do not  have <em>Isnaad</em>.’<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4 – </strong><strong>Rawafidah (Shia) and the Jews</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘During the seventh and eighth century you would not find except the Rawafidah (Shia) in Madina and likewise in Makkah, this is what Ibn Taymeeyah, Dhahabi and Sakhawi mention.  I believe that there is no enemy of the Muslims the likes of the Rawafidah (Shia) and the Jews. The founding father of the Rawafidah was Abdullaah bin Saba and he was a Jew.  Shaykh ul-Islaam wrote a chapter in the book ‘<em>Minhaj as-Sunnah</em>’ explaining the resemblance of the Rawafidah (Shia) to the Jews. If the leaders from the Muslims had not used politics to deal with the Rawafidah and the Jews, they would not have been secure from their cunning evil.  The Rawafidah do not know anything about Islaam.’<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘a – The Rawafidah took their religion from the Jews, and their attacking the Companions is attacking Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b – When the Asha’areeyah<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> affirmed seven <em>Sifaat</em> (Attributes) of Allaah, they did not do this because it is present in the Qur’aan, rather they affirmed them because the intellect did not oppose them, if they had affirmed them due to the Qur’aan then they would have affirmed the rest of the <em>Sifaat</em>.’<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>5 – The Term ‘Rawafidah’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The evidence of the Ahl-ul-Hadeeth that the Ahadeeth which mention the word ‘ar-Rawafid’ are Ahadeeth which are lies, whereby this title was not applied except at the time of the Abbaseeyeen.’<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>6 – <em>Takfeer</em> of the Rafidah<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed when Imam Ahmad was asked about the Rafidah he answered that they were <em>Kuffar</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then my father said: ‘Some of the people of knowledge have said that the Rafidah are <em>Mubtadia’</em>(people of <em>Bida’</em>)’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then my father said: ‘This statement that they are people of <em>Bida’</em> is a light statement about them, since their actions are the actions of the <em>Kuffar</em> and likewise are their statements.’<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Rafidah say that Ali <em>–</em><em>Radhi Allaahu anhu</em><em>–</em> will be sent before the Day of Judgement.’  They mean in place of Isa <em>-alayhi as-Sallaam</em>.’<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>

The Collection is called: ‘al-Majmoo’ Fee Tarjama al-Allama al-Muhaddith ash-Shaykh Hamad bin Muhammad al-Ansaari <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> wa Seeratahi wa Aqwaalihi wa Rihlatihi’. It is a large two-volume collection of the sayings, wisdom and various biographies of the Shaykh.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;" align="center">Part One</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center">Compiled by Abu Abdurahman Makki<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allaah, may praise and peace be upon the Messenger of Allaah, upon his family, his Companions and those who follow his guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 – al-Imam ‘Aamir ash-Sha’abee (d. 105 A.H.) – rahimullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I warn you against misguided desires, and the most evil of them are the Rafidah. That is because from them there are Jews who immerse themselves into Islaam to try to prepare it to enter their misguidance just like when Paul the son of the King of the Jews immersed himself into Christianity in order to enter their misguidance into it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then ash-Sha’abee said: ‘<strong>The Rawafid did not enter into Islaam out of desire or from awe of Allaah but rather out of hatred for the people of Islaam</strong>.’<a title="" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – Talha bin Mussarraf (d. 112 A.H.) -rahimullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Regarding the Rafidah, their women are not to be married nor is the meat from the animal they slaughter to be eaten because they are apostates</strong>.’<a title="" href="#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – Abu Hanifa (d. 150 A.H.) -rahimullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Jamaah is to prefer Abu Bakr, Umar, Ali and Uthmaan, and they do not belittle or find anyone deficient from amongst the companions of the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</i>.’<a title="" href="#_ftn3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – The Imam of Dar-al-Hijra Malik bin Anas al-Asbahi (d. 179 A.H.) -rahimullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever curses the companions of the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> then he has no part, [or he said: no share] in islaam.’<a title="" href="#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 – Al-Lailka’ee narrated that Imam Malik said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever curses the companions of the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> then he has no reward.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) Allaah – Azza wa Jal – says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">لِلْفُقَرَاءِ الْمُهَاجِرِينَ الَّذِينَ أُخْرِجُوا مِنْ دِيَارِهِمْ وَأَمْوَالِهِمْ يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلًا مِنَ اللَّهِ وَرِضْوَانًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;(<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And there is also a share in this booty) for the poor emigrants, who were expelled from their homes and their property, seeking Bounties from Allah and to please Him.</strong></span>&gt;&gt;<a title="" href="#_ftn5">[5]</a>; the Ayaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These were the companions of the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> who migrated with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) Then Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">والذين تبؤوا الدار والإيمان</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And those who, before them, had homes (in Al-Madinah) and had adopted the Faith, love those who emigrate to them</strong></span>&gt;&gt;<a title="" href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> the Ayaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These were the Ansaar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">والذين جاءوا من بعدهم يقولون ربنا اغفرلنا ولأخواننا الذين سبقونا بالإيمان</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah said: &lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And those who came after them say: ‘Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in Faith</strong></span>&gt;&gt;<a title="" href="#_ftn7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the reward is for these three types, but whoever curses the companions of the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> then he is not from these three and he has no truthful right to be amongst these three.’<a title="" href="#_ftn8">[8]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – Al-Qadi Abu Yusuf -rahimullaah – (d.182 A.H.) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>I do not pray behind a Jahmi, nor a Rafidi, nor a Qadri</strong>.’<a title="" href="#_ftn9">[9]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 – AbdurRahman bin Mahdi -rahimullaah – (d. 198 A.H.) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>They are two nations: al-Jahmeeyah and Rafidah.’ (Meaning not from the Muslim Ummah)</strong>’<a title="" href="#_ftn10">[10]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8 – Imam Shaafi’ee -rahimullaah – (d. 204 A.H.) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>A Rafidi has no intercession, this is only for a Muslim</strong>.’<a title="" href="#_ftn11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9 – Muhammad bin Yusuf al-Faryaabi – rahimullaah- (d. 212 A.H.) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘I hold the opinion that the Rafidah and the Jahmeeyah are nothing but heretics (unbelievers)</strong>.’<a title="" href="#_ftn12">[12]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10 – Ahmad bin Yunus – rahimullaah – (d. 227 A.H.) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Indeed we do not eat the meat of the animal slaughtered by a Rafidi, because to me he is an apostate.</strong>’<a title="" href="#_ftn13">[13]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11 – Ahmad bin Yunus also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If a Jew slaughtered a sheep and a Rafidi slaughtered one as well, then I would eat from the meat slaughtered by the Jew, and I would not eat from the meat slaughtered by the Rafidi because he has apostated from Islaam.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal said to a person about Ahmad bin Yunus: ‘Go to Ahmad bin Yunus since indeed he is Shaykh ul-Islaam.’<a title="" href="#_ftn14">[14]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12 – Imam as-Sunnah Ahmad bin Hanbal – rahimullaah – (d. 241 A.H.) was asked by his son Abdullaah bin Ahmad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘I asked my father about a person who curses a person from the companions of the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</i>, so he said:  ‘I hold the view that he is not upon Islaam</strong>.’<a title="" href="#_ftn15">[15]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13 – From Abu Bakr al-Marwathi who said: I asked Abu Abdullaah about the person who curses Abu Bakr, Umar and Aeysha?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied: ‘I hold the view that they are not upon Islaam.’<a title="" href="#_ftn16">[16]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14 – From Abu Bakr al-Marwathi who said: I heard abu Abdullaah saying that Malik said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Whoever curses the Companions of the Prophet – sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – then he has no share, or he said: no share in Islaam</strong>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khalaal said: AbdulMalik bin AbdulHameed informed me, who said, I heard Abu Abdullaah saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Whoever cursed [the Companions] I fear disbelief upon him, like that of the Rawafid</strong>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Whoever cursed the Companions of the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> then we do not find any security for him that he has indeed exited from the Deen</strong>.’<a title="" href="#_ftn17">[17]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15 – Al-Khalaal said: Abdullaah bin Ahmad bin Hanbal said: ‘I asked my father about a person who curses a man from the companions of the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</i>, so he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I do not hold him to be upon Islaam.’<a title="" href="#_ftn18">[18]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16 – Imam Ahmad also said about the Rafidah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘They free themselves from the Companions of Muhammad <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> they curse them, belittle them and they make Takfeer (excommunication) of their leaders except four of them: Ali, Amaar, al-Miqdad and Sulayman, and the Rafidah have nothing to do with Islaam.’<a title="" href="#_ftn19">[19]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17 – Imam al-Bukhari -rahimullaah – (d. 256 A.H.) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I do not care if I prayed behind a Jahmi and a Rafidi, or prayed behind a Jew and a Christian, and they are not given Salam, nor are they visited, or married into, nor is their testimony accepted and their slaughtered animals are not eaten.’<a title="" href="#_ftn20">[20]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18 – Abu Zura’a ar-Raazi (d. 264 A.H.) -rahimullaah- said: –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘If you see a man belittling any one from the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</i>; then know that he is a Zindeeq, and that is because to us the Messenger <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> is upon the truth, and the Qur’aan is true.  Indeed the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> conveyed to us the Qur’aan and the Sunnan, indeed they want to criticise our witnesses so that they can invalidate the Book and the Sunnah, and these (critics) are foremost to be criticised and they are Zanadiqa (heretics).</strong>’<a title="" href="#_ftn21">[21]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19 – Al-Lalka’ee narrated by way of AbduRahman bin Abi Hatim, that he asked his father and Abu Zura’a about the Madhab of the Sunnah and their beliefs which the people of knowledge found them upon in every country , and what was mentioned from what they said is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘And indeed the Jahmeeyah are Kuffar, and indeed the Rafidah, rejected Islaam.</strong>’<a title="" href="#_ftn22">[22]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20 – Abdullaah Ibn Qutayba ad-Daynoori al-Baghdadi (d. 276 A.H.) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the extremism of the Rafidah in love for Ali which they exemplify in placing him in front of those whom the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </i>and his Companions placed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their claim is that Ali had a partnership with the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> in his Prophet hood, and they also claim that the Rafidah Imams have knowledge of the unseen of when someone will give birth and similar false statements, and secret matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These matters are gathered in that they are lies, kufr, extreme ignorance and stupidity.’<a title="" href="#_ftn23">[23]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;" align="center">What Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari<a title="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> said About Al-Ikhwan al-Muslimoon<a title="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>. <span style="font-size:1rem;">Compiled &amp; translated </span><span style="font-size:1rem;">By </span><span style="font-size:1rem;">Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1 – al-Ikhwan al-Muslimoon &amp; the Rafidah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>a)</b> ‘In the past I heard about the group al-Ikhwan al-Muslimoon who had gathered in the era of King Farooq <a title="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> and agreed upon a point that they clarify, which is that the <i>Rafidah</i> (the Shia) are regarded as a school of thought from the schools of thought of the Muslims, and therefore, they must be included amongst the al-Ikhwan al-Muslimoon.  This is why they were the ones who aided the Khomeni revolution and were happy with it, and they said there is no Islaam except with him (Khomeni).’<a title="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>b)</b> Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">‘Indeed the Ikhwan al-Muslimoon are from the helpers of Khomeni and the <i>Rafidah</i> (Shia).’<a title="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>3 – Are al-Ikhwan al-Muslimoon &amp; the Tableegh from the Ahl-ul-Sunnah?</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Who are the <i>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jammah</i>?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘They are those who adhere to what the Companions were upon.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the questioner asked: ‘Are the Salafiyoon, the Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jammah?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Yes, <i>as-Salafeeyah</i><a title="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> is the Sunnah and the <i>Jammah</i>; because the meaning of <i>Salafeeyah</i> is adhering to what the <i>Salaf as-Salih</i> were upon in the past.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The questioner said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O Shaykh, regarding the Ikhwan group and the Tableegh are they from the Ahl-ul-Sunnah?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Everyone who is upon a thought which opposes the Ahl-ul-Sunnah, then he is not from them, therefore the <strong>Ikhwan group and the Tableegh are not from the Ahl-ul-Sunnah</strong>, because they have thoughts which oppose the Ahl-ul-Sunnah.’<a title="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>4 – Doubts</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Do not come close to Jamat al-Ikhwan al-Muslimoon since everything they have is doubtful.’<a title="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>5 – Sayyid Qutb</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>a)</b> A man asked Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There are some people who identify Sayyid Qutb with the title ‘Reviver’?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh disapproved of this title and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘What did Qutb revive? Did he revive <i>Tawheed</i>? Meaning did he call to <i>Tawheed</i>?  Or did he revive the call to judge by what Allaah has revealed, and that was by authoring a book, actually all his speech was philosophy.’<a title="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a><b></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>b) </b> Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed Sayyid Qutb has a lot of <i>Hizbeeyah</i> and many customers.’<a title="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>6 – Muhammad Qutb</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed Muhammad Qutb the blood brother of Sayyid Qutb is a dangerous Ash’ari.  He authored a book of <i>Tawheed</i> for the Saudi education ministry and this book was all rhetoric and philosophy.’<a title="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>7 – Surooreeyah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the Surooreeyah are a group from the al-Ikhwan al-Muslimoon who broke away from them and live in London.’<a title="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#666699;">Taken from Siyaar ‘Alaam an-Nubalaa &amp; Thahdheeb at Thahdheeb  And other works</span></strong><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> Compiled &amp; Translated  By Abbas Abu Yahya<br />

</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <strong>From the People of Knowledge</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;"> <em>The Khalifah Umar bin AbdulAzeez</em></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was the Khalifah and great Imaam Umar bin AbdulAzeez ibn Marwan bin al-Hakm bin Abee al-Aas, his <em>kunya</em> was Abu Hafs and he was from the Quraish. His mother was the granddaughter of Umar bin al-Khattab. He was born in 63 A.H. and passed away in the year 101A.H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by AbdulAzeez bin Yazeed al-‘Aylee who said : Sulaiman did Hajj &amp; Umar bin AbdulAzeez was with him, it started to thunder &amp; lightening struck so much that their hearts nearly came out, so Sulaiman said, Abu Hafs, have you ever seen a night like this or even heard of one like this? He answered: O <em>Ameer al-Mumneen</em>! This is the sound of the mercy of Allaah, so how would it be if you heard the sound of the punishment of Allaah! ?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-‘Awza’ee said : Umar bin AbdulAzeez wrote a letter to us, no one memorized it except me and Makhool : ‘To proceed, indeed whoever remembers death a lot, then he is pleased with little in this world, and he who adds his speech in comparison to his action, then he lessens his speech except with that which will benefit him and as-salaam.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;"><em>Sufyaan bin Saeed ath-Thawree </em><em>-Rahimullaah</em></span> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyaan bin Saeed ath-Thawree (161 A.H.) was born in Koofah in a place called Thawr, his <em>kunya</em> is Abu Abdullaah, he narrated many ahadeeth and many scholars say that he was the <em>Ameer ul Mumineen</em> of hadeeth of his time. His father was also a great <em>Muhaddith</em> (Scholar of hadeeth).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullaah ibn Mubarak <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>said: ‘I wrote hadeeth from over 1,100 Shaykhs and I didn’t write from anyone better than Sufyaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyaan ath-Thawree said: The Angels are the guardians of the heavens &amp; the Companions of hadeeth (<em>as-haabul hadeeth</em>) are the guardians in the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Refer to Thahdheeb at thahdheeb by Ibn Hajar 2/56 &amp; Siyaar ‘Alaam an-Nubalaa by adh-Dhahabee 7/229.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Maalik ibn Anas </em><em>-Rahimullaah</em> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Maalik ibn Anas ibn Aamir was born in Madeenah in 93 A.H. &amp; died in 179 A.H. His <em>kunya</em> was Abu Abdullaah, he had the famous title of ‘Imaam Dar ul Hijrah’ which means Madeenah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His grandfather Aamir was from amongst the major Companions. He was a <em>Muhadith</em> and a <em>Faqih</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He taught hadeeth in Madeenah for 40 years. He did not want his famous book al-Muwatta to become the only book that was relied upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Abdullaah bin al-Mubarak </em><em>-Rahimullaah</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullaah bin al-Mubarak al-Hanzaalee at-Tameemee the great Imaam,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AbdulAzeez bin Abee Rizma’ said : There’s no characteristic from the good characteristics except that it was combined in Abdullaah bin al-Mubarak, shyness, hospitality, good behaviour, a good companionship, it is good to sit with him, <em>Zuhud</em> and piety and in everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He passed away <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>in 181 A.H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Imaam Shaafiee </em><em>-Rahimullaah</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Shaafiee was born in 150 A.H. and grew up in Makkah. He was a beautiful man. Ibn Abdul Barr <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> mentions that he had memorised the Qur’aan by the age 7 and memorised al-Muwatta by 10 years of age, and was giving legal verdicts from 15 years of age.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His ancestry goes back to the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> (his grandfather al-Muttalib was the brother of the grandfather of the Prophet.) At the age of 20 he began studying with Imaam Maalik in Madina until Imaam Maalik <em>-Rahimullaah-</em>passed away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>was also his student. He died in 204 A.H. in old Cairo, due to injuries from being stabbed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Yahya bin Ma’een </em><em>-Rahimullaah</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Zakariya, Yahya bin Ma’een bin ‘Awn al-Ghatfaanee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said that Yahya’s father left Yahya a million dirham in inhaeritance, and Yahya spent all of it in the field of Hadeeth until he did not have shoes to wear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was the elder of his peers, from the likes of ‘Alee bin Madeenee, Ahmad bin Hanbal, Ishaaq bin Rah’wayaa &amp; Abu Bakr bin Abee Shayba <em>-Rahimhumullaah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to Imaam Ahmad &amp; said : O Aba Abdillaah, look at these ahaadeeth indeed there is a mistake in them. So Imaam Ahmad said: Go to Abu Zakariya, for indeed he knows the mistake.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad said about Yahya bin Ma’een: Here is a man that Allaah created for this matter, he exposes the lies of the liars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He died in the year 233 A.H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Abu Zura’h ar-Razee </em><em>-Rahimullaah</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Zura’h, UbaidAllaah bin ‘AbdulKareem bin Yazeed al-Qurashee ar-Razee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He started travelling for knowledge when he was 13 years of age, and on his second journey he was away for 14 yrs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam adh-Dahabee said: He was unique of his time, in memory power, intelligence, and in the <em>Deen</em>, sincerity and knowledge and action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahya bin Manda said: It is said that Abu Huraira <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211; </em>had the most powerful memory from this <em>Ummah</em>, then it is Abu Zura’h ar-Razee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hatim said: If you saw ar-Razee and others hating Abu Zura’h then know that person is a mubtadi’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He passed away to the mercy of Allaah in 264 A.H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Abu Hatim ar-Raazee </em><em>-Rahimullaah</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hatim, Muhammad bin Idrees bin al-Mundhir al-Qhatfaanee ar-Raazee, who died in 277 A.H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He first started to memorize narrations when he was 14 years old, he was so knowledgeable that by just looking at the hadeeth he could give a judgement on it, whether it was authentic or not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hatim and Abu Zura’h were good friends.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam adh-Dahabee said: If Abu Hatim says someone is <em>thiqa’</em> (trustworthy), then hold onto his saying, because he does not make anyone <em>thiqa’</em> (trustworthy) except a narrator who has authentic hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>an-Nisaa’ee </em><em>-Rahimullaah</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu AbdurRahmaan Ahmad bin Shuaib bin ‘Alee al-Khurasaanee an-Nisaa’ee, who died in the year 303 A.H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said that the town from which an-Nisaa’ee came from, was named Nisa’ which means women, and the story behind it’s name is because when the Muslims came to conquer it during the earlier period of Islaam, the men were not present in the town, so the women came out to fight, when the Muslims saw that, they did not fight, because women are not fought against.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer mentions that Imaam an-Nisaa’ee was very beautiful and his face was like a candle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He started travelling for knowledge at a young age. Ibn ‘Adee said: I heard Mansoor the Faqhiee and Abu Jafar at-Tahawee say: Abu AbdurRahmaan is a Imaam from the Imaams of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Ya’ala al-Khaleelee said: That his book is added to the books of al-Bukharee, Muslim and Abu Dawood, …and his opinion in <em>Jarh wa Ta’deel</em> (praising and criticising narrators) is relied upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was very strict and firm in <em>Jarh wa Ta’deel</em> (praising and criticising narrators). He <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>died in Makkah and was buried there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>ad-Daraqutni </em><em>-Rahimullaah</em></strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">He had a tremendous memory, Raja’ bin Muhammad al-Mu’adl said: I said to Daraqutni: ‘Have you ever seen anyone like yourself?’ and he replied that Allaah says : ‘Do not praise your selves.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then al-Mu’adl said I leaned towards him and said: ‘I have not seen anyone gather what you have gathered.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Adh-Dhahabee said: ‘This man never entered into philosophy nor debating, nor did he investigate it but rather he was a Salafee.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;"><em>Ibn Salaah </em><em>-Rahimullaah</em></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is Ibn Taqi ud-Deen Uthmaan bin Abdurrahman Salaah ud-Deen, He died in 643 A.H. he was a great scholar of hadeeth, especially in the field of the science of hadeeth, Imaam ad-Dhahbee said: ‘He was a Salafee, he had a correct creed, not entering into the <em>ta’weel</em> (interpolation) of the philosophers, he believed in what was established from the texts, neither going too deep, nor over bound.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah </em><em>-Rahimullaah</em></strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the religions sciences, Ibn Taymeeyah studied the Qur’aan, Hadeeth and Sharee’ah. He learnt the Hanbalee Fiqh (law) from his own father.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>had great love for Tafseer (Qur’aanic exegesis). He read over a hundred commentaries of the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He completed his studies when he was a teenager and at age 19 he became a professor of Islaamic studies. Who was well versed in Qur’aanic studies, Hadeeth, Fiqh, theology, Arabic grammar and scholastic theology, etc.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>His Name &amp; Lineage</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AbdulAwal bin Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Shaykh Hamad bin Muhammad al-Ansaari al-Khazraji as-Sa’adi – in lineage to Sa’ad bin ‘Ubadah al-Ansaari, the noble Companion -Radi Allaahu anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh left Africa, &#8211; the country of Mali- due to the humiliating colonisation over Africa at that time.  This was the French colonialism which was filthy, unrelenting, and terribly violent. It had eaten up everything whether it was green and alive, or dry and dead. It prevented people from becoming religious and seeking knowledge, it demolished the rights of the people of Islaam, in addition to many other problems, difficulties and types of corruption.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Shaykh was born in 1344 A.H. in a town called ‘Tadd Makkah’ in West Africa in the country of Mali.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Shaykh said: I was born in 1344 A.H. and that was the year King AbdulAziz took over al-Madina an-Nabaweeyah.  I came to know this while preparing for Hijra, I asked my mother when was I born? She replied: ‘In the year Ahl-ul-Najd[4] took over al-Madinah.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Shaykh’s father passed away when he was eight years old, so he was orphaned and lived in the shelter of his uncle, his mother’s brothers and his mother. Also those around him from amongst his relatives both on his father’s side and his mother’s side were students of knowledge, scholars, Muftis and judges.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he grew up in a purely knowledge based environment, in an environment where there were nothing of the modern day conveniences whatsoever, such as electricity, cars and planes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He lived in the most beautiful of surroundings, of greenery, forests, pure fresh water, beautiful breezes and clean air.  I heard him say more than once: ‘Indeed no one would wish to leave it due to all the goodness that was there, which was unlimited supplies of food, drink, in addition to recreation and other things.’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The people at the time of the Shaykh would memorise the Qur’aan using slates and boards.  The Shaykh of the scribes would write one or four Ayaat and the students would go away and memorise them, and then recite them to the teacher, then the teacher would wipe it clean and write other Ayaat for the students, and this is how they would memorise the whole Qur’aan.’[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘We in my country would share one book between a hundred men, and that was due to the absence of books.  We would divide up one book into sections of papers each person would take a section read it and memorize it.’[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Hijra From Mali to Saudi Arabia</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Shaykh used to tell us that he had a book of poetry that he had to leave behind in Africa, he did not bring it with him when he migrated to this blessed land (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia). This was because he left Africa escaping with only a Mus’haf (Qur’aan) fearing the colonialism of the French and the British.  The colonists would not allow anyone from the people of Africa to leave to go to the Haramain (the two major Masajid).  The Shaykh would tell us, that when he prepared to leave with two of his relatives, they had to leave in the night riding an animal, each one of them had a camel and they left, they <span style="color:#993300;">spent two years on their journey until they reached the port of Jeddah</span>.’[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I heard my father saying: ‘My journey from my country until I reached the Haramain (Makkah &amp; Madina) was an adventure.’[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard my father say: ‘When I exited from Mali, there were only two people with me on the journey, Shaykh ‘Amaar and Shaykh Uheed.  We left from the country in the year 1365 A.H. we would walk during the night and sleep during the day – it took us a complete year for the journey.’[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Nigeria</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘They passed by many countries like: ‘Niger’, ‘Nigeria’ ‘Sudan’ and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My father -Rahimullaah- met with some of the people knowledge in Nigeria, he met the Shaykh, the reviver, the scholar, as-Salafi, Abdullaah bin al-Mahmood ash-Shareef al-Hussni al-Madani, who spread the Dawat-us-Salafeeyah in the deserts of Mali.  Allaah guided nations of people on his hands away from the misguidance of grave worship, Tawwasul[12] with the righteous people, superstitions and Bida’ which had become widespread at their time in some of the African deserts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Abdullaah whom my father -Rahimullaah- met in Nigeria had come over from this blessed country (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia – may Allaah Ta’ala protect it &amp; honour it). Shaykh Abdullaah had from a young age spent this life in al-Madina an-Nabaweeyah, and he was the Imam of the Masjid an-Nabaweeyah ash-Shareef, and he was also a teacher there.’[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘When my father met Shaykh Abdullaah al-Mahmood in Nigeria, he took many benefits and advice from him, the most important being when Shaykh Abdullaah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">‘O my son, when you reach the land of the Haramain, then adhere to the books of Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah and Ibn Qayyim.  And it is upon you to disseminate the ‘Aqeedah of the Salaf and spread their books. It is upon you to teach the people ‘Aqeedah and knowledge.’</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AbdulAwal bin Hamad al-Ansaari continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I heard my father say: ‘I was greatly affected by his advice, and I took that advice and it held a great status in my heart, and I decided to act upon that advice.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed Shaykh Abdullaah bin al-Mahmood al-Madani took permission from king AbdulAziz -Rahimullaah- to travel to Africa for Dawa’, and he gave him permission. When the Shaykh arrived in Africa he opened a school for learning Qur’aan, and Tawheed as-Salafi, we the younger ones benefitted from it, but the elders did not benefit from it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Shaykh gave Dawa’ there for thirty years and he died in 1373 A.H.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then my father said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">‘The reason why Shaykh Abdullaah al-Madani left Madina, was because the people of Madina [at that time].  When the Shaykh would go out to lead the prayer [in the Prophet’s Masjid] he would not allow the shops to be left open, he would not lead the people in the Masjid an-Nabawee until they closed their shops. So the people complained to King AbdulAziz about him, when the complaint reached him, the King AbdulAziz -Rahimullaah- wrote to the Shaykh and said: ‘I am certain that the people of Madina are not truthful, however to prevent chaos I hope that you will resign.’ So the Shaykh resigned and wrote to him and after that he went to Mali.’</span>[14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sudan</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘My father also met Shaykh Tahir as-Sowakinee in the country of Sudan, and took from him the knowledge of hadeeth and on his hands he became familiar with the books of hadeeth.  Shaykh Tahir was a scholar from the scholars of Sudan in hadeeth and other sciences; he had a great concern for the knowledge of hadeeth. Indeed I heard my father saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed I was affected by Shaykh Tahir as-Sowakinee in the knowledge of hadeeth, he advised me to learn it, and to acquire its books and to follow the Manhaj of its people.’[15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Makkah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘My father met with Shaykh Hamid Faqeeh in Makkah, and was greatly affected by him in more than just his knowledge or spreading the ‘Aqeedah of the Salaf, and his love for the books of Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah and his student Ibn Qayyim. Also the books of the Imams of Dawa’ beginning from its Imam Muhammad bin AbdulWahab at-Tameemi -Rahimullaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I entered Makkah and I saw the gathering of Hamid Faqeeh.  I saw that he was strong in Salafi Tawheed, so I sat there until the Adhan of Isha.  Then when I was alone with him I asked him: ‘O Shaykh how did you learn Tawheed?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: your question is excellent.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he narrated the famous story to me.’[16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I met with Shaykh Hamid Faqeeh once and I said to him: Salafiyoon are a rarity in Egypt, and you are a Salafi, so how did Salafeeyah come to you?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘I had graduated from the university of Cairo or Azhar, and while I was travelling back to my village carrying my university certificate I passed by a farm and I saw an old Shaykh sitting there and I gave him Salam, so he said to me what is that in your hands?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: ‘A graduation certificate.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Next to the Shaykh was the book ‘Kitab al-Tawheed’ with its explanation of ‘Fath al-Majeed’ the Shaykh stood up and walked off to take care of something and he was away for sometime. I picked up the book to read, then later on the Shaykh returned, I asked him about this book, and I told him that I was amazed by it.  He began explaining the ‘Aqeedah of the Salaf to me.  He said: ‘O my son it is upon you to spread Tawheed and the ‘Aqeedah of the Salaf, because indeed you did not learn that in the university from where you graduated.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from then on I began calling to the ‘Aqeedah of the Salaf, and this Shaykh was a farmer in that farm.’[17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘He also met Shaykh Yahya al-Muallami, the brilliant scholar of hadeeth the scholar of his time in the knowledge of hadeeth, he adhered to him and took from him love for the knowledge of hadeeth and learning it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘My Shaykh AbdurRahman al-Mu’alami -Rahimullaah- would research a very great deal.  He would research into more than one book at one time.  I would sit with him in the library of the Haramain, and he would give me books and say ‘look for such and such thing.’ But I could not find it, when I would give them back he would say to me: ‘Here it is, where are you?’  This was in the year 1367 A.H. at that time I was not paying attention and being hasty.’[18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘He also adhered to Shaykh Taqi uddeen al-Hilali, sticking to him for a long time and benefitting from him in more than one science from the sciences of knowledge.’[19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Riyadh</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘My father travelled to Riyadh in 1373 A.H. and met Shaykh Muhammad bin Ibraheem ‘Ala-Shaykh -Rahimullaah- the general Mufti of this blessed land.  Shaykh Muhammad bin Ibraheem encouraged him to teach in the Jamia Masjid of Riyadh, my father would teach the books of ‘Aqeedah, and hadeeth to the youngsters, as the Shaykh had ordered him to, due to what he saw from my father of knowledge, understanding, cleverness, intelligent and concern for the ‘Aqeedah Salafeeyah.’[20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Hamad said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I came from Riyadh in the year 1385 A.H. and Shaykh at-Tayyib ibn Is’haq had died in 1365 A.H.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AbdulAwal bin Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘at-Tayyib bin Is’haq al-Ansaari was one of the senior scholars of the Salafeeyeen in al-Madina an-Nabaweeyah, of those who made Hijra a long time ago from Mali.’[21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Madina Nabaweeyah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Also when my father was in Madina before he went to Riyadh he met Shaykh Ibn Turki – and he was from the scholars of Madina at that time – and my father read ‘Saheeh al-Bukhari’ to him and the ‘Aqeedah of the Salaf and was affected by him.  Shaykh Ibn Turki was very strict, and this was clear and apparent to everyone.  He was a scholar, a Zahid[22], there were very few like him in his Zuhd in Madina Nabaweeyah at that time.’[23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘He studied under a number of scholars of al-Madina an-Nabaweeyah in Dar al-Uloom ash-Sharia’, from them were Shaykh al-Khaleel -Rahimullaah- and Shaykh Abu Bakr Shareef al-Timbaktooee – who was a teacher in the Masjid Nabawee Shareef near the Rawdah.’[24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘My father taught ‘Sunnan Tirmidhi’ in the Masjid Nabawee until he finished it completely, likewise he taught Arabic grammar, the study of the forms of words, and some sciences and hadeeth.’[25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The reader should know that my father utilized himself from the time he came to this blessed land, in giving service to the knowledge of hadeeth and the ‘Aqeedah Salafeeyah. He was a teacher in the Islamic University, in its institutes, faculties and in higher studies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would encourage students of knowledge to spread the ‘Aqeedah Salafeeyah, to learn it, and teach it and he would clarify the ‘Aqeedah Salafeeyah for them with an excellent explanation.’[26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Establishing the Islaamic University</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AbdulAwal bin Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I heard him say: ‘When the order came to launch an Islaamic University, there was a difference of opinion of where it should be.  So I suggested to Shaykh Muhammad bin Ibraheem ‘Ala-Shaykh -Rahimullaah: ‘It would be good if you established it in al-Madina since previously there was an Islaamic University in Madina which was none other than Abu Bakr -Radi Allaahu anhu- who represented the Arabs, and Bilal who represented al-Habasha etc.’[27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Term ‘al-Munawarah’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I searched for the origin of what people say these days of <span style="color:#ff6600;">al-Madina ‘al-Munawarah</span>’ and I found that the first people to label it ‘al-Munawarah’ were the ‘Uthmaanyoon’.  As for the Companions and the Successors and those after them, then for many centuries they called it <span style="color:#ff6600;">al-Madina an-Nabaweeyah</span>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AbdulAwal bin Hamad al-Ansaari commented:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I noticed from my father -Rahimullaah- that if he saw a person write ‘al-Munawarah’, he would say to him to wipe out the word ‘al-Munawarah’ and write ‘an-Nabaweeyah.’[28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the people of knowledge apply the term ‘an-Nabaweeya’ to al-Madina.’[29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Applying the word ‘al-Munawarah’ after the word al-Madina was introduced by the non-Arabs.  What was well known by the Companions and the Successors was the addition ‘an-Nabaweeyah’. Likewise, adding the term ‘al-Mukkarama’ to Makkah is not known.’[30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Rain in Madina</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed rain is good for the health, now when we have became deprived of it we have become sick.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There used to be a lot of water springs in al-Madina an-Nabaweeyah, and there used to be a spring of water right next to the Masjid Nabawee.  It had fish in it due to the large quantity of water and its great amount, and that was in the year 1369 A.H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I came to Madina again in 1385 A.H. I asked about it and it was said to me the water springs had lost their pressure and dried up and were taken away by people digging artesian wells.’[31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘At our time in al-Madina Nabaweeyah there used to be a well in every house, for those who used to live in houses.’[32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Manuscripts</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘During my travels I brought five thousand manuscripts for the Islamic University on their account. Most of my travels which were for acquiring manuscripts and copying them were during the administration of Shaykh AbdulMuhsin al-Abbad of the university.’[33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Muhammad Nasir-uddeen al-Albaani</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed Shaykh al-Albaani made ‘al-Musnad’ easy for us, he made it really easy in an excellent manner by which he compiled lists for the Companions mentioned in ‘al-Musnad’ and before this we would have great difficulty in finding the hadeeth.’[34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed Shaykh al-Albaani studied knowledge abundantly and sufficiently, and he took the trade of mending watches for livelihood just as the Imams in the beginning used to do so. Indeed each one of them used to have a skill for his livelihood, for example Abu Hanifa was a cloth merchant.’[35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘When I was in Damascus I used to visit al-Albaani in his house in ‘Safha, Mount Qassiyoon’.  I would stay awake the night with him after Isha until the end of the night, and that was so I could look into his books and his library was a good size.  Indeed Shaam[36] has been deprived of the Shaykh Nasir al-Albaani, there is none present like him in Shaam, especially in his field of expertise.’[37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Likewise I also used to phone Shaykh AbdulAziz bin Baz, there is no Muhaddith who exists like him, even though he has many duties which have come between him and being free to specialise in the knowledge of hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition to this, indeed I would refer to Shaykh Albaani regarding some matters, because he posses vast research in to the knowledge of hadeeth.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Meeting Shaykh Albaani &amp; Muhammad al-Banna</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Hamad said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘We met two noble generous brothers in Casablanca (Dar al-Bayda), Shaykh Nasir-uddeen Albaani and brother Muhammad al-Banna on their way to London, dispatched to teach in London.  We really enjoyed their company on Wednesday night, the following morning we were to leave the lands of Morocco.  That night was sociable, pleasant, relaxed, filled with the Prophetic Ahadeeth, and splendid guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also attended, on that Wednesday evening an excellent lecture entitled: ‘Straightening the rows in the prayer is from establishing the prayer’ which was delivered by Shaykh Nasir-Uddeen Al-Albaani in the Masjid al-Muhammadi in Casablanca.’[38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani (d.1420A.H) -Rahimullaah- said about him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This is along with my awareness and appreciation of his knowledge, his excellence, and his benefitting the students especially in the Islamic University, may Allaah reward him with goodness.’[39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>He Used to Love the Sunnah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr. Waleed al-Firyaanee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari’s life was not one of play and uselessness or a life of being meek and lethargic, rather it was a living example for a biography of a serious scholar who turned down the enjoyments of this life and its pleasures. He sacrificed his time and effort for knowledge and teaching.  He -Rahimullaah- would exemplify the guidance of the Salaf as-Salih in his look, in his appearance, his character, his manners, his good behaviour, his humility, and him turning away from everything, which may violate and dishonour knowledge and the prestige of the scholars. He had Islaamic awareness, he was a Zahid. He possessed honesty in his tongue, and purity in the heart, and contentment. May Allaah have vast mercy upon the deceased.’[40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>From His Students</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Is Shaykh Rabee al-Madkhali from your students?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh replied: ‘Yes, he is from my students.’[41]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed Muqbil al-Wada’iee was my student; I was the one who chose the topic [for his Master’s Degree].[42] He would read to me in my house, the days I used to live in Sharqeeyah district.  I used to advise him and say to him O Muqbil, you came from your country to seek knowledge so do not mix with those people[43], leave them and mixing with them, and turn towards that for which you travelled for.  However he was trialled and tested and he fell into that which I warned him against – I used to say to him: ‘I hope that you will be for Yemen in our time as Shawkaani was in his time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muqbil was a student the like of whom I have never seen in energy and seeking knowledge.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AbdulAwal bin Hamad added: ‘When my father said: ‘those people’ he meant those who have something against the Saudi Salafi state.’[44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AbdulAwal bin Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Shaykh AbdurRahman Muhiddeen narrated to me that he was the last person to gain an Ijazah from my father.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AbdulAwal adds: ‘Ijazah for what my father had of narrations in Hadeeth and other works.’[45]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And indeed Shaykh Ali Faqihi is my student, he would adhere to me strongly.  He would come to visit me in Makkah to take from me, and due to his great concern for knowledge, he would sleep in the library next to the books.’[46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed Hafidh Hakami is my student’ – my father means the author of many works and poetry who died along time ago.’[47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh’s Death</strong>[48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The reader should know that my father -Rahimullaah- sacrificed his wealth, time, his life from a tender age to meet Allaah Ta’ala after suffering from a medical error which led him to fall into a coma that lasted nine months, then he died [1418A.H] and was buried near the graves of the Prophet’s -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- daughters and his wives, near the entrance of Baqia’ al-Gharqad on the left of the entrance.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Also from those who are buried there near that place in that spacious graveyard is the Shaykh, the scholar Umar bin Muhammad al-Falata who used to love and revere my father, and he knew his worth, rank, his knowledge and his extensive research and his love for spreading the ‘Aqeedah of the Salaf and the knowledge of hadeeth.’[49]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘He was prayed upon in the Masjid Nabawee on Wednesday 21st of Jumada al-Aakhir 1418 A.H. – corresponding to 22nd October 1997.’[50]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>From the Okaz Newspaper</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘During these past two weeks al-Madina al-Munnawara has lost two scholars from its senior scholars. Those who were known for research and deriving verdicts, high aspirations in the field of Dawa’ and a large number of the senior scholars of the Kingdom had graduated at their hands. They, who have travelled from our world are the noble Shaykh, Scholar, Muhaddith Hamad bin Muhammad al-Ansaari after suffering from an illness, and likewise the noble Shaykh, the judge, AbdulAziz bin Muhammad ash-Shibal who departed and met his Lord facing Him while he was in Sajda’ in the ‘Rawda ash-Shareef’ in the Masjid an-Nabawee ash-Shareef.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Beginning with the scholar, Muhaddith, Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari, since indeed a number of the senior scholars of the Kingdom have spoken about him, whereby the noble Shaykh Abdullaah al-Bassam, who is a member of the committee for the Senior Scholars, said about Shaykh Hamad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I have known Shaykh Hamad due to his strength of his knowledge regarding the knowledge of hadeeth whereby he was strong and sturdy in it, and a reference point for every question.  I have known him to be Salafi in ‘Aqeedah upon the Manhaj of the Salaf.  He made great efforts in education and teaching and researching books.  I ask Allaah to forgive him and compensate the students of knowledge with other than him.’[51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace  and blessings be upon our final  Prophet Muhammad, his  family, his companions  and all those who  follow his  guidance.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;&#8230;.As for the people who know about this science then they do not have any doubt in the weakness of this type of hadeeth.  Here we have Shaykh Muqbil bin Haadee al-Yemani who mentions in his checking of &#8216;Ibn Katheer&#8217; (v1 p.513) after briefly speaking about the narrators of the <em>isnaad</em> one by one;&#8217; the hadeeth is weak due to a break in the <em>isnaad</em> and because of the weakness of UbaydAllaah bin Waleed ar-Rasaafee&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from &#8216;Silsilah ad-Da&#8217;eefah  V5 p.95&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani was asked about Muqbil bin Haadee al-Waadi&#8217;ee and Rabee bin Haadee al-Madkhalee he answered with;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;We, by no doubt praise Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em> that He has subjected/provided for this righteous <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>, which stands upon the Book, the Sunnah and the methodology of the <em>Salaf as-Saalih</em>, many callers to Islaam in the different Islaamic countries who establish the duty which is established by very few of the people in the Islaamic world today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore these two shaykhs are a blessing, the two callers to the Book, the Sunnah and what the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em> were upon, who battle against those who oppose this correct <em>Manhaj.</em>  As everyone knows (regarding those who oppose these two shaykhs) &#8211; that this certainlyemanates from two types of people; &#8216;either from an ignorant person or a person who follows his desires&#8217;.  As for the ignorant person then it is easy to guide him, since he thinks that he has some knowledge-so when correct knowledge is explained to him he is guided.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why I have said on many occasions that many of the organisations which are prevalent today, even though they have deviated away from our <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>, we find amongst them those who have sincerity &#8211; which is more beloved to me than some of those in our <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>.  Although it becomes clear that they are not with us in the sincerity which is a condition for the acceptance of all good actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who follows his desires, then we have no other way for him except that Allaah <em>Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala</em> guides him.  So those who criticise the two Shaykhs, are as we mentioned either ignorant, so they are educated, or he who follows his desires, then Allaah&#8217;s refuge is sought from this person&#8217;s evil, and we request from Allaah that He either guides him or He breaks his back.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Shaykh Muqbil, I have not read much of his works, unlike the case of our brother Rabee.  What seems apparent is that Rabee is more active in writing than Shaykh Muqbil and vice versa in <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>, (Shaykh Muqbil is more involved in) mixing with the people and inviting them to the Book and the Sunnah, admonishing them and directing them more so than Shaykh doctor Rabee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Shaykh Muqbil then the people of Makkah know their pastures better &#8211; the news that reaches us from you is the best testimony that Allaah has blessed him with ability which is probably unparalleled when compared to some of the other callers to Islaam on the face of the earth today. So we ask Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal </em>that He grants the Muslims the capability to acknowledge firstly their (i.e. the two shaykhs’) religion and that they are far from following their desires.&#8217;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2) The <em>Allaama</em> The <em>Faqeeh</em> Ash-Shaykh AbdulAzeez bin Baz</strong></p>
<p>A questioner from Yemen asked the Shaykh where he should go to study knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh answered: &#8216;Go to Shaykh Muqbil.&#8217;</p>
<p>When Shakyh Bin Baz spoke about the history of the Dawa&#8217; in Yemen he mentioned: &#8216;this is the result of the fruits of honesty and sincerity.&#8217;</p>
<p>Shaykh Bin Baz would accept references -from Shaykh  Muqbil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muqbil mentioned: At that time a person escaped to Riyadh and he said to Shaykh Bin Baz: O Shaykh I&#8217;m from <em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em> but I don&#8217;t have any documents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Bin Baz said to him: &#8216;Prove to me that you&#8217;re from <em>Ahl-us-Sunnah</em>.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man took out a piece of paper with a reference from me, upon that the Shaykh wrote a letter for him with which he could travel to wherever he wanted.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from &#8216;Rathaa shaykhina libin Baz p. 16&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3) Shaykh the <em>Faqeeh</em> Uthaymeen.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Uthaymeen said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Tell him that I regard him as a reviver of Islaam.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from &#8216;Nubtha Mukhtasira&#8217; (p.9) by Umm Abdullaah the daughter of Shaykh Muqbil</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4) Shaykh Muhaddith Rabee bin Haadee al-Madkhalee</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Rabee also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;He is a reviver of Islaam in the country of Yemen. There has not been, since the time of AbdurRazaq as-Sanaani until our time, anyone who has established the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> and revived it like al-Waadi&#8217;ee.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from &#8216;Nubtha Mukhtasira&#8217; (p.9) by Umm Abdullaah the daughter of Shaykh Muqbil</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said in his advice to the <em>Salafis</em> of Yemen and in poetry he recited when mourning for the Shaykh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;This is what we express as condolence about the flag bearer of the Sunnah and <em>Tawheed</em>, that caller to Allaah, the reviver in truth in the land of Yemen. The effects of his <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> reached to many regions of the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say to you what I believe, that your country, after the best generations, came to know the Sunnah and the <em>Manhaj</em> of the <em>Salaf as-Saalih</em>.  The Sunnah appeared at different periods of time with strength, yet still I do not know of any period like this, with which Allaah has blessed you and the people of Yemen at the hands of this righteous man, the<em>Muhadith</em>, the <em>Zahid</em>, the <em>Wara&#8217;</em> who stamped the world and its adornment under his feet.&#8217;   Dated: 1422/5/1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from &#8216;al-Abhaaj bitarjamat al-Allama al-Muhadith Abee Abu AbdurRahmaan Muqbil bin Hadi al-Waadi&#8217;ee wa Dar al-hadeeth bi-Damaj&#8217; p.163</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Rabee also said: On the death of our Shaykh the Imam Muqbil bin Haadee al-Waadi&#8217;ee may Allaah have mercy on him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;May Allaah make your reward great and give good condolences, may He forgive your dead.  Allaah gives and takes what is His and everything has an appointed time.  This is the Sunnah of Allaah<em>Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala</em> and all praise belongs to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah that He covers this man with His mercy and is pleased with him. This man <em>Zahid</em>, the pious, whom I regard InshAllaah as a reviver in our time from the revivers of Islaam.  May Allaah have mercy on him.  He was burdened with carrying the <em>Dawa&#8217; </em>and he handled its responsibility, its difficulties and toiling with patience,<em>Zuhud</em> and piety.  All these means helped in spreading his <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> and raising his status InshAllaah with his Lord and with the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory on his students that they continue on the path of the noble Messenger <em>-alayhi as-sallat wa sallam &#8211;</em> in the light of the Book and the Sunnah and upon the <em>Manhaj </em>of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em> &#8211; upon the actions of the <em>Manhaj </em>of this man who you saw with your eyes, witnessed with your sight and came to know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I hope that his example was a living example for you to follow in the<em>Deen</em> and to hold onto in piety and <em>Zuhud</em> and with patience at theharm faced in making the word of Allaah <em>Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala</em> high and spreading the <em>Deen</em> of Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from &#8216;al-Abhaaj bitarjamat al-Allama al-Muhadith Abee Abu AbdurRahmaan Muqbil bin Hadi al-Waadi&#8217;ee wa Dar al-hadeeth bi-Damaj&#8217; p.164</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>5) Shaykh Ahmad bin Yahya an-Najmee</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Mufti</em> of the south said when he came to visit Dar al-hadeeth in Dammaj after the shaykh passed away. His visit was on 3rd Jumad al-Akhir 1422 A.H.:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Praise belongs to Allaah on His <em>Qada</em> and His <em>Qadr</em>.  It is necessary to have patience since all people will die.  However whoever leaves behind the likes of this then he is not regarded as one who has died, since he has established something, he has reformed, he has invited and he has exerted himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We love that he is regarded (as being) of the virtuous people and of the pious from the highest of the <em>Awliyah</em>.  This is how we regard him and Allaah will take all of us to account.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However we see all this, we see it with our own eyes, and feel it with our senses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we know <em>&#8211; alhamdulillah &#8211;</em> that he did a lot of good, very few people can reach what he did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All these centres of learning which emanated from Yemen are goodness from his good deeds, rather from some of his good deeds. Every person who is in charge of a centre is from his students and all of them are examples to be followed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that anyone who establishes good or does a good action and whoever follows that good action, then the person who initiated that good deed will have a reward as well as the reward of the one who acts upon that deed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> said, &#8220;whoever calls to goodness then he will be rewarded and he will have the reward of the one who acts upon what he calls to from goodness.  Whoever originates misguidance or calls to it then upon him is the sin and the sin of the one who acts upon that evil.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah for forgiveness and goodness. This gathering, which we see, is nothing except from the good deeds of this great Shaykh who called to Allaah and was patient and steadfast.  He sacrificed all that was dear and every precious thing in gathering these faces, encouraging them to study knowledge and placing them on the correct path-the path that Allaah <em>Subhanahu Ta&#8217;ala</em> ordered to follow since He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((And verily, this is My Straight Path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">for they will separate you away from His Path. This He has ordained for you that you may become <em>Al-Muttaqoon</em> (God fearing)))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last of our call is that we ask Allaah <em>Azza wa  Jal </em>that He forgives our dead and our afflicted Ummah altogether. That Allaah forgives him and pardon his mistakes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em> to forgive him his mistakes.  We are completely convinced <em>InshAllaah</em> that the like of these deeds are a reason for Allaah forgiving His slave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah that He forgives Shaykh Muqbil and that He gives usthe ability to take him as an example in these good deeds and that we follow the path he followed in giving the correct <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to the Book of Allaah, to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> and to the actions of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em>.  We ask for the ability to follow this <em>Salafi Manhaj</em>, which is the methodology of the<em>Salaf</em> -may Allaah be pleased with them.  May Allaah send prayers upon our Prophet Muhammad and his Family and his Companions.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from &#8216;al-Abhaaj bitarjamat al-Allama al-Muhadith Abee Abu AbdurRahmaan Muqbil bin Hadi al-Waadi&#8217;ee wa Dar al-hadeeth bi-Damaj&#8217; p.164-166</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>6) Shaykh Salih ibn Fawzan al-Fawzan</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was asked about the <em>Aqeedah</em> of Shaykh Muqbil, and he replied with:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Yes, Shaykh Muqbil &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him- studied here in this country, in the Islamic University.  He learnt <em>Tawheed</em> and went to Yemen.  He called to Allaah and to <em>Tawheed</em>.  His <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> is good, as far as I have heard and as far as the fruits from that <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>go.  Allaah caused him to benefit.  May Allaah have mercy on him.&#8217;</p>

<span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Compiled &amp; Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I heard Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> narrate from some of the righteous people that they said: ‘That people worship Allaah, and as for the<em>Soofeeyah</em> then they worship their own selves.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Swallat Ibn al-Qayyim li Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah’ P.269 &amp; ‘Madarij Salikeen’ 1/260]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And how good is what Abu Ahmad ash-Shayrazi said: ‘The <em>Soofeeyah</em> used to ridicule Shaytaan and now the Shaytaan ridicules them! !’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Ighaatul al-Lafaan Fee Massaeed ash-Shaytaan’ with the checking by Shaykh Albani Vol. 1 p.241]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>The Deception of the Shaytaan of the Soofeeyah</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Hamid al-Faqee <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>comments on the statement of<em>Imaam</em> Ibn al-Qayyim <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> when he spoke about the deception of the Shaytaan of the <em>Soofeeyah</em>, when he <em>Imaam</em> Ibn al-Qayyim <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Shaytaan caused them to buzz around (dance) and to beat/strike the ground whizzing around on their feet, then sometimes he makes them like donkeys going around a pivot, and sometimes like insects dancing  in the middle of the house…’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Hamid al-Faqee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Shaykh (Ibn al-Qayyim <em>-Rahimullaah</em>) intends the <em>Mutasawwafa</em> (<em>Soofeeyah</em>) who form into circles, then stand up in those circles and dance and swing from side to side to the tune of singing and musical instruments.  They shout, scream and dance together with what they call <em>Dhikr</em> (remembrance of Allaah), rather it is sinfulness, disobedience and the remembrance of Shaytaan, may Allaah guide them and free them and free Islaam from those evils and crimes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Ighaatul al-Lafaan Fee Massaeed ash-Shaytaan’ with the checking by Shaykh Albani Vol. 1 p.409]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>How the Shaytaan Deceived the People that Whistling and Clapping is Prayer</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> speaks about the <em>Ayaah</em> &lt;&lt; Their prayer at the House (of Allaah) was nothing but whistling and clapping of hands. &gt;&gt; [Anfal: 35] and how the Shaytaan deceived the people that whistling and clapping is prayer.  Ibn al-Qayyim quotes: ‘Ibn Arafah and Ibn al-Ambaari who said: ‘that whistling and clapping is not prayer. . .’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Hamid al-Faqee commented on this by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘In reality this is not prayer, Allaah called it prayer because they used to whistle and clap in their thundering movements to the tunes of whistling and clapping, since they intended by it a means of coming closer to Allaah, so Allaah reprimanded them and criticized them, and Allaah clarified that He does not love that, He does not reward them for it except with a painful punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that whistling and clapping (of the polytheists) is like what takes place in the gatherings of the <em>Soofeeyah</em> of our time, like for like; dancing movements to the tune of whistling and clapping. Their deep-rooted desires beautified this, likewise their ignorance and the Shayateen from the men and Jinn, beautified this to make them think that it is <em>Dhikr</em> (remembrance of Allaah) and worship!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is far from this.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Ighaatul al-Lafaan Fee Massaeed ash-Shaytaan’ with the checking by Shaykh Albani Vol. 1 p.440]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>The Soofeeyah’s Dislike of Knowledge</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Uthmaan ad-Dhahabi (d.748) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> quoted:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ibn Baakwaya said: ‘One day Abu Abdullaah bin Khaffeef saw Ibn Maktoom and his group and they were writing something, so he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘What is this?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘We are writing such and such.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Busy yourselves by learning something and do not be deceived by the speech of the<em>Soofeeyah</em>.  I used to hide my pen in the pocket of my rags and the paper in the pocket of my garment and I would go in hiding to the people of knowledge, if they (the<em>Soofeeyah</em>) found out I was there they would dispute with me and say: you will not be successful, but then eventually they were in need of me (this knowledge).’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Imam</em> ad-Dhahabi (d.748) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This Shaykh had combined between knowledge and action and getting chains of narrations (Ahadeeth) from their sources, and would adhere to the <em>Sunnan</em> with a long enjoyable life in obedience to Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Siyaar ‘Alaam an-Nubala’ 16/346 &#8211; 347]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Uthmaan ad-Dhahabi (d.748) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> quoted Ghazali saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ghazali said: The <em>Soofeeyah</em> have taken to inspirational knowledge and not proper learnt knowledge, so one of them sits with his heart being empty, with total concern he says: ‘Allaah, Allaah, Allaah’ continuously so that his heart becomes empty. The <em>Soofeeyah</em> do not busy themselves with recitation of Qur’aan, nor with the books of Hadeeth.  So if the <em>Soofi</em>reaches this limit, then he stays in his house alone in the darkness and in a garment wrapped up, then at that time he hears the call of truth: &lt;&gt;[Surah Al-Muddathir]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; O you wrapped in garments (Prophet Muhammad)! &gt;&gt;[Surah Al-Muzzammil]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ad-Dhahabi (d.748) commented:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The leader of creation indeed heard &lt;&gt; [Surah Al-Muddathir] from Jibraeel from Allaah. As for this idiot, then he never heard the call of truth, rather he heard the Shaytaan, or he heard it from his fickled brain and did not hear it in reality, and success is adhering to the Sunnah and <em>al-Ijmaa’</em>(consensus).’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Siyaar ‘Alaam an-Nubala’ 19/322-346]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>A Rich Thankful Person and a Needy Patient Person who is Better?</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> after discussing the issue of: ‘The difference amongst the people about a rich thankful person and a needy patient person who is better?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The definition of <em>al-Faqar</em> (poverty – needy) according to many of the people, had become such that they regarded: <em>al-Faqar</em> to be <em>Zuhud</em>, worship and manners. They labeled the one described with <em>Zuhud</em>, worship and manners as a <em>Faqeer</em> (needy person) even though he possessed wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they said about the one who is not described with <em>Zuhud</em>, worship and manners as not a <em>Faqeer</em> (needy person) even if he does not possess wealth, and perhaps it is possible that this meaning can be called <em>Tasawwuf</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the people there are those who differentiate between the title <em>al-Faqeer</em>(needy person) and <em>as-Soofi</em>, then there are from these people who regard the term <em>al-Faqeer</em> better, and from them are those people who hold the view that the title <em>as-Soofi</em>is better.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Research into this issue shows that one should not look at innovated words, but one should look at what the Book and the Sunnah brought from words and meanings, indeed Allaah gave the description of His <em>Aawliya</em> which is that of <em>al-Eemaan</em> and <em>at-Taqwa</em> so whoever has a greater portion is better and the rich people are equivalent in regard to this, and Allaah knows best.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Udaatus Sabireen’ p.293]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Ibn al-Qayyim’s Refutation Against the Soofeeyah in their Rejection of Knowledge</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for what is narrated about some of them [i.e. the <em>Soofeeyah</em>] in that they regard knowledge as insignificant and them being in no need of knowledge, then that is like the one [<em>Soofee</em>] who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘We take our knowledge directly from the living One, who does not die, as for you then you take it from one who lives and then dies [i.e. narrators of hadeeth].’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another one said when he was asked: ‘Why don’t you travel so that you can hear hadeeth from AbdurRazzaq?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘What can I do with narrating from AbdurRazzaq, when someone hears directly from the Creator?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another one [<em>Soofee</em>] said: ‘Knowledge is a veil between the heart and between Allaah – Azza wa Jal – [i.e. Prevents you from reaching Allaah].’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another said: ‘If you see a <em>Soofee</em> busying himself with ‘<em>Akhbarana</em>’ (he informed us) and ‘<em>Haddathana</em>’ (he narrated to us) [These terms are used in narrating hadeeth] then wash your hands from him [i.e. keep away from him].’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another one said: ‘We have knowledge from numerical codes and you have knowledge from papers.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> comments on their statements by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The best of the conditions of those who say these statements and other similar statements is that he is an ignoramus who can be excused for his ignorance. Or a negligent person who acknowledges his negligence, or otherwise if it was not for AbdurRazzaq and the likes of him [scholars of hadeeth], and if it was not for ‘<em>Akhbarana</em>’ (he informed us) and ‘<em>Haddathana</em>’ (he narrated to us) then nothing of Islaam would have reached this person and those similar to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whoever directs you to other than ‘<em>Akhbarana</em>’ (he informed us) and ‘<em>Haddathana</em>’(he narrated to us) then he has directed you to either, <em>Soofee</em> fiction, or philosophical analogy, or to his own personal opinion.  There is nothing after the Qur’aan or ‘<em>Akhbarana</em>’ (he informed us) and ‘<em>Haddathana</em>’(he narrated to us) except the doubts of the people of theological rhetoric and the opinions of the deviant people, and the imaginations of the <em>Soofeeyah</em>, and analogies of the philosophers. Whoever separates himself from the evidences then he becomes misguided away from the correct path, there is no evidence to lead to Allaah and Paradise except the Book and the Sunnah.  Every path which is not accompanied with the Qur’aan and the Sunnah is from the path of Hell and the Shaytaan <em>nirajeem</em> (accursed Shaytaan).’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Madarij   vol.2 p.438-439]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Muhammad bin Idrees Sha’fiee <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> (d.204 A.H.) said in a poem:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">قال الشافعي رحمه الله<br />
كل العلوم سوى القرآن مشغلة                            إلا الحديث وعلم الفقه والدين<br />
العلم ما كان فيه قال حدثنا                                                                     وما سوى ذلك وساوس الشياطين</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every knowledge other than the Qur’aan is a distraction *</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Except the hadeeth and the knowledge of <em>Fiqh</em> of the <em>Deen</em> *</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowledge is that which has ‘He said’ ‘he narrated to us’ *</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everything other than that is whisperings of <em>Shayateen</em> *</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘Dewaan ash-Sha’fiee’ (p.124), ‘Bidayya wa Nihiyya’ (10/254)]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari said:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I entered Makkah and I saw the gathering of Hamid Faqeeh. I saw that he was strong in Salafi Tawheed, so I sat there until the Adhan of Isha. Then when I was alone with him I asked him: ‘<strong>O Shaykh how did you learn Tawheed?</strong>’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: your question is excellent.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he narrated the famous story to me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari also said:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I met with Shaykh Hamid Faqeeh once and I said to him: Salafiyoon are a rarity in Egypt, and you are a Salafi, so how did Salafeeyah come to you?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘I had graduated from the university of Cairo or Azhar, and while I was travelling back to my village carrying my university certificate I passed by a farm and I saw an old Shaykh sitting there and I gave him Salam, so he said to me what is that in your hands?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: ‘A graduation certificate.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Next to the Shaykh was the book ‘Kitab al-Tawheed’ with its explanation of ‘Fath al-Majeed’ the Shaykh stood up and walked off to take care of something and he was away for sometime. I picked up the book to read, then later on the Shaykh returned, I asked him about this book, and I told him that I was amazed by it. He began explaining the ‘Aqeedah of the Salaf to me. He said: ‘O my son it is upon you to spread Tawheed and the ‘Aqeedah of the Salaf, because indeed you did not learn that in the university from where you graduated.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from then on I began calling to the ‘Aqeedah of the Salaf, and this Shaykh was a farmer in that farm.’</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F280002525&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Shaykh Rabee al-Madkhali was asked: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Are there any remnants from the Prophet?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Answer :</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing now from the remnants of the Prophet <em>-alayhi as Sallat wa sallam</em>. Whoever claims that there remains something from his belongings then he is a liar and a crazy foolish person!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We visited India and found people who claimed that they had a hair of the Prophet <em>-alayhi as Sallat wa sallam</em>. They are liars and they are cheaters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We saw, I think it was either in Pakistan or in Bangladesh a Masjid, where they claimed they had the foot print of the Prophet <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in Delhi there was a Masjid and the Imam was a Bukhari and he had a lot of influence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Non-Muslim European men and women who were barely dressed would visit this Masjid.  They would go to a place in the Masjid and this Bukhari person would say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘At this place is a remnant of the Prophet <em>-alayhi as Sallat wa Sallam</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It had the like of a dome built over it. You see shameless women and men gathering to view the footprint of the Prophet <em>-alayhi as Sallat wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I saw this evil and I came to this Imam to advise him and I said: ‘You people claim that the Prophet <em>-alayhi as Sallat wa sallam –</em> came to this place and this is his remnant/sign? ‘</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied: the people say such-and-such.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to him: ‘O Brother we read history and came to know that the Messenger <em>-alayhi as Sallat wa sallam-</em> was taken up to the heavens, he went from Makkah to Madinah and he went out for battles to well known areas and he went to Tabuk, but we did not find in history that the Messenger came to Delhi and stood at this place! !</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was going around in circles. . . . then I spoke to his father when he came – and I had a Salafi with me translating – his father said about me: ‘This is bad manners’ [i.e. towards the Prophet’s hair.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then this Salafi who was with me informed me:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘That when King Saud <em>-rahimullaah-</em> visited India and came to Banaras  which is the main center idols and deities – this place Banaras is like Makkah –  In this place they have many idols,  so when they heard that he will visit this place they covered these idols – I swear by Allaah they covered them up – why ? Out of fear of Tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he came to this Masjid to pray and they said to him: Here is the footprint of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> so he quickly left that place and came to know that this is foolishness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The person who singles out Allaah alone has knowledge and insight, he has understanding, the people of Bida have stupidity, ignorance and foolishness or evilness. May Allaah bless you. So there are many claimants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Turkey they claim that the Prophet’s hair is present there,  some of the people claim that the Mus’haf which Ali <em>-radiAllaah anhu-</em> wrote with his hand is present etc….. these are lies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sunnah of Allaah regarding these things is that they pass away and cease to exist, this is the Sunnah which Allaah -Subhanahu wa Ta’ala- placed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah send praise and security upon Muhammad, upon his family and his Companions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>1927- &#8220;Oppression is of three types, the oppression which Allaah will not leave, an oppression that will be forgiven, and an oppression that will not be forgiven.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As for the oppression which will not be forgiven, then Shirk will not be forgiven.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As for the oppression which will be forgiven, then that is the oppression which the slave commits between himself and his Lord.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As for the oppression which will not be left, then it is the oppression of the slaves, then Allaah will take the rights some from others.”</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Part 7 : The Condemnation of the People of Knowledge for this Dome</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the people of knowledge &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on them &#8211; condemn what has been prohibited by the Sharia&#8217;. Some of them have clearly mentioned their condemnation and some of them -perhaps- have remained silent, since what is known is that there is no advantage to this speech.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps they took into account the permissibility of remaining silent because of the saying of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; to &#8216;Aeysha -radiAllaah anhu:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;If it were not that your people had recently left kufr (disbelief) I would have rebuilt the house (Ka&#8217;ba) on the foundations upon which Ibraheem built it.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Agreed upon by Bukharee and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is understood is that those who openly mentioned their condemnation fulfilled what Allaah had made obligatory upon them, which is advising for the sake of Islaam and the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following are some of those who condemned the building of this dome.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him &#8211; said in his book &#8216;Iqtidaa Siraat ul-Mustaqeem&#8217; :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;…….And this is why, when his apartment was built in the time of the Tabieen (the followers of the Companions) &#8211; I would sacrifice my mother and father for him &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- that<span style="color:#993300;"> they left the top of it as a skylight towards the sky</span>. And it was like that until recent times, with wax placed upon it and rocks on its edges which held it together.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The roof was projecting upwards towards the sky and it was like that at the time the masjid and the mimbar (pulpit) were burnt down in the year six hundred and fifty odd. The fire was so severe in the land of the Hijjaz that it lit up the necks of the camels in Basra. After that came the fitnah (trial) of the Tartars in Baghdad and other Fitn (trials) also came.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Then the Masjid was re-built as it had originally been, as was the roof, and a wooden wall was introduced around the apartment. Then, after a number of years, the dome was erected on the roof whilst there were those who condemned it.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Sanaani &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him &#8211; said in &#8216;Tatheer al-I&#8217;tiqaad&#8217; :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;If you say: This is the grave of the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, a great dome has been built upon it and a lot of money has been spent on it. Then, I say that this is major ignorance of the reality of the situation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Without doubt this dome was not built by the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, nor by his Companions, nor by their successors (Tabieen), nor the followers of the successors, nor the scholars of the Ummah &#8211; the Imaams of his people.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Rather, this dome was imposed on his grave &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; and was built by one of the latter kings of Misr (Eygpt), Qaloon as-Salihee, more well known as king al-Mansoor in the year 678.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He mentioned it in: &#8216;Tahqeeq an-Nasraah bi Talkheehs mu&#8217;aalim Dar al-Hijrah&#8217; and these matters are issued by the governments and not based upon evidences from the text.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">Shaykh Hussain bin Mahdi an-Nuaymi mentions, in his book &#8216;Ma&#8217;arij alAlbaab&#8217;, the statements of some of those who were tried as a result of taking the dome of the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; as sanction for the permissibility of building all domes. A Mufti states, &#8216;From what is well known is that the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; had a dome, just like the &#8216;Aawliya of Madeenah and the &#8216;Aawliya of the rest of the different cities. Building domes is the fashion in every era; it is believed that having a dome is the cause of receiving blessings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nuaymi &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him &#8211; commented by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;I say: if this is the case, then what about the fact that the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, warned against this, he cautioned and cleared his blessed and pure self &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam from what you did. You did exactly what he specifically prohibited. Was it not sufficient for you that you opposed his command? This (alone) is evidence against yourselves. You were forward in the presence of the Messenger (ie his statement). Did he &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – allude to any of what you hold permissible? Was he pleased with that or did he not prohibit this? As for your belief of blessings descending, then this is from yourselves and not from Allaah, and Allaah has refuted you.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Ikhwaan &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on them &#8211; entered Madeenah at the time of AbdulAzeez &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him -, it was of great importance to them to remove the dome. If only they had done so, but they &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on them &#8211; feared that the fitnah from the <strong>Qubooreeyeen</strong> (the sect of grave-worshippers) would be greater than removing the dome i.e. that removing an evil might lead to something more evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look how many false arguments the Qubooreeyeen have when they are called to remove these domes, some of which are similar to al-Laat, Uzza and Habil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance. &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chapter 11 &#8211; The prohibition of praying to graves, upon them and in the graveyard</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 &#8211; On the authority of Abdullaah bin Umasr on the authority of the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; where he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Pray some of your prayers in your houses, and do not take them as graves</strong></span>.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhaaree (v.2 p.75) &amp; Muslim (v.6 p.68)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- On the authority of Abu Huraira -radiAllaah anhu &#8211; that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;Do not make your houses into graveyards, verily Shaytaan runs away from the house in which Soorah alBaqarah is recited.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Muslim (v.6 p.568)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is deduced from these two hadeeth, is that the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; ordered that some of the optional prayers should be prayed in homes, and prayer is not kept away from homes, as it is kept away from the graveyards.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 &#8211; On the authority of Abu Murthid al-Ghanawee who said that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> &#8216;Do not sit on graves and do not pray towards them.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Muslim (v.7 p.38) Abu Dawood (v.3 p. 210), Tirmidhee (v.2 p. 154) Nisaee (v.2 p.53)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- On the authority of Abu Sa&#8217;eed al-Khudree -radiAllaah anhu &#8211; who said: that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;The whole earth is a place in which to pray except for graveyards and bathing places.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Abu Dawood (v.1 p.184), Tirmidhee (v.2 p.263) Ibn Majah (v.1 p.246) Ahmad (v.3 p.83) by way of Muhammad bin Ishaaq on the authority of &#8216;Amr bin Yahya bin &#8216;Imarrah on the authority of his father on the authority of Abu Sa&#8217;eed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also by way of Hamad bin Salmah on the authority of &#8216;Amr bin Yahya on the authority of his father. Also as narrated from ath-Thawaree in a Mursalan form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also (p.96) by way of AbdulWahid bin Ziyad on the authority of the &#8216;Amr bin Yahya in a Mosoolun form. It was narrated by Ibn Hibban in his Saheeh, likewise in &#8216;Muwaarid athaaman&#8217; (p.104) &amp; Hakim (v.1 p.251) and he said it fulfilled the conditions of Bukhaaree &amp; Muslim and ad-Dhahabi agreed with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam ibn Taymeeyah said in &#8216;Iqtida as-Siraat al-Mustaqeem&#8217;: &#8216;Narrated by Ahmad and Abu Dawood, Tirmidhee, Ibn Majah and Bazzar and other than them, with good chains of narrations and whoever speaks against this hadeeth has not gathered all its chains.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- On the authority of Abu Huraira -radiAllaah anhu &#8211; who said: that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;Do not make your houses into graves, do not make my grave as a place of Eid (i.e. regularly visited), and send your prayers upon me, since your prayers reach me from wherever you are.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Abu Dawood and Ahmad (v.8 p.155) from the &#8216;Tarteeb of al-Musnad&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him &#8211; said in &#8216;Iqtida as-Siraat ul Mustaqeem&#8217; (p.321): &#8216;This chain is Hasan.&#8217; then he mentioned what was said regarding one of the narrators, Abdullaah bin Nafa&#8217; asSaaigh, and he mentioned its supporting narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6- On the authority of Abdullaah bin &#8216;Amr -radiAllaah anhu &#8211; that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;Prohibited praying in a graveyard.&#8217;</strong></span> Narrated by Ibn Hibban as is mentioned in &#8216;muwaarid athaaman&#8217; (p. 105).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7- On the authority of Anas -radiAllaah anhu &#8211; that the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>-&#8216;prohibited praying to graves.&#8217;</strong></span> and in another wording: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;He prohibited praying between graves.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by lbn Hibban as in &#8216;Muwaarid&#8217; (p.105), and al Haythamee said in &#8216;Mua&#8217;jam al-zawaid&#8217; (v.2 p.27): narrated by Bazaar, and its narrators are the narrators of the saheeh</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8- On the authority of &#8216;Amroo bin Dinaar who was asked about praying between graves &#8211; who said, &#8216;It was mentioned to me that the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;Banu Israeel took the graves of their Prophets as places of prayer due to that Allaah Ta&#8217;ala cursed them.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Abdur Razzaq (v.1 p.407) and it is a mursal hadeeth (not attributed to the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9- On the authority of Abu Sa&#8217;eed the freed slave al-Mahree who said that the Messenger of Allaah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;Do not take my house as a place of Eid, nor your houses as graves and send your prayers upon me wherever you are, verily your prayers reach me.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hadeeth mursal narrated by Sa&#8217;eed bin Mansoor, as is mentioned in &#8216;Iqtida Siraat ul-Mustaqeem&#8217; (p.322)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Therefore, what is exempted from the prohibition of praying in a graveyard is the funeral prayer, due to the ahadeeth which were mentioned about it:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- On the authority of Ibn Abbas -radiAllaah anhu &#8211; that &#8211;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; passed by a grave where someone was buried just that night and he said; &#8216;when was this person buried?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said; &#8216;last night.&#8217;<br />
He said: &#8216;Why did you not inform me?&#8217;<br />
They said: &#8216;He was buried in the dark of the night, and we disliked to wake you up.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8212; stood for the funeral prayer and we stood in a row behind him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abbas said: &#8216;and I was among them, and we prayed over him.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhaaree (v.3 p.433), Muslim (v.6 p.24 &amp; p.25), and Ahmad (v.7 p.226) with the tarteeb of Sa&#8217;aatee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- On the authority of Abu Huraira -radiAllaah anhu &#8211; that &#8211;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A black man or woman used to live in the masjid, and he died. The Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -did not know about his death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So that day the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -mentioned him and said: &#8216;What happened to that person?&#8217;<br />
They said: &#8216;He died O Messenger of Allaah.&#8217;<br />
He said: Why did you not inform me?<br />
They said: Surely he was such and such, such is his story, and they belittled his matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; said: Show me where his grave is.&#8217; He came to his grave and prayed over him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhaaree (v.3 p.448) and Muslim (v.6 p.25, 26), Ahmad (v.7 p.223, 224) from the tarteeb of Musnad</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- On the authority of Anas bin Malik -radiAllaah anhu &#8211;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A black man used to clean the masjid and he died, he was buried during the night, and when the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; came, he was informed about him. He said: &#8216;Go to his grave.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they went to his grave and he said: &#8216;Certainly these graves are full of darkness for the inhabitants, and indeed Allaah Azza wa Jaal illuminates them by my prayer over them.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he came to the grave and prayed over it, a man from the Ansaar said: &#8216;O Messenger of Allaah! Indeed my brother died and he was not prayed over.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He asked: &#8216;Where is his grave?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he told him, and the Messenger of Allaah went with the Ansaar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Ahmad (v.7 p.225), Sa&#8217;atee mentions in his Takhreej: narrated by al-Bayhaaqi, ibn Mundah and Abu Dawood at-Tayalisee and al-Haythamee mentioned with his wording and said: a part of it is in asSaheeh, it is narrated by Ahmad and its narrators are the narrators of As-Saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- Also on the authority of Anas that &#8211;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; prayed for the woman at her grave, who had been already buried.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Ahmad (v.7) from tarteeb of al-Musnad, as-Sa&#8217;atee mentions: narrated by al-Bazzar and alBayhaqi and narrated by Muslim also by way of Shobah with a chain of the hadeeth from that chapter; concise, with the wording that the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -prayed at a grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is apparent is that the grave is of the woman who used to live in the masjid. This is what is generally understood although another meaning is possible. Allaah Subhana wa Ta&#8217;ala knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 &#8211; On the authority of Yazeed bin Thaabit -radiAllaah anhu &#8211; who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We went out with the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; and when we reached al-Baqee (the graveyard). He came across a new grave. He questioned us about it, so it was said it was such and such woman, and he knew her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8216;Why didn&#8217;t you inform me about her.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: &#8216;O Messenger of Allaah you were sleeping and fasting, we disliked to wake you up.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8216;Don’t do that. There is none amongst you who dies and I am here amongst you, except that you should inform me about that person. Verily my prayer over him is mercy for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yazeed said; then he came to the grave and we made rows behind him, he prayed the funeral prayer over it with four Takbirs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Ahmad (v.7 p.225) from the Tarteeb of al-Musnad. Sa&#8217;atee mentions: it was narrated by anNisa&#8217;ee, al-Bayhaqee and its Sanad is good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam a-Bayhaqee &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him &#8211; said: (v.4 p.48): We were informed by Abu Abdullaah al-Hafidh and Abu Sa&#8217;eed bin Abee &#8216;Amr who both said: Abul-Abbas Muhammad bin Yaqoob narrated to us that ar-Rabia&#8217;bin Sulaiman narrated to us that Bashr bin Bakr narrated to us that al-Awaz&#8217;aee narrated to me that Ibn Shihab informed me on the authority of Abee Umamah bin Sahl ibn Haneef al-Ansaari that some of the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; informed him that &#8211;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the Messenger of Allaah used to visit the poor, sick Muslims and those who were weak. He would follow their funerals, and no one used to pray over them except the Messenger. There was a poor woman from the people of al-Awaali (a place in Madinah) whose sickness lasted a long time. The Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -used to ask her neighbours about her, from those who used to visit her. He would order them that they should not bury her if anything happened to her, so that he could pray over her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The woman died that night. So, they carried her and brought her with the funeral bier &#8211; or he mentioned the place of the funeral prayer &#8211; in the masjid of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -so that the Messenger of Allaah could pray over her as he had ordered them. However, they found that he had gone to sleep after the Isha prayer, and they disliked waking him from his sleep. They prayed over her, took her and buried her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the morning the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -asked about her from her neighbours who came to visit him. They informed him about her and that they disliked to wake the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; for her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8212; said to them: &#8216;Why didn&#8217;t you do it? Let&#8217;s go.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, they went with the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; until they reached her grave. They arranged themselves in rows behind the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; as they would arrange themselves in rows for the funeral prayer. The Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; prayed over her, and said four takbeers just like he would say the takbeer for the funeral prayer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth is authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now, our noble Shaykh AbdulGhaffar al-Hindi &#8211; may Allaah preserve him &#8211; mentioned during the debate, that he required me to discuss the saying of Allaah Azza Wa Jal: &lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Then those who won their point said: &#8220;We verily shall build a place of worship over them.&#8221;</span></strong> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since it is from the greatest doubts of the Qubooreeyeen (grave worshippers). I responded to his request &#8211; may Allaah preserve him &#8211; after the debate had ended, and I wrote the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Qubooreeyeen have a doubt, and it is regarding the saying of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala &lt;&lt; then those who won their point said: &#8220;We verily shall build a place of worship over them.&#8221; &gt;&gt;</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say: building masajid on graves was permitted in the Sharia&#8217; for those before us, and it is also permissible for us now, as long as there is no abrogation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reply to this doubt is from the following angles:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: this action was the action of the people of the companions of the cave. The companions of the cave said, describing this nation: &lt;&lt;These, our people, have taken for worship gods other than Him (Allaah) &gt;&gt; Therefore whoever claims that the people of the companions of the cave accepted Islaam after the people of the cave isolated themselves, then he has certainly relied upon the stories of Banu Israeel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the evidences showing that their people remained upon their disbelief is the saying of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala: &lt;&lt; And thus We made their case known to the people, that they might know that the Promise of Allaah is true, and that there can be no doubt about the Hour &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He who does not know that the promise of Allaah is true and that there is no doubting the final Hour, then he is not a Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly if we accept, for the sake of argument, that they were Muslims, then where do we find in their Sharia&#8217; that building masajid on graves was permissible for them?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it not possible that they arrived at an understanding and were mistaken? Thirdly if we accept for the sake of argument that it has been permitted in the Sharia&#8217; for those before us, then now it has been abrogated with our Sharia&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Ahadeeth are Mutaawatir (recurring chains) from the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -which prohibit the taking of the graves as places of worship. The curse of the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -is upon the one who does this, as is mentioned in Bukharee and Muslim from the hadeeth of &#8216;Aeysha -radiAllaah anha.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Imam Allaama Shaykh Rabee bin Hadi al-Madkhali -hafidhullaah- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;We advise the Salafis to have harmony/solidarity and to adhere to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To have brotherhood upon what is contained in the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam of Aqeedah, worship and actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having brotherhood for the sake of Allaah Azza wa Jal and to have Eemaan in these principles and these foundations and to love each other for the sake of Allaah Azza wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">If a person makes a mistake whether it is a minor one or a major one, advice is given with wisdom and good admonition.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There are people who make a claim of Salafeeyah, they are hard and forceful with falsehood, with slander and oppression. They are harsh and hard when being harsh is not required and they have no wisdom whatsoever, nor mercy or any of these things!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">With sadness some people accuse the established Salafis with this exaggeration! This is extreme oppression.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I swear by Allaah we wage war against this harshness, the harshness of the Khawarij, we criticize these people who are extreme and delve too deeply and also the harsh ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We criticize those who water-down, belittle and wage war against the principles of Islaam who originate, derive and produce false, unintelligent principles and statements to protect the people of Bida.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We criticize this extremist and we call to the straight path and to that what the Salaf as-Salih were upon of beliefs, actions and manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are extremists in watering-down, belittling and warring against the principles of Islam and the others are extremists in declaring people innovators and making Takfeer of people, so both of these types deviate from the straight path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allaah ordered us to have moderation and justice and to be steadfast upon the straight path.&#8217;</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">–</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>هـل نـسـتـغـفـر النبي؟</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;">Translated &amp; Compiled By Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What has been said about the Ayaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ إِذْ ظَلَمُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ جَاءُوكَ فَاسْتَغْفَرُوا اللَّهَ وَاسْتَغْفَرَ لَهُمُ الرَّسُولُ لَوَجَدُوا اللَّهَ تَوَّابًا رَحِيمًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> If they (hypocrites), when they had been unjust to themselves, had come to you (Muhammad) and begged Allaah’s Forgiveness, and the Messenger had begged forgiveness for them: indeed, they would have found Allaah All-Forgiving (One Who accepts repentance), Most Merciful</strong></span>.&gt;&gt;   [Nisa: 64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1 – Shaykh ul-Islaam Ahmad bin AbdulHaleem Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) -Rahimullaah- said:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘From the people there are those who interpret the saying of Allaah Ta’ala :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ إِذْ ظَلَمُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ جَاءُوكَ فَاسْتَغْفَرُوا اللَّهَ وَاسْتَغْفَرَ لَهُمُ الرَّسُولُ لَوَجَدُوا اللَّهَ تَوَّابًا رَحِيمًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If they (hypocrites), when they had been unjust to themselves, had come to you (Muhammad) and begged Allaah’s Forgiveness, and the Messenger had begged forgiveness for them: indeed, they would have found Allaah All-Forgiving (One Who accepts repentance), Most Merciful.</strong></span>&gt;&gt; [Nisa: 64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say : ‘If we seek forgiveness from the Messenger after his death then we are of the status of those who sought forgiveness from amongst the Companions.’  However, with this statement they oppose the Ijmaa (consensus) of the Companions and those who succeeded them with goodness and the rest of the Muslims, since not a single one of them sought from the Prophet –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– after his death that he intercede for them. Nor did they ask him anything and not a single one of the Imams mentioned this in their books.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Majmoo al-Fatawa 1/190]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>2 – Shaykh Allaama Saddeeq Hasan Khan (d. 1307 A.H.) said about this Ayaah :</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This ‘visiting/coming to the Prophet’ is specific to his  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam–  life time, and this does not mean that ‘this visiting /coming to’ is to  the enlightened place where he is buried after his death  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.  What indicates to this is what is mentioned in this Ayaah, as is affirmed in the book: ‘Saarim al-Munky’. This is why none from the Salaf of the Ummahand their Imams, not from  the Companions, Successors, nor from those who followed them in goodness ever took this extreme possibility [of seeking forgiveness from the Prophet –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– after his death.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Fath al-Bayan fee Maqasid al-Qur’aan 2/315]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">3 – Shaykh Abdul Muhsin bin Hamd al-Abbad al-Badr said:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the saying of Allaah Ta’ala :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ إِذْ ظَلَمُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ جَاءُوكَ فَاسْتَغْفَرُوا اللَّهَ وَاسْتَغْفَرَ لَهُمُ الرَّسُولُ لَوَجَدُوا اللَّهَ تَوَّابًا رَحِيمًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If they (hypocrites), when they had been unjust to themselves, had come to you (Muhammad) and begged Allaah’s Forgiveness, and the Messenger had begged forgiveness for them: indeed, they would have found Allaah All-Forgiving (One Who accepts repentance), Most Merciful</strong></span>.&gt;&gt;   [Nisa: 64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then this Ayaah is in regard to the Munafiqeen, this becomes clear from what preceded this Ayaah and what came after it. ‘Coming to’ the Prophet  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– is specific to, in his lifetime. What is established in ‘Saheeh al-Bukhari’ from the Hadeeth of ‘Aeysha –Radhi Allaahu anha–that when she said: ‘O my head is hurting!’ The Messenger of Allaah –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– said to her:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>ذَاكِ لَوْ كَانَ وَأَنَا حَىٌّ، فَأَسْتَغْفِرُ لَكِ، وَأَدْعُو لَكِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘If you die and I am alive then I will seek forgiveness for you and I will pray for you. . . ‘</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the Prophet –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– was to seek forgiveness for anyone after his death then there would not have been a difference between him dying before her or her dying before him. Some of the people of Bida’ claim that which is much more than that, which is that the Prophet  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– brought his hand out of the grave and shook hands with one of the followers of the people of Bida’. What clearly invalidates this, is that the likes of this never occurred for the Companions –Radhi Allaahu anhum– and they are the best of this Ummah.  The Prophet  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>أَنَا سَيِّدُ وَلَدِ آدَمَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ وَأَوَّلُ مَنْ يَنْشَقُّ عَنْهُ الْقَبْرُ وَأَوَّلُ شَافِعٍ وَأَوَّلُ مُشَفَّعٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘I am the leader of the son of Adam on the Day of Judgement and I am the first for whom the grave will be opened and I am the first to intercede and the first to be interceded.’</span></strong> [Muslim] And this opening of the grave will be when the resurrection takes place. Allaah Ta’ala said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>ثُمَّ إِنَّكُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ تُبْعَثُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Then (again), surely, you will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection.</span></strong> &gt;&gt;[al-Muminun : 16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Butlaan Qisatay by AbdurRahmaan al-Umaysaan p.179-180]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaykh Abdul Muhsin bin Hamd al-Abbad al-Badr also said:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the saying of Allaah -Tabarak wa Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ إِذْ ظَلَمُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ جَاءُوكَ فَاسْتَغْفَرُوا اللَّهَ وَاسْتَغْفَرَ لَهُمُ الرَّسُولُ لَوَجَدُوا اللَّهَ تَوَّابًا رَحِيمًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">If they (hypocrites), when they had been unjust to themselves, had come to you (Muhammad) and begged Allaah’s Forgiveness, and the Messenger had begged forgiveness for them: indeed, they would have found Allaah All-Forgiving (One Who accepts repentance), Most Merciful.</span></strong>&gt;&gt;   [Nisa: 64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the intent is not approaching his grave  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– after his death, but rather the intent is come to him during his lifetime  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– just as the Companions–Radhi Allaahu anhum– understood it.  I clarified this is in a booklet called ‘The Importance of Tawheed al-Eebaadah’ (p.69) where I said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The inmates of graves are visited and Dua is sought for them and they are not supplicated to. Allaah is requested for them and nothing is requested from them, not Dua’ nor cure nor to achieve benefit nor to repel harm. Since this is indeed requested from Allaah, Allaah -Subhanahu wa Ta’ala- is the One Who is supplicated to and to have hope in. Dua is made for anyone other than Allaah and is not supplicated to, the proof for this is that the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– used to request from him to make Dua during his lifetime and he would make Dua for them. After his death  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam–  during his life of the Barzakeeyah they would not go to his grave  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam–  and requested Dua from him. This is why  when the drought occurred at the time of Umar –Radhi Allaahu anha– he requested Dua for rain from al-Abbas–Radhi Allaahu anha– and Umar requested him to make Dua’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Bukhari collected in his book from Anas that Umar bin al-Khattab used to request Dua for rain from al-Abbas bin AbdulMuttalib, if there was a drought and he would say: ‘O Allaah indeed we used to come closer to You (make Tawassul) with Your Prophet –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– and You [Allaah] would give us rain, and indeed we come closer to You with his uncle, so give us rain,’ then the rain would come down.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the request for Dua from the Prophet  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– after his death was permissible Umar –Radhi Allaahu anha– would not have turned away from it and requested Al-Abbas to make Dua’ for rain.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1 &#8211; Reading Star Signs</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Salih Alaa ash &#8211; Shaykh -hafidhullaah- said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Whoever reads the page which contains star signs and he knows the star sign of when he was born, or he knows that star sign which is significant for him, and he reads the comments mentioned in that star sign then it is as if he has asked a soothsayer/fortune teller. So his prayer would not be accepted for forty days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he attests to it and believes in that star sign then he has disbelieved in that which was revealed to Muhammad &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- . . .&#8217; (the Shaykh continues saying: ) &#8216;and if he brings home newspapers which contain these type of things then it is as if he brought a soothsayer / fortune teller into his house.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Tamheed Sharh Kitaab al Tawheed p. 349 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2 &#8211; Watching Magical Acrobatic Stunts &amp; Circus Antics </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzaan -hafidhullaah- said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;It is not permissible to use magic in the form of acrobatic stunts or circus antics or anything similar to that. Like the one who pulls a car with his hair, or a car is driven over him and does not harm him. . . . . all of this is magical imagery, so it is not allowed to perform it or to be happy with it, nor to attract your friends to do this in front of Muslims. Because it is clear evil, it is obligatory to reject and terminate it and to cleanse the Muslim lands of it . . . if those who go to see magic in the form of acrobatic stunts even though they are not pleased with going to see them, they have carried out something which is prohibited and they are sinful for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If they are pleased with this and they know that this is done by magic then they have fallen into disbelief because of it.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Daroos fee sharh Nawaqid al Islaam p. 152-156]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3 &#8211; Wearing an Engagement Ring</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This enters under the saying of the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8216;Indeed incantations, amulets and Tiwalah [1] (a form of magic) are Shirk.&#8217;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Ahmad and Abu Dawood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Uthaymeen -rahimullaah &#8211; gave the example that an engagement ring is a Tiwalah and he explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;If the people believe that it can benefit or harm, then with this intention it is from the minor Shirk, and even if this intention is not there &#8211; and this is highly unlikely that he does not have this intention &#8211; it is resemblance of the Christians since it is taken from them.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Qawl al-Mufeed ala Kitaab al Tawheed 1 /228-229]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4 &#8211; Wearing Brass Bracelets to Battle Against Rheumatism</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh AbdulAziz Ibn Baz &#8211; rahimullaah &#8211; said regarding these type of bracelets after having exhausted all the evidences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;The opinion which I hold in this issue is leaving these previously mentioned bracelets and not to use them; this is to block the path leading to Shirk, to terminate the aspect of any Fitnah with these bracelets and to incline to them, also that souls become attached to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, in having the incentive in turning the Muslim with his heart to Allaah -Subhanahu- and to have trust in Him, and reliance on Him sufficing with the means which are in accordance with the Sharia&#8217; and their allowance is well known with committing Shirk.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Majmoo&#8217; Fatawa ash-Shaykh Ibn Baaz vol.1 p.207]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Neither Wealthy, Nor Knowledge of the Unseen, Nor an Angel<br />
By Shaykh ul-Islaam Ahmad bin AbdulHaleem Ibn Taymeeyah -Rahimullaah-</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">قُلْ لَا أَقُولُ لَكُمْ عِنْدِي خَزَائِنُ اللَّهِ وَلَا أَعْلَمُ الْغَيْبَ وَلَا أَقُولُ لَكُمْ إِنِّي مَلَكٌ إِنْ أَتَّبِعُ إِلَّا مَا يُوحَى إِلَيَّ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#000000;">Say (O Muhammad): “I don’t tell you that with me are the treasures of Allah, nor (that) I know the unseen; nor I tell you that I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me by inspiration.”</span></strong>&gt;&gt; [Soorah Ana’am : 50]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ahmad bin AbdulHaleem Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) -Rahimullaah- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the Messenger –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– was ordered to free himself from claiming these three things with Allaah’s statement &lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Say : ‘I don’t tell you that with me are the treasures of Allaah, nor (that) I know the unseen; nor I tell you that I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me by inspiration.’</span></strong> &gt;&gt; This is also what Nuh -alayhi as-Salam- said and he was the first of the main Messengers, the first Messenger&nbsp;[1] whom Allaah Ta’ala sent to the people of the earth. Here, too now, is the seal of the Messengers and the seal of the main Messengers and they have both freed themselves from this claim. This is because people sometimes seek knowledge of the unseen from the Messenger–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, as in the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَى هَذَا الْوَعْدُ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">They say: “When will this promise (i.e. the Day of Resurrection) come to pass? if you are telling the truth.”</span> </strong>&gt;&gt; [Mulk:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ السَّاعَةِ أَيَّانَ مُرْسَاهَا قُلْ إِنَّمَا عِلْمُهَا عِنْدَ رَبِّي</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>They ask you about the Hour (Day of Resurrection): “When will be its appointed time?” Say: “The knowledge thereof is with my Lord (Alone)</strong></span>. &gt;&gt; [al-Aa’raaf: 187]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also they sometimes seek this knowledge to be persuaded of the truth, as in the saying of Allaah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَقَالُوا لَنْ نُؤْمِنَ لَكَ حَتَّى تَفْجُرَ لَنَا مِنَ الْأَرْضِ يَنْبُوعًا () أَوْ تَكُونَ لَكَ جَنَّةٌ مِنْ نَخِيلٍ وَعِنَبٍ فَتُفَجِّرَ الْأَنْهَارَ خِلَالَهَا تَفْجِيرًا () أَوْ تُسْقِطَ السَّمَاءَ كَمَا زَعَمْتَ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفًا أَوْ تَأْتِيَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْمَلَائِكَةِ قَبِيلًا () أَوْ يَكُونَ لَكَ بَيْتٌ مِنْ زُخْرُفٍ أَوْ تَرْقَى فِي السَّمَاءِ وَلَنْ نُؤْمِنَ لِرُقِيِّكَ حَتَّى تُنَزِّلَ عَلَيْنَا كِتَابًا نَقْرَؤُهُ قُلْ سُبْحَانَ رَبِّي هَلْ كُنْتُ إِلَّا بَشَرًا رَسُولًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">And they say: “We shall not believe in you, until you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us; “Or you have a garden of date-palms and grapes, and cause rivers to gush forth in their midst abundantly; “Or you cause the heaven to fall upon us in pieces, as you have pretended, or you bring Allaah and the angels before (us) face to face; “Or you have a house of adornable materials (like silver and pure gold, etc.), or you ascend up into the sky, and even then we will put no faith in your ascension until you bring down for us a Book that we would read.” Say : “Glorified (and Exalted) be my Lord (Allaah) above all that evil they (polytheists) associate with Him! Am I anything but a man, sent as a Messenger?”</span></strong>&gt;&gt; [al-Israa: 90-93]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sometimes, they would regard the human need a Messenger had as shameful, as in the saying of Allaah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَقَالُوا مَالِ هَذَا الرَّسُولِ يَأْكُلُ الطَّعَامَ وَيَمْشِي فِي الْأَسْوَاقِ لَوْلَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْهِ مَلَكٌ فَيَكُونَ مَعَهُ نَذِيرًا () أَوْ يُلْقَى إِلَيْهِ كَنْزٌ أَوْ تَكُونُ لَهُ جَنَّةٌ يَأْكُلُ مِنْهَا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And they say: “Why does this Messenger eat food, and walk about in the markets (like ourselves). Why is not an angel sent down to him to be a warner with him? “Or (why) has not a treasure been granted to him, or why has he not a garden whereof he may eat?”</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [Furqan : 7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Allaah ordered the Messenger to inform them that he neither knew the unseen, nor did he possess the treasures of Allaah, nor was he an Angel who was not in need of eating or wealth. Rather, he was a follower of what was revealed to him, following that which was revealed to him is the Deen, which is obedience to Allaah and he was commanded to worship Him with knowledge and actions, both inward and outward. A person attains from those three things, according to the amount Allaah Ta’ala gives him. He learns from him what He has taught him and has ability according to what Allaah gives him the capability to do, and he suffices himself with that which Allaah enriched him with in matters which would otherwise oppose general practices or the practice of the majority of the people.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Majmoo 11/312-313]</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>The Keys for Receiving Provisions<br />
</b>By Shaykh Muhammad bin Umar bin Salim Bazmool<br />
[From the ‘My Religion taught me’ series]</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Receiving Provisions has keys, the most important are five:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The First:</strong></span> Being continuous upon the five daily prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is from the secrets of where paying Zakat is repeatedly connected to establishing the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is – and Allaah knows best – an indication that whoever established the prayer then their provision will increase and they will possess wealth more than they need, so much so that paying Zakat becomes obligatory upon them. This is why the saying of Allaah is repeated [in the Qur’aan]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(اقيموا الصلاة وآتوا الزكاة).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>establish the prayer and pay the Zakat</strong>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Second:</strong></span> Seeking Forgiveness</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Subhanahu says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>{وَيَا قَوْمِ اسْتَغْفِرُواْ رَبَّكُمْ ثُمَّ تُوبُواْ إِلَيْهِ يُرْسِلِ السَّمَاء عَلَيْكُم مِّدْرَاراً وَيَزِدْكُمْ قُوَّةً إِلَى قُوَّتِكُمْ وَلاَ تَتَوَلَّوْاْ مُجْرِمِينَ }</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#000000;">And O my people! Ask forgiveness of your Lord and then repent to Him, He will send you (from the sky) abundant rain, and add strength to your strength, so do not turn away as Mujrimun (criminals, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allaah)</span></strong>.&gt;&gt; [Hud:52]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Subhanahu says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[فَقُلْتُ اسْتَغْفِرُوا رَبَّكُمْ إِنَّهُ كَانَ غَفَّاراً{10} يُرْسِلِ السَّمَاء عَلَيْكُم مِّدْرَاراً{11} وَيُمْدِدْكُمْ بِأَمْوَالٍ وَبَنِينَ وَيَجْعَل لَّكُمْ جَنَّاتٍ وَيَجْعَل لَّكُمْ أَنْهَاراً{12} مَّا لَكُمْ لَا تَرْجُونَ لِلَّهِ وَقَاراً].</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">《<strong><span style="color:#000000;">”I said (to them): ‘Ask forgiveness from your Lord; Verily, He is Oft-Forgiving; ‘He will send rain to you in abundance; ‘And give you increase in wealth and children, and bestow on you gardens and bestow on you rivers.” What is the matter with you, [that you fear not Allaah (His punishment), and] you hope not for reward (from Allaah or you believe not in His Oneness).</span></strong>》[Nuh:10-13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Third:</strong></span> keeping good relations with relatives</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most important and at the forefront is being good to parents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Anas bin Malik <em>-Radhi Allaahu anhu-</em> who said I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa Salam– </em>saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>((مَنْ سَرَّهُ أَنْ يُبْسَطَ لَهُ فِي رِزْقِهِ أَوْ يُنْسَأَ لَهُ فِي أَثَرِهِ فَلْيَصِلْ رَحِمَهُ ))</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Whoever is pleased that his provision is increased or that his life is lengthened then he should keep good relations with his relatives.’</strong> </span>[Collected by Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fourth:</strong></span> Taqqwa of Allaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً{} وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لَا يَحْتَسِبُ وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَالِغُ أَمْرِهِ قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدْراً).</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">《<strong><span style="color:#000000;">And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allaah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allaah has set a measure for all things.</span></strong>》[Talaq: 2-3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifth:</strong></span> Performing Hajj &amp; Umrah a lot.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Abdullaah <em>-Radhi Allaahu anhu-</em> who said that the Messenger of Allaah <em>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa Salam – </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>«تَابِعُوا بَيْنَ الْحَجِّ وَالْعُمْرَةِ؛ فَإِنَّهُمَا يَنْفِيَانِ الْفَقْرَ وَالذُّنُوبَ كَمَا يَنْفِي الْكِيرُ خَبَثَ الْحَدِيدِ مِنَ الذَّهَبِ وَالْفِضَّةِ، وَليْسَ لِلْحَجَّةِ الْمَبْرُورَةِ ثَوَابٌ دُونَ الْجَنَّةِ»</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Follow up between Hajj and Umrah since they wipe out poverty and sins, just as the furnace separates the iron slag from gold and silver. There is no reward for a Hajj done correctly except Paradise.’</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Beautiful Humble Dua of Abu Bakr -RadhiAllaahu anhu- the Best of Creation after the Prophets</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said after an announcer praised him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;I thank the brother, teacher Ibraheem for his statements and his praise, there is nothing that I can say in return except by following the first Khalifa Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq -RadhiAllaahu anhu- who was truly a Khalifa and the first of them for the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; but even though he was the Khalifa when he would hear a person praising him with goodness &#8211; and I believe that praise, no matter how excessive that person was in giving it, as long as it was for the Khalifa of the Messenger of Allaah, then he deserved it &#8212; but along with that -Allaah ul-Musta&#8217;aan (Allaah&#8217;s help is required) [here the Shaykh begins to shed tears] along with that Abu Bakr used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> اللهم لا تؤاخذني بما يقولون، </strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>O Allaah do not take me to task with   what they say, </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> واجعلني خيرًا مما يظنون، </strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>and make me better than what they presume </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>واغفر لي ما لا يعلمون،</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>and forgive me for what they do not know.&#8217; </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what as-Siddeeq al-Akbar said, so what can we say after him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I say &#8211; following him:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> اللهم لا تؤاخذني بما يقولون، واجعلني خيرًا مما يظنون، واغفر لي ما لا يعلمون، </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>O Allaah do not take me to task with what they say, and make me better than what they presume and forgive me for what they do not know.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[The Shaykh cries trying to utter this statement]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The truth is &#8211; and I say the truth &#8211; I am not as was described previously, by what you heard from our respected brother Ibraheem, indeed I am only a student of knowledge, nothing else. It is upon every student of knowledge to be with the statement of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"> (بلغوا عني ولو آية، بلغوا عني ولو آية، وحدثوا</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> عن بني إسرائيل ولا حرج، ومن كذب عليّ</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> متعمدًا فليتبوأ مقعده من النار)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>&#8216;Convey from me, even if it is only one Ayaah, convey from me, even if it is only one Ayaah. There is no problem of narrating from Bani Israel. Whoever intentionally lies against me then he should take his seat in Hell fire.&#8217; </strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Foolishness of the Khawarij </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">Abul-Abbas Muhammad bin Yaqub bin al-Assm said :</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">&#8216;Two of the khawarij were making Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba and one of them said to his companion : </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">&#8216;No one will enter Paradise from this creation except me and you!&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">His companion said to him :</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">&#8216;The span of Paradise will be like the span of the heavens and the earth, which has only been built for me and you?!!&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">He said : &#8216;Yes!&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">So he replied : &#8216;Then it is only for you!&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">And he left the opinion of the khawarij and became guided. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>20 &#8211; Exiting from the Fire for those who Worshipped Allaah Alone</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">225 – When the believers will have finished from the fire on the Day of Judgment and become secure. Then one of you arguing for the truth, in the Duniya for his companion will not be more intense than the debating of the believers with their Lord, regarding their brothers whom had been entered into the fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: they will say:<strong> Our Lord! These are our brothers they used to pray along with us, and fast along with us, and perform the Hajj along with us, and you have entered them into the fire</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: that Allaah will say: &#8220;go and take out those whom you know.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they will come to them, and they will know them by their faces. The fire would not have eaten their faces. From amongst them there will be, he whom the fire has reached half way up his shins, and he whom the fire has reached to his ankles, and they will take them out.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The believers will say: &#8220;We took out those whom You have commanded to take out.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah will say: &#8220;Take out he who has the weight of a dirham of Emaan in his heart. Then the one who has the weight of half a dirham,&#8217; until He says: He who has an atom’s weight in his heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sa&#8217;eed said: whoever does not believe this, then let him read this Ayaah : &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Surely! Allaah wrongs not even of the weight of an atom, but if there is any good (done), He doubles it, and gives from him a great reward</strong></span>. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said: The Believers will say: &#8220;O our Lord! Indeed we have taken out those whom You have commanded to take out.&#8217; Then there will not remain anyone in the fire who has good in himself.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said: Then Allaah will say: the Angels have interceded, and the Prophets have interceded, and the believers have interceded and The Most Merciful of those who shows mercy remains.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said : Then Allaah will grab a handful from the fire &#8211; or He said : two handfuls &#8211; of people who never did any good for Allaah at all, indeed they will be burnt so much that they will have become charcoal.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said: they will be brought to water, which is said to be called the water of life. It will be poured on them they will sprout out like the seed sprouts after what is left over by the torrential floods, they will come out of their bodies like pearls, and they will have a stamp on their necks, saying: those freed by Allaah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said: it will be said to them: Enter into Paradise, whatever you wish for or anything you see then it is for you, and I have something with Me which is better than that. He said: They will say: Our Lord! What can be better than this?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said: Allaah will say: My being pleased with you, I will never be angry with you.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1661- &#8220;Indeed Allaah Azza wa Jal will take out a people from the fire after nothing remains of them except for their faces and Allaah will enter them into Paradise.&#8221; The hadeeth is in saheeh al-Bukhari (4/463-464) by a different narration on the authority of Abu Sa&#8217;eed in a narration ascribed to the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, and he mentions the whole of the hadeeth of the intercession; and in it, is stated: &#8220;Allaah Ta&#8217;aala will say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Go to those whom you find in their hearts the equivalent to a dinar of Emaan and take them out of the fire, Allaah prohibits the fire from their faces…</strong>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1450 &#8211; &#8220;Take out of the fire whoever has in his heart the equivalent of an atom worth of Emaan.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1451- &#8220;Some people from the people of Tawheed will be punished in the fire, until they will be like charcoal, then mercy will reach them. They will be taken out and thrown at the doors of Paradise. He said: then the people of Paradise will sprinkle water upon them, they will sprout like seeds left over, sprouts after the torrential floods, then they will enter paradise.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>22- The Covenant that Allaah Took from His Slaves</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>172- “Allaah will say to the one who has been punished the least from the people of the Hell-fire on the Day of Judgment: ‘O son of Adam! How have you found your resting place?’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>He will say: ’An evil resting place!’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>It will be said to him: ‘If you had the world and everything in it, would you ransom yourself with it?’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>He will say: Yes.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Allaah will say: You have lied, what I wanted from you was less than that, while you were in the spine (and in another narration: in the back) of Adam, that you do not associate anything with Me, and I will not enter you into the fire, but you refused and committed Shirk. He will be ordered to be taken to the fire.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Regarding this hadeeth:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Regarding His saying: ‘He will say: you have lied.’</strong></span> An-Nawawee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It means: If We returned you to the Duniya, you would not have ransomed it, because you were asked for something easier than that but you refused. This will have the same meaning as in the saying of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">But if they were returned (to the world), they would certainly revert to that which they were forbidden. And indeed they are liars</span> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the meaning of this hadeeth is combined with the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">If they had all that is in the earth, and as much again therewith to ransom themselves thereby</span> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Regarding, His saying: ‘I wanted from you’</strong></span>: i.e. I would have loved from you. When the word ‘Allaah’s Will’ (<strong>al-Irada</strong>) is mentioned in the Sharia&#8217;, it is used in the absolute sense. It means what is general both from the good and the bad, guidance and misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As is mentioned in the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">And whomsoever Allaah wills to guide, He opens his heart to Islaam, and whomsoever He wills to send astray, He makes his heart closed and constricted, as if he is climbing up to the sky</span>. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Will of Allaah (al-Irada) is that which will most definitely happen. Sometimes when this Will of Allaah (al-Irada) is applied it means, that which is the synonym of love and being pleased. As is mentioned in the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"> Allaah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you</span> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is the meaning of the intent of the saying of Allaah Ta’ala in this hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I wanted from you’ i.e. that I loved from you. The Will of Allaah (al-Irada) with this meaning might not happen, since Allaah Tabaraka wa Ta’ala does not force anyone to obey Him, even though He created them because of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">Then whosoever wills, let him believe, and whosoever wills, let him disbelieve</span> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, therefore Allaah Tabarak wa Ta’ala could want from His slave that what Allaah does not love from His slave, and Allaah loves from His slave that which His slave does not want.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim -may Allaah have mercy upon him &#8211; called this Will of Allaah (alIrada) a will of the order of being (al-Irada), taking that from the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">Verily, His Command, when He intends a thing, is only that He says to it, &#8220;Be!&#8221; and it is</span>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He called the other Will (al-Irada) which is a synonym for &#8216;being pleased&#8217;: the Sharia&#8217; Will (al-Irada).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever understands this division, then he has a solution to many of the problems of understanding the issues of <strong>al-Qadaa</strong> (Allaah&#8217;s ordainment of everything in creation) and <strong>al-Qadr</strong> (Allaah&#8217;s Pre-decree for the creation). And he will succeed from the fitna (tribulations) of the stance of those who say that a person does actions under force, or who hold the beliefs of the Mu&#8217;tazilah. The explanation of this can be found in the magnificent book ‘Shifaa’ al-Aleel al-Qadaa wal-Qadr wal-Hikmaah wa Ta’aleel’ by Ibn al-Qayyim -May Allaah have mercy upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Regarding His saying: ‘……. and you were in the spine of Adam.’</strong></span> Qadi Iyaad said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Messenger indicates to the saying of Allaah Ta’ala &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">And (remember) when your Lord brought forth from the Children of Adam, from their loins, their seed (or from Adam&#8217;s loin his offspring)</span>&gt;&gt;, in the Ayaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This covenant was taken from them while they were in the spine of Adam. So, whoever fulfills it after he is brought into this world then he is a believer, and whoever does not fulfill it, is a Kaffir.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the intent of this hadeeth is: I wanted from you when I took the covenant, but you refused so I took you to the Duniya but you committed Shirk.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is mentioned in &#8216;al-Fath&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Dislike of Making a vow</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">478 &#8211; &#8220;<strong>Allaah Azza wa jal said: Making a vow does not earn anything for the son of Adam except that which I have destined for him. Rather, making a vow is something which makes a miserly person give. He comes to Me with that which he would not offer due to his miserliness</strong>. &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration: &#8216;<strong>He offers that which he never offered before</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>From The Fiqh of the hadeeth</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth, with all its different wordings, indicates that it is not legislated to make a vow, rather it is disliked.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The apparent meaning of this prohibition in some of its narrations is that making a vow is haram as some of the scholars have said. However, the saying of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala: &#8220;<strong>Rather, making a vow is something which makes a miserly person give</strong>.&#8221; One feels that this dislike or prohibition is specific to making a vow which is offered to Allaah as a recompense or which is done in exchange for a reward rather than a vow which, from the onset, is done out of obedience to Allaah. This (second type of) vow is purely a means of coming closer to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because the one who is making the (second type of) vow has the correct intent with it, i.e. that he wants to receive an obligatory reward, which is better than the optional reward. This is the vow which is intended &#8211; and Allaah knows best &#8211; with the saying of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala: &lt;&lt;<strong>They fulfil their vows</strong>&gt;&gt; rather than the meaning of the vow which is offered as a recompense to Allaah or which is done in exchange for a reward.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafidh said in &#8216;al- Fath (11/ 5000) that at -Tabari narrated an athar with an authentic chain on the authority of Qatadah who said regarding the saying of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala: &lt;&lt;<strong>They fulfil their vows</strong>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;They would make vows in obedience to Allaah in their prayer and their Fasting, Zakaat, Hajj, Umra and in those things that Allaah had made obligatory upon them. Allaah labelled them as righteous people. It is clear that this praise is not for the making a vow which is offered as a recompense to Allaah.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Before this he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;That Qurtubi mentioned in his book &#8216;al- Mufhim&#8217;, that the prohibition in the hadeeth regarding the vow was that vow offered as a reward to Allaah, and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>An example of this prohibition is to say for instance, “If Allaah cures me from my illness then I will give such and such in charity.” The point of objection here is when the goal of coming closer to Allaah is given a condition, this then makes it clear that the action was not done with the pure intention of coming closer to Allaah Ta&#8217;ala rather he did it in exchange for recompense.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>What shows us this is that if he was not cured -from his illness- then he would not give charity. So he attached the act of giving charity to (Allaah) curing him. This is the condition of the miserly person. Surely he does not give anything from his wealth unless he has a quick, increased return on what he gave.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the meaning which is referred to in the hadeeth when the Messenger of Allaah said &#8220;Making a vow is something which extracts from a miserly person, that which a miserly person would not give&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Sometimes what is added to this ignorant belief is the idea that a vow means that the goal will be achieved or that Allaah gives him this goal due to this vow.</strong></span> This is also indicated in the hadeeth: &#8220;Without doubt, a vow cannot repel whatever Allaah has destined&#8221;. The first situation is close to disbelief and the second is a clear mistake.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al- Hafidh said: &#8220;I say: rather that the second type is also close to disbelief.&#8221; Then he brings a quote from al-Qurtubi in which the scholars regarded the prohibition mentioned in the narration is understood to be of disapproval. Then he says: &#8220;what is apparent to me is that, it is held to be prohibited for the one whom you fear has corrupt belief. Therefore it would be haram for this person to make this vow, and it would be regarded as disapproval for the one who does not have that corrupted belief.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a good explanation and what supports this is the story of Ibn Umar, who is the narrator of the hadeeth regarding the prohibition of vows, since they are vows offered as recompense.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: what he intends by this <strong>story</strong> is what has been narrated by Hakim (4/304) by way of Faleeh bin Sulayman on the authority of Sa&#8217;eed bin Harith that he heard Abdullaah bin Umar when he was asked by a man called Mas&#8217;ood bin &#8216;Amr, from the tribe of Bani Ka&#8217;b, say: o Abu Abdur Rahman my son was in the lands of the Persians, from those who were with Umar bin UbaydAllaah in Basra. There fell a severe plague, so when this reached me I made a vow that if Allaah brought my son to me I would walk to the ka&#8217;ba. My son came, but he was sick and died, so what do you think? &#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Umar said: Were we not prohibited from making vows?! Certainly the Messenger of Allaah -alayhis-sallat wa sallam- said; &#8220;A vow doesn&#8217;t bring anything forward nor does it delay anything, rather it takes something out of a miserly person.&#8221; Fulfil your vow.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>So, summing up, there is a warning in this hadeeth for the Muslim not to approach a vow which is offered as a reward. Therefore it is for the people to know this so that they do not fall into this prohibition whilst they thought that they were acquiring good by their deeds!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his Family, his Companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Giving the Kaffir the glad-tidings of the Hellfire and Passing by the Places where the Mushrikeen Where Destroyed</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>18- &#8216;When ever you pass by the grave of a kaffir then give him the glad tidings of the Hellfire.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Origin Of the hadeeth</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;A Bedouin came to the Prophet and said: ‘My father used to keep good relations with his relatives and he used to do such and such good deeds so where is he?” He -sall&#8217;Allaahu alayhi wa sallam- said &#8216;in the fire&#8217;: It was as if the Bedouin was upset due to this, so he said, “O Messenger of Allaah, then where is your father?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8216;Whenever you pass by the grave of a kaffir then give him the glad tidings of the Hellfire.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Bedouin accepted Islaam and he said; the Messenger of Allaah -sall&#8217;Allaahu alayhi wa sallam- gave me the responsibility of a task; I did not pass by a grave of a kaffir except that I gave him the glad tidings of the Hellfire.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>From the understanding of the hadeeth</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a great benefit in this hadeeth which many of the general books of fiqh have neglected which is none other than the legislation of giving the kaffir the glad tidings of the Hellfire if you pass by his grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is in this legislation is not hidden, since it contains that which awakens the believer and reminds him of the danger of the sin of the kaffir, who has committed a great sin which would make all of the sins of the world facing him seem like nothing if they were all gathered together. The sin is disbelief in Allaah Azza wa Jal and committing shirk with him, which Allaah Ta&#8217;ala explained His severe hatred of such that He excludes shirk from His forgiveness. He says</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong>Verily, Allaah forgives not that partners should be set up with him in worship, but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He pleases</strong> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; said; &#8216;That the biggest of the major sins is that you associate a partner to Allaah while He is the One who created you.&#8217; [Agreed upon.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Without doubt ignorance about this benefit is what leads some Muslims to fall into that which is contrary to what Allaah, the Most Wise, intends by this benefit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>With certainty we know that many of the Muslims come to the lands of the kuffar to take care of some of their general or specific interests. However, they do not suffice themselves with just this, rather they intend to visit some of the graves of those who are called great men from amongst the kuffar. They place flowers and wreaths and they stand in front of those graves with humility and sadness which indicates being pleased with those in the graves and not having a detest for them. </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They do this even though the best example i.e. that of the Prophets &#8211; alayhim assalam &#8211; dictates the opposite of what they do, as is mentioned in this authentic hadeeth. Listen to the statement of Allaah Azza wa Jal:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong>Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibraheem and those with him, when they said to their people: Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allaah, we have rejected you, and there has started between us and you, hostility and hatred for ever &gt;&gt;</strong> the Ayaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is their stance against those who were alive, so what about those are dead!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhaaree (2/120) and Muslim (8/221) narrate on the authority of Ibn Umar that the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam said to them when he passed by Hijr (a place where the people had been destroyed):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8216;Do not enter upon these people who were punished, except that you cry, and if you do not cry then do not enter upon them, so what afflicted them does not afflict you.&#8217; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah 19</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[He veiled his face with is garment while he was on his mount]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad narrated this and the extra wording is from his book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sadeeq Hasan Khan mentioned a heading for this hadeeth in his book &#8216;Nazl alAbraar&#8217; p.293, which is; &#8216;Chapter : crying and fear while passing by the graves of the oppressors and the place where they were destroyed, and showing the need of going back to Allaah Ta&#8217;ala and warning against being neglectful about this.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah Ta&#8217;ala to give us the understanding of our Deen and inspire us to perform actions according to it. Indeed He is the One who hears and answers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;There is no obedience due to anyone in disobedience to Allaah Tabarak wa Ta&#8217;aala.&#8221;</strong> [Silsilah Saheehah: 179]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;There is no obedience in disobedience to Allaah Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;aala.&#8221;</strong> [Silsilah Saheehah: 180 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;There is no obedience to mankind in disobedience to Allaah, indeed obedience is in goodness.</strong>&#8220;[Silsilah Saheehah: 181]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The reason for this hadeeth:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah- sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – dispatched an army, and he commanded a man to lead them, who lit a fire, and the man said to the army: enter into the fire. The people wanted to enter into the fire, but some of them said : verily we have just fled from the fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was mentioned to the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – and he said to those who wanted to enter into it: if you entered it you would have remained in it until the Day of Judgment, and he said a good word to the others, and he said…..(the above hadeeth).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The extra wording in the hadeeth is from Tayyalisee and the context is by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration by him where he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – dispatched a battalion and ordered a man from the Ansaar to lead them, and he ordered them to listen to him and obey him. They caused this man to get angry, so he said to them: Gather some firewood for me, so they gathered it for him. Then he said: light the fire and they lit the fire, then he said to them: Did not the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – order you to listen and to obey me? They said Yes, of course.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said &#8211; enter in to the fire!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they started to look at each other, and said (and in another narration: a young boy said to them) : indeed we fled to the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – from the fire, [ do not be hasty, until you meet the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – and if he orders you to enter it, then enter into it ], so this is what they did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man&#8217;s anger came down/subsided, and the fire was put out. When they returned to the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – and mentioned it to him, he said: if you had entered it, you would never have exited from it, <strong>indeed obedience is in goodness</strong>.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhari (8/47, 13/109), Muslim (6/16), Ahmad (1/82, 134) and other narrations which contain the extra wording is also by Ahmad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth has many benefits, the most important of which is the impermissibility of obedience to anyone, if it is disobedience to Allaah Tabarak wa Ta&#8217;aala, whether it is the leaders, scholars and the shaykhs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from this hadeeth you get to know the misguidance of different groups of people;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The first:</strong></span> some of the soofis who obey their shaykhs, even if they command them to commit sins, using as a proof, that they in reality are not committing sins. Also that the shaykh sees that which the follower does not see.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I know a shaykh from amongst these people who appointed himself as a leader. He mentioned a story to his followers in some of his lessons in the masjid, the summary of which is, one of the Soofi shaykhs ordered one of his followers that during the night he should go to his father and kill him while he is in his bed next to his wife! So when he killed him, he returned to the shaykh, happily having carried out the command of the shaykh! The shaykh looked at him and said: Do you think that you have really killed your father? Rather he is your mother&#8217;s boyfriend! As for your father he is away!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he makes and presents a Sharia&#8217; ruling, as he claims, from his story, and he says to his followers : If a shaykh orders his follower with a ruling which is apparently against the Sharia&#8217;, it is upon the followers to obey him in this, then he said: Do you not see this shaykh, he apparently orders the boy to kill his father, however in reality he ordered him to kill the one who fornicated with his mother, and that person deserved to be killed!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The falsity of this story is not hidden according to the Sharia&#8217; from many angles:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Firstly</strong></span>: Carrying out the punishment is not the right of the shaykh, no matter how important he is; rather it is from the right of the leader or the one in charge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Secondly</strong> </span>: if the case was that this actually took place, then why did he only carry out the punishment on the man and not the woman, and they both fornicated?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Thirdly</strong></span>: the Sharia&#8217; ruling for the married adulterer is to be stoned to death, and the person is not killed except by stoning. From this it is clear that the shaykh has opposed the Sharia&#8217; from many angles, this is also the situation with the follower who based upon this previous story, made it incumbent upon the Muslims to be obedient to the shaykh, to the extent one of them said to the people: if you see the shaykh and he is wearing a cross around his neck, then it is not allowed to criticize him!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With all the clarity of the absurdity of these stories, and their opposition together to the Sharia&#8217; and to the intellect, we find some people become deceived by these stories, and amongst them some of the cultured youth. A discussion took place between me and one of those youths about that story, and he had heard it from that follower of the shaykh, and what the shaykh had based his ruling upon. However, the discussion with him did not bring about any benefit. He persisted in believing this story, since according to his claim, it was a miracle, and he added: you people reject miracles!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when I said to him: If your shaykh orders you to kill your father, would you do it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: Indeed, I have not reached that level yet!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after this can anyone be blamed for characterizing the religion of these shaykhs except that they are the opium of the people?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second group is:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The blind followers who prefer to follow the statements of the Madhab above the statement of the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam with what is clearly taken from the statements of the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam. So if it is said to one of them, for example: <strong>do not pray the Sunnah of the Fajr prayer after the obligatory prayer has begun</strong>, due to the prohibition of the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – from doing so, which is clear, they do not obey, and they say the Madhab allows this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is said to them: <strong>the Nikah at-Tahleel</strong> ( whereby another man marries the divorced woman and then divorces so that she can be allowed to marry her first husband) is invalid, because the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – cursed the one who does this. They would answer by saying: No, but it is permissible according to such and such Madhab!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are hundreds of issues like this, and this is why many of the scholars held the opinion that the saying of Allaah Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala about the Christians: &lt;&lt; <strong>They took their rabbis and their monks to be their lords besides Allaah</strong> &gt;&gt; applies to these blind followers, as Fahkr ar-Razi has explained in his Tafseer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Daesh (in Arabic) are the initials for &#8216;Dawla al-Iraq wa Shaam al-Islaami. [Islamic state of Iraq and Shaam(1) &amp; in English termed as ISIS (2)] (3)</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">They do not know anything of Islaam except for the word &#8216;Islaam&#8217;, they are the most ignorant about Islaam.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">This misguided sect came from the Khawarij [4] al-Qa&#8217;ida movement, the grandchildren of Abdurahman bin Muljam. [The evil dog who assassinated Ali RadhiAllaahu anhu]</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The al-Qa&#8217;ida movement was the mother whilst Daesh and Jabha an-Nusrah are the children.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The children (ISIS) have begun making Takfeer [5] of each other and killing each other as was the condition of their forefathers , the Najdaat and the Azaariqa who made Takfeer of each other and killed each other.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">So the children (ISIS) repeated the history of their fathers in making Takfeer, treachery and cheating. Moreover the children &#8211; meaning Daesh &#8211; have even more extreme exaggeration than their forefathers.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Khawarij of old used to make Takfeer of those who committed major sins. As for Daesh and those similar to them make Takfeer of both, those who commit major and minor sins!!!</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">When they make Takfeer of one of the Muslims <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/27a1.png" alt="➡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> they &#8216;declare his blood, wealth and honour lawfully to be taken.&#8217;</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>I have been informed from the trustworthy people of Shaam</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That if Daesh make Takfeer of someone:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; they carry out capital punishment for apostasy by being shot to death.<br />
&#8211; they take his wealth as spoils of war for the stockpile reserves for the Muslims.<br />
&#8211; they take the women folk of Shaam as slaves and they carry out lewd acts on them, with the argument that these women are what the right hand possess.<br />
&#8211; it has also been affirmed that they carry out pedophilia with the children of the Muslims and refuge with Allaah is sought.</p>
<p>they are filthier than the Jews and Christians and more defiled than the saliva of dogs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Khawarij swear allegiance with the Shia against the people of Sunnah</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; when the Khawarij rebelled against the rightly guided Khalifa Uthmaan bin Affan &#8211; RadhiAllaahu anhu &#8211; there was with them Abdullaah bin Saba a senior from the Shia and along with some of those people who came from the land of Yemen, they entered along with the Khawarij and killed Uthmaan -RadhiAllaahu anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Today this is Daesh which takes oaths of allegiance with the Shia Nusayreeya</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; they fight against the people of Sunnah in the land of Shaam; they have no mercy upon the young, or old, or those of intellect, nor the insane, or a woman or a baby.<br />
&#8211; they display the dead bodies of the Muslims and set fire to them.<br />
&#8211; the Hadeeth mentions: &#8216;The Prophet &#8211; alayhi salat wa sallam &#8211; prohibited mutilation and displaying the dead body.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; it is affirmed from the Messenger &#8211; alayhi salat wa sallam:<br />
ً أوصاه بتقوى الله وقال لھم اغزوا ولا تغدروا ولا تمثلوا ولا تقتلوا امرأة )<br />
أنھ إذا أمر أمیرا<br />
ً<br />
ً ولا صبیا<br />
(&#8230;ولا شیخا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;When he would appoint a leader, he would advise him with having Taqwa of Allaah. He would say to them go to battle, do not be treacherous, do not mutilate and display the body, do not kill a woman, old person nor a child.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Khawarij hate the leaders of the Muslims and they make Takfeer of them:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; the Khawarij were not pleased with the authority of the Amir al &#8211; Mumineen Ali bin Abi Talib -RadhiAllaahu anhu.<br />
&#8211; they broke their oath of allegiance. . . and they made Takfeer of him and those who were with him. . . .<br />
&#8211; they waged war against him and they killed him treacherously when he came out to pray the Fajr prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> This is Daesh</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; &#8216;they make Takfeer of the rulers of the Muslims.&#8217;<br />
&#8211; &#8216;they make their blood lawful to take.&#8217;<br />
&#8211; &#8216;rather they make Takfeer of everyone who opposes them from the Muslims.&#8217;<br />
&#8211; &#8216;they wish to remove the Islaamic countries, because they do not view them as Islaamic countries, rather they view them as countries of disbelief. This was the &#8216;Aqeedah of the destructive Sayed Qutb, a leader of the Takfeeris (those who excommunicate Muslims) of the modern times.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"> The Messenger of Allaah &#8211; alayhi salat wa sallam &#8211; said:<br />
(یقتلون أھل الإسلام ویتركون أھل الأوثان)<br />
&#8216;They kill the people of Islaam and leave off the people who worship idols.&#8217;</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The forces of Daesh try to wipe out the Muslims in the country of Shaam whilst the Muslims say La ilaha illa Allaah.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Just like the forefathers of Daesh did so when they killed the Muslims in Basara; they killed Abdullaah bin Khabbab bin al-Araat [6] and threw him in a river. Then they cut open his wife&#8217;s belly and took out the baby and threw him in the river as well.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">They would cut off the highways in Basra, kill the Muslim and let go the Christian.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah &#8211; alayhi salat wa sallam &#8211; said :<br />
(لزوال الدنیا أھون عند الله من قتل مسلم بغیر حق)<br />
&#8216;The whole of the Dunyaa being destroyed is lesser to Allaah than unlawfully killing a Muslim.&#8217;</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Daesh forces:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">○ The Daesh forces consist of a number of nationalities from different countries, from them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; the people of Morocco, they are the extremist of the people in excessively making Takfeer.<br />
&#8211; the people from Iraq and they are those who carry out killings, looting, plundering and crucifixion.<br />
&#8211; those from the people of the Arabian Gulf carry out suicide operations.<br />
&#8211; those from Chechneya are war commanders in Daesh.<br />
&#8211; those from the people of Sham from the Baith party are spies and traitors. They inform Daesh of the homes of Syrians so they can kill them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is some of what I have heard about this misguided sect, dogs of the Hell fire. I ask Allaah Ta&#8217;ala to hasten their destruction.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1 – The Hadeeth</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaddad bin Aws <em>–</em><em>Radhi Allaahu anhu</em><em>–</em> said that the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>said to me:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O Shaddad bin Aws! If you see the people amassing gold and silver then say these statements a lot:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْأَلُكَ الثَّبَاتَ فِي الْأَمْرِ، وَالْعَزِيمَةَ عَلَى الرُّشْدِ، وَأَسْأَلُكَ مُوجِبَاتِ رَحْمَتِكَ، وَعَزَائِمَ مَغْفِرَتِكَ، وَأَسْأَلُكَ شُكْرَ نِعْمَتِكَ، وَحُسْنَ عِبَادَتِكَ، وَأَسْأَلُكَ قَلْبَاً سَلِيمَاً، وَلِسَانَاً صَادِقَاً، وَأَسْأَلُكَ مِنْ خَيْرِ مَا تَعْلَمُ، وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ مَا تَعْلَمُ، وَأَسْتَغْفِرُكَ لِمَا تَعْلَمُ، إِنَّكَ أنْتَ عَلاَّمُ الْغُيُوبِ</p>
<p>‘O Allaah verily I ask of You for strength of perseverance of obedience on the Deen<a name="_ftnref1"></a>[1], and determination in practicing of the Deen and goodness.  And I ask of You for that which obligates Your mercy and resolutions for Your forgiveness.</p>
<p>And I ask of You for the capability to be thankful for Your blessings and to worship you in a correct and good way.</p>
<p>And I ask of You for a heart which is purified in belief<a name="_ftnref2"></a>[2] and free from desires and a truthful tongue.</p>
<p>And ask of You for the best of what You know, and I seek refuge with You from the evil of what You know and I seek forgiveness for that which You know.</p>
<p>Indeed You are the One who knows the unseen.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2 – Transliteration</strong></p>
<p>‘Allaahumma innee as-alooka ath-Thabat fil Amr Wal azzeemata ala Rushd, wa as-alooka Moojeebat Rahmatik, wa Azzaim Maghfiratik, wa as-alooka Shukr Na’maatik,  Wa husn ibadaatika, wa as-alooka Qalbun Saleeeman wa Lisaanan Saddiqun, as-Alooka min khairi ma Ta’lamu wa Audhubika min Sharee ma Ta’lamu, wa astaghfiruka lima Ta’lum, Innaka Anta Alam al- Ghayoob.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3 – Tahkreej:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Tabraani in ‘Mu’ajam al-Kabeer’ (7/335-336), Abu Na’eem in ‘al-Hileeyah’ (1/266), Ibn Aasakir in ‘Tareekh Damishk’. Albaani said this Isnaad is Jayyid, in ‘Silsilah Saheehah’ No. 3228.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad &amp; an-Nisaee, from ‘Silsilah Saheehah’ No. 3228. Shaykh Albaani originally declared it to be weak in ‘Tammam al-Mina’ p.225, ‘Kalima Tayyib’ 105 and ‘Da’eef al-Jamia’ 1190 then he declared it to be Saheeh lighayrihi in ‘Silsilah Saheehah’ No. 3228 and ‘Taleeqat al-Hasaan’ 931,’al-Mishkat’ 955.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shawkani mentioned it in ‘Nail Awtaar’ 92/332 and said the narrators of its chain are trustworthy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4 – Different Wordings:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 – In another narration the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> used to teach us to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْأَلُكَ الثَّبَاتَ فِي الْأَمْرِ ، وَأَسْأَلُكَ عَزِيمَةَ الرُّشْدِ ، وَأَسْأَلُكَ شُكْرَ نِعْمَتِكَ ، وَحُسْنَ عِبَادَتِكَ ، وَأَسْأَلُكَ لِسَانًا صَادِقًا ، وَقَلْبًا سَلِيمًا ، وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ مَا تَعْلَمُ ، وَأَسْأَلُكَ مِنْ خَيْرِ مَا تَعْلَمُ ، وَأَسْتَغْفِرُكَ مِمَّا تَعْلَمُ إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ عَلَّامُ الْغُيُوبِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – As for the wording: ‘If the people gather gold and silver, then gather this Dua’. . . . . ‘ then this is from the wording of the Hadeeth collected by Imam Ahmad whereby Shaddad <em>–</em><em>Radhi Allaahu anhu</em><em>–</em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">سمعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يقول إذا كنز الناس الذهب والفضة فاكنزوا هؤلاء الكلمات</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If the people gather gold and silver, then gather these words. . . . .’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ Collected by Tabraani in ‘Mu’ajam al-Kabeer’, Abu Na’eem in ‘al-Hileeyah’ Ibn Aasakir in ‘Tareekh Damishk’. Albaani said it is Saheeh lighayrihi in ‘Silsilah Saheehah’ and  ‘Taleeqat al-Hasaan’ No. 93. ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – It has also been collected with similar wordings, as for it being from the Dua’ said in the prayer then this has been collected by Nisa’ee in his ‘Sunnan’ with the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم كان يقول في صلاته…)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>  used to say in his prayer. .  .’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also narrated ibn Hibban in ‘Saheeh ibn Hibban’ Also narrated by Ahmad with extra wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وكان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يعلمنا كلمات ندعو بهن في صلاتنا أو قال في دبرصلاتنا.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> used to teach us statements with which we make Dua’ in our prayer or he said at the end of the prayer.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>5 – Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Explanation by Shaykh Muhammad bin AbdurRahmaan al-Mubarakfoori (d. 1353 A.H.)  in the explanation of Tirmidhi, ‘Tufhat ul-Ahwaadhi’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>‘and determination in conduct’</em> – which is seriousness and determination in being correct whereby a person implements all that which is correct from his matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>‘Conduct and being correct’:</em> is righteousness,  success and correctness.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the narration of Ahmad: <em>‘I ask of You for strength of perseverance on the Deen and determination in conduct.’</em> Meaning:  having a resolve with the heart upon accomplishment of the matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>‘And I ask of You to be able to be thankful for Your blessings’</em>: meaning to have the ability to be thankful for Your blessings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>‘And to worship you in a correct and good way.’</em> meaning: for the worship to take place in a good accepted way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>‘And I ask You for a truthful tongue’</em> meaning: protected from lying.<br />
<em>‘and for a heart which is correct in Aqeedah’</em> meaning: secure from corrupt beliefs and secure from desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>‘and I seek refuge with You From the evil of what You know’</em> meaning: that which You know and I do not know of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>‘and I seek forgiveness for that which You know’</em> of me, of my negligence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>‘Indeed You are the One who knows the unseen’</em> meaning : the hidden things which do not occur from the outset except with the knowledge of The Gentle One and the well informed.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Tuhfatul Ahwaathi’ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>6 – Benefits</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the slave of Allaah being complete then that is with adhering to the truth and being upright upon it and having a firm resolve. Therefore, whoever does not have a firm resolve then he is deficient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever has a firm resolve but does not adhere to the truth and is not upright upon it then he is deficient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if adhering to the truth and being upright upon it is coupled with having a firm resolve then the fruits of every noble status and perfect condition occur.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why in the Prophet’s Dua’ which has been narrated by Imam Ahmad and Ibn Hibban in his book ‘Saheeh’ there occurs : ‘O Allaah verily I ask of You for strength of perseverance of obedience on the Deen, and determination in practicing of the Deen and goodness. ‘ and it is known that the tree of strength of perseverance does not stand except upon the tree trunk of patience.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Tareeq al-Hijratayn p.400-401]</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Shaykh Ibn Baz advised with memorizing this Dua’ and he said:</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If you see the people amassing gold and silver then amass this Dua’.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>سُبْحَانَكَ اللَّهُمَّ وبَحَمْدكَ</em> أشْهدُ أنْ لا إلهَ إلا أنْتَ <em>أَسْتَغْفِرُكَ وأتُوبُ إِلَيْكَ</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Similar to this is what is mentioned in the Hadeeth of Umm Salamah <em>–</em><em>Radhi Allaahu anha</em><em>–</em> who said: ‘The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> used to say this Dua’ a lot : ‘O Turner of hearts, turn my heart to be upon Your obedience.’ She said: I mentioned to the Messenger of Allaah: ‘You  make a lot of supplication with this Dua, do not the hearts go back and fro?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger said: ‘Yes, there is no heart except that it is between the two Fingers from the Fingers of Ar-Rahmaan (The Most Merciful) He turns them whichever way He wants, if He wants He makes it steadfast and if He wants He causes it to deviate.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Tirmidhi &amp; authenticated by Albaani]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Allaah Ta’ala said: &lt;&lt; The Day whereon neither wealth nor sons will avail,<strong> </strong>except him who brings to Allaah a clean heart [clean from <em>Shirk</em> (polytheism) and <em>Nifâq</em> (hypocrisy)].&gt;&gt; [Shu’ara: 88-89]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From an-Num’an bin Basheer, who said : I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>say :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘. . . . .Truly in the body there is a morsel of flesh which, if it be whole, all the body is whole and which, if it be diseased, all of it is diseased. Truly it is the heart.’ [ Bukhari and Muslim]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">by Shaykh Allaama Muhammad bin Salih al-Uthaymeen (d.1421 A.H.)<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Getting married with the intention of divorce is <em>Haraam</em> because it is cheating the wife and her family</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Esteemed Shaykh Muhammad bin Salih al-Uthaymeen may Allaah have mercy upon him was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">A person wanted to travel outside this country because he had been delegated to do so, and he wanted to protect himself by getting married from that country for a specific time, then after that he will divorce this wife, he would have married her without informing her that he will divorce her, so what is the verdict regarding his action?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Shaykh answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This marriage with the intention of divorce is of two situations: either he makes it a condition in the contract, that he marries her for a month or a year, or until he completes his studies, then this is a marriage of <em>Muta’</em> (temporary marriage) and this is <em>Haraam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or either, he intends that without making it a condition, so what is well-known from the <em>Madhab</em> of the Hanabila, that this is <em>Haraam</em>, and that the marriage contract is invalid because they say that the one who makes this intention is similar to the one who makes a condition (i.e. specific period of time), due to the saying of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed actions are but by intentions and indeed every person will have what they intended.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a man marries a woman from someone who has pronounced a divorce from her three times, and he marries her to make her <em>Halaal</em> for her previous husband so he can re-marry her, and then he divorces for this reason then this type of  <em>Nikah</em> (Marriage contract) is invalid, even if this <em>Nikah</em> was without the condition of divorcing her, since the one who makes the intention of doing this is like the one who makes it a condition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, if getting married with the intention of making the wife permissible for her previous husband invalidates the marriage contract then the intention of <em>Muta’</em> also invalidates the marriage contract,  this is the opinion of the Hanabila.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second opinion of the people of knowledge regarding this issue is: that it is correct for a man to marry a woman and he has the intention to divorce her, if he leaves that  country, like those foreigners who go abroad for education, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their reasoning is that the man has not made a condition (of a specific period of time), and the difference between this and <em>Muta’</em> is, that in <em>Muta’</em> if the time period finishes then a separation takes place between the husband and wife, whether the husband likes it or not, this is contradictory to the other way, since it is possible for him to want and have interest in the wife and she continues to remain with him, and this is one of the two sayings of Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What I say is, that this is correct, it is not <em>Muta’</em> since the definition of <em>Muta’</em> (temporary marriage) cannot be applied to this, but marriage with the intention of divorce is <em>Haraam</em> from the angle that it is cheating the wife and her family.   Indeed the Prophet has made cheating and deception  <em>Haraam</em>, and if the wife came to know that this man did not want to marry her except for this period of time, she would not have married him, and her family would also not marry her to him since the man would not allow his daughter to marry a person who has the intention of divorcing her when he has finished with his need from her, so how can this man allow for himself to deal with others with that which he does not allow for them to deal with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This contradicts <em>Eemaan</em>, due to the saying of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘None of you truly believe until you love for your brother what you love for yourself.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since I have heard that some people have taken this verdict as a means which leads to a matter that no-one holds permissible which is that some people travel to countries only to get married (temporarily). They go to these countries so they can get married and then they stay with this wife, whom they marry with the intention of a temporary period, then they return however long Allaah wills.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is also seriously forbidden in this issue, so it is better to close this door, due to what is there from cheating, deception and dishonesty and because this opens the door and the people are ignorant, and most people are not prevented due to following their desires, transgressing against what Allaah has made <em>Haraam</em>.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Compiled &amp; Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Hadeeth</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Abu Hurairah who said the Messenger of Allaah<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>-SallAllaahu alayhi wa Sallam-</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">صنفان من أهل النار لم أرهما قوم معهم سياط كأذناب البقر يضربون بها الناس ونساء كاسيات عاريات مميلات مائلات رءوسهن كأسنمة البخت المائلة لا يدخلن الجنة ولا يجدن ريحها وإن ريحها ليوجد من مسيرة كذا وكذا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There are two types of the people of the Hell-Fire who I have not seen, a people who have whips like cows’ tails with which they are hitting the people, and women who will be naked in spite of being dressed, who are seduced (to wrong paths) and seduce others, their heads will be high like a camel with humps they will not enter Paradise, nor will they find its fragrance, even though its fragrance can be found from travelling such and such distance.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Imam Ahmad in ‘al-Musnad’ &amp; Muslim in ‘as-Saheeh’]<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Allaama, Muhadith</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Muhammad Nasir Deen al-Albaani<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></strong><strong>– May Allaah have mercy upon him.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Questioner:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">‘What is the ruling of a woman gathering her hair above her neck at the back of the head whereby it is shaped like a ball, taking into consideration that when a woman covers herself with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Hijaab</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>the shape of her hair would be apparent from her<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Hijaab</em>?’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Albaani said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This is a mistake many women who wear<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Hijaab</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>fall into, whereby they gather their hair at the back of the head and it bulges out from the back of their head, even though they have covered it with covering<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Hijaab</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>over it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed this opposes a condition from the conditions of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Hijaab</em>, which I had gathered in my book ‘<em>Hijaab Al-Marata Al-Muslimah min Al-Kitab wa Sunnah</em>‘. From these conditions is that the clothing should not show the shape of the limb or anything from the woman’s body,  this is why it is not permissible for a woman to put her hair in a circular shape at the back of her head or at the side of her head whereby it bulges out, so that it appears to the one who sees her, even unintentionally that she has shaggy hair or that she has little hair.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory that it is left hanging and not piled up/crumpled up.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From the cassette collection ‘Silsilah al-Huda wa Noor’ No.386, see<a href="http://albanyimam.com/play.php?catsmktba=13094" rel="nofollow">http://albanyimam.com/play.php?catsmktba=13094</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Ruling of  a Woman Winding up her Hair at the Top of her head</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Allaama</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Muhammad bin Salih al-Uthaymeen – May Allaah have mercy upon him.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">‘Some women gather their hair in the shape of a bun at the back of the head,  does this enter into the warning mentioned in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Hadeeth</em>: ‘Women whose  heads will be like the inclined hump of a camel they will not enter Paradise’.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Uthaymeen said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If a woman gathers her hair for when she is busy working away, then afterwards she lets it down,  then there is no harm in this, since she does not do this as an adornment or beautification but rather out of necessity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for gathering her hair and raising it up for the purpose of beautification, and it is facing upwards then it enters under the prohibition, due to the saying of the Prophet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>-sallAllahu alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Their heads will be like the hump of a camel.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A camel hump is at the top, and if the hair is above the neck then it does not enter under the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Hadeeth</em>. However, it is warned against doing so if a woman wants to go out to the market, since if she goes out to the market and gathers her hair on her head then it will appear from within her<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Abaya</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>(outer garment), and it will cause attention, so she is prohibited from having this hair-style if she goes out to the market places.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The discussion highlighted in this research paper is a discussion of the ruling of cutting the beard after a fistful. The researcher has brought the evidence, research and argument from those who hold it to be permissible, and a presentation of the overwhelming proofs and evidences. This is not a comparative research of both opinions, being permissible and impermissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Compiled &amp; Translated  by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2.</strong> A Summary of the Evidences for Cutting the Beard after the Fist</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A – Hadeeth of Bukhari from Nafa’ from Ibn Umar from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">خالِفُوا المُشْرِكينَ؛ وَفِّرُوا اللِّحَى، وَأَحْفُوا الشَّوَارِبَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Differ from the Mushrikoon, grow the beard and trim the moustache.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Umar used to, if he performed Hajj or Umrah hold his beard in a fist and cut whatever was extra.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">B – Hadeeth of Muslim from Abu Hurairah from the Prophet:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">جزوا الشوارب وأرخوا اللحى</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Trim the moustache and grow the beard.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">C – Abu Zura’a bin Jareer said: ‘Abu Hurairah would take a hold of his beard, and whatever was under his fist he would cut it.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">D – Many narrations of the Salaf &amp; their understanding</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong><strong>3. </strong>Principles For Understanding Ahadeeth</h2>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Principle 1</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Adhering to general texts which have not been implemented or acted upon is not from the <em>Fiqh</em> of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Nasiruddeen Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Adhering to general texts which have not been acted upon, is not from the <em>Fiqh</em> (understanding) of the Salaf. Indeed every <em>Bida’</em> which some people regard as being good, is generally taken from a general evidence.’[3]</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Principle 2</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Companion is more knowledgeable about what he narrates than anyone else</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘A Companion is more knowledgeable about what he narrators than anyone else</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If a Companion narrates a Hadeeth and he himself explains it, or understood its meaning in a certain way from the different meanings then it is appropriate to agree according to what that Companion held the opinion of, from the meanings of that Hadeeth because he himself is the narrator of the Hadeeth, and a narrator is more knowledgeable about what he narrators than anyone else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If two Companions differed and one of them was the narrator of the Hadeeth then he is given precedence above the other Companion, because the Companion who narrated the Hadeeth was more knowledgeable of what he narrated than the other Companion.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Sam’aani said in ‘Qawatta’ al-Adilla’ (1/190):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the explanation of a narrator for one of the two possibilities of a meaning of a narration then the narrator is an assured confirmation of the explanation of that narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like what was narrated by Ibn Umar that two people in a transaction have the choice (to accept or reject) the transaction as long as they do not step away from each other.’ Ibn Umar explained it to mean as long as they physically step away and not verbally separate, so his explanation is foremost, because he indeed witnessed the statement of the Messenger  and knew its intent and his explanation is of the same status as conveying the intent of the Hadeeth.’[4]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong><strong>4. </strong>Research of Shaykh Albaani</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Research One</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani commented in his research in ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth Da’eefah’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Know that there it is not established in an authentic Hadeeth from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> of taking from the beard not in a saying of his or in an action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yes this action is affirmed from some of the Salaf, here are some of them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 – From Marwan bin Salim al-Muqfa’ who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I saw Ibn Umar grab a hold of his beard and cut what was more than a fistful.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Abu Dawood and others with a Hasan Isnad; as I have explained in Irwaa no. 920 &amp; Saheeh Abi Dawood no. 2041]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – From Nafa’: that if Abdullaah bin Umar would finish from Ramadan and intended to go on to Hajj, he would not cut any of his hair nor his beard until Hajj.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration: that if Abdullaah bin Umar would shave his head in Hajj or Umrah he would take from his beard and his moustache.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Malik in ‘Muwatta’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khalaal narrates in ‘Tarrajjal’ with an authentic chain from Mujahid who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I saw Ibn Umar grab his beard on Yawm an-Nahr (11th of Dhul Hijjah), then he said to the Barber: take from that which is below a fistful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Baji said in ‘Sharh al-Muwatta’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘He means that he would want to cut from his beard and get his head shaved, and Malik <em>-Rahimullaah-</em>would hold that to be recommended because taking from the beard in this form does not change his innate character of beauty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – From Ibn Abbas that he said about the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; let them complete the prescribed duties (Manasik of Hajj) for them&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At-Tafath (prescribed duties): Shaving the head, taking from the moustache, plucking armpit hair, shaving pubic hair, trimming fingernails, taking from the sides of the face,  (and in another narration: The beard), stoning the Jamaraat, staying in Arafaah and Muzdalifah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ibn Abi Shaybah &amp; Ibn Jareer in ‘Tafseer’ with an authentic chain.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – From Muhammad bin Ka’ab al-Qurtubi that he used to say about this Ayaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Then let them complete the prescribed duties (Manasik of Hajj) for them&gt;&gt;, he mentioned similar things, one before the other, and in it occurs: and taking from the moustache and the beard.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Also Collected by Ibn Jareer and its Isnaad is Saheeh or at the least it is Hasan.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 – From Mujahid similarly with the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘….and cutting the moustache and cutting the beard.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ibn Jareer also with an authentic Sanad.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – From al-Muharibi (AbdurRahman bin Muhammad) who said I heard a man ask Ibn Juraij about the saying of Allaah: &lt;&lt; Then let them complete the prescribed duties (Manasik of Hajj) for them&gt;&gt; he said: ‘It is taking from the beard and from the moustache.  . .’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 – Also in ‘Muwatta’ that it reached him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that if Salim bin Abdullaah wanted to go into Ihraam, he would call for scissors and would cut his moustache and take from his beard before climbing upon his camel and before making the intention by saying the Talbeeyah and entering into Ihraam.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8 – From Abu Hilal who said a Shaykh narrated to us – I think he is from the people of Madina- who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I saw Abu Hurairah trim from its sides, meaning take from it. I saw that he had a yellowy beard.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ibn Sa’ad in ‘ Tabaqat’]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Albaani) say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I hold that this Shaykh [Narrator] from Madina is Uthmaan bin Ubayd Allaah, since indeed Ibn Sa’ad narrated Ahadeeth after this with an authentic Sanad from Ibn Abi Dhib from Uthmaan bin Ubayd Allaah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I saw Abu Hurairah dying his beard while we were in a small area for studying and memorising Qur’aan.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hibban mentioned him in ‘Thiqaat’, so to me the Sanad is hasan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Albaani) say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In these authentic Aathaar (narrations) is what indicates to that trimming the beard, and taking from it was a matter well known to the Salaf,  this is in contrast to what some of our brothers from the Ahl-ul-Hadeeth think, those who are extreme in not taking from the beard, those who adhere to the general saying if the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>: ‘Grow the beard’ without paying attention to what they understand from the generality that this is not the meaning of the Hadeeth due to the Salaf no it acting upon it,  and from them is he who narrated this general Hadeeth and they are Abdullaah bin Umar and his Hadeeth is in Bukhari and Muslim and Abu Hurairah, and his Hadeeth is from Muslim,  and both these Hadeeth are researched in ‘Jilbaab al-Marata al-Muslimah’ and Ibn Abbas and his Hadeeth is in ‘Mujma al-Zawaid’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Of that which there is no doubt, is that the narrator of a Hadeeth is more aware and knowledgeable with the intent of the Hadeeth, than those who did not hear the Hadeeth from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>and that the narrator was more concerned about following the Prophet than they were.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is supposing the meaning of ‘al-‘Iafaa'(to let grow) means ‘abundant’ and ‘a lot’ as is well known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, al-Baji said in ‘Sharh al-Muwatta’ quoting from al-Qadi Abi al-Waleed saying, that to me it is possible that what he meant by grow  the beard is also to trim it, because having a big beard is also something which had not been ordered to just leave, Ibn Qassim narrates from Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no problem with taking what flutters from the beard and is abnormal.’ It was said to Malik: ‘What if it grows very long? ‘ He said: ‘ I hold the opinion that you should take from it and cut it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was narrated from Abdullaah bin Umar and Abu Hurairah that they both used to take from their beards whatever was more than a fistful.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Albaani ) say : that al-Khalaal collected that from them in the book ‘at-Tarajjul’ with two authentic chains.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also narrated from Imam Ahmad that he was asked about taking from the beard?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Ibn Umar used to take from his beard that which was more than a fistful, and it is as if that was Imam Ahmad’s opinion.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Harb said: I asked him: ‘What is ‘growing the beard’?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: it is narrated from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said: and this was ‘growing the beard’ according to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Albaani) say: and from what is known is that the narrator of his Hadeeth is more knowledgeable about it than anyone else, and especially if he had a concern for the Sunnah like Ibn Umar, and he sees his Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> the one who ordered with growing the beard – day and night, so reflect upon this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then al-Khalaal narrates by way of Ishaq who said: I asked Ahmad about a man who takes from his beard?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: Whatever is more than a fistful of the beard is cut.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked what about the Hadeeth of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Trim the moustache and grow the beard.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘Take from its length and what is under the throat.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I saw Abu Abdullaah taking from the length of the beard and from under his throat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Albaani ) say: I have extended this a little by mentioning these texts from some of the Salaf and Imams due to its status and due to the presumption of many people that these narrations oppose the generality of the Hadeeth: ‘and grow the beard’,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However they did not pay attention to the principle that if a single aspect from the general aspects is not acted upon, then this is an evidence that this was not the intent of it, and so many Bida’ occur due to this reason, which Imam Shatibee named ‘al-Bida’ al-Edafeeyah’ (associated innovation).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Along with this it is still rejected by the people of knowledge, because it was not from the actions of the Salaf, and they were more pious, more knowledgeable than those who came later.  So it is hoped that attention is paid to this, since the issue is precise and important.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Research Two</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani Comments:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">لا يأخذ أحدكم من طول لحيته ، ولكن من الصدغين</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘None of you should take from the length of his beard, but rather from the area of the face which is from the eye to the ear.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Da’eef Jiddan (VeryWeak)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Ibn Adee (2/260) and Abu Na’eem in al-Hileeyah (3/323-324) and al-Khateeb in Tareekh (5/187), from Ufayr bin Ma’daan from ‘Atta from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri from the Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Adee said that the general narrations of Ufayr bin Ma’daan are not strong.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the book ‘Taqreeb’: ‘he is Da’eef’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Albaani) say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Some of this Hadeeth has supporting proof which is reported from the companions; collected by al-Muhaamali in ‘al-Amali'(12/65):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn Abbas who said regarding the statement of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">( ثم ليقضوا تفثهم)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«Then let them complete the prescribed duties (Manasik of Hajj) for them》</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘Attafath (prescribed duties): is shaving the head, trimming the moustache, and plucking the armpit hair, shaving the pubic hair, trimming fingernails, taking from the sides of the face and cheeks, stoning the Jamaraat, staying in Arafaah and Muzdalifah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narrators are all trustworthy except for Hasheem, since he makes a lot of Tadlees (deception in narrating) and in this narration he has narrated using the form of ‘anana’  (meaning from a narrator but not mentioning how the narration was conveyed); If it was not for his Tadlees I would have declared his Isnaad to be authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I found that Imam at-Tabari collected this Athar in the Tafseer of the mentioned Ayaah (17/109).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From way of Hasheem who said that AbdulMalik informed us from ‘Atta from Ibn Abbas with the Athar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Hasheem clearly mentioned that he was informed, therefore, we have been saved from the evil of his Tadlees; so his Isnaad is Saheeh, and all praise belongs to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then it had also been narrated from Muhammad bin Ka’ab al-Qarthee that he used to say about this Ayaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«Then let them complete the prescribed duties (Manasik of Hajj) for them》:stoning the Jamaraat, slaughtering an animal, and taking from the moustache, beard, and nails, and performing Tawaf of the House (Kaba) and between Safa and Marwa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: and its Isnaad is Saheeh. Then Tabari narrated similarly about cutting the beard from Mujahid likewise, and its Isnaad is authentic. What prompted the research of the Hadeeth of this issue was a question from one of the Salafi brothers regarding its authenticity, he showed me by hand a book entitled: ‘Grow the beard and trim the moustache’ by Shaykh Abdurahman bin Muhammad bin Qasim al-Asimi al-Hanbali so I ordered him to research the narrations against the book ‘Tareekh al-Baghdad’ I showed that it was weak due to the narrator ‘Afeer bin Ma’daan, I decided to research it in this [book] ‘Silsilah’ for a general benefit and to bring to attention various points:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Firstly:</em>  The aforementioned Shaykh presented the Hadeeth from the narration of al-Khateeb whilst remaining silent about it after quoting the saying of Nawawi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘What the chosen opinion is, is leaving the beard as it is, and not to oppose it by trimming any of it from the outset.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadeeth – along with it being Da’eef is an evidence against him, since it is clear in the permissibilty of cutting from ‘the area of the face which is from the eye to the ear ‘ (الصدغين) which is dual for (الصدغ) : The side of the face from the eye to the ear. The intent is: the hair from above that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Secondly:</em> The word الصدغين ‘the area of the face which is from the eye to the ear ‘ has not been presented, so I do not know, was this intentionally or out of negligence? !</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Thirdly:</em> It appears that the author has not been precise in conveying the Ahadeeth from their original sources, perhaps he delegated some students to relay them, indeed I saw some mistakes in this which are not possible, see his statement on p.4:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And by Muslim: who said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“خالفوا المجوس ؛ لأنهم كانوا يقصرون لحاهم ويطولون الشوارب” …” !</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Differ from the Majoos, because they used to shorten their beards and lengthen their moustaches “…”!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is how the motive of the sentence occurred: “Because they used to. . .” between  speech marks; and it is not from the Hadeeth, not from Muslim or anyone else rather it is [inserted] from the speech of the author! So rightfully it should have been placed after the last two speech marks.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is apparent is that the Shaykh did not supervise the draft corrections of the book. The Hadeeth is a portion from the Hadeeth of Abu Hurairah Marfoo’ (from the Prophet) with the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“جزوا الشوارب وأرخوا اللحى،خالفوا المجوس”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Trim moustaches and grow beards, differ from the Majoos.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Muslim (1/153). The Shaykh mentioned it on the following page (5) without this last sentence: ‘Differ from the Majoos’, but mentioned it on the page preceding this, along with the insertion I indicated to earlier.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Fourthly:</em> He mentions (p.7) the Hadeeth of Zayd bin Arqam marfoo with the wording: ‘Whoever does not take off his moustache then he is not from us.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said: ‘authenticated by Tirmidhi’!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: But the wording of the Hadeeth from Tirmidhi (2762) mentions: ‘… from his moustache…’ With the extra word: ‘from’, and likewise it is in ‘al-Mishkat’ (443) narrated by others, also narrated by Ibn Hibban (1481) – Mawarid, and Diyaa al-Maqdasi. The difference between this and what occurred in the book is not hidden, since the first indicates that taking from the moustache means some of the moustache, and not all of the moustache as is the opinion of the author, and cutting the moustache is by cutting what grows over onto the lip as I explained as a practical Sunnah. See ‘Adab az-Zafaf’ (p. 120).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Fifth:</em> The author (p.14) said: ‘Some of the people of knowledge gave a concession in taking what is more than a fistful; due to the action of Ibn Umar.’ And he commented upon it saying: ‘the evidence is in his narration not for his opinion; there is no doubt that the statement of the Messenger and his actions are more correct and foremost to follow than the statement or action of other than him; no matter who that individual is!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I say: of course; however to place an opposition between the Prophet  <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em>and Ibn Umar is a mistake, because there is not a Hadeeth of his actions that he <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> did not use to take from his beard.  And regarding saying: ‘and grow the beard’ it is possible that he meant absolutely and without exception, so the action of Ibn Umar would not be in opposition to the Prophet, so the difference between the scholars returns to the understanding of the text.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Umar – in regards to him narrating the Hadeeth – it is possible to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narrator knows more about what he narrates than anyone else, especially since some of the Salaf are in agreement with him with taking from the beard as has preceded, without anyone from the Salaf opposing Ibn Umar, from what we know. And Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I came across an important Athar narrated from the Salaf which aids what preceded regarding taking from the beard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al Bayhaqi narrates in ‘Shuab al – Eemaan’ (2/1/263):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Tahir al-Faqeeh informed us that Abu Uthmaan al-Basri narrated to us that Muhammad bin AbdulWahhab narrated to us that Ya’ala bin Ubayd conveyed to us that Sufyaan narrated to us from Mansoor from Ibrahim who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘They [the Companions] used to take from its sides and clean it.’ Meaning the beard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: and this Isnaad is Jayyid; all the narrators above al-Basri are all trustworthy from the narrators in the book ‘Tahdheeb’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Abu Uthmaan al-Basri then he is Amr bin Abdullaah, as in the biography of Muhammad bin AbdulWahhab – and he is al-Fara an-Naysaboori – from ‘Tahdheeb ‘.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hafidh Dhahabi mentioned him in the book ‘Wafayaat’ in year 334 his grandfather was called ‘Dirhaman al-Mutowa’ee’, and described him as: ‘Musnad Naysaboor’ in his book ‘Tadhkirah al-Huffadh’ (4/847).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Abu Tahir al-Faqeeh, then he is from the well-known shayookh of al-Hakim, those from whom he narrated a lot in ‘Mustadrak’, and his student al-Bayhaqi participated in narrating from him. His name is: Muhammad bin Muhammad ibn Muhamash az-Zayadi, Dhahabi mentioned him in ‘Tadhkirah’ also in ‘Wafayaat’ Year 410, and described him as: ‘Musnad Naysaboor al-Allamma’. There is a biography of him in ‘Tabaqat ash-Shafia’eeya’ by Subki (3/82).[6]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Length of the Prophet’s Beard</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Abdullaah bin Jafar who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">” ثُمَّ ذَهَبَ رَسُولُ اللهِ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ، فِي الْحَائِطِ فَقَضَى حَاجَتَهُ، ثُمَّ تَوَضَّأَ، ثُمَّ جَاءَ وَالْمَاءُ يَقْطُرُ مِنْ لِحْيَتِهِ عَلَى صَدْرِهِ، فَأَسَرَّ إِلَيَّ شَيْئًا لَا أُحَدِّثُ بِهِ أَحَدًا، فَحَرَّجْنَا عَلَيْهِ أَنْ يُحَدِّثَنَا، فَقَالَ: لَا أُفْشِي عَلَى رَسُولِ اللهِ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ سِرَّهُ حَتَّى أَلْقَى اللهَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘…..Then the Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> went into the garden and relieved himself, then he performed Wudu, then he came and water was dripping <strong>from his beard on to his chest</strong>, and he whispered something to me which I will not tell anyone.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We tried hard to get him to inform us, but he said: ‘I will not spread  the secret of the Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> until I meet Allaah.’[7]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Statements of Imam Ahmad <em>-Rahimullaah-</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Regarding Cutting the Beard after the Fist</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr Ahmad bin Muhammad Al-Khalaal[8] <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> (d. 311 A.H.) brought a chapter heading:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Chapter Regarding the Saying of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> Grow the Beard</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">92 – Khalaal said that Harb[9] informed me that Ahmad was asked about taking from the beard?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Ibn Umar used to take from his beard that which was more than a fistful,’ and it is as if that was Imam Ahmad’s opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Harb said: I asked him: ‘What is al-I’afaa (to grow) the beard?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: it is narrated from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said: and this was al-I’afaa (to grow) the beard according to him (Imam Ahmad).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">93 – al-Khalaal said Muhammad bin Abee Haroon informed me that Ishaq narrated to them that he said: I asked Ahmad about a man who takes from his beard from the sides of his cheeks?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad said: ‘Take from the beard whatever is more than a fistful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked what about the Hadeeth of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Trim the moustache and grow the beard?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘Take from its length and what is under the throat.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I saw Abu Abdullaah (Imam Ahmad) taking from the length of the beard and from under his throat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">95 – al-Khalaal said that Haroon bin Ziyaad informed me that Ibn Abee Umar narrated to us that he said: Sufyaan narrated to us from Ibn Abee Najeeh from Mujaahid who said: I saw Ibn Umar take a fistful of his beard on the day of Nahr (10<sup>th</sup> day of the Hajj) then he said to the barber: ‘Take what is below the fist.’[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">96 – al-Khalaal said that Haroon bin Ziyaad informed me that Ibn Abee Umar narrated to us that he said: Sufyaan narrated to us that Ibn Tawoos said: My father used to command me to take from this, and he indicated to the bottom of his beard.’[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">97 – al-Khalaal said Ahmad bin al-Hasan bin Hassan informed us that ar-Rabia’ bin Yahya narrated to us that Shu’ba narrated to us from Umar bin Ayyoob narrated to us that Abu Zura’a bin Jareer said: ‘Abu Hurairah would take a hold of his beard, and whatever was under his fist[12] he would cut it.’[13]/[14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Haani said: ‘I asked Abu Abdullaah (Imam Ahmad) about a person who takes from the beard from his cheeks?’ He replied: ‘ Take from the beard what is more than a fistful.’ I said: ‘What about the Hadeeth of the Prophet –   – :’Trim the Moustache and grow the beard’?’ He said: take from the length and from under the throat, and I saw Abu Abdullaah take from the sides of his cheeks and under his throat.’[15]</p>

The Hanafiya held it to be recommended as Ibn Abideen clearly mentions in his comments to ‘ad-Dur al-Mukhtar’. The Malikiyah say there is no problem from taking from the beard that which what flutters from the beard and is abnormal  and there is no problem with taking from its length if it grows very long.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A Discussion about the Statements of the Scholars of Jarh wa Ta’adeel</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questions regarding Trimming the Beard</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A discussion took place with Shaykh al-Albaani regarding the Jarh (Criticism) used by the Muhaditheen (Scholars of Hadeeth) regarding someone with a long beard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner:           I have reservations regarding the use of the Muhaditheen when they said about some narrators that they had long beards but in a way of dispraise and criticism, how can the Muhadithoon use it in this way? This opens the door against those who adhere to growing the beard and not just those who grow the beard long.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh:         Do not say growing the beard because that returns the dispraise of the hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner but this could possibly strengthen the thought of the person who says that it is from above the fist .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh:         therefore, it is necessary to say regarding this point that the dispraise is for the one who opposes growing the beard and lengthens it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner:           Is it possible to use what these Muhaditheen formulated to strengthen the thought of the person who holds the opinion of Ibn Umar –RadhiAllaahu anhumma?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh:         Absolutely this is correct, because the Imam of the Sunnah, Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal holds the opinion of cutting what extends more than a fistful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner:           The use of the Muhaditheen of this criticism is from the point of view of fickle minded, heedless and stupid and other meanings as well?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh:         Yes!’[1]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Some Statements of the People of Knowledge</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 – Abu al-Waleed al-Baaji said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ibn al-Qasim narrated from Malik: ‘there is no problem taking from the beard what flutters from the beard and is abnormal.’ it was said to Malik: If it grows very long?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: I hold the opinion that one takes from the beard and cuts it, it is narrated from Abdullaah bin Umar and Abu Hurairah <em>-RadhiAllaahu anhumma-</em> that they both used to take from their beard what was more than a fistful.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – Ibn Haani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I asked Abu Abdullaah (Imam Ahmad) about a person who takes from the beard from his cheeks?’ He replied: ‘ Take from the beard what is more than a fistful.’ I said: ‘What about the Hadeeth of the Prophet <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> : ‘Trim the Moustache and grow the beard’?’ He said: take from the length and from under the throat, and I saw Abu Abdullaah take from the sides of his cheeks and under his throat.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – Hafidh Ibn AbdulBarr said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘In the action of Ibn Umar taking from the bottom of his beard in Hajj is an evidence of  cutting from the beard in other than Hajj because if cutting the beard was not allowed then it would not have been allowed in Hajj. and Ibn Umar narrated from the Prophet <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em>: ‘Grow the beard’ and he is the most knowledgeable about what he narrated, therefore, the meaning to him and to the majority of scholars is to take from the beard that which flutters and Allaah knows best.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for growing the beard then it is left as it is, and if he takes what is more than a fist then this is not disliked. The text for this is as preceded from Ibn Umar, and likewise he took from his beard what flutters.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 – Qurtubi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It is not allowed to shave the beard nor to pluck it, nor to cut a lot of it, as for taking from the length and the width of what flutters from the beard, or that which disfigures him and causes to becoming well-known, then this is good according to Malik and other than him from the Salaf.’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – Ibn al-Jawzi brings some narrations:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Sa’eed bin Mansoor that he said, I said to Ibn Idris, Have you seen Salam bin Abi Hafsah? He answered: Yes, I saw him, he had a long beard and he was stupid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn Sireen that he said: If you see a man with a long beard then you know that he has nothing in his intellect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zayed ibn Ubayy said: A man’s beard does not increase more than a fist’s length except that increase is deficiency in his intellect.’[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 – Al-Khateeb al-Baghdadi mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Al-Awfi used to have a very long beard, and regarding his beard there were some strange matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ali bin Abu Ali informed us that Talha bin Muhammad al-Mua’dal informed us that Ahmad bin Kamil narrated to me that Hussain bin Fahm narrated and said: al-Awfi’s beard used to reach up to his knees’.[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8 – al-Qadi Ayyad said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for taking from its length and its width is good.’[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9 – Ibn Battal said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Atta said: It is no problem to take a little from ones beard, from its length and its width if it is long.’[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10 – al-Mardawi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘and grow his beard . . . .and it is not disliked to take from that which extends from the beard more than a fistful, -and Ahmad had mentioned – there is no problem with taking from the beard and taking from under the throat….’[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11 – Ibn Abi Shaybah brings a chapter heading in ‘Musannaf’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘What has been said regarding taking from the beard’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Abu Zura’ah who said: Abu Hurairah used to take a hand hold from his beard then cut what wasa extra from the handful.’[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>10</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Some Fatawa of Shaykh Albaani From Silsilah Huda wa Noor[13]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Discussion One</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner:           Regarding what I have heard from someone mentioning from your Fatawa which says it is permissible to take from the beard in other than Hajj or Umrah, is this correct?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani: 100 % correct.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner:           100% correct, okay then what is the evidence for this?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:                    The action of the Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner:           Is it possible that you could mention some examples for what you mentioned that it is from the actions of the Companions?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:                    The action of Ibn Umar, since it is established from him that he took from his beard restricting it to doing that in Hajj and Umrah, and also without restricting doing so in other than Hajj and Umrah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise it has been mentioned from some of the Companions and the Tab’aieen, like Abu Hurairah and Mujahid and other than them, this is what I can remember.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh continues the discussion later on..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:                    so how can we view these Companions and at the head of them is Ibn Umar, that either we are saying about him he did not have an understanding of this text [growing the beard] whether it was a general text or absolute; or along with his understanding he opposed the Messenger – alayhi as-Salat wa Salam-, even though he was    amongst the Companions, and he was the one single companion of       whom we know that he would overstress and had strictness in following the actions of the Messenger – alayhi as-Salat wa Salam- even in those actions which were the Messenger’s natural disposition and were not from the Sunnan of worship; therefore, it is not possible for it to be said that, since Ibn Umar was the one who had great concern in following the Messenger – alayhi as-Salat wa Salam- and indeed he accompanied him for all those years which Allaah had willed, watching the Messenger – alayhi as-Salat wa Salam- coincide his sayings with his actions, and his actions with his sayings, and then he comes along and opposes the saying of the Prophet and his action together!! This is so farfetched to occur from the likes of this Companion!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible for the sake of argument, that the like of this opposition to occur from those Companions who were Bedouins, like the Bedouin who came to the Messenger – alayhi as-Salaam- and believed in him and heard some advises or some issues then he returned to his sheep, camels and the desert. But as for Ibn Umar who accompanied                 the Messenger – alayhi as-Salaam- and had that concern, which was a strange and strict concern in following him – alayhi as-Salam- even in those things which others will see as not being at all from following the Messenger, but rather Ibn Umar’s love for the Messenger led him to overstress in following the Messenger  <em>– </em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–  </em>even in that which was not from the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is extremely difficult to hold the opinion that Ibn Umar would     come and see the Messenger -alayhi as-Salam- do something – and what confirms this is the Messenger’s saying: ‘and grow the beard’ – then he would not grow the beard and oppose what he saw from the Messenger and what he heard from the Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I believe that none who has an intellect and understanding has any doubt that this address which a companion hears generally and Ibn Umar heard specifically and directly from the mouth of Messenger <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>– </em>with his own ears, that he will have a better understanding than any other person who appears at a later date or even a long time ago however he had not directly heard from the Messenger  <em>– </em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.[14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Discussion Two</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:                    As for it to be said that this is specific to Ibn Umar, then no, firstly    this is not just established by Ibn Umar alone, but rather it is also established from Abu Hurairah. It is established on more than one of the Successors (Taba’een, followers of the Companions), so much so that  one of them and that is, Ibrahim bin Yazeed an-Nakha’ee who said: ‘They used to take from their beards.’ If  a Taba’ee (a Successor) narrates with the wording ‘They used to’ who do they mean? The Companions.  Therefore, we have a number of texts that taking from the beard was not something that Ibn Umar alone carried out and not other Companions. . .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>The Shaykh continues later. . .</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:                    . . . you have understood that the text is general [not to cut the beard] and Ibn Umar did not understand that the text is general, this is not something a person would say. So they had a better understanding than us, this is firstly, then secondly there is something with which they are distinguished above us which is the saying of the  Messenger -alayhi as-Salam: ‘A witness sees that which an absent person does not see.’ And the second hadeeth . . . ‘Being informed is not like the one who investigates it.’ This is a great hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>The Shaykh continues. . .</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:                    . . . O people this is a general text upon which the Salaf did not act upon it [in this way] there is no hadeeth from the Messenger nor from other than the Messenger that they would leave their beards . . .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>The Shaykh continues. . .</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:                    here we say, we are Salafioon, we do not ascribe to the Salaf in vain and futilely, but so we don’t fall into problems like these, and start understanding the text opposite to how they understood the text. This is why Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ومن يشاقق الرسول من بعد ما تبين له الهدى ويتبع غير سبيل المؤمنين نوله ما تولى ونصله جهنم وساءت مصيرا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers’ way. We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell – what an evil destination.&gt;&gt; Here we have perfect wisdom, the mention of the path of the believers. . . .’[15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Discussion Three</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">. . . .if we want to act upon a general text then it is obligatory to keep it as it is, however what was the stance of the Salaf to this text? Here it becomes clear to you the importance of our Salafi Manhaj when we say, it is not sufficient to follow the Book and the Sunnah but it is necessary to return to the Salaf who implemented these texts which were the statements of the Prophet <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.  The first of these [Texts], which has reached you is the narrator of the Hadeeth ‘grow the beard’, he was Abdullaah bin Umar and he would take what was more than his fist full of his beard, he would cut what was more than a fist full.  He was not the only one to do this, rather this action is also authentic from Abu Hurairah, it is also authentic from a number of Companions without there being any mention whatsoever from anyone of the Companions that they opposed this action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We know from some of the scholars of Fiqh, like Ibn Qaddamah al-Maqdasi and others from the scholars that when they mentioned an action of a single Companion they would clarify it by saying, ‘and we do not know of anyone who opposed him in this, then this is a consensus (Ijma’)’. So how about the situation if the issue being conveyed is not just from one Companion but from a number of Companions and it is not mentioned that anyone from them opposed them in this issue.’[16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Discussion Four</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner:           It has reached us from some of our brothers that you have mentioned it is obligatory to take from the beard. That you have used as evidence or mentioned the proof of the action of Ibn Umar  that he would take from his beard and him being the narrator is more aware of the meaning of what he narrates.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘In reality we have a very important principle, we hope that the students comprehend and understand it correctly, because as a result of this principle there are hundreds of Fiqh issues which branch off from it if not thousands. The Principle is: ‘It is not allowed to act upon general texts, which due to their nature are general and include a number of different sections in that text, when it is established that the Salaf did not act upon a section of these different parts of the text. So here it is not allowed to act upon this because of the generality of this text, due to this part of the text being specific.’ Is this speech clear? However, it will become clearer by driving home an example or more than one example.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Before we bring a new novel example, we would like to bring to attention that every Bida’ which is wide spread among the Muslims, which the Mubtadia’ (people of Bida’) have no lack of, meaning the Mubtadia’ or those who regard Bida’ as good are never deprived of finding a text for their Bida’ in the Book or in the Sunnah, a general text which aids this section of the Bida’ that they establish.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Take for example: the Adhan al-Muhammadi (the Prophetic Adhan) which commences with ‘Allaahu Akbar Allaahu Akbar’ and ends with ‘La ilaha illAllaah’ all the Muslims acknowledge this reality. There  does not exist, and I hope that it does not exist, that a person, no matter how ignorant he is or misguided that he says that Bilal, Umar bin Umm Maktoom and Abu Mahdoorah used to say after saying ‘La ilaha illAllaah’ that they would say: as-Salat ala Rasool -Alayhi as-Salam (aloud).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This did not occur and I hope it does not occur, however along with this they use as an evidence against us – the callers to the Sunnah and to follow the Salaf and the Imams- the saying of Allaah Ta’ala: &lt;&lt;O you who believe! Send your <em>Salat </em>on (ask Allaah to bless) him (Muhammad), and (you should) greet (salute) him with the Islaamic way of greeting (salutation i.e. <em>As-­Salamu ‘Alaikum</em>).&gt;&gt;[17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say this is a general text, and they are truthful, it is a general text, because Allaah Ta’ala did not say send Salat in a certain place, or do not send Salat in a certain place, but rather send Salat generally.  So what is our reply to these people? [The reply is]the previous principle [‘It is not allowed to act upon general texts, which the Salaf did not act upon.’]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now I will give you an imaginary example, because sometimes the imagination can broaden the horizons of thinking and cause to comprehend a reality which a person discusses. So we are now discussing that a generality in a specific section of which was not acted upon is not allowed to be acted upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[The example is] we say if a person were to enter a Masjid at the time of Dhur prayer for example, and a group of people enter along with him and each one went to a separate part of the Masjid wanting to pray two Rakat Sunnah or four Rakat Sunnah before the obligatory prayer, then  one of them says, O people lets pray [Sunnah prayer] in congregation and immediately uses as proof two Ahadeeth; ‘Allaah’s Hand is upon the Jama’ah’ and ‘Prayer in congregation is twenty five or twenty seven times better than prayer individually.’ Is this use of proof correct? Of course all of you will say no, even if there was – and Allaah forbid- a Mubtadia’ among you. Why? We have no reply [to their claim] except the same reply to [saying Salat aloud] after the Adhan, before the Adhan and increasing upon giving Salat. There are tens, hundreds even thousands of examples like this. So our reply is that if this was good they [the Salaf] would have preceded us in it.  If it was good to pray optional and prescribed Sunnah prayers in congregation and the Messenger had said: ‘Prayer in congregation…’ till the end of the Hadeeth, did not they [the Salaf] have a better understanding than us or not? They were more concerned than us to come closer to Allaah. Secondly, if they did not act upon [a deed] then this is an evidence that they did not take this understanding which you have understood. I think this principle has become clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Applying this issue [cutting the beard] to this principle; we know that in many Ahadeeth the Prophet<em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> said: ‘Trim the Moustache and grow the beard and differ from the Jews and Christians.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an absolute text (Mutlaq). ‘Grow the beard’ is an  absolute text as we mentioned as an example earlier with the ‘prayer in congregation’, ‘Allaah’s Hand is upon the Jamah’ and as we gave an example with that Ayaah, &lt;&lt;O you who believe! Send your <em>Salat </em>on (ask Allaah to bless) him (Muhammad), and (you should) greet (salute) him with the Islaamic way of greeting (salutation i.e. <em>As­-Salamu ‘Alaikum</em>).&gt;&gt;[18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Discussion Five</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I have found it to be very, very important to especially bring to attention this point that it is not allowed to act upon a section from the sections of a general text of which the Salaf did not act upon, this is because they have a better understanding than us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is strange that I say all goodness is in following the Salaf and all evil is in what the Khalf innovated, and if it was goodness, they would have preceded us in it, but it does not enter into the hearts of our brothers.’[19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Discussion  Six</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Should we implement the principle ‘The consideration is with the narrator’s narration and not by his opinion’ in the issue of cutting the beard?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people present a doubt regarding the issue that a narrator of a Hadeeth is more knowledgeable of his narration than anyone else, they say that in this research of taking from the beard we implement another principle which is ‘The consideration is with the narrator’s Hadeeth and not by his opinion’, so how do we reply to this doubt?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Here, when an opinion opposes the narration as is [the example of] the  Hadeeth of Abu Hurairah.  Abu Hurairah narrated the Hadeeth of washing seven times, ‘If a dog licks your container then you must wash it seven times the first of which with soil.’ It is narrated in an Isnaad from Abu Hurairah  which contains a person whose name is Abdul Malik ibn Abi Sulayman, who  is from the narrators in Saheeh Muslim.  There is some sort of criticism about him, but I say this is from the aspect of information even though I am certain of his trustworthiness. He narrates from Abu Hurairah that Abu Hurairah himself said wash the vessel which a dog has licked three times, here O brother comes this principle, because this statement [of Abu Hurairah] contradicts the other [the Hadeeth of Abu Hurairah]. It is not possible to say that this statement of Abu Hurairah is a Tafseer (explanation) of the Hadeeth. As for the principle of general text and absolute text, then this is not like that principle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We say O brother, if Ibn Umar used to take from his beard and lived in a society not like the societies of our time today, where there is no enjoining good, or forbidding evil, at their time it was totally the opposite, as soon as a person appeared to do something opposite [to the Sharia] you find some objection and disapproval from all angles. Then they will be informed of what is correct, this is if, one person were to do so, how about this issue, you have Companions Ibn Umar and Abu Hurairah, the Taba’een (successors to the Companions) ‘Atta ibn Abi Rabbah and al-Hasan al-Basri and  many others, this is from just one book ‘al-Musannaf’. What if we opened a book for example, ‘Shua’b al-Eemaan’ which was printed recently, we would find other Athaar (narrations).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, if we understand that taking from the beard is the Salafi Sunnah of                                 the best of the people at that time, then in this situation the principle, that the                               Hadeeth of a narrator precedes his opinion. In this situation of taking from the                                beard, then this is not an opinion.’[20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Discussion Seven</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘….. now we enter into the crux of the subject, actions of the Salaf. Here it is necessary for me to pause, our Dawa’ is not limited to the Book and the Sunnah, as is the Dawa of every Muslim, as it should be. However we want to say that our Dawa is established by the Book, the Sunnah and the Manhaj of the Salaf as-Salih. Why? Because if it was not for the Salaf as-Salih we would not have been able to understand our religion precisely and this is why the Islamic Jama’at -old and present time – have separated into groups and parties. &lt;&lt;each group rejoicing in its belief &gt;&gt;[21]  as Allaah has mentioned in the Noble Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say, why is this? Because the Islaamic groups did not rely upon that what the Salaf as-Salih were upon and they took the Tafseer (explanation) of the texts according to their whims and desires, so they fell into confusion and extreme contradiction. They separated, as we mentioned into groups and parties. As for us, then we say we are Salafis, we see how the Salaf as-Salih used to understand the Sunnah of the Messenger, with its three divisions, his statements, actions and allowances and we follow that path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it upon us to limit ourselves with this limitation [understanding of the Salaf] and act upon the Sharia’? We say how can we not! Allaah Ta’ala said: &lt;&lt;And whosoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been clearly shown to him and follows other than the path of the believers.  We shall keep him in the path he has chosen and burn him in Hell – what an evil destination. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, opposing the path of the believers is the same as opposing the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah -Alayhis Salaam- because the intent of following them is that they directly saw the Messenger and they conveyed to us the Sunnah of the Messenger. They were his Companions, then those who came after them, then those who came after them, as is mentioned in the authentic Hadeeth. So when we say the Book, the Sunnah and upon the Manhaj of the Salaf as-Salih, taking this from the Ayaah and the Hadeeth of al-Irbaad bin Sareeyaa, ‘upon you is my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided Khulafa’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also taking from the Hadeeth of Anas bin Malik &amp; Muwaweeyah and others:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘and my nation will split up into 73 sects all of whom will be in the fire except one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Companions asked, ‘Which one O Messenger of Allaah?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“What I am upon and my Companions are upon.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now we return [to the issue], we do not have a single Hadeeth not even a weak one like our Hadeeth which says that the Prophet <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>– </em> used to take from his beard from its sides and length, we said it was weak. Nor does there exist a weak Hadeeth that the Messenger did not take from his beard. There are those from the scholars now who say that the Messenger did not used to take anything from his beard, there is no origin for this Hadeeth at all. What there is, is the speech which says a general Hadeeth, ‘and grow the beard’. However, this generality is like the other generality upon which no action was done because of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we have in difference to the issue that it has not been conveyed that the Messenger used to take from his beard, which is that his Companions who witnessed him took from their beards, do you think that these Companions would oppose the Messenger while they narrate the Hadeeth of the Messenger, ‘and grow the beard’? No they do not oppose the Messenger. It is a widespread mistake here and in other issues, which is a two- fold mistake, you previously narrated from Ibn Umar that when he used to perform Hajj or Umrah he would take from his beard.  This is an authentic narration, but it is not unrestricted, meaning did he only do that in Hajj and Umrah? No, he used to take from his beard even in other than Hajj and Umrah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there is a second widespread mistake that it was only Ibn Umar who took from his beard, this is also a mistake, since it is also authentic from Abu Hurairah, that he would also take from his beard. It is not just this, but rather it is authentic from Ibraheem bin Yazeed an-Nakha’ee and he is from the Taba’een (successor of the Companions) who said: ‘they used to take from their beards’. ‘They used to take….’ who are ‘they’ who used to take? The Companions of the Messenger – alayhi as-Salaam.  There are no texts (narrations) which oppose these texts whatsoever. Therefore, the guidance of the Salaf is not is to let the beard grow (completely) like we see some of those who preceded of [ignorant] worshippers . . . . . and there is no way for us to know the likes of this except by way of the Companions of the Messenger. From among the Companions of the Messenger was Ibn Umar who was the most concerned with following the Messenger, so much so that he would follow the Messenger even in the matters of the Messenger’s habits – and these issues are well known to you. ‘</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>11</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A Meeting With the Shaykh</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>My cutting the beard after the fist</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>By Abbas Abu Yahya</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After having been guided to follow the Sunnah of the Prophet <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>– </em> I began to grow my beard, and while taking a literal understanding of the Hadeeth: ‘grow the beard and trim the moustache’ I would not trim my beard rather I let it grow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My beard had reached past my navel. During my first Umrah trip I encountered a student of knowledge who began to question the reasons for the extra long length of my beard. So I reminded him of the Sunnah -as I had understood it – and he promptly informed me that there were Companions of the Prophet <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> who would trim their beards after a fist long.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He mentioned many of the proofs, for example from the books of Hadeeth and that Ibn Hajr mentions that 12 or 14 of the Companions trimmed their beards after the fist. However, even with all this evidence my heart needed contentment and I needed to hear this from a scholar.  Here he dropped a bomb and said even Shaykh Albaani holds this opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With this I could not be content without actually asking this question face to face.  So began a journey for seeking knowledge. Allaah had favoured me out of His Mercy,  that the following day of the night of which I had arrived in the Hashmite Kingdom of Jordan, there was going to be a gathering with the Shaykh and we had been given an invite.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is what took place in that memorable gathering.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To set the scene, I was being driven to a gathering with the Shaykh, we headed towards Amman on a Friday morning,  around 8.30 – 9.00 o’clock,  the weather was nice and warm as it was summer time.  We drove off the main highway down a side path surrounded by very tall trees, and at the end of the track was a small farm house, getting out of the car I recognised that famous sweet voice and an amazing smile appeared on my face which contrasted with the nice bright summery morning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I rushed into the main room where everyone was gathered, sitting tightly squeezed together, and found a place amongst the people and there was the Shaykh of Hadeeth sitting on a large arm chair with his legs on a footstool, covered with a blanket due to rheumatism. The excitement was exhilarating, unfortunately being unlettered in the Arabic language, I could not understand anything, and having been sleep deprived my energy level began taking its toll.  I commented to myself, you came all this way and you’re sitting in front of a scholar of the highest calibre and you’re falling asleep!! You need to go outside, this is shameful!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I picked up the courage when the Shaykh was interrupted and dived outside, the scene was beautiful, picturesque,  there I was sitting on the veranda on a nice warm summer’s day listening to that beautiful Arabic tone and as far as the eyes could see, were olive trees lining the earth in front of me. A funny thing happened that Abu Layla – who records the Shaykh’s sittings came out and asked me a question to which I replied in my pigeon Arabic ‘Maafee Arabee’ (no Arabic). Then he quoted the Hadeeth of the Angels sitting in gatherings of knowledge, and I understood the Arabic word for Angels,  so I ventured back in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyhow, or the story continues, after Jummah we had returned to the farm house but now the venue was outside in the veranda,  and the Shaykh begins by asking me,  ‘Are you from the Jamiat Ahl ul Hadeeth of Pakistan?’ I replied, ‘No,  I’m not with them.’ (There was a translator on hand).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh continued by saying: ‘They, like our brothers in Saudi hold the opinion that it is not permissible to trim the beard after a fistful, and they are mistaken in this,  since Ibn Umar trimmed his beard after the fist,  either in Hajj or Umrah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I quickly asked: ‘O Shaykh is this not regarded as his Ijtihaad since he opposed the Hadeeth[23]?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered very cleverly: ‘Who is more knowledgeable about the Hadeeth, you or Ibn Umar?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I answered bewildered: ‘Ibn Umar <em>– RadhiAllaahu anhu –</em> without doubt!!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh followed up to my amazement: ‘Ibn Umar was the narrator of the Hadeeth, ‘grow the beard and trim the moustache.’ I was dazed, it hadn’t even crossed my mind, that’s why he’s the Shaykh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continued: ‘there’s a principle that the narrator of the Hadeeth is more knowledgeable about the narration than anyone else. And Ibn Umar narrated this Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another thing, imagine Ibn Umar did this action in Hajj or Umrah imagine he was surrounded by companions.  They are not like us that if they see something opposing the Sunnah that they would remain silent, but we do not have a single narration of anyone opposing Ibn Umar.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here, I was convinced I did not require any more proof. I had been given many more evidences while visiting Saudi. However, I needed clarification of the foundational principle, so I asked: ‘Shaykh are you saying that we can’t follow the Hadeeth except by the understanding of the companions?’<br />
He answered : ‘ Of course!!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here it was the clear Salafi Manhaj had been well and truly laid out.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There were five or six others in this gathering, students of knowledge and Imams of Masajid, who had long beards, Abu Layla had passed a pair of scissors around and they began trimming their beards after a fist while saying we have heard and we obey.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scissors were passed to me and at the same moment the food was brought in, Abu Layla looked at me and I indicated after we’ve eaten.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After having shared food with the shaykh I went to wash my hands and as I looked up from the basin into the mirror I saw Abu Layla standing behind me with his scissors,  like a psychopathic murderer! !</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After I had trimmed my beard -which I had not trimmed for seven years or so – we went back to the gathering and Abu Layla announced to the Shaykh that I had cut my beard,  the Shaykh heartedly said Mubarak! !</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[This incident took place in Jordan in the year 1992]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>12</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The overwhelming evidence shows – and Allaah knows best – that the correct understanding of the Hadeeth which command the growing of the beard have to be understood with the understanding of the first three generations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ibn Umar – in regards to him narrating the Hadeeth – it is possible to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narrator knows more about what he narrates than anyone else, especially since some of the Salaf are in agreement with him with taking from the beard as has preceded, without anyone from the Salaf opposing Ibn Umar, from what we know. And Allaah knows best.’[24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How excellent was the saying of the poet:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every good is in the following of the Salaf * and every evil is in the innovations of the Khalaf[25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>سُبْحَانَكَ اللَّهُمَّ وبَحَمْدكَ</em> أشْهدُ أنْ لا إلهَ إلا أنْتَ <em>أَسْتَغْفِرُكَ وأتُوبُ إِلَيْكَ</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>An Excellent Example</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we have in the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> and in all the Prophets of Allaah a good example.  The Messenger was commanded to take those Prophets before him as an example and to follow their guidance and we have been commanded to follow the guidance of the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, and take him as an example:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong>Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a good example to follow forhe who hopes in (the Meeting with) Allaah and the Last Day and remembers Allaah much</strong>. &gt;&gt; [al-Ahzab: 21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This good example is complete in every matter which Muhammad <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> came with<em>;</em> so, he is an example in his <em>‘<strong>Aqeedah</strong></em>, so we believe in that which he believed in; an example in his <strong>worship</strong>, so we worship Allaah making the religion sincerely for Him, following that which the noble Messenger –<em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam – </em>came with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is an example in great manners which perhaps many of the callers to Allaah <em>– Tabaraka wa Ta’ala –</em> and many of the youth have lost, much of it having been forgotten and some of the youth have forgotten it too.  Indeed Allaah has praised His Messenger – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam –</em> with eloquent praise and He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong>And verily, you are on an exalted standard of character</strong> &gt;&gt; [Qalam: 4]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So the caller to Allaah, the student of knowledge, the instructor and the guide all need to take the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> as an example in their <em>‘Aqeedah</em>, <em>Manhaj</em> and manners.  So if these matters are combined in the caller to Allaah or they are nearly complete then this <em>Dawa’</em> will be successful <em>– InshAllaah –</em> and the caller to Allaah will have presented it in the most beautiful and best form <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the caller to Allaah is deficient in the matters of his <em>Dawa’</em>, being deficient in having noble manners-from which is having patience, wisdom, gentleness, softness and other things which are important, which the <em>Dawa’</em> of the Messengers <em>–alayhim Sallat wa Sallam-</em> requires.  Then this is an apparent deficiency in his <em>Dawa’</em>.  So it is upon him to ensure he manifests those matters completely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Perhaps many of the people are negligent of this! And this harms the <em>Dawa’</em> of Salafiyyah and harms its people.  Since if these manners are neglected and the<em>Dawa’</em> is presented to the people in a way that they dislike and is made unpleasant and detestable by having harshness, severity and recklessness – and the likes of these things – then this is an obstacle to the <em>Dawa’</em> and to it being accepted.  Since these matters are even disliked in the affairs of the <em>Duniya</em> let alone in the matters of the <em>Deen</em>.</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is necessary for the student of knowledge to follow a path of righteous good manners in giving <em>Dawa’</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">So this sermon consists of the advice to fear Allaah, which is necessary and it is not exemplified except in the lives of the righteous, truthful scholars as in the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allaah</strong></span>. &gt;&gt;[Fatir: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fear Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em> so you can reach this level and learn so that you can reach that status; because the one who knows the correct <em>‘Aqeedah</em>, <em>Manhaj</em> and rulings, manners and behaviour springing from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> then he is the one who fears Allaah<em>Azza wa Jal</em> and <em>Taqwa</em> is attained with all of these matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when these matters – which we have mentioned – are acknowledged then the slave is driven to the <em>Taqwa</em> of Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em>, to having fear of Him and being aware of Him in every time, place and situation.  This is a great station which is the station of <em>al-Ihsaan</em> (perfection of worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>That you worship Allaah as if you see Him and if you cannot see Him then know that He sees you</strong></span>.'[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This station of <em>al-Ihsaan</em> (perfection of worship) is that a person has certainty that Allaah sees him and that Allaah hears all he says and hears; the beating of his heart, the feelings of his heart and what he thinks to himself.   Allaah<em>Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala</em> knows it and hears it and He sees his movements and when he is still.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the true believer regards Allaah with true greatness and he acknowledges that Allaah <em>Subhanah</em> hears everything that he says and knows everything he discusses, or thinks to himself and that Allaah has:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Angels <em>Kirâman </em>(honourable)<em> Kâtibîn</em> writing down (your deeds). They know all that you do</strong></span>. &gt;&gt; [al-Infitar: 11-12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if these distinguished feelings are found in the soul of a believer then he has acquired the characteristic of <em>Taqwa</em> which causes him to keep away from sinning,<em>Shirk, Bida’</em> and superstitions and he acquires the station of <em>al-Ihsaan</em>(perfection of worship) since he is aware of Allaah and he feels that Allaah sees him and he cannot hide anything of his affairs from Allaah not a little nor a lot, not even the like of an atom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a noble awareness and distinguished feeling which pushes one <em>-InshAllaah –</em> to the <em>Taqwa</em> of Allaah.  This cannot be reached except for the one who knows the correct <em>‘Aqeedah</em>, the correct rulings of <em>Halaal</em> and <em>Haraam</em> and knows the commands and prohibitions, the promise and the warnings from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em><strong><em>.  </em></strong>They are the ones who deserve the praise of Allaah <em>– Tabaraka wa Ta’ala –</em> He said; about them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allaah</strong></span>.&gt;&gt; [Fatir: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong>Allaah will exalt in degree those of you who believe and those who have been granted knowledge</strong>. &gt;&gt; [al-Mujadilah: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So strive to be from these types of people: i.e. that you combine knowledge and action.  That is the fruit of correct knowledge and having the <em>Taqwa</em> of Allaah <em>– Tabaraka wa Ta’ala –</em> and being aware of Him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is upon him to learn from the sources which contain the correct beliefs and correct methodologies, to read the <em>Salafi Tafseer</em> books, which are based upon the <em>Tafseer</em> of the Book of Allaah by the Book of Allaah, by the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah and by the <em>Fiqh</em> of the noble Companions those who lived through the descent of the revelation and were present at the time of the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> and lived with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They knew the aim of the Book and the Sunnah. They are the ones whose <em>Fiqh </em>should be held on to as they preserved the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em><em>.  </em>This is why the noble Messenger –<em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam –</em> when he spoke about splitting up into sects and spoke about the <em>Firqaat-Un Najeeyah</em> said: ‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Those who are upon what I am upon and my Companions</strong></span>.'[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this <em>Fiqh</em> of the true <em>Deen</em> of Allaah which the noble Companions had – which they acquired from the Book of Allaah and from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, from his sayings, actions, his teachings and his directives – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam –</em> it is obligatory upon us to take it as our reference.  The Companions are the intended believers in the saying of Allaah <em>– Tabaraka wa Ta’ala -:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him and follows other than the believers’ way. We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell – what an evil destination.</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [an-Nisaa: 115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a severe threat to the one who contends with Allaah and His Messenger and follows a path other than that of the believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So pay attention to this matter and strive to understand the way of the believers which they derived from the Book of Allaah, the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam </em>– and from his purifying and educating them upon the Book and the wisdom <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a great opportunity for you; understand from it the true <em>Deen</em> of Allaah and strive earnestly to make it apparent over all religions with proofs and evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is upon you to seek knowledge from its original watering sources; from the <em>Salafi</em> books of <em>Tafseer</em>, from the <em>Salafi</em> books of <em>‘Aqeedah</em>, which gush forth from the Book of Allaah and from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah –<em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em>.  The difference between the way of the truthful believers and the way of the innovating discriminators of the true <em>Manhaj</em> of Allaah will become clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They – I swear by Allaah – are the protectors of this <em>Ummah</em> upon the <em>Deen</em> of Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em>, they had the correct <em>‘Aqeedah</em> and <em>Manhaj</em> and they were firmly upon what Muhammad <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> came with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From what is understood principally, is that it is obligatory upon us to follow the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> to hold on firmly to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> and to bite onto that with our molar teeth, just as the Messenger of Allaah mentioned – when he gave an eloquent sermon whereby tears fell and the hearts trembled  – the Companions requested him to give them some advice they said ; O Messenger of Allaah it is as if this is a farewell sermon, so advise us, he said: ‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I advise you to fear Allaah…….</strong></span>’  pay attention to this advice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>….to hear and obey, whoever lives from amongst you will see many differences so it is upon you to hold on to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided <em>Khulafah</em>, bite on to it with your molar teeth, beware of newly invented matters, for every newly invented matter is a <em>Bida</em>’ and every <em>Bida’</em> is misguidance.</strong></span>’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[1] Translator’s note: Due to the saying of the noble Messenger of Allaah<em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> ‘Whoever does not thank the people does not thank Allaah.’ As narrated by Abee Sa’eed, &amp; authenticated by al-Albaani in as-Saheehah, I say that may Allaah reward with all goodness in this life and in the Hereafter the brother who facilitated us with the booklet and aided us in its translation.  And to our editor, may Allaah enter her into the highest grades of His Paradise among the Prophets, the Companions and the righteous for all her efforts.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Advice to the Salafiyyoon</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers, use <strong>beneficial knowledge</strong> and <strong>solid proof</strong> and <strong>beneficial wisdom</strong> in your <em>Dawa’</em>. You should have all the noble and <strong>beautiful manners</strong> encouraged by the Book and the Messenger of guidance; indeed they are causes for victory and causes for success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have to believe that the Companions did not spread Islaam or enter it into the hearts except with their <strong>wisdom</strong> and their <strong>knowledge</strong> more so than with their swords.  However, whoever enters into Islaam under the sword might not be firm, but whoever enters Islaam by way of knowledge, proof and evidence then this is what makes his Eemaan firm by Allaah’s permission and His assistance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is upon you to have these good methods and also to be serious about knowledge.  You have to be serious about <em>Dawa’</em> to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now – O brothers – I advise you with two issues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: Brotherhood between all of <em>Ahl -ul-Sunnah</em>; So O you Salafees, disseminate the soul of love and brotherhood between yourselves.  Put into effect what the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> informed us of regarding the believers: ‘Like a building, some of its parts supporting others.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that they are: ‘<strong>Like a single body if one limb complains then the rest of the body suffers with fever and insomnia</strong>.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is how you should be O brothers: distance yourselves from the causes of splitting, I swear by Allaah indeed it is a dangerous evil and a disastrous disease.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: distance yourselves from the causes which lead to enmity, hatred, splitting up and dissension.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Keep away from these things; because this has become predominant nowadays at the hands of people, about whom only Allaah knows their condition and intent.  It has become predominant and has torn apart the youth in this country – whether in the university or other than it – or in the other parts of the <em>Duniya</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why?! Because those who are not from its people – neither in knowledge nor in understanding – entered into the arena of giving <em>Dawa’</em> to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible that the enemies could have entered someone into the midst of the<em>Salafeeyeen</em> to tear them apart and split them up, and this issue is not unlikely, rather it can truly happen <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Strive to have brotherhood.  If any dissension has occurred between you, then both parties should make themselves forget what is past and start with a clean slate now.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say to the brothers: whoever falls short it is not allowed to debase him, nor destroy the one who is deficient.  Whoever makes a mistake amongst us we do not destroy him. <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em> – but we cure him with gentleness, wisdom and face him with love and friendship and all the rest of the righteous manners, along with the correct <em>Dawa’</em> until he repents.  And if there remains a weakness in him then we are not hasty with him, or otherwise, I swear by Allaah no one will remain, no one will remain!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are some people now who chase after the Salafis so much so that they reached the scholars and called them those who water things down <em>(Mumaya’een)</em>!! There is hardly any scholar in the arena of <em>Dawa’</em> today except that he has been falsely attacked with this claim about him!  Of course this is the way of the Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen and the way of <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> since, from the weapons of the <em>Ahl ul-Bid</em>a’ is that they begin by overthrowing the scholars, rather it is the Jewish Masonic way: that if you wanted to discredit an idea, then discredit their scholars or their personalities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So keep away from this rotten legacy and have respect for the scholars.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Chapter 13 : Warning Against Having Extremism in the Deen</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the great lessons of benefit for the pilgrim during his Hajj to the House of Allaah is the important lesson of taking the <strong>middle course and being just in all matters</strong>, keeping away from extremism, negligence, falling into excess or heedlessness. Allaah Ta’ala has said regarding this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Thus We have made you a just and the best nation, that you be witnesses over mankind and the Messenger be a witness over you.</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah: 143]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of His saying &lt;&lt; <strong>just and the best nation</strong> &gt;&gt; is: trustworthy witnesses, who do not shy away from the truth, so that they exaggerate, nor that they become unmindful but are are balanced and are just.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hajj is full of great experiences and magnificent lessons which show the great importance of the straight path and of being balanced. From the most important circumstances in this great issue is looking to the guidance of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and his Sunnah regarding <strong>stoning the Jamaar</strong> and considering it in light of what has been mentioned by the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam. After that, look at the state of the people in comparison to the Prophet’s Sunnah and you will see that the condition of these people is either that of exaggeration and excess or shortcoming and negligence, except for those whom Allaah has given the understanding of the religion and has honoured with adherence to the Prophetic Sunnah and imitation of his guidance and example.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Imaam Ahmad, Nis’aee and Ibn Majah on the authority of Abdullah bin ‘Abbas –RadhiAllaahu anhuma- who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘The Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said to me on the morning of ‘Aqaba while he was on his she-camel: ‘Collect small stones for me.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So I collected seven small stones for him from the little stones and began to shake off their dust from his palm while he was saying: ‘Throw stones the likes of these (type and size stones).’ </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Then he said: ‘O you people beware of exaggerating in the Deen because what destroyed those before you was indeed exaggeration in the Deen.’</strong></span> [1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This chain of narration is authentic according to the conditions of Muslim as Shaykh-ul-Islam -Rahimullaah- and others have mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- saying in the hadeeth: ‘Throw stones the likes of these (type and size stones).’ i.e. the stones that were gathered for him had a specified size as is mentioned in the hadeeth. The stones were the size of those used for stoning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word al-Hassa (stone) does not carry the meaning of small sized stones, such as pebbles, nor does it carry the meaning of a large sized stone, such as a rock but rather, what has been legislated is in between.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though this issue has been clearly discussed with detailed explanation, if you were to compare this to the actions of some Muslims ignorant of the Prophet’s -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- Sunnah you would find their actions relating to stoning the Jamaarat to be very strange. You will find them fluctuating between exaggeration and deficiency, increase and falling short or between excess and negligence. The truth, however, is found somewhere inbetween them. The Muslim does not have shortcomings regarding the Sunnah of the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- unlike those who are negligent and incompetent or those who are excessive and exaggerate. The Muslim is just and balanced.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards the saying of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -: ‘<strong>Beware of extremism</strong>.’ then this statement is general and it applies to all types of extremism in all aspects of belief and actions because the ruling derived is taken from the general wording of this hadeeth and not the specific reason for which the statement was revealed. The Muslim is prohibited from extremism in all circumstances and in all his affairs. He is ordered to follow the way of the Noble Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and adhere to his Sunnah in all circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the Shaytan strives absolutely to turn the believers, the slaves of Allaah, away from the right path and keep them far away from Allaah&#8217;s straight path either through extremism or negligence. The Shaytan uses every which way he can to be victorious.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as some of the Salaf said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Allaah did not command anything except that Shaytan incites evil with two commands; either negligence and shortcoming or exceeding the limits and extremism and he does not mind with which of the two he is victorious.’</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaytan is seated in the path of the Muslim. He does not become lax, nor does he become bored of his relentless plotting or his wait to ambush the Muslim. He strives absolutely to increase the Muslim in misguidance and to divert him from the straight path and clear guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn al-Qayyim -Rahimullaah</strong>&#8211; said in his great book ‘<strong>Ighatha allhaffan min Masayid ash-Shaytaan</strong>’ :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘From his (Shaytan&#8217;s) plots (may Allaah have protect us and you from him) is that he scrutinizes the soul until he knows which of the two strengths can be overcome, the strength of boldness and courage or the strength of abstention, humility and shame. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If Shaytan sees that the soul leans towards humility and abstention, he begins to hinder him and weaken the Muslim’s endeavour and resolve in what he has been ordered and charged with. So Shaytan makes it easy for him to leave that off until he regularly leaves off (what he has been ordered with) or lessens his (following) and neglects Allaah’s orders.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If Shaytan sees that the soul leans towards the strength of boldness, zeal and lofty aspirations, he causes him to undervalue the commands of Allaah and makes him imagine that what he has is insufficient such that he needs to exaggerate and do extra along with that. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Therefore, the Shaytan causes the first to reduce in what Allaah has commanded and causes the second to exceed. Most people, except very few, fall either reduction or excess &#8211; these two valleys &#8211; the valley of shortcoming and the valley of extremism. Only a very small number are steadfast on the path the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and what his Companions were upon.’</strong> </span>[2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Ibn al-Qayyim -Rahimullaah- cites many examples of this, from different angles of the Deen, dividing the people into three groups: the extremists, the negligent and the people of the middle and straight path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed being upright in all matters, taking the middle course and being far away from extremism and negligence is the correct methodology and the straight path which the believers are required to follow, just as Allaah commanded in His Book and His Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- ordered. So truly being in the middle and being upright is holding onto the restrictions Allaah has laid down for His slaves, such that whatever is not from the religion is not added to it nor is anything from the religion excluded. This is what Allaah entrusts the believers with and what He commands them with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta&#8217;ala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And those, who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor niggardly, but hold a medium (way) between those (extremes)</strong> </span>&gt;&gt; [al-Furqan :67]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta&#8217;ala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck, nor stretch it forth to its utmost reach (like a spendthrift), so that you become blameworthy and in severe poverty</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [al-Isra: 29]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Ta&#8217;ala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And give to the kindred his due and to the poor and to the wayfarer. But spend not wastefully (your wealth) in the manner of a spendthrift</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [al-Isra:26]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Ta&#8217;ala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>and eat and drink but waste not by extravagance</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [‘Aaraaf:31]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta&#8217;ala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And be moderate (or show no insolence) in your walking, and lower your voice</strong></span>&gt;&gt; [Luqmaan:19]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, it is authentically reported in the hadeeth of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘The middle course, the middle course will make you reach paradise.</strong></span>’[3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means: it is binding on you to take the middle course in all matters of speech and action. Moderation is being in the middle, between two extremes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also authentically reported in Musnad and others that the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Take the middle course of guidance, indeed the one who is severe in the Deen, then it will overcome him</strong></span>.’[4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas’ood –RadhiAllaahu anhu- used to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Being restrained within the Sunnah is better than striving in Bida</strong></span>’.’[5]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Deen of Allaah is in the middle, between the one who goes to extremes and the one who is negligent. The best of people are those in the middle who have raised themselves above the shortcoming of the neglectful, but do not join the exaggeration of those who go beyond the limits. Rather the best of people stick to the guidance of the leader of the Messengers, the one chosen by The Lord of the Worlds who is an example for all people, Muhammad bin Abdullah, may Allaah&#8217;s Peace and Prayers be upon him, his Family and all his Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Chapter 11: <strong>Shaving the Head<br />
<a title="Lessons of Creed Acquired From The Hajj – By ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2012/10/06/lessons-of-creed-acquired-from-the-hajj-by-abdurrazzaq-bin-abdul-muhsin-al-badr/">Lessons of Creed Acquired From The Hajj<br />
</a>By  Shaykh AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The actions of the day of an-Nahr, the tenth day of the month of Dhul-Hijjah, are indeed four well-known actions which are the stoning, the slaughter, shaving the head and then the Tawaaf. The discussion here will be about shaving the head or shortening the hair as worship for Allaah in obedience to Him and seeking closeness to Him on this great day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaving is completely removing the hair of the head while shortening is lessening the hair of the head all over. Shaving or shortening the hair is one of the obligations of Hajj and Umrah, it is not permissible to leave it, and the evidence is the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Certainly, you shall enter masjid al-Haram; if Allaah wills, secure, (some) having your heads shaved, and (some) having your head hair cut short, having no fear</strong></span>&gt;&gt; [Fath : 27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qadaamah –Rahimullaah- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘If it was not from the rites of Hajj, Allaah would not have described them this way.’</strong> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Bukhari and Muslim from the hadeeth of Ibn Abbas –RadhiAllaahu anhu- who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘When the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- came to Makkah he ordered his Companions to make Tawaaf of the House and of Safa and Marwa, then to come out of Ihraam and shave or shorten their hair.’</strong> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, it is one of the obligations of Hajj and Umrah. So whoever does not shave or shorten their hair, then it is necessary to atone for this by slaughtering a sacrificial animal. It (i.e. shaving/shortening) is a sign that the time period for Ihraam has ended and it imitates the actions of the Messenger &#8211; alayhi as-sallat wa sallam- where he shaved his head and ordered his Companions to shave their heads, casting aside their impurities and removing dishevelled hair. Shaving the head is the act of humbly placing the forehead in front of its Lord, due to His greatness, and in submission due to His Honour and it is from the most intense forms of Uboodiyah (worship) for Allaah Azza Wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when the Muslims performs this great act of obedience and important worship in reverence of Allaah and in imitation of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- it is obligatory upon him to <strong>know that shaving the head or shortening the hair is done to worship and seek closeness to Allaah and that it is not permissible to perform it for anyone other than Allaah –subhanahu wa Ta’ala</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great Imaam, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaykh-ul-Islaam ibn Taymeeyah -Rahimullaah–</strong></span> was asked about a people who shave their heads at the command of their shaykhs at such graves as they glorify while regarding it as a means seeking closeness to Allaah and worship: is all of this a Sunnah or a Bida? Is shaving the head, generally, a Sunnah or Bida?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He –Rahimullaah- replied: <strong>‘Shaving the head is of four types</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>One of them is shaving the head in Hajj and Umrah</strong></span> and this is from what Allaah and His Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- have ordered. It is legislated and ordered in the Book, the Sunnah and the consensus of the Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Certainly, you shall enter masjid al-Haram; if Allaah wills, secure, (some) having your heads shaved, and (some) having your head hair cut short, having no fear</span></strong>&gt;&gt; [Fath : 27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are multiple narrations on the authority of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallamthat he shaved his head in his Hajj and Umrah as did his Companions. From them were those who shaved their heads and some who shortened their hair. Shaving is better than shortening because <strong style="line-height:1.5;">the Prophet said: ‘O Allaah forgive those who shave their heads.’ The people said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and those who shorten their hair?’ He said ‘O Allaah forgive those who shave their heads.’ The people said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and those who shorten their hair?’ He said ‘O Allaah forgive those who shave their heads.’ The people said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and those who shorten their hair?’ He said: ‘And those who shorten their hair.’</strong><span style="line-height:1.5;"> [3]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the farewell Hajj he -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- commanded the Companions who had brought a sacrificial animal with them to shorten their hair if they had performed Tawaaf of the House and had walked between Safa and Marwa for Umrah and then to shave their heads once they had completed the Hajj. So (in this way) he combined for them, firstly, shortening their hair and, secondly, shaving their heads.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second type of shaving the head</strong> </span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">is for a need</span>, such as shaving the head for treatment</strong>. This is also permissible according to the Book, the Sunnah and the consensus of the scholars. Indeed Allaah has permitted the Muhrim (pilgrim), for whom it is not usually allowed to have his head shaved until completion of the Hajj rites, to shave his head if he is suffering as Allaah Ta’ala mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>and do not shave your heads until the Hady (sacrificial animal) reaches the place of sacrifice. And whosoever of you is ill or has an ailment in his scalp (necessitating shaving), he must pay a Fidyah (ransom) of either observing Saum (fasts) (three days) or giving Sadaqah (charity &#8211; feeding six poor persons) or offering sacrifice (one sheep)</strong> </span>&gt;&gt; [Baqarah :196]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What has been established by agreement of the Muslims is the hadeeth of Ka’b bin Ujraah that when the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- passed by him in the Umrah of Al-Hudaybiyah lice were falling from his head, so the Prophet said to him: ‘Are your lice harming you?’ K’ab replied: ‘Yes.’ So the Prophet said: ‘Shave your head and sacrifice a sheep, or fast three days or feed a group of six needy people.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The authenticity of this Hadeeth is agreed upon and has been received with acceptance by all the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The third type of shaving the head is that which is done for worship, religion and Zuhd (abstention from loving worldly things) in other than Hajj or Umrah</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, some of the people command the one who repents, once he has repented to shave his head. Similar is the one who shaves the head as a sign of being from the people of rituals and religion or as a sign of the perfection of Zuhd and worship or as a sign that the one who shaves is better, more religious or has more Zuhd than the one who does not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there are those who adhere to certain shaykhs such that if they repent, they shave their heads or they cut some of his hair. So the shaykh specifies who should have the scissors and prayer rug so he can pray on that rug (and not with the Muslims). His cutting hair from the heads of the people is from the complete authority befitting him and someone who is imitated in order to make the people repent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So all of this is Bida’ which has neither been commanded by Allaah, nor by His Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</strong>. It is not obligatory nor has it been recommended by any one scholar of the Deen. Not one of the Companions did this, nor did any of those who followed the companions in goodness, neither the scholars of the Muslims who were well known for Zuhd and worship nor the Companions, the successors or those who came after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There were those who accepted Islam at the time of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- but he never used to order them to shave their heads if they entered Islaam nor did he cut anyone’s hair. He didn’t pray on a rug but, rather, he used to pray as an Imaam with all the Muslims. He used to pray on what they used to pray, sit where they used to sit and he never used to make himself distinct from them by sitting on something special, whether a prayer rug or anything else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever takes this Bida’ -which is not obligatory or even recommended- as a means of seeking closeness and obedience or as a path to Allaah making it a completion of the Deen or orders the repentant to do it, both the Zahid (the one who abstains from loving worldly things) and the worshipper, then he is a misguided person outside the path of ar-Rahmaan (Allaah the Most Merciful), following the footsteps of the Shayateen.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Shaykh ul-Islaam –Rahimullaah- mentioned <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>the fourth type of shaving the head</strong></span> which is shaving the head as other than a ritual or for other than a need, neither seeking closeness to Allaah nor seeking to be religious. He mentions that the people of knowledge have two opinions regarding this, which are two narrations attributed to Imaam Ahmad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first is that it is disliked and this is the Madhab of Maalik and others. The second is that it is permissible and this is well known amongst the companions of Abu Haneefa and ash-Shafi&#8217;ee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Imaam Ahmad mentions the evidence that the scholars use for each of these sayings. [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim</strong> mentions a similar division to what has preceded in his book &#8216;Zaad al-Ma&#8217;ad&#8217;. He mentions that from the different types of shaving the head there is one that is Shirk and one that is Bida’. <strong>Shirk being the one shaving his head for other than Allaah –Subhaanhu- such as those who follow shaykhs and who shave their heads for their shaykhs</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of them will say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;I have shaved my head for so-and-so and you have shaved your head for soand-so.’ This is the same as saying: ‘I have done Sadjah (prostration) for so- and-so,’ because shaving the head is done with humility, in worship and with submissiveness and it is done for the completion of Hajj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he mentions that the misguided shaykhs deceive their followers by causing them to shave their heads for them, just as they mislead them into prostrating to them. [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this is clear Shirk and a great lie, we ask Allaah for security.</p>

He knows you well when He created you from the earth (Adam), and when you were fetuses in your mothers&#8217; wombs. So ascribe not purity to yourselves. He knows best him who fears Allaah and keep his duty to Him [i.e. those who are <em>Al-Muttaqûn </em>(pious)].&gt;&gt;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Najm: 32]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[Aala Imraan: 188]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta&#8217;ala said:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">1 &#8211; From Ubaad bin Tameem from his uncle from the Prophet  :</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[an-Nihaaya 2/516]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 &#8211; It has been mentioned about Umar</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">أنّه عاتب أبيّا عندما رأى الناس يمشون خلفه ، فنهره و زجره قائلا : &#8221; كُفَّ عن هذا ، فإنها فتنة للمتبوع مذلة للتابع</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">That he rebuked a person when he saw that the people were all walking behind him, he said: &#8216;Stop this, it is a Fitnah for the one who is being followed, and a humiliation for those who follow him.&#8217;</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">6 &#8211; Imam Ahmad said to his student, when he came to know the praise of the people for him:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">10 &#8211; Ibn Hazm said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8216;Whoever is trialed with being amazed of his own self, then he should think about his faults, if he is amazed by his virtues, then he should check his disgraceful and vile manners, if his faults are hidden from him generally, so much so that he thinks he has no faults, then let him know that his problem is until eternity, and he is the foremost of the people in his deficiencies and the greatest of them in faults, and the weakest of them in determining his faults.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The first of that is: he is a weak minded ignoramus, and there is no fault more severe than these two. Because the intelligent one is he who can determine faults by himself, and he overcomes them and he tries to correct them.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">A stupid person is ignorant about his own faults: either due to having little knowledge, and his lack of understanding and determining, and his weak thought, or because he regards his faults as noble characteristics.&#8217;</span></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From Anas <em>&#8211; RadhiAllaahu anhu &#8211;</em> who said: &#8216;A Bedouin came to the Prophet<em> &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> and said: &#8216;O Messenger of Allaah!  Teach me some goodness.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet <em> &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> took him by the hand and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8221; قل: سبحان الله، والحمد لله، ولا إله إلا الله، والله أكبر.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>‘Say: ‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu Akbar.)&#8217;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Bedouin counted them on his hand, when he finished he began to reflect then came back to the Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> smiled and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &#8216;The desperate one has reflected.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Bedouin came and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O Messenger of Allaah! ‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest.’  This is for Allaah, what is for me?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>اللهم اغفر لي وارحمني وعافني وارزقني واهدني</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8216;Say: O Allaah forgive me, and have mercy on me, and pardon me, and provide for me, and guide me.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8216;O Bedouin! If you say: <em>&#8216;SubhanAllah&#8217;</em>, Allaah says: &#8216;you have spoken the truth,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If you say: <em>&#8216;Alhamdulillah&#8217;</em>, Allaah says: &#8216; you have spoken the truth, </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If you say: <em>‘</em><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em>, Allaah says: &#8216;you have spoken the truth,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If you say: <em>Allaahu Akbar</em>, Allaah says: &#8216;you have spoken the truth, </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If you say: O Allaah forgive me, Allaah says: I have done so,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If you say: O Allaah have mercy on me, Allaah says: I have done so, </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If you say: O Allaah give me provision, Allaah says: I have done so,</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Bedouin  counted it seven times on his fingers,  then went away.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Muhaddith al-Albaani</strong> <em>-Rahimullaah &#8211;</em> said :</p>

So I performed a <em>Sajdah</em> to Allaah thankful for His success and I ask Him for an increase in His excellence.&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1 &#8211; Objective of <em>Khutbah</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr <strong>Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah</strong> (d.751 A.H.) -Rahimullaah- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘On the day of Jumu&#8217;ah<em>’</em> there is a <em>Khutbah</em> (sermon) the objective of which is to glorify Allaah and regard Him as Magnificent, and testify to singling out Allaah Alone as the Creator, and testify that His Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> brought the message.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Also to remind the worshippers about the Messenger’s days. To warn the people from Allaah’s  torment and His punishment, and advising them with that which will bring them closer to Allaah and to His Paradise.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Likewise prohibiting them from that which will bring them close to His Anger and His Fire. Therefore, this is the purpose / intent of the <em>Khutbah</em> and gathering for it.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Zad al-Ma’ad’ by Ibn Qayyim vol. l/p. 398 point 22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2 &#8211; Description of the <em>Khutbah</em> and what is Taught in it.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Muhhadith Muhammad Nasir- Deen <strong>Al-Albaani</strong> (d.1420A.H) <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Know that the type of <em>Khutbah</em> which is legislated is that which the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> regularly used to be upon, which was <span style="color:#993300;"><b style="color:#993300;">persuading (with good rewards) the people </b><span style="color:#993300;"><b>dissuading</b></span><b style="color:#993300;"> (warning) them</b></span>-this in reality is the soul of the <em>Khutbah</em> for which it was legislated.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">‘</span><span style="color:#ff0000;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Admonition</strong></span> </span>in the <em>Khutbah</em> of <em>Jumma’</em> is what should be the context of the talk. Therefore, if the <em>Khateeb</em> (the one delivering the <em>Khutbah</em>) does this, then he has performed a legislated action, except that if he precedes it with praising and glorifying Allaah, and sending <em>Salat</em> upon His Messenger, or to proceed in his admontion the catastrophies mentioned in the Qur’aan then this would be better and more complete.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘So briefly, the soul of the <em>Khutbah</em> is giving a good admonition from the Qur’aan or other than it. The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>used to praise Allaah –Ta’ala- in his <em>Khutbah</em> and send <em>Salat</em> upon Allaah’s Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>or by the two testifications and reading a complete <em>Soorah</em> and the intent and purpose of the admonitioning with the Qur’aan, and prompt with what the Qur&#8217;aan rebukes, where ever possible, and that is not specific to mentioning a complete <em>Soorah</em>.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> used to teach his Companions in the <em>Khutbah</em> the principles of Islaam and its <em>Sharia’</em> and gave them orders and prohibitions in his <em>Khutbah </em>when he came across an order or prohibition. Like when he ordered the person entering into the <em>Masjid</em> while the Prophet was delivering the <em>Khutbah</em> and he ordered him to pray two <em>Rakaat</em>. The Prophet reminded the people with the pillars of the <em>Sharia’</em> and with Paradise, Hell-fire the Day of Judgement and ordered them to have <em>Taqwa</em> of Allaah and warned them against the anger of Allaah. The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> would encourage the people in those things which obligate His Pleasure, and he would recite the <em>Ayaat</em> of the Qur’aan, so in the hadeeth of (Saheeh) Muslim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>used to deliver two <em>Khutbahs</em> and sit between them, he would also recite the Qur’aan, remind the people and warn them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘al-Ajwiba an-Nafiah ‘an  ‘Asseelah lajna Masjid aj-Jamia’ summarised from p.94 -99]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3 &#8211; Shortening of the <em>Khutbah</em> &amp; Lengthening of the prayer</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Muhhadith Muhammad Nasir- Deen <strong>Al-Albaani</strong> (d.1420A.H) <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;From ‘Amaar bin Yassir who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Indeed a person who lengthens the prayer and shortening the <em>Khutbah</em> is a sign of the <em>Fiqh</em> of a man.’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Imam Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning that a person’s <em>Fiqh</em> (understanding) is known by this. Everything that indicates to a issue is a sign for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the shortening of the <em>Khutbah</em> is a sign of understanding.  This is becase a <em>Faqeeh </em>(scholar) is someone who researches the reality of the meaning of the texts [of the Book &amp; the Sunnah], and comprehensive wording, whereby he has the ability to express using eloquent beneficial statements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the complete wording of this hadeeth is :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Lengthen the prayer, and shorten the <em>Khutbah</em>, and indeed there is magic in speech.’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of a long prayer is the length where the one who prays does not come under the prohibited length of the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> used to pray the <em>Jumma’</em> prayer reciting Soorah al-Jumma’ and Soorah al-Munafiqoon, and likewise as is collected by Muslim from Ibn Abbas and an-Num’aan bin Basheer <em>-RadhiAllaahu anhumma</em> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">‘The Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> used to recite in the two <em>Eid</em> prayers and in the <em>Jumma’</em>prayer with Soorah al-Ala and al-Ghashiyah</span></strong> [1].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was long in relation to his <em>Khutbah</em>, and not so long that it entered into the length which is prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Umm Hisham bint Haritha bin an-Nu’maan who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">‘I did not take &lt;&lt;Qaf, By the Glorious Qur’aan&gt;&gt; <em>Soorah Qaf</em>, except from the mouth of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>; he would recite it every Friday upon the <em>Mimber</em> when he would address the people.’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this narration is an evidence for the permissibiltiy for reading a <em>Soorah</em> or a part of it in the <em>Khutbah</em>. The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> chose to be continuous upon this <em>Soorah</em> since he<em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was the best in giving admonition and in reminding.  Also, in this is an evidence of frequently giving admonition in the <em>Khutbah</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from Ajwibaa an-Nafi Albaani p. 57 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4 &#8211; Length of the <em>Jumma’ Khutbah</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>used to shorten the <em>Khutbah</em> and lengthen the prayer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was given the ‘<em>Jawama’ al-Kalim</em>’ (comprehensive speech), and fountains of wisdom would spring from between his noble lips <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.  Therefore, if he <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em> addressed the people he would speak with a few words, if a person counted them then he would be able to do so, because the aim of the <em>Khutbah</em> is teaching, reminding, admonishing without making it burdensome or making it boring.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the advice of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>to his Companions was to shorten speeches, and at the head of that was the <em>Khutbah</em> of <em>Jumma’</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em> explained that the shortening of the <em>Khutbah</em> indicates to the good understanding [<em>Fiqh</em>] of a person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From ‘Ammar bin Yassir -Radi Allaahu anhu- who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">‘Indeed a person who lengthens the prayer and shortens the <em>Khutbah</em> is a sign of the <em>Fiqh</em>of a man.’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected in Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Abdullah bin Masood who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘Indeed shortening the <em>Khutbah</em> and lengthen the prayer is a sign of the <em>Fiqh</em> of a man.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ibn Abee Shaybah, Saheeh. Taken From: ‘Ma Saha min ‘Athar Sahabah Fee Fiqh’ p.486 Vol.1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>commanded to shorten the <em>Khutbah</em> and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">‘Lengthen the prayer and shorten the <em>Khutbah</em>.’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected in Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From ‘Ammar bin Yassir -Radi Allaahu anhu- who said: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em> ordered us to shorten the <em>Khutbah</em>.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Abu Dawood &#8211; <em>Hasan</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the instruction from him <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>and his guidance upon which he followed and continued upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Jabir bin Samarah who said: <strong><span style="color:#808000;">The Messenger of Allaah<em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> would not lengthen the admonition on Friday, rather it would be a few words.’</span></strong> [Collected by Abu Dawood &#8211; <em>Hasan lighayrihi</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>used to sometimes lengthen the <em>Jumma’ Khutbah</em>, however generally it would be short.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said: ‘He would sometimes shortens his <em>Khutbah</em>, and lengthen it sometimes according to the needs of the people. His irregular <em>Khutbah</em> would be longer than his regular <em>Khutbah</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Zaad al-Ma’ad 1/191)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from the book: &#8216;Min Hadi an-Nabi <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> fee Khutbah ul &#8211; Jumma&#8217; p.22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Not Leaving Off Hajj for More than Five Years</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 1662 &#8211; The Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam said:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">No.2765 &#8211; On the authority of Safwaan bin Umayyah who said: A man came to the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam: wearing a lot of coloured perfume on his clothing, he was wearing different pieces of clothing and he had already assumed Ihraam for Umrah. He said: ‘What do you order me to do, O Messenger of Allaah, in my Umrah?’ Then Allaah -Azza wa Jal- revealed: &lt;&lt;Complete the Hajj and Umrah for Allaah &gt;&gt; So the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: ‘Where is the person who asked the question about Umrah?’ The man said: ‘Here I am.’ So the Messenger said: ‘Remove your clothing and take a bath, clean off the perfume as much as you can and whatever you used to do for your Hajj, then do that in your Umrah.’</p>

Silsilah-Saheehah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Benefit: Ibn Hajr said in ‘al-Fath’ (3/394): Ibn al-Muneer said in ‘al-Hashiyah’: ‘What the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said was: “Wassna’,” (i.e. the Arabic word for ‘do, make’) which means: ‘To leave something,’ because the clarification meant what a Muhrim keeps away from. So, the benefit taken from this explanation is that ‘leaving something is an action in itself.’</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">The Prohibition of the Woman in Ihram Covering her Face with a Scarf</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2930 &#8211; On the authority of ‘Uqbah bin ‘Aamr al-Juhanee who said: ‘My sister vowed that she would walk to the Ka’bah barefoot and unveiled. So the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- came to her and said: ‘What is wrong with this woman?’ They said: She vowed to walk to the Ka’bah barefoot and unveiled! So he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> ‘Order her to take a ride, cover herself, perform the Hajj and slaughter an animal.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh<br />
Silsilah-Saheehah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘In this hadeeth there are some important benefits, from them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That the Ihram of the woman is for her face, so it is not permissible for her to cover her face with her Khimaar (scarf), rather she covers her head and chest. This is like the hadeeth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> ‘A woman in Ihram does not wear a Niqaab (face veil), nor does she wear gloves.’ </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Narrated by Bukhari and Muslim.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Important note: Shaykh al-Albaani said in his book: ‘The Rites of Hajj and Umrah’ (p.12)</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘It is permissible for the woman to cover her face with something like a Khimaar or Jilbaab, which she throws over her head and it sits on her face. What is correct is that it can touch her face, but she cannot tie it to her face. </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is similar to what Ibn Taymeeyah -Rahimahullaah said.]’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2617 -The Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘O Allaah this Hajj has no ostentation in it nor any hypocrisy.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">The Permissibility of the Person in Ihram Covering his Face if Needed.</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2899 &#8211; On the authority of Uthmaan bin ‘Affan –RadiAllaahu anhu- that</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘The Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- would cover his face while he was in a state of Ihram.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh<br />
Silsilah-Saheeha</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abdullaah bin ‘Aamir bin Rabeeh that</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>he saw ‘Uthmaan bin ‘Affan in a village near Madina with his face covered by a deep red coloured, velvet cloth on a summer’s day while he was a Muhrim (in the state of Ihram).</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Its chain is authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said: ‘So if you know that the chain of narration is authentic, then there is no contradiction between this hadeeth and the report which is Mawqoof (the Isnad only goes back to the Companion) at ‘Uthmaan, as is apparent. This is because there is nothing that conflicts with the acceptability of ‘Uthmaan doing that which it is possible the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is better (that the hadeeth and the Athar correspond) rather than attributing a mistake to one of the trustworthy narrators simply because ‘Uthmaan did an action that he narrated from the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam. Do you not also see that there is no difference between what ad-Daraqutni -Rahimullaah- noted, saying that the Mawqoof (the Isnad only goes back to the Companion) precedes the Marfoo’ (a narration ascribed to the Prophet), and those who invert the issue saying that the Marfoo’ precedes the Mawqoof.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The truth is that both of them are authentic, so neither of them opposes the other. Indeed there are many Aathaar narrated by the Companions, the Tabieen and the diligent Imaams which permit the person in a state of Ihram to cover his face if need be. Ibn Hazm uses these Aathaar as evidence in his book ‘al-Muhalla’ (7/91-93) so as to support the original stance. Al-Bayhaqi also narrated some of these Aathaar (5/54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth does not oppose the saying of the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallamregarding the person who dies while in a state of Ihram:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Wash him with water mixed with Acacia leaves, shroud him in his clothing and do not cover his face or head.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Muslim and other than him and it is narrated in the book ‘al-Irwaa’ (4/198-199).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verdict is specific to the one who dies in a state of Ihram but the hadeeth under discussion is regarding the living, so it (i.e. the ruling) is different.’</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">What Animals are Permissible for the Muhrim to Kill</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 193 -‘Five types of animals which, if a Muhrim kills, there is no blame upon him: a crow, a predatory bird, a rat, scorpion and a voracious dog.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of Ibn Umar in a narration ascribed to the Prophet: -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘From what is clear in this hadeeth is the absence of blame, which shows the permissibility of killing them. It is not to be understood from this that it is recommended or obligatory to kill them or that it is better leave off killing them.’</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Talbeeyah</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 830 &#8211; On the authority of Zaid bin Khalid al-Juhanee, on the authority of the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Jibraeel came to me and said: O Muhammad! Order your Companions to raise their voices with the Talbeeyah (proclamation for Hajj or Umrah), since it is from the signs of Hajj.’ </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 1500 &#8211; On the authority of Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq who said that</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- was asked: ‘What is the best Hajj?’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>He answered ‘The one where you raise your voice reciting the Talbeeyah and you slaughter an animal.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 1621 &#8211; On the authority of Abu Huraira in a narration ascribed to the Prophet: -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘A person does not ever make Talbeeyah except that he is given glad tidings, nor does a person ever say Takbeer except that he is given glad tidings.’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> It was asked: ‘With Paradise?’ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>He answered: ‘Yes.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Mina</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 804 &#8211; On the authority of Ibn Abbas: the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam used to visit the House (Ka’bah) every night from the nights of Mina.’</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Tawwaaf</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2725 &#8211; On the authority of Abdullaah bin Umar who said I heard the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Whoever makes seven circuits of Tawwaaf around the House (Ka’bah) and prays two Rakats, it is the same as freeing a slave.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Salutation of the House &#8211; for the person not in Ihram- is Two Rakah</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadeeth has no chain &#8211; La Asl laha<br />
No.1012 ‘Salutation of the House is done with Tawwaaf.’<br />
The Hadeeth has no chain &#8211; La Asl laha</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Silsilah-Daeefah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I say: I do not know, neither from the sayings or actions of the Sunnah, that which attests the meaning of this hadeeth other than the general evidences which mention praying before sitting in the Masjid which then include the Masjid al-Haraam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The assertion that salutation of the Masjid al-Haraam is the Tawwaaf opposes the general evidence previously mentioned. So, this salutation cannot be accepted until it can be affirmed and how inconceivable is that? Especially as – due to experience &#8211; it is not possible for the person entering the Masjid al-Haraam during the days of the sacred seasons to perform the Tawwaaf every time he enters it, so praise be to Allaah Who has made the matter easy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And He has not placed any burden upon you in your religion&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed what must be brought to attention here regarding this verdict is that it is for the person who is not a Muhrim. As for the person who is in Ihram then the rightful Sunnah is that he begins with the Tawwaaf and then the two Rakah after it.’</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">The Hajj Pilgrimage is Only Made to the House of Allaah</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Da’eefah No. 265 Mawdoo- Fabricated</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O Abu Huraira! Teach the people the Quran and learn it, because if you died upon that, the Angels would visit your grave just as they visit the Ancient House (Ka’bah). Teach the people my Sunnah, even if they dislike it. If you would like not to stop on the bridge on the Day of Judgement, even for the blink of an eye until you enter Paradise, then do not innovate with your opinion.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mawdoo- Fabricated<br />
Silsilah-Daeefah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ibn al-Jawzi mentions this narration in his book ‘al-Mawdoo’aat’ (The Fabricated Ahadeeth) (1/264) and he said: ‘Not authentic and Abu Hammam (one of the narrators) is Muhammad bin Mujeeb.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahya said: ‘He is a liar.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Haatim said: ‘He is lost in hadeeth (i.e. rejected).’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Sooyuti brings a similar narration but mentions the wording: ‘If death comes to you and you are in this state then the Angels perform Hajj (pilgrimage) to your grave just as the believers perform Hajj to the House of Allaah, the Haraam.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Sooyuti remained silent about this; but I have a more severe hatred for this wording than the first &#8211; due to what it mentions about performing Hajj to a grave &#8211; as it is an innovated statement which has no origin in the Sharia’. Also, performing Hajj to a visited thing other than the House of Allaah, the Haraam, is not mentioned in the Sharia’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for performing Hajj (Pilgrimage) to graves, then that is done by Ahl-ul-Bida’ (the people of Bida’) who aggrandize graves to extreme by journeying to them, spending nights there, performing Tawwaaf around them, making Dua’, begging and imploring of the graves and other similar things which are all symbols of the Hajj. Some of them even authored a book entitled ‘The Rites of Making Hajj to Shrines and Graves’ as a refutation of what Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah mentioned in his books!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is major misguidance and no Muslim who has smelt the fragrance of pure Tawheed will doubt that this is the thing most disliked by the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-. So how can it be conceived possible that the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- made this statement: ‘the Angels would visit your grave just as they visit the Ancient House (Ka’bah).’ O Allaah! Indeed the heart testifies that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- never said even one of the letters from this statement. May Allaah disfigure the one who fabricated this.’</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Raml</h2>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">The Sharia’ Reasoning for the Brisk Walk During Tawwaaf</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2573 &#8211; On the authority of Ibn Abbas –RadiAllaahu anhu- ‘The Quraish said: ‘Indeed Muhammad and his Companions have been weakened by the fever of Yathrib.’ So in the year the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – performed Umrah he said to his Companions: ‘<strong>Walk briskly around the Ka’bah so the Mushrikeen can see your strength</strong>.’ So when they walked briskly the Quraish said: ‘It has not weakened them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh<br />
Silsilah-Saheehah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This chain is Saheeh according to the conditions of Imam Muslim. Bukhari narrates it without a complete chain in his ‘Saheeh’ (5/86) on the authority of Hamad bin Salamah in a narration similar to this, as does Hamad bin Zayd in a narration on the authority of Ayoob whose wording is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘The Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- commanded them to walk briskly for three circuits and walk calmly between the two corners so the Mushrikeen could see their strength and patience.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Mushrikeen said: ‘These are those whom you claimed had been weakened by the fever. They are stronger and more patient than such and such!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In ‘al-Musnad’ (1/305) via another chain which is narrated on the authority of Abu Tufail from Ibn ‘Abbas that when the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- stopped at a place not far from Makkah called ‘Marra az-Zahran’ on his way to Umrah, it reached the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- that the Quraish were saying: What has caused them to come here feeble and thin?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his Companions said: ‘If we slaughter our camels, eat from their meat and make a broth from its soup, then we will be relaxed when we enter upon the people tomorrow.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger said: ‘Do not do that, but gather your provisions and bring them to me.’ So they gathered them for the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and spread out a tablecloth made from leather. They ate, and had eaten satisfactorily, then left and every one of them took some in their sacks. Then the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- turned and went ahead until he entered the Masjid – and the Quraish were sitting near the black stone. The Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- uncovered one of his shoulders through his top garment then said: ‘Do not let the people see you as deficient/weak.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He touched the corner and entered Tawwaaf, passing by the Yemeni corner and walking to the Black Stone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Quraish said: ‘Just walking in the Tawwaaf does not please them, but they leap and jump like gazelles.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- did that for three circuits and so it became the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Tufail said: ‘Ibn ‘Abbas informed me that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- did this in his farewell Hajj.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Its chain is also authentic according to the conditions of Imam Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was also narrated by al-Bayhaqi in his book ‘Dala’il an-Naboowa’ (3/3/1) through two routes. Muslim narrated it (4/64) by way of al-Jareeri on the authority of Abu Tufail with a similar narration and it has been researched in ‘al-Irwaa’ (4/315).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was also narrated via ‘Atta on the authority of Ibn Abbas who said: ‘Indeed the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- walked, and he walked briskly, around the House (Ka’bah) to show the Mushrikeen his strength.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Benefit: Perhaps someone might say: ‘If the Sharia’ reason for the brisk walk during the Tawwaaf was to show the Mushrikeen the strength of the Muslims, then can it not be said that as the reason for doing the action has ceased, then the legislation of the brisk walk should cease<br />
too?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer: No, because the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – walked briskly in his Tawwaaf after that first Umrah, in his farewell Hajj, as is mentioned in the long hadeeth of Jabir and by other than him, such as this hadeeth of Ibn Abbas with the previous narration of Abu Tufail. This is why Ibn Hibban said in his book ‘Saheeh’ (6/47 al-Ihsaan): ‘So this objection has been cleared up and the brisk walk during Tawwaaf remains prescribed upon the Ummah of al- Mustafa &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – until the Day of Judgement.’</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Iltizaam</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No.2138- On the authority of Abdullaah bin ‘Amr who said</p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Arafat</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2551 &#8211; On the authority of ‘Aeysha that the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: ‘</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>There is no other day in which Allaah frees more slaves from the fire than the Day of ‘Arafah. Indeed, He comes close to them then boasts about them to the Angels and then He says: ‘What do these people want?’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Jamaraat</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2515 &#8211; On the authority of Ibn Abbas who said that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> ‘If you stone the Jamaar (pillars) it will be as light for you on the Day of Judgement.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 1437 &#8211; The Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam said: ‘Stone the Jamarah with pebbles the size of chick peas.’</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Gathering the Pebbles for Stoning the Jamaraat from Mina and not from Muzdalifah</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2144 &#8211; On the authority of al-Fadl bin Abbas who said</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam said to the people when they left on the evening of ‘Arafat and Muzdalifah: ‘You should be tranquil.’ He said this while he was preventing his female camel from speeding until he entered Mina and descended in a place between Mina and Muzdalifah. Then he said: ‘You should take pebbles the size of chick peas, with which you can stone the Jamarah.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then al-Fadl said: ‘and the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- was demonstrating with his hand just as when a person throws.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh<br />
Silsilah-Saheehah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Benefit: Nisa’ee wrote a chapter heading for this hadeeth saying: ‘From where does one collect the pebbles?’ indicating by this that collecting pebbles takes place in Mina and the hadeeth regarding this is clear. This is because the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- ordered them to do this when he stopped at a place called ‘Muhassir’, while he was in Mina, as is mentioned in the narration of Muslim and al-Bayhaqi.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What also indicates this is the apparent hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbas who said: The Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said to me on the morning of ‘Aqabah while he was on his she-camel: ‘Collect small stones for me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I collected small pebbles for him which were like chickpeas and when I placed them in his palm, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘The likes of these (type and size stones), O you people. Beware of exaggerating in the Deen, as indeed what destroyed those before you was exaggeration in the Deen.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Nisa’ee, al-Bayhaqi and Ahmad (1/215,247) with an authentic chain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the evidence here is his saying: ‘early at ‘Aqabah’ by which he means the early morning in which you stone the large Jamarat al-‘Aqabah, and from what is apparent from the hadeeth is that the act of collecting the pebbles took place in Mina, near the Jamarah. As for what people do today, collecting pebbles in Muzdalifah, we do not know an origin for it in the Sunnah, rather it opposes these two ahadeeth and it contains burden and inconvenience with no benefit.’</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Does the Person Performing Hajj Walk to the Jamarah to Stone it?</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2072 &#8211; On the authority of Ibn Umar –RadiAllaahu anhu- that</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘The Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- would walk to the Jamarah if he wanted to stone it; he would walk to it and walk back from it.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh<br />
Silsilah-Saheehah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Benefit: Tirmidhi said at the end of this hadeeth: ‘Most of the people of knowledge implement this hadeeth while some of them say: He would ride on the day of an-Nahr (slaughtering) and would walk for the days other than the day of an-<br />
Nahr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tirmidhi continues: ‘It is as if the person who said this statement intended to follow the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- in his action, because indeed what is narrated of the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- is that he rode on the day of an-Nahr to go to stone the Jamarah and only Jamarat ul-‘Aqabah is stoned on the day of an-Nahr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say (Albaani): As for the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- stoning the Jamarat ul- ‘Aqabah while he was riding, then this is mentioned in the long hadeeth of Jaabir cited in the book ‘The Hajj of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam’ from the narration of Muslim and others. This is why the hadeeth of Ibn Umar (above) that when the Prophet intended ‘to stone the Jamarat, he would walk to it and walk back from it’ is explained to mean other than the stoning of the day of an-Nahr, thereby reconciling this hadeeth of Ibn Umar with the hadeeth of Jaabir, and Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I came across that which supports this opinion, from the narration of Abdullaah bin Umar on the authority of Nafi’ with the wording: ‘On the authority of Ibn Umar: that he used to come to the Jamaar during the three days after the day of an-Nahr, going back and forth walking and he mentioned that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- used to do that.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Abu Dawood(1969) and Ahmad 92/156)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration by Ahmad (2/114,138):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Umar used to stone the Jamarat ul-‘Aqabah while riding on his animal on the day of an- Nahr and he never used to go to the other Jamaarat after that except that he would go back and forth walking. He asserted that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- never used to go back and forth to the Jamaarat, except on foot.’</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Everything is Permissible After Stoning the Jamaarat al-‘Aqabah Except Women</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 239 &#8211; On the authority of Ibn Abbas –RadiAllaahu anhu- who said that: The Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘When you stone the Jamarah, then everything except women becomes permissible.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh<br />
Silsilah-Saheehah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Benefit: In this hadeeth is a clear proof that when the person on Hajj has stoned the Jamaarat al- ‘Aqabah then all the prohibitions of Ihraam are lifted except for the prohibition of intercourse with women; this is not permissible for him as has been unanimously agreed.’</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Slaughter</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 805- On the authority of Jaabir who said: we used to preserve the slaughtered meat and take it to Madina during the time of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.’</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">After the Completion of Hajj</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No.1379 – On the authority of ‘Aeysha in a narration ascribed to the Prophet: -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 883- On the authority of ‘Aeysha that she would carry Zam-Zam water, and she would say that</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam used to carry Zam-Zam water in leather water sacks and jugs, and he used to pour it on the sick and give it to them to drink.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">The Permissibility of Visiting the Prophet’s -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- Grave</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2497 &#8211; On the authority of ‘Aasim bin Humaid as-Sakooni –RadiAllaahu anhu- that when the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- sent Mu’adh to Yemen, he came out with him to advise him. Mu’adh was riding and the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- was walking next to his riding animal. When the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; had advised him he said: O Mu’adh! Indeed you might not meet me after this year and perhaps you will pass by my Masjid and my grave.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh<br />
Silsilah-Saheehah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Benefit: ‘Dr. al-Booti uses this hadeeth in the last part of his book ‘Fiqh as-Seerah’ as evidence for the permissibility of visiting the Prophet’s -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- grave – claiming that Ibn Taymeeyah rejects this visiting!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though we do not oppose his use of this proof, as it is indeed clear, we notify the readers that this is a false claim and a lie against Ibn Taymeeyah -Rahimullaah. Indeed his books make clear and abundant mention of its legality and he even expounded on how to visit the grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What Ibn Taymeeyah rejected was intending a journey to visit the grave as is the meaning of the hadeeth: ‘Do not undertake a journey except to three Masajid…’ which I have explained in detail with the sayings of Ibn Taymeeyah himself in my refutation of al-Booti entitled: ‘In defense of the Prophetic hadeeth.’ So what does the doctor intend by persisting with this slander which is even in the latest print of his book? Intelligent readers know the answer.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 45 &#8211; ‘Whoever performs the Hajj of the House (Ka’bah) and does not visit me has indeed treated me badly.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fabricated- Mawdoo<br />
Silsilah-Daeefah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Benefit: From what indicates its being fabricated is that ill-treatment of the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- is from the major sins, if not disbelief. So if the one who does not visit the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- has committed a great sin, then this necessitates that this visit is obligatory, like Hajj, which no Muslim would say. This is because even though visiting the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- is from the actions that bring one closer to Allaah, it does not exceed the status of being only recommended by the scholars. So how can it be that the one who leaves off visiting it is harsh to the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallamand is one who turns away from him!?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, His family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source:<strong> <a title="Lessons of Creed Acquired From The Hajj – By ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2012/10/06/lessons-of-creed-acquired-from-the-hajj-by-abdurrazzaq-bin-abdul-muhsin-al-badr/" target="_blank">Lessons of Creed Acquired From The Hajj</a> – By ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr, </strong>Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chapter 8 : An Explanation of the Obligation to Adhere to the Sunnah and to Take from the Guidance of the Messenger of Allaah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed from the greatest benefits and lessons from Hajj for the pilgrims to the House of Allaah is knowing the importance of the Sunnah and limiting oneself to it in all actions of the Hajj. The importance of knowing the Sunnah becomes apparent from the state of many pilgrims who you see gathering together in circles of knowledge and remembrance. They ask the scholars many questions regarding the description of Hajj: how to perform it, its pillars and obligatory duties and those acts that negate it. These questions are asked with precision and enthusiasm, especially by those who, in their Hajj, are conscious of the saying of the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-: ‘Take your Hajj rites from me’ [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore Hajj will not be accepted by Allaah unless the Muslim does it in the manner of the Messenger of Allaah, adhering to his guidance in the Hajj and following his Sunnah &#8211; without excess or negligence, without going to extremes or being without purpose and without adding to or taking away from it. So if a Muslim adheres to the Sunnah of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- in his Hajj and limits himself to his guidance, he benefits from the knowledge that adhering to the Sunnah and following his -sall&#8217;Allaahu alayhi wasallam- guidance is obligatory in all acts of obedience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as it is necessary to take the rites of Hajj from the Messenger, it is also necessary for all Muslims to take the guidance of the Messenger in every act of obedience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said with regards to prayer: ‘pray as you have seen me praying.’ [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said in all matters of general obedience: ‘Whoever does an action which we have not commanded then it is rejected.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration: ‘Whoever innovates in this matter of ours, that which is not from it, it will be rejected.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus all actions which are not done in accordance to the guidance of the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- will not be accepted by Allaah, as is shown by his explicit statement -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam: ‘Whoever does an action which we have not commanded then it is rejected.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed this proves that every innovation (Bida’) introduced into the religion has no foundation in the Book or Sunnah, regardless of whether it is from knowledge-based verbal innovations or practical, worship-based innovations. So whoever informs of other than that which Allaah and His Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- have informed or worships in a way that Allaah and His Messenger have not permitted then this will be returned to the one who did it and it will not be accepted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth also implies the meaning that anyone who does an action in accordance to what Allaah and His Messenger have commanded i.e. is worshipping Allaah with correct creed and righteous actions from what is obligatory and recommended, then his action will be accepted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Abu Daawood, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and others on the authority of al-Irbaad bin Sariyyah –RadhiAllaahu anhu- who said that the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- led us in prayer that day, then turned and faced us and gave us an admonition which caused hearts to tremble and eyes to shed tears.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we said: ‘It is as if this is a farewell speech, so advise us O Messenger of Allaah!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘I advise you to hear and obey, even if a slave rules over you. Indeed whosoever from you lives will see many differences, so hold on to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Khulafaah after me, bite on to it with your molar teeth. Beware of newly invented matters, since every Bida’ is misguidance.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- saying in the hadeeth ‘All Bida’ is misguidance’ then this is from his comprehensive, eloquent speech. This statement is a great principle from the principles of the Deen and it resembles the saying of the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam: ‘Whoever innovates anything in this matter of ours that which is not from it, will be rejected.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus anyone who innovates and ascribes something to the Deen which has no foundation to which it can be referred, then it is misguidance which the Deen is free from, the one who innovates has the innovation rejected and it is not accepted from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Deen of Allaah is built upon two great, strong principles and foundations. Firstly; That we do not worship except Allaah Alone who has no partner. Secondly; That we do not worship Him except with what He legislated on the tongue of His Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-. We do not worship Allaah according to our desires or Bida’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Ta’ala said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Then We have put you on a plain way of (Our) commandment. So follow that and do not follow the desires of those who do not know. Verily, they can avail you nothing against Allaah &gt;&gt; [Al-Jathiyah : 18-19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Ta’ala said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Or do they have partners with Allaah (false gods), who have instituted for them a religion which Allaah has not allowed. &gt;&gt; [Shura: 21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not allowed for anyone to worship Allaah except with what His Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- legislated from obligatory and recommended actions. We do not worship Him with newly invented matters which have no foundation in the Deen nor any basis for them in the Sharia’. It is not allowed for anyone to worship anything except Allaah Alone, so no-one is allowed to pray except to Allaah, nor fast except for Allaah, nor perform the Hajj except to His house, nor rely upon anyone except Him, nor can anyone direct any aspect of worship to anyone except Him.[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah combined these two great principles in His –<br />
Subhanhu- statement :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord.&gt;&gt;[Kahf :110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A good action is that which is in agreement with the pure Sharia’ and is sincere i.e. that which is not done, except for Allaah’s Face. These are the two pillars for acceptance of actions. So if an action is done sincerely but is not correct then it will not be accepted and if the action is correct but is not done sincerely for Allaah, then it will not be accepted unless the action is sincere and correctwhere sincere means that it is done purely for Allaah and being correct means that it is done according to the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is obligatory on every Muslim who hopes for success and happiness for himself in this world and the hereafter is that he attaches himself to the guidance of the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-, that his action conforms to his &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- Sunnah and that he is wary of deviating from his guidance, opposing his Sunnah or following other than his path; since he -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- is a guide and example for his nation, as Allaah Ta’ala said regarding him :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a good example to follow for he who hopes in (the Meeting with) Allaah and the Last Day and remembers Allaah much. &gt;&gt; [Ahzab:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;The Prophet is closer to the believers than their ownselves &gt;&gt; [Ahzab: 6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means : ‘He has more right over them in all aspects of the Deen and worldly affairs and he is of greater importance to them than their ownselves or anyone else. It is obligatory upon them to give what he determines from their wealth even if they are in need of it. It is obligatory upon them to have more love for him than for their ownselves, and it is obligatory upon them to put his rulings first, before their own rulings for their ownselves. In brief, if the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- calls them to something and they themselves call to something else then it is obligatory for them to give precedence to what he calls them to and to defer what they themselves call to. It is obligatory upon them to have obedience to him which supersedes obedience to their ownselves and that they prefer obedience to him before that which their ownselves incline to and their inner selves desire.’ [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that this necessitates that the Muslim strives to know the Sunnah and sacrifices time in the path to knowing the guidance of the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- &#8211; which is done by questioning the people of knowledge, sitting in the circles of remembrance where the rules of Halaal and Haraam are explained and also by reading beneficial books and useful works which collect these issues. So after that a Muslim can establish a path whereby he can worship correctly on a sound methodology, in agreement with the guidance of the noble Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chapter Nine : On the Day of ‘Arafah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the day of ‘Arafah is a great day from the blessed days of Allaah and is a large gathering from the gatherings of goodness, Eemaan and Taqwaa. It is a season which is welcomed with great importance. A season from the seasons of obedience and worship, a day where the shedding of tears increases, where there are continuous supplications, where mercy descends and shortcomings are rectified, a day where mistakes are forgiven, a day of hope and humility, submissiveness and humbleness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed it is a noble blessed day. The sun never rose on a day better than the day of ‘Arafah. Indeed it has been specified with noble merits, great privileges and important characteristics. It is no easy task to encompass all its characteristics, nor is it possible to fully investigate them all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed it is the day on which Allaah completed this Deen for the Ummah and completed His favour for them, as on that day the saying of Allaah Ta’ala was revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you and have chosen for you Islaam as your religion.</strong></span>&gt;&gt; [al-Maida:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nothing about the Halaal or Haraam was revealed after that day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of Tariq bin Shihaab who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> ‘A man from the Jews came to Umar bin al-Khattab &#8211; radiAllaahu anhu &#8211; and said: ‘O Ameer ul-Mumineen, indeed you read an Ayaah in your Book and had this Ayaah been revealed to us, the Jewish nation, we would have taken that day as a festival.’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">So Umar -radiAllaahu anhu- said: ‘And which Ayaah is that?’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">So he replied: the saying of Allaah</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&lt;&lt;This day have I perfected your religion for you completed My favour upon you&gt;&gt;[al-Maida:3]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Then Umar said: I swear by Allaah, indeed I know on what day it was revealed to the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and the hour in which it was revealed to the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam. It was revealed in the evening of ‘Arafah on a Friday.’[1]</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On this noble blessed day, there are many of Allaah’s slaves who are saved from Hellfire. Allaah is generous to His believing slaves and He boasts about them in front of the Angels that are near Him. It has been narrated by Muslim in his authentic book of hadeeth on the authority of ‘Aeysha &#8211; radiAllaahu anha – that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘There is no day on which Allaah frees as many slaves from the Hell-Fire as the day of ‘Arafah. Indeed He comes close to them, boasts about them to the Angels and then says: ‘What do they want?’</strong></span>[2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abdul Barr -Rahimullaah- said: ‘This indicates that they have been forgiven; because Allaah does not boast about the people who have mistakes and sins except after they have sought repentance and forgiveness.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been narrated by Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad on the authority of Abdullaah bin ‘Amr &#8211; radi Allaahu anhu – on the authority of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘ Indeed Allaah Ta’ala boasts to His Angels with the people of ‘Arafah on the evening of ‘Arafah and says: Look at My slaves. They come to Me with dishevelled hair and covered in dust.’</strong></span> [4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ibn al-Qayyim -Rahimullaah- said in his famous poetry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For Allaah is that great standing * Like the standing of the Day of Judgement, rather that is greater</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He The Jabbar –the Glorified- comes closer that Day * He boasts about them to what He possesses, but He is more generous</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He says: My slaves have come to Me with love * and I am to them more Generous and more Merciful</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I testify that I have indeed forgiven their sins * and I have given them what they had hoped for and bestowed blessings</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So be it glad tidings O people of that great place * by it Allaah forgives the sins and gives mercy</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Fudayl bin ‘Ayaad -Rahimullaah- stood in ‘Arafah and saw the sobbing and crying of the people during the evening of ‘Arafah, then said: ‘Do you not see if all these people came to a man and asked him for a small coin, would he refuse them?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said, ‘No,’ so he replied: I swear by Allaah, that Allaah forgiving them is easier than this man trying to fulfil their request of a small coin.’ 5(1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is why it is necessary for the Muslim who desires profit and gain on this blessed day to be humble to his Lord -Subhanahu- to humble himself for Him, lower himself in honour of Allaah, feel powerless in front of Him, hope for His mercy and forgiveness, fear His punishment and that which He hates, repent to Him from every sin that one’s hands have earned and from every mistake one’s feet walked towards.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslim does not waste his time at this great place by going here and there or by chatting with this person and that person, rather he turns to his Lord and Protector, making much Dhikr (remembrance) and Dua’ (supplication), seeking forgiveness and begging from Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is established in the hadeeth of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- is that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘The best supplication is the supplication of the day of ‘Arafat and the best thing which I and the Prophets before me have said is:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah Alone, He has no partner and to Him belongs the Dominion. To Him belongs the praise and He is capable/has power over all things.’[6]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">La ilaha ‘illa Allaahu wahdahu la shareeka lahu, lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu wa huwa ala kulli shayin qadeer</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Day of ‘Arafah is a day of supplication and the best Dhikr (remembrance) is saying ‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah.’ The Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- used to say the best Dhikr (remembrance) abundantly on the best of the days, since the best of days is the day of ‘Arafah and the best of Adhkaar (plural of Dhikr) is saying ‘There is none worthy of worship except Allaah.’ So saying the best of Adhkaar plentifully on the best of days is the most appropriate aim and match.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the statement: ‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah,’ which the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- used to say a great deal on the day of ‘Arafah, is the best of words, the most magnificent of all statements, the firmest handhold and it is a statement of Taqwaa and the key to the land of eternal happiness. It is the principle of the Deen and its foundation, and the head of its matter. Due to ‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’ (There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah) the heavens and the earth were established, the creation was created, the Messengers were sent and the Divine Books were revealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The excellence of these words and their status in the Deen are indescribable and greater than the claims of those who say they know its virtues. On the contrary, it has virtues and distinctions which could not ever enter one’s mind or one’s imagination. However, it is obligatory for the Muslim to know that ‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’ (There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah) is not accepted from the one who merely pays lip service to it, without establishing its rights and obligations or fulfilling its principles and conditions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, ‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’ (There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah), is not a statement with no meaning or reality, nor are they words without any content. Rather these great words indeed have a meaning which it is necessary to understand, which have to be comprehended and an aim which it is necessary to adopt. There is agreement amongst the people of knowledge that this statement is not beneficial if it is, either, merely pronounced without understanding its meaning, or if what it necessitates is not acted upon as Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#008000;">And those whom they invoke instead of Him have no power of intercession; except those who bear witness to the truth, and they know (the facts about the Oneness of Allaah)</span></strong>&gt;&gt; [az-Zuhkruf : 86]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">which means: except those who testify ‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah’ and their hearts know the meaning of what their tongues declare. There is no doubt that this matter is of utmost importance and that it is fitting that every Muslim should concern himself with it fully and pay complete attention to it. Indeed ‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’ (There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah) does not benefit except the one who knows its meaning, both the negation and affirmation, and believes in and acts by it. As for the one who says it and acts upon it outwardly without believing in it then he is a hypocrite. As regards the one who says it and acts contrary to it with Shirk then he is a disbeliever. Also the one who says it and then apostatises from Islaam by rejecting something of what it necessitates from its rights, then it does not benefit him even if he says it a thousand times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who says it and then directs any aspect of worship to other than Allaah, such that he supplicates to or seeks aid from other than Him or seeks 4help, assistance or victory from other than Allaah in those things where only Allaah has the capability, or other such similar acts of worship, then whoever directs away from Allaah that which is only befitting Him is a Mushrik, even if he says ‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah’. This is because this great statement entails making all worship purely for Allaah’s sake and not associating partners with Him, turning to Allaah Alone, without any partner, with humbleness and submissiveness, with striving and strong desire and turning repentantly with trust and reliance in supplication and request.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The companion of ‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah’ does not ask except from Allaah nor does he seek deliverance and rescue except from Allaah. He does not trust in or rely except upon Allaah nor does he have hope or longing for other than Allaah. He does not sacrifice except for Allaah nor does he avert any of the acts of worship to other than Allaah. He disbelieves in everything that is worshipped besides Allaah and he clears them away from<br />
Allaah.[7]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 12</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Having Sincerity for Allaah During Supplication</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed from the great acts of worship the Muslims increase upon and show great concern for during the Hajj is Dua’, which is the most important form and best type of worship. The Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- described in the authentic hadeeth that Dua’ in itself is worship due to its great status and lofty nature. This is why there are many texts from the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah showing the great importance and high status of Dua’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The texts comprise praise for making Dua’, encouragement to make Dua’ and inspire different ways to make Dua’, sometimes with a command to make Dua’, sometimes explaining its position and status, sometimes praising the people who make Dua’ and sometimes mentioning the great and different types of reward for those who make Dua’ and warning against those who neglect to make Dua’ or refuse to do so out of haughtiness or arrogance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta&#8217;ala says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret.  He likes not the aggressors. And do not do mischief on the earth, after it has been set in order and invoke Him with fear and hope; Surely, Allaah&#8217;s Mercy is (ever) near unto the good doers.</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [Araaf: 55-56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He is The Ever Living, Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), so invoke Him making your worship pure for Him Alone (by worshipping Him Alone, and none else, and by doing righteous deeds sincerely for Allaah&#8217;s sake only, and not to show off, and not to set up rivals with Him in worship). All the praises and thanks be to Allaah, The Lord of the all that exists</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [Ghafir: 65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And when My slaves ask you concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright</strong></span>. &gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah: 186]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord said: ‘Invoke Me, (and ask Me for anything) I will respond to your (invocation). Verily! Those who scorn My worship [i.e. do not invoke Me and do not believe in My Oneness,] they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!’</span></strong> &gt;&gt; [Ghafir:60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ayaat with this meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What increases the pilgrims in their concern for Dua’ and strengthens them in it during the Hajj is that they have combined the virtue and honour of the place they are in with the virtue and honour of the time period they are in, along with what descends upon their hearts of gentleness, humility and turning towards Allaah, especially on the Day of ‘Arafat which is the greatest and most noble of days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah -Rahimullaah- said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Indeed it is known that on the evening of ‘Arafat Eemaan, mercy, light and blessings which cannot be expressed descend upon the hearts of the pilgrims.’</strong></span>[1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is established on the authority of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- regarding the great matter of Dua’ on the Day of ‘Arafat and in explanation of its excellence, that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> ‘The best of Dua’ is the Dua’ of the Day of ‘Arafat.</strong></span>’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abdul Barr -Rahimullaah- said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘… and from the Fiqh of the previous hadeeth is that the Dua’ of the Day of ‘Arafat is better than all other Dua’. Also, in this hadeeth, is evidence that the Dua’s on the Day of ‘Arafat are all, generally, answered.’</strong></span>[3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During Hajj there are specific places at which it is necessary for the Muslim to stop. It is appropriate to make Dua’ at these places emulating the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-, as it is established that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- would stop there, face the Qiblah and supplicate to Allaah Azza wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>There are six places in particular:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) In ‘Arafat &#8211; as previously mentioned.<br />
(2) In the places of al-Haraam where the Hajj rites take place, as Allaah Ta&#8217;ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then when you leave ‘Arafat, remember Allaah at Mash&#8217;ar-il-Haram</strong></span>&gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah:198]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3,4) On as-Safa and al-Marwa as is established in Saheeh Muslim from the hadeeth of Jaabir -RadhiAllaahu anhu- that when the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- used to stand on as-Safa he would say Allaahu Akbar three times and would say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah Alone, He has no partners, to Him belongs the Dominion and for Him is all praise, and He is capable of all things.’</strong></span> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would do that three times and make Dua’ and would do likewise on al-Marwa.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5,6) After the stoning the two Jamaraat (the small one and medium one) as it is established in Saheeh Bukhari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullaah bin Umar –Radhi Allaahu anhu- used to stone the small Jamaarah with seven small pebbles and used to recite Takbeer on throwing each stone. He then, would proceed further until he reached level ground, where he would stay for a long time, facing the Qibla to supplicate to Allaah whilst raising his hands. Then he would stone the medium Jamaarah similarly and would go to the left towards the level ground, where he would stand for a long time facing the Qibla to supplicate to Allaah whilst raising his hands. Then he would stone the big Jamaarah from the middle of the valley but he would not stay by it. Ibn Umar used to say: ‘This is what I saw the Messenger of Allaah doing.’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are the six places where it is established that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-stood, made Dua’ and raised his hands. Dua’ is a great matter and has a high status in Hajj. Generally, Dua’ has an innate nature in all aspects of worship, it is the spirit and essence of worship and it is established from the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- that he said: ‘Dua’ is worship.’[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If making Dua’ has distinguished status and a high rank then it is obligatory upon the Muslim to have a great concern for the significance of Dua’. He should understand that he is bound by its conditions and should be refined by its manners. He should be on-guard to avoid any actions that would prevent a Dua’ from being answered and he should be aware of the times when Dua’ is most likely to be answered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most important matter in this great act that is necessary for the Muslim to check, is that his Dua’ is solely and sincerely for Allaah – Azza wa Jal. So he does not make Dua’ except to Allaah, he does not seek aid except from Allaah, nor does he request assistance, support and help or cure except from Allaah. This is because Dua’, as previously mentioned, is worship and directing any act of worship to other than Allaah is Major Shirk which takes a person outside of Islaam. We seek refuge in Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta&#8217;ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And invoke not besides Allaah any that will neither profit you, nor hurt you, but if (in case) you did so, you shall certainly be one of the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if Allaah touches you with hurt, there is none who can remove it but He; and if He intends any good for you, there is none who can repel His Favour which He causes to reach whomsoever of His slaves He will. And He is The Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful &gt;&gt; [Yunus : 106-107]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And whoever invokes (or worships), besides Allaah, any other ilâh (god), for whom he has no proof, then his reckoning is only with his Lord. Surely! the disbelievers will not be successful &gt;&gt; [al-Muminoon:117]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; He is The Ever Living, Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), so invoke Him making your worship pure for Him Alone (by worshipping Him Alone, and none else, and by doing righteous deeds sincerely for Allaah&#8217;s sake only, and not to show off, and not to set up rivals with Him in worship). All the praises and thanks be to Allaah, The Lord of the all that exists &gt;&gt; [Ghafir: 65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And the mosques are for Allaah (Alone), so invoke not anyone along with Allaah &gt;&gt;[Jinn : 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Again, there are many Ayaat with this meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the manners of making Dua’ is what Allaah Ta&#8217;ala mentioned in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret.  He likes not the aggressors. And do not do mischief on the earth, after it has been set in order and invoke Him with fear and hope; Surely, Allaah&#8217;s Mercy is (ever) near unto the good – doers &gt;&gt;[al-‘Aaraaf: 55-56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his Dua’, the Muslim combines bringing presence of the heart and the feeling of dire need of what is sought with the Dua’. He does this causing it to coincide with the best times for Dua’ along with Khushoo’ (humility) in the heart, subservience to his Lord, submission to Him, imploring Him, having graciousness, having faced the Qibla in a state of purification, raising his hands to Allaah, beginning with praise and exaltation of Allaah and joining this with prayer upon Muhammad -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- who is His slave and Messenger. After this, he puts forward, to Allaah, his requests of repentance and forgiveness, then beseeches Allaah, earnestly asking of Him with total subservience to Him, supplicating to Him with fervent desire and dread and seeking closeness to Him with His Names, Attributes and Tawheed. He makes this Dua’ with sincerity and so this Dua’ is not about to ever be rejected. This is especially so if all of this coincides with supplications the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- taught as well as the best times and places for the answering of supplications along with the greatest Name of Allaah, whereby if He is asked He bestows and if He is called with it, He answers the supplication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the supplications established in the books of Sunnah is: that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- heard a man saying: ‘O Allaah. I ask of You, whereby I testify that You are Allaah, there is no god except You, The One, The SelfSufficient, Who is not begotten nor does He beget and there is none that resembles Him.’ So the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: ‘Indeed you have asked Allaah with His greatest name which if He is asked by, He bestows, and if He is supplicated to with it, He answers.’[8]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Obligation of Having Sincerity When Slaughtering the Sacrificial Animal</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed from the great days of Allaah is the day of an-Nahr, the tenth day from the month of Dhul-Hijjah, the day of the blessed ‘Eid al-Adha. This day has been called the day of an-Nahr because the Muslims seek closeness to Allaah on that Day by slaughtering grazing livestock (sheep, camels, cattle, goats). Pilgrims on this day slaughter their sacrificial animals and the Muslims in every scattered part of the earth slaughter their sacrificial animals too, seeking closeness to Allaah by doing so, Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<em><span style="color:#008000;">And for every nation We have appointed religious ceremonies, that they may mention the Name of Allaah over the beast of cattle that He has given them for food. And your (God) is One (God &#8211; Allaah), so you must submit to Him Alone (in Islaam). And give glad tidings to the Mukhbitin [those who obey Allaah with humility and are humble from among the true believers of Islaamic Monotheism],</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Whose hearts are filled with fear when Allaah is mentioned; who patiently bear whatever may befall them (of calamities); and who perform the prayer and who spend (in Allaah&#8217;s Cause) out of what We have provided them.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And the Budn (cows, oxen, or camels driven to be offered as sacrifices by the pilgrims at the sanctuary of Makkah.) We have made for you as among the Symbols of Allaah, therein you have much good. So mention the Name of Allaah over them when they are drawn up in lines (for sacrifice). Then, when they are down on their sides (after slaughter), eat thereof, and feed the beggar who does not ask (men), and the beggar who asks (men). Thus have We made them subject to you that you may be grateful.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allaah, but it is piety from you that reaches Him. Thus have We made them subject to you that you may magnify Allaah for His Guidance to you. And give glad tidings to the Muhsinûn (doers of good).</span></em> &gt;&gt; [Hajj: 34-37]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of which is: The intent is not just slaughtering but, indeed what has been legislated for you is slaughtering this sacrifice so that you remember Allaah at the slaughter, as He indeed is The Creator and The Provider, it is not that He will take anything from its meat or its blood, for Allaah Ta’ala is in no need of other than Himself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&lt;&lt; but it is piety from you that reaches Him&gt;&gt;</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of which is: to have sincerity, hope of gaining reward, a good intention and a desire for the Face of Allaah by performing good actions. In 1this is a great encouragement and motivation to have sincerity in slaughtering and that the intent should be the Face of Allaah alone, because Allaah Ta’ala does not accept actions except those that are sincere, with which one only desires the Face of Allaah –Subhanahu- as Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&lt;&lt;Say: &#8220;Verily, my prayer, my sacrifice, my living and my dying are for Allaah, The Lord of all that exists. He has no partner.  And of this I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims.&#8221;&gt;&gt;</span></em> [Anaam: 162-163]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer –Rahimullaah- said in explanation of this Ayaah: ‘Allaah Ta’ala commands the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- to inform the Mushrikeen who worship other than Allaah and slaughter in other than His name, that he is in opposition to them in this. Indeed his prayer is for Allaah and his sacrifices are in the name of Allaah alone, Who has no partner. This is like the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&lt;&lt;Verily, my prayer, my sacrifice&gt;&gt;</strong> [Anaam: 162]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">i.e. that your prayer and your slaughtering should be sincerely for Allaah. Indeed the Mushrikeen used to worship idols and slaughter for them, so Allaah Ta’ala ordered the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- to oppose them, to turn away from what they were upon and to face Allaah with purpose, intention and determination, doing so sincerely for Allaah Ta’ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujahid said regarding Allaah’s saying <strong>&lt;&lt;my prayer, my sacrifice&gt;&gt;</strong> i.e. ritual: slaughtering in the Hajj and Umrah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ath-Thawri said on the authority of Sa’eed bin Jubair who said regarding the word:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&lt;&lt;my sacrifice&gt;&gt;</strong> : my slaughtering.</p>
<p>As-Saadi and Dhihaak also said the same thing.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Slaughtering is a great act from the different types of worship with which the Muslims seek nearness to their Lord –Azza wa Jal – fulfilling rites for the sake of Allaah Ta’ala from slaughtering the sacrificial animal to vows to other such things. So it is not permissible to direct these acts of worship to other than Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been established in the authentic book of hadeeth by Muslim from the hadeeth of the Ameer ul-Mumineen ‘Alee bin Abu Taalib –radhiAllaahu anhuwho said: the Messenger of Allaah-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- informed me of four statements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> ‘Allaah’s curse is upon the one who slaughters for other than Allaah, Allaah’s curse is upon the one who curses his parents, Allaah’s curse is upon the one who gives shelter to an innovator and Allaah’s curse is upon the one who changes signposts which mark directions on the earth.’ [2]</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accursedness meaning exiled and being distant from the Mercy of Allaah. The most dangerous of these four matters, such that the one who does it is deserving of this punishment, is slaughtering for other than Allaah. This is why the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- mentioned it first, which shows the great danger of this matter, as slaughtering for other than Allaah is Shirk, whereas the other points mentioned are from the major sins but they do not reach the level of Shirk. Any type of slaughtering done for other than Allaah is Shirk even if what is slaughtered -seeking closeness to Allaah- is insignificant or small such as a fly or something similar to that. So how about the one seeking closeness while he sacrifices the best and the finest of animals?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been narrated by Imaam Ahmad in his book ‘az-Zuhd’, by Abu Na’eem in his book ‘al-Hileeya’ and in other places on the authority of Salman alFarsi –RadhiAllaahu anhu- with an authentic chain stopping at him, that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘A man entered Paradise due to a fly and another man entered the Fire due to a fly. They asked, ‘How is that?’ He replied: Two men from before your time passed by some people who had an idol and none could pass by them except that he had to sacrifice to their idol.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">They said to one of the two men: Sacrifice something.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">He said: I don’t have anything.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">They said: Sacrifice something, even if it is a fly.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">So he sacrificed a fly and passed by, then entered the Hell-fire.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">They said to the other man: Sacrifice something.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">He said: I never sacrifice anything for other than Allaah –Azza wa Jal. So they chopped his head off and he entered Paradise.’[3]</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows the wickedness of Shirk and the severity of its danger that, even if it is with something small, it obligates entry into Hell-fire. So, when the first man sacrificed a despicable and the vilest of animals, a fly, for the idol his reward was the Fire due to him committing Shirk in the worship of Allaah. If this is the case of the one who sacrificed by slaughtering a fly, then what is the state of the one who fattens a camel or a sacrificial animal then slaughters it for the one he worships other than Allaah such as graves, tombs, stones, trees or anything else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shawakaani –Rahimullaah- said in his book ‘Sharh as-Sadoor’: ‘This is from the causes of extreme evil, by which the evil companion is thrown behind the wall of Islaam from the highest point of the Deen and lands on his skull. So much so that many of them come with the best of the livestock they possess and the most excellent of what they have of sheep and cattle, then they slaughter them at the graves seeking closeness to them and hoping that this (closeness) can be attained from the graves. So they sacrifice for other than Allaah and, as a result, they worship one from amongst the idols, because there is no difference between slaughtering for the erected stones they call idols and slaughtering for and at the grave of the deceased calling it a grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A simple difference in description does not affect something’s being Halaal or being Haram. The one who calls alcohol by other than its true name and drinks it has the same ruling as the one who calls alcohol by its name and drinks it, there is no difference of opinion amongst any of the Muslims in this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that slaughtering is one type from the different types of worship for Allaah, similar to slaughtering the sacrificial animal and atonement. So the one who seeks closeness to the inhabitant of the grave and slaughters for it does not have any other intent in so-doing except to glorify and honour the grave, to seek to attain goodness from it and to fend off evil due to it. This is, no doubt, worship and it suffices as evil just to hear of it. There is no power or might except with Allaah, The Most High, The Most Great, to Allaah we belong and to Him is our return. The Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: ‘In Islaam there is no slaughtering animals near graves.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdur-Razzaq Sanaani said: ‘They used to slaughter at the grave, i.e. cows and sheep’ as narrated by Abu Daawood with an authentic chain of narration on the authority of Anas ibn Maalik.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Imaam ash-Shawakaani –Rahimullaah- was very eloquent in his advice and very good in warning against this dangerous issue. We ask Allaah, The Most Noble that He saves us all from falling into any of this and that He makes all our actions sincerely for His Noble Face, in accordance with the Sunnah of His Prophet Muhammad -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam. Indeed Allaah is The Most Generous and The Most Noble.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> continued saying: So some of the people of the heavens inquired from the other people, until the news reaches the sky of this <em>Duniya</em> then the Jinn seize this statement and they throw this to their <em>Aawliyaa</em> (friends) and they pass it on so whatever they mention correctly then this is the truth, however they increase upon this and they mention extra things.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">Compiled &amp; Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 – Imam Shaafi’ee (d.199 A.H.) <i>-Rahimullaah-</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The first of manners which should be followed is that which the Messenger of Allaah  <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> did.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘al-Adab’ by al-Bayhaqi (300) / ‘Tawjee al-Muqtasid’ p.5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – Abul Abbas bin ‘Atta said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever adheres to the manners of the Sunnah then Allaah enlightens his heart with the light of knowing his <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> Sunnah.  There is no station/status more noble than following the beloved <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> in his commands, actions, his manners and in following his manners in statements and actions and intentions.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: Zuhud al-Kabeer by al-Bayhaqi (287) / ‘Tawjee al-Muqtasid’ p.5-6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <i>-Rahimullaah- </i>said:<i></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Know that it is obligatory upon every mature, intelligent person from mankind and the Jinn to testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah sent him with the guidance and the religion of the truth to make it uppermost above all religions, and Allaah is sufficient as a witness. Allaah sent him to all of creation, mankind and Jinn, the Arabs and the non-Arabs, the Persians and the Indians, the Barbars and the Romans, and all the different types of non-Arabs, black and white.  What is meant by non-Arabs is those who do not have the Arab language, amongst all their different languages.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Muhammad <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> was sent for every single person from the humans and the Jinn, whether they are from those who follow a revealed Book or not. He was sent for every single person in relation to his Deen, from the inward matters and outward ones, regarding his beliefs, realities, methods and his legislations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there is no ‘Aqeeda/belief except the Messenger’s <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i>‘Aqeeda, and there is no reality except his reality, and there is no method except his method, and there is no legislation/Sharia’ except his Sharia’/legislation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one from the creation can reach to Allaah, and to His pleasure, and His Paradise, and to His Generosity, and His Guardianship except by following the Messenger <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> inwardly and outwardly, and in sayings and actions inwardly and outwardly, in statements of the heart and its beliefs, and the conditions of the heart and its realities, and the statements of the tongue and the actions of the limbs.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Majmoo’ Fatawa’ 10/430-431]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – Imam Abu Muthaffar Samaani (d.489 A.H.) <i>-Rahimullaah-</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed we have been ordered with following and have been recommended to it, and prohibited from innovating and rebuked for it.  The sign of the Ahl-ul-Sunnah is that they follow the Salaf as-Salih, and that they leave everything that is innovated and a novelty.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘al-Inteesar li Ahl-ul-hadeeth’ p.69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 – Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <i>-Rahimullaah- </i>said:<i></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the beliefs (al-‘Iteeqad) then it is not taken from me nor from someone more senior than me, rather it is taken from Allaah and His Messenger <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> and that which the Salaf of the Ummah were gathered upon.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Majmoo’ Fatawa’ 3/161]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – al-Hasan al-Basari (d.110 A.H.)  said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘A statement is not correct except with action, and a statement and action are not correct except with intention, and a statement and action and intention are not correct except with the Sunnah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Sharh Asool I’teeqad’ 1/57]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 – Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <i>-Rahimullaah- </i>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Following the Prophet <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> is a proof and evidence that the follower loves Allaah –Azza wa Jal – and what indicates to that is the saying of – Jala wa ‘Ulaa – : &lt;&lt;Say (O Muhammad): ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you and forgive you of your sins.&gt;&gt; [Aal’Imraan:31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Majmoo’ Fatawa’ 1/334]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8 – Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <i>-Rahimullaah- </i>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘What is necessary to comprehend is that Allaah Subhanahu said in His Book: &lt;&lt;Say (O Muhammad): ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you and forgive you of your sins.&gt;&gt; [Aal’Imraan:31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">A group from the Salaf said: there were a people at the time of the Messenger of Allaah<i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> who claimed that they love Allaah, so Allaah revealed this Ayaah: &lt;&lt;Say (O Muhammad): ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you and forgive you of your sins.&gt;&gt; [Aal’Imraan:31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah explained that His love obligates following the Messenger <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> which in turn obligates the love of Allaah for His slave.  Allaah tested those who claim to love Allaah by this specific love, and indeed this issue has many claimants and those who are dubious in their love for Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Majmoo’ Fatawa’ 10/81]</p>

<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1.      From Yahya bin Saeed al-Qattaan (d. 198 A.H.) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Do not look at the Hadeeth, but look at the <em>Isnaad</em> to see if the <em>Isnaad</em> is <em>saheeh</em>, otherwise do not be deceived by the Hadeeth if the <em>Isnaad</em> is not authentic.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From: ‘Siyaar ‘Alaam an-Nubala’ 9/188]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">4.      From Uthmaan who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘A man came to Maalik and asked him about an issue.  So Maalik said to him: ‘The Messenger of <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said such and such’.  The man said to him ‘Do you hold that view?’ Imam Malik said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And let those who oppose the Messenger’s commandment (i.e. his <em>Sunnah) </em>(among the sects) beware, lest some <em>Fitnah</em> befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them.&gt;&gt; [Noor: 63]’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> established <em>Sunnan</em>, following them is following the Book of Allaah, and it is completion of obedience to Allaah, and strength upon the <em>Deen</em> of Allaah.  It is not permissible for anyone to change it, nor to look into that which opposes the Sunnah.  Whosoever seeks guidance by it, then he is guided.’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<em>Tooba</em> (a tree in Paradise) is for the one who looks at his own shortcomings rather than the shortcomings of others.  <em>Tooba</em> is for the one who humbles himself for Allaah without degrading himself. May Allaah have Mercy on the people of humility and servitude. He gives charity for the wealth gathered in a <em>Halaal</em> way and sits with the people of knowledge and gentleness and wisdom, and the Sunnah is sufficient for him and does not transgress to <em>Bida’</em>.’</p>

Yes I take this, and that is obligatory for me, and upon everyone who hears it. Indeed Allaah chose Muhammad <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> from the people and guided them by him, and upon his hands, so it is upon the creation to follow him, the obedient ones or the disobedient ones, there is no exit for the Muslim from this.’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam ash- Shaafi’ee trembled, shuddered and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Which sky will shade me and which earth will carry me if I narrate a Hadeeth from the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and say an opinion other than that of the Hadeeth.’ And he said: ‘If you find a Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> then follow it and do not turn to the saying of anyone.’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘No, but for opposing the Sunnah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘at-Tamheed’ 20/104 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21- From AbdurRahman bin Mahdi (d. 198 A.H.) that a group of the Ahl-ul-Bida’ were mentioned in front of him and their striving in worship, so he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Allaah will not accept except that which is upon the Deen and the Sunnah, then he recited: &lt;&lt; But the Monasticism which they invented for themselves, We did not prescribe for them&gt;&gt; [Hadeed: 27]  So Allaah did not accept that from them and he reprimanded them about it.’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">23- From Sufyaan ibn Sa’eed ath-Thawri  (d. 161 A.H.) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<em>Bida’</em> is more beloved to Iblees (<em>Shaytaan</em>) than sinning.  One repents from sinning, and one does not repent from <em>Bida’</em>.’</p>

<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a – Shaykh ul-Islaam Ahmad bin AbdulHaleem Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the level excellence of Abu Bakr then Umar, then Uthmaan and Ali, then this is agreed upon between the Imams of knowledge and <em>Deen</em>, from amongst the Companions and <em>Taba’een</em>.  It is the <em>Madhab</em> of Malik, <em>Ahl-ul- Madinah</em>, Abu Hanifah, Hamad bin Zayed, Hamad bin Salamah and the likes of them from the people of Iraq and it is the <em>Madhab</em> of Shaafi’ee, Ahmad, Ishaq, Abu Ubayd and other than them from the Imams of Islaam who have a truthful tongue from amongst the <em>Ummah</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Majmoo’ al-Fatawa 4/421]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b – Imam Nawawi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The <em>Ummah</em> is agreed upon the correctness of the <em>Khalafah</em> of Abu Bakr and his precedence over the Companions <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhum ajmaeen</em>&#8211; due to him being the best of them, and the most deserving for the <em>Khalafah</em> than other than him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Tahathab al-‘Asmaa 2/191]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">c – Hafidh Suyootee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah</em> are united that the best person after the Messenger of Allaah is Abu Bakr, then Umar, then Uthmaan and then Ali.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Tareekh al-Khulafah p.34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">d – From Ibn Abi Layla who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abu Bakr and Umar were being discussed, so a man from ‘Attarad said: ‘Umar is better than Abu Bakr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Jarrood said: ‘Rather Abu Bakr is better than him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This news reached Umar <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em>, and he began to beat him with a stick until he ran off, then he turned to al-Jarrood but he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Be away from me!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Umar said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abu Bakr was the best of the people after the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> in such and such thing.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Umar said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever says other than this, then we will do to him what we do to a slanderer.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Abdullaah bin Ahmad bin Hanbal in ‘as-Sunnah’ 2/579]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">e – From Abdullaah bin Salmah who said I heard Ali saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The best of the people after the Messenger of Allaah is Abu Bakr, and the best of the people after Abu Bakr is Umar . . . . .’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ibn Majah &amp; authenticated by Albaani no. 86]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">f – From Abu Juhayfah who said: ‘I heard Ali saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Shall I not inform you who is the best of this <em>Ummah</em> after its Prophet, it is Abu Bakr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Ali continued:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Shall I not inform you who is the best of this <em>Ummah</em> after Abu Bakr it is Umar.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ahmad &amp; authenticated by Ahmad Shakir. Imam Dhahabi said in ‘Tareekh al-Khulafah’ p.115: ‘I swear by Allaah the Magnificent, that this is what Ali said and it is<em>Mutawatir</em> from him, because he said this while on the <em>Mimbar</em> in Koofah, may Allaah fight the Rafidaah, how ignorant they are!’]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">g – From Muhammad bin al-Hanafeeyah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I said to Ali bin Abi Taalib: O my father, who of the people is the best after the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abu Bakr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Abdullaah bin Ahmad bin Hanbal in ‘as-Sunnah’ No.1363]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">h – From Muhammad bin al-Hanafeeyah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I asked my father, who of the people is the best after the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Abu Bakr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked: ‘Then who?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘then Umar.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I feared that he would say Uthmaan, I then said: ‘Then you?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I am no other than a person from amongst the Muslims.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">i – From Shaqeeq who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It was said to Ali <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em>: ‘Will you not appoint a leader?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> did not appoint a leader, so how can I appoint one.  If Allaah <em>– Tabaraka wa Ta’ala –</em> wants good for the people then He gathers them as He gathered them after their Prophet upon the best of them.’ [i.e. Abu Bakr]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ibn Abi Aassim in ‘as-Sunnah’ 1221]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">j – From Sufyan at-Thawri who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever claims that Ali <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> was more deserving of ruler ship than Abu Bakr and Umar, then he has claimed that Abu Bakr was wrong, likewise Umar, the<em>Muhajiroon</em>, and the <em>Ansaar</em>.  I hold the opinion that this person’s good actions will not rise up to the heavens (not accepted by Allaah), if he holds this view.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Abu Dawood &amp; Albaani said it is Saheeh al-Isnaad although it is disconnected. No.4387]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">k – From Abdullaah bin Umar who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘We used to say while the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was alive: ‘The best of the <em>Ummah</em> of the Prophet after the Prophet is Abu Bakr, then Umar, then Uthmaan <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhum ajmaeen</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Abu Dawood, Ibn Abi Aassim in ‘as-Sunnah’ &amp; Abdullaah bin Ahmad in ‘as-Sunnah’, Albaani said it’s <em>Isnad</em> is Saheeh]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">l – From Ibn Umar <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘During the time of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> we would not equate anyone along with Abu Bakr, then Umar, then Uthmaan then we would leave the Companions of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and not choose a preference between them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">m – From Shaafi’ee who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Companions and their followers are gathered upon the excellence and precedence of Abu Bakr, then Umar, then Uthmaan, then Ali.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘al-Itiqaad’ by Bayhaqi]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">n – Imam Dhahabi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The scholars of the Sunnah are agreed that the best of the Companions are the ten who had been testified with entering Paradise.  The best of those ten were Abu Bakr, then Umar bin al-Khattab, then Uthmaan bin ‘Affan, then Ali bin Abi Taalib <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhum ajmaeen</em>&#8211; and no one doubts that except an innovator, a hypocrite, or a filthy person.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 1771 – From Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was brought some milk that was blended with water and on his right was a Bedouin and on his left was Abu Bakr, so he drank from it then he gave it to the Bedouin and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘On the right on the right.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration: ‘those on the right, those on the right, you should give it on the right hand side.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 1771</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawood]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘In this hadeeth, the one who was serving the drinks began with the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>because the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>was the one who requested a drink. Therefore, it is not correct to use this hadeeth as an evidence to prove that the Sunnah is to essentially begin with the eldest of the people as is widespread nowadays.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can this be the case when the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>himself did not do this, on the contrary the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>gave the drink to the Bedouin who was on his right hand side and not to Abu Bakr who was on his left hand side, then the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>explained by saying: ‘On the right hand side then the next one after him.’</p>

He kills the Muslim as if he is slaughtering a chicken, so every time the killer comes across a door from the doors of Paradise, Allaah comes between him and the door.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666699;">From the <em>Manhaj</em> of the <em>Muhaddith</em>, Shaykh, <em>Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Nasiruddeen al-Albaani </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Concerning Boycotting the People of <em>Bida’<br />
</em>Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part One</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>The Issue of giving Advice before Spreading a Refutation</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘What branches off from this[previous question: mentioning the good deeds of an individual while refuting him] is the statement of some of the people or more correctly should I say, the condition set by some of the people who say that in the case of refutations it’s necessary before it being printed, that a copy is sent to the one being refuted so that they can look into it.  They say that this is from the <em>Manhaj</em> of the Salaf?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This is not a condition, however if it’s easy to do, and it is hoped from this practice to bring that person closer without making the case well-known between the people, then there is no doubt that this matter is good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for firstly making it a condition, and then secondly making it a general condition then this is not at all from wisdom in any circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people, as you all know, are of different natures, like the natures of gold and silver.  So the one whom you know from him that he is with us on the path and methodology and that he would accept the advice, wherein you can at least write to him without making his mistake public as you see it, then this is good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, this is not a condition, even if this was a condition it’s not a possible matter, where can you get that person’s address? How can you contact him? Then, will you get a response from him or not? These are matters which are absolutely speculative.. . . . implementing this condition is very difficult, that is why this point is not conditional.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from the cassette entitled: ‘al-Muwwazanaat Fee Naqd’ Side A from the ‘Silsilah al-Huda wa Noor’ No.638]</p>
<h2 id="jp-post-flair" class="sharedaddy sd-like-enabled" style="text-align:justify;"> Part Two</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Making (Hajr) Boycotting the Ahl-ul-Bida’</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Questioner: Regarding what is connected to boycotting the <em>Mubtadi’</em> (person of<em>Bida’</em>) O Shaykh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh: Go ahead.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner: What appears from what I heard is that you have a regard for the benefit of the <em>Mubtadi’</em> himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh: Yes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner: And you do not reject the principle of boycotting?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh: I do not deny the principle of <em>Hajr</em>, this is obligatory, this <em>Hajr</em> is. .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner: O Shaykh as you notice we see the opinion of the impermissibility of the<em>Hajr</em> of the <em>Mubtadi’</em> – we take into consideration the benefit for this <em>Mubtadi’</em>.  Do we not see the general benefit for those who might become misguided due his effecting them, then there’s another thing…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh: Leave the other issue until we’ve looked into the first issue.  This issue in reality my brother, from a practical view needs precise knowledge and precise practical action, so just now you gave an example of a scholar who mixes with a <em>Mubtadi’</em> and the general people think that there is good in this <em>Mubtadi’</em>, do you view this scholar as one who flatters people?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner: No.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh: Okay, so if you view the opposite of this, as I hoped then it is possible for me to say, that you hold the opinion, that this scholar criticizes them for this <em>Bida’</em>[they practice], he advises them, and he admonishes them.  So if this is the case, then from where will the danger come to the general people when they hear him, when he advises them and reminds them etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner: Yes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh: So this danger which you notice and indicate towards is regarding the one who flatters people and not regarding the one who criticizes the <em>Bida’</em>, this is also better, so there is a difference between one scholar and another scholar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner: May Allaah reward you with good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh: I mean, in other words, the one who goes along with them and remains quiet about their <em>Bida’</em> and their misguidance and is over-looking, then we criticize this and it is necessary to make it clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from sahab.net/forums/showthread.php?t=363847]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part Three</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Is it permissible to defame a companion of Bida’ or to speak against him and criticize him?</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of <em>Bida’</em> are of two kinds:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Either he conceals it to himself – or he is well known amongst the people. As for the first instance then there is no need to make it well know, because his misguidance is limited to his own self.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the other type then it is necessary to defame him and warn against him, so that the people who live amongst him are not deceived by him; And this is not backbiting at all – like some of the obstinate ones presume – and the hadeeth Of Backbiting: ‘you mentioning about your brother that which he dislikes to be mentioned’  this hadeeth is from those that are general and which is specific.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have mentioned to you the saying of some of the Scholars in two lines of poetry, which gathers the type of backbiting which is exempted from being <em>Haram</em>, so they say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">القدح ليس بغيبةٍ في ستةٍ ……….متظلم ومعرِّفٍ ومحذرٍ<br />
ومجاهر فِسقاً ومستفتٍ ومـن…… طلب الإعانة في إزالة منكر</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Defamation is not backbiting regarding six types of people**</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The oppressed and for <em>recognition</em> and the one warned against***</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who openly sins and the one who necessitates a verdict***</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who seeks aid in removing an evil***</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Mutathalumin : being oppressed – Mua’arafin: recognition – Muhadeerin: Warning against Mujahir fisqan : One who openly sins – Mustaftin : Inquiring a fatwaa</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Istee’ana fee Ezzalatin Munkarin : seeking assistance in changing the evil</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So defaming the <em>Mubtadi’</em> enters into this definition and it also enters into warning against him; this is why the Scholars of hadeeth –May Allaah reward them with goodness-  are agreed upon characterizing many of the narrators of hadeeth with what they had innovated into the <em>Deen</em>. The scholars of hadeeth mention all of this due to them standing up with the obligation of clarifying it for the people; So that it would be known who is the strong narrator and his ‘<em>Aqeedah</em> is accepted. The narrator who is a<em>Mubtadi’</em> is abandoned along with his deviated ‘<em>Aqeedah</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Excerpts from Works by a Numerous People of Knowledge<br />
Translated &amp; Compiled by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Salaf as-Salih Did Not Celebrate It</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said regarding the<em>Mawlid</em> of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Salaf as-Salih did not do this even though they could have done it and there was no prevention in doing so.  If the <em>Mawlid</em> was good or seen as beneficial the Salaf <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhum</em><em>&#8211;</em> would have had more of a right to it than us because they were the greatest in love for the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and in respect for him, compared to us, and were more concerned for goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed loving him completely and respecting him is by following him <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, obeying him and following his commands, reviving his Sunnah outwardly and inwardly and conveying what he was sent with, striving upon that with the heart, hand and tongue, as this was the way of the foremost to embrace Islaam from the Muhajireen, the Ansar and those who followed them in goodness.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘Iqtida’ as-Siraat al-Mustaqeem’ Vol.2 p.619</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> was asked, as occurs in ‘Fatawa al-Misreeyah’, regarding completing the Qur’aan every year on the night of the <em>Mawlid</em> of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> is that a recommended action or not?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘All Praise belongs to Allaah, the gathering of people for food on the two Eids and the days of stoning in the Hajj is sunnah and is from the distinguishing features of Islaam which the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> established as a Sunnah for the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Helping and feeding the poor in the month of Ramadan is also from the <em>Sunnan</em> of Islaam.  The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever opens a fasting person’s fast then he has the reward similar to the fasting person.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Giving the poor recitors what aids them in reciting the Qur’aan is a good action at all times, and whoever helps them in this shares in the reward.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for taking a season other than the legislated seasons, like some of the nights of the month of Rabi al-Awwal- which it is said is the night of the <em>Mawlid</em>&#8211; or taking some of the nights of Rajab or the 18<sup>th</sup> of Dhul-Hijjah, the 1<sup>st</sup> Jumu’ah of Rajab or the 8<sup>th</sup> of Shawwal which the ignorant people call <em>Eid al-Abrar</em> then all of this is from Bida’ (innovations) which the Salaf neither recommended nor did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘Rasil fee Hukm al-Ihteefal bil-Mawlid an-Nabawi’ Vol.2 p.429</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Is it Obligatory or Recommended?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   The ‘Allaama Shaykh Taj-Uddeen Faakihanee[1] who died in the year (734 A.H.) said in his unique booklet about this subject entitled: ‘al-Mawrid fee Amal al-Mawlid’ and this is its wording and text:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘In The name of Allaah, The Most Kind and Most Merciful</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allaah who guided us to follow the leader of the Messengers and supported us with the guidance to aid the <em>Deen</em>, Who made it easy for us to follow the <em>Athaar</em> of the Salaf as-Saliheen until our hearts filled up with the light of the knowledge of the<em>Sharia’</em> and the definite clear truth and Who purified our hearts from introducing new innovations and innovating in the <em>Deen</em>.  I praise Allaah with what He has favoured us with of the light of certainty and I thank Him for what He has conferred on us holding on to the strong rope of the <em>Deen</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I testify that none is worthy of worship except Allaah – Alone who has no partner- and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger, the leader of the earlier people and of those who came later.  May Allaah send His prayers upon His Messenger, his Family, his Companions and his pure wives, who are the Mothers of the Believers, continuously until the day of Judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Amma Ba’d:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed a question has been repeated from a group of blessed people about a gathering which some of the people organize in the month of Rabi al-Awwal and they call it ‘<em>al-Mawlid</em>’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Does it have an origin in the <em>Sharia’</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or is it a Bida’ and innovation in the <em>Deen</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They wanted the answer to this to be clear and to clarify it specifically.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I say – and success is with Allaah – :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I do not know of an origin for this <em>Mawlid</em> neither in the Book of Allaah nor in the Sunnah, nor was it narrated that any of the scholars of the <em>Ummah</em> performed it; those scholars who are an example for the <em>Deen</em>, holding on to the <em>Athaar</em> of the predecessors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, <em>Mawlid</em> is a Bida’, it was innovated by magicians; those parasites who followed their desires and became rich by it.  The evidence for this is that if we applied the five types of <em>Sharee’ah</em>rulings to it we would say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is either obligatory (<em>Waajib</em>), recommended (<em>Mandoob</em>), permissible (<em>Mubaah</em>), disliked (<em>Makrooh</em>) or prohibited (<em>Muharam</em>)!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By consensus it is neither obligatory nor recommended; because the reality of a recommended act is: an act which is sanctioned by the<em>Sharia’</em> without any disapproval for the one who leaves it.  The<em>Sharia’</em> did not give permission for the <em>Mawlid</em> and the Companions did not do it, neither the <em>Tabieen</em> nor the religious scholars – as far as I know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is my response to this before Allaah –Ta’ala – if I am asked about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nor is it correct that it is permissible (<em>Mubaah</em>), because innovating in the <em>Deen</em> is not permissible – and all the Muslims are in agreement regarding this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So nothing remains except that it is disliked (<em>Makrooh</em>) or prohibited (<em>Muharam</em>).’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘al-Hukm al-Haqq fee al-Hihteefal biMawlid sayyid al-Khalq’  p.11</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Differing on the Date of Birth</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   Ustadh Abu Abdullaah Muhammad al-Haffar[2]  – who died in the year (811 A.H.) as stated in the book ‘al-Ma’yeyar al-Ma’arab’ (7/99-101):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Salaf as-Salih – and they are the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and those who followed them – never used to gather on the night of the <em>Mawlid</em> for worship, they would not do anything on that night which they would not do on any other night of the year because the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>is not revered except due to that which the <em>Sharia’</em> regards as reverential.  Revering the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> is from the greatest of ways of drawing closer to Allaah but drawing closer to Allaah – the Magnificent – is only with what He has legislated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The evidence that the Salaf never used to do anything extra on that night – over what they did on any other night – is that they differed in the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It had been said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> was born in Ramadan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It had been said: in Rabia’ al-Awwal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They differed regarding the day on which he was born with four different sayings!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if there was worship that occurred due to the birth of the best of creation <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> on the night preceding the day on which he was born – then it would have been well-known and widespread and no difference would have occurred regarding it, but observing extra reverence was not legislated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do you not see that Friday is the best day upon which the sun rose?! And the best thing to do on the best day is to fast.  Despite this, the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> prohibited fasting on Fridays – even though it is an excellent day.  So this indicates that no worship occurs for any time or place except that which is legislated and if it is not legislated, then it is not done, since the last of this <em>Ummah</em>cannot bring guidance better than what the first of this <em>Ummah</em>brought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this door to unlegislated worship were opened then people would come and say: the day the Messenger migrated to Madeenah was the day Allaah honoured Islaam, so there should be a gathering and worship should be performed!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Others will say: the night on which the Messenger was taken on the night journey he received honour that cannot be valued!  Then worship would be innovated on that night…..so, they would not stop at this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And good – all of it – is in following the Salaf as-Salih; whom Allaah chose for Himself, so whatever they did we do and whatever they left we leave.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if this is understood, then gathering on that night is not required by the <em>Sharia’</em> rather it is commanded to leave it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘al-Hukm al-Haqq fee al-Hihteefal biMawlid sayyid al-Khalq’ p.14</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Following the Salaf</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   ‘Allaama Ibn al-Haaj who died in (737 A.H.) said in the book ‘al-Madkhal’ (2/11-12) – clarifying the ruling of performing al-Mawlid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘….that it is an addition to the <em>Deen</em> and is not from the actions of the Salaf of the past.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Following the Salaf takes precedence – rather it is more obligatory than intending increase to the <em>Deen</em> by opposing that what they were upon – because they were the greatest of the people in following the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and in proclaiming greatness for him and his Sunnah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</em>  The Salaf have the superiority and excellence of haste to the Sunnah and it is not narrated from anyone of them that the Messenger suggested observing the <em>Mawlid</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We follow the Salaf; so what was permissible for them is what is permissible for us, and it is known that following them should be in following their sources and their pathways to watering holes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘al-Hukm al-Haqq fee al-Hihteefal biMawlid sayyid al-Khalq’  p.16</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   Hafidh Abu Fadl bin Hajr al-Asqalani who died in the year (852 A.H.) said in his <em>Fatawa</em> about celebrating the <em>Mawlid</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The origin of celebrating the <em>Mawlid</em> is a Bida’.  It has not been conveyed from anyone from the Salaf as-Salih of the first three generations.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘Hasan al-maqasid fee Amal al-Mawlid’ by Suyootee. &amp; From: ‘Rasil fee Hukm al-Ihteefal bil-Mawlid an-Nabawi’ Vol.2 p.444</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   As-Sakhawi said in his <em>Fatawa</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Celebrating the noble <em>Mawlid</em> has not been conveyed from anyone of the Salaf as-Salih from the first three excellent generations, rather it was invented after them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘Subal al-Huda wa Rashad Fee Seerat Khair al-Abaad’ by Muhammad bin Yusuf Salih p.439 &amp; From: ‘Rasil fee Hukm al-Ihteefal bil-Mawlid an-Nabawi’ Vol.2 p.444</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Not From the Way of the Arabs</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   As-Sayyid ‘Alee Fikri who died in the year (1372 A.H.) in the sixteenth lecture of the book ‘al-Muhadaraat al-Fikreeyah’ (p.128):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It was not from the ways of the Arabs that they would celebrate the date of birth of anyone from amongst them and it was not the way of the Muslims – in the times that have preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is mentioned in the books of history – and in other books – that the practice of celebrating the <em>Mawlid</em> of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> is from the innovated ways.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘al-Hukm al-Haqq fee al-Hihteefal biMawlid sayyid al-Khalq’  p.17</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   The ‘Allaama ash-Shaykh Abdul Lateef bin Abdur Rahman bin Hasan bin Imaam Muhammad bin AbdulWahhab said explaining the <em>Da’wah</em> of Imaam Muhammad bin AbdulWahhab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Muhammad bin AbdulWahhab criticized what the people were doing in that and other countries, from proclaiming the greatness of the <em>Mawlid</em> and the Eid celebrations of <em>Jahileeyah</em> for which there was no revealed authority raising its status and for which there was no<em>Sharia’</em> evidence or proof; because in those celebrations and in their time and place is resemblance of the misguided Christians’ Eid celebrations and it is falsehood and rejected in the <em>Sharia’</em> of the leader of the Messengers.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from ‘Majmoo’ ar-Risail wal-Masail an-Najdeeyah’ Vol.4 p.440 &amp; ‘Durrar as-Saneeyah’ Vol.4 p.409 &amp; From: ‘Rasil fee Hukm al-Ihteefal bil-Mawlid an-Nabawi’ Vol.2 p.438</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The best of generations and the best of the people of knowledge did not </strong>celebrate the<strong> <em>Mawlid</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   Shaykh Zuhair ad-Deen Jafar at-Tazmantee who died in the year (682 A.H.) said clarifying the ruling of Mawlid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This action was not performed by the Salaf as-Salih in the early period, even though they revered the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>greatly, those whose love for him was so great that if you were togather our love for him, it would not reach the amount of love of even one of them for him, not even a fraction of it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this is a principle which is free from a need for elaboration and it is not in need of any form of evidence, since the Salaf were more knowledgeable and more pious, nobler and more guided.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘al-Hukm al-Haqq fee al-Hihteefal biMawlid sayyid al-Khalq’ p.18</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   The Imam Ibn Katheer ad-Damishqi ash-Shaafia’e who died in the year (774A.H.) said in his ‘Tafseer’ (13/12)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Explaining the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And those who disbelieve (strong and wealthy) say of those who believe (weak and poor): ‘Had it been a good thing, they (weak and poor) would not have preceded us thereto!’ &gt;&gt; [al-Ahqaaf: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Which means that they – the unbelievers – said about those who believed in the Qur’aan, ‘that if the Qur’aan was good then they would not have preceded us to it;’ meaning by this Bilaal, ‘Ammar, Suhaib, Khabbab – and their likes, their peers from the weak, the male-slaves and female slaves.  That was only because they believed, with regard to themselves that they had a high rank with Allaah and that He had concern for them!!  But they were mistaken, horrendously mistaken!  They clearly erred!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Thus We have tried some of them with others, that they might say: ‘Is it these (poor believers) that Allaah has favoured from amongst us?’ &gt;&gt; [An’aam: 53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means: they are amazed; ‘How were these people guided and not us?!’  That is why the disbelievers said: &lt;&lt; ‘Had it been a good thing, they (theweak and poor) would not have preceded us thereto!’&gt;&gt; [al-Ahqaaf: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jamaah they say about every action and statement – which is not proven from the Companions – that it is a Bida’, since if it was good they would have preceded us to it, because they did not leave anything of the qualities of good except that they hastened to it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘al-Hukm al-Haqq fee al-Hihteefal biMawlid sayyid al-Khalq’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Principles of Loving according to the <em>Sharia’</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The claim of those who celebrate <em>Mawlid</em> is that they do it due to the love of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>-.  This is a false claim since the evidence for love is to follow and not to go beyond limits in matters just as Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Say: ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me &gt;&gt; [Al-Imraan: 31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah – Subhanahu – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; So stand (ask Allaah to make) firm and straight (on the religion of Islaamic Monotheism) as you are commanded and those who turn in repentance (unto Allaah) with you, and transgress not. Verily, He is All-Seer of what you do.  &gt;&gt; [Hud: 112]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Katheer said in his ‘Tafseer’ (1/358) explaining the first<em>Ayah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This <em>Ayah</em> is a ruling upon everyone who claims the love of Allaah – while he is not upon the way of the Prophet –that he is a liar in his claim unless he follows the legislation of Muhammad and the Prophetic religion in all his sayings and actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As is established in ‘the Saheeh’ on the authority of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> that he said: ‘Whoever does an action which we have not commanded then it will be rejected.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Allaah said &lt;&lt;Say: ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me&gt;&gt; [Al-Imraan: 31] which means: you achieve more than what you request due to your love for Him, which is Him loving you, which is greater than the former.  Also, as some of the scholars and wise-people said: ‘The issue is not whether you love Him; rather the issue is whether you are loved.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan al-Basri and others from amongst the Salaf have said: ‘A people claimed that they loved Allaah; so Allaah tried them with this<em>Aayah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Say: ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you and forgive you of your sins.  And Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.’&gt;&gt;[Al-Imraan: 31]’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qadi ‘Ayyaad mentioned in ‘Shifaa bi Haqqooq al-Mustafaa’ (2/24): ‘Know that whoever loves something then he follows it and he follows that which it agrees upon otherwise he will not be truthful in his love and will be a mere claimant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the one who is truthful in his love for the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> is the one who makes those signs outwardly manifest; the first of which is taking the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> as an example, implementing his Sunnah, following his sayings and actions, fulfilling his commands, keeping away from what he prohibited and to follow his character in ease and hardship and in times of strength and weakness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof for this is Allaah’s -Ta’ala – saying: &lt;&lt;Say: ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you&gt;&gt; i.e. following what Allaah legislated above his own desires making his desires in agreement with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala- said: &lt;&lt; and they have no jealousy in their hearts for that which they have been given (from the booty of Banî An-Nadîr), and give them (the emigrants) preference over themselves, even though they were in need of that. &gt;&gt; [Hashr : 9]’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘al-Hukm al-Haqq fee al-Hihteefal biMawlid sayyid al-Khalq’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and blessings be upon our final</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prophet Muhammad, his</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">family, his companions</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and all those who</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">follow his</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Imaam Ibn Katheer mentioned his biography in ‘al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah’ (18/370): ‘Shaykh, al-Imaam, possessor of skills…..distinguished &amp; advanced in the knowledge of Arabic grammar –  &amp; other sciences – …’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Farhoon al-Malikee said in ‘ad-Deebaaj al-Madhab’ (2/80): ‘He was a scholar, respected, had many skills in hadeeth, Fiqh, al-Usool, Arabic, literature….’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Ustadh Muhammad bin Muhammad Makhloof mentioned in his biography in the book ‘Shajaratul noor az-Zakeeyah’ : (1/247) saying: ‘He was the Imaam of Garnaatah (a city in Andalus) he was its Muhaddith, its Mufti… he was a Faqihi, scholar, a righteous exemplary…’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]Here we can say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every good is in the following of the Salaf * and every evil is in the innovations of the Khalaf</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The transliteration of which is: ‘Kullu khairin fee ittiba’ man Salaf * wa Kullu Sharrin fee Ibtida’ man Khallaf’ (T.N.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666699;">By Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah as-Salafi <em>-Rahimullaah-<br />
</em>From his book  ‘Madarij as-Salikeen’</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah as-Salafi <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘</strong>Allaah’s slave cannot implement &lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship&gt;&gt; except with two great principles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of which is following the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second is <em>Ikhlaas</em> (sincerity) for the One worshipped.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is then implementing &lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people are divided into four categories in relation to these two principles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first of which is the people who have <em>Ikhlaas</em> for the One worshipped and for following the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>. They are, in reality, the people of &lt;&lt; You (Alone) we worship&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So all their actions are for Allaah, their sayings are for Allaah, their giving and their prohibiting are for Allaah, their loving is for Allaah and their hating is for Allaah.  Their apparent dealings and hidden dealings are for Allaah’s Face Alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They do not want reward from the people for this or thanks, nor do they desire position with them, nor do they request praise or status in their hearts or escape from their criticisms.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather they hold the people at the same status as those who are in graves. They do not possess any harm or benefit for them, neither life or death, nor the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, action done for the sake of the people, desiring refuge and status among them and hoping for harm and benefit from them, never emanates from the one who knows the people, but rather itemanates from the one who is ignorant of their affairs and one who is ignorant of his Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who knows the people places them according to their status.  So whoever knows Allaah, then he makes his actions and sayings sincerely for Allaah, he obeys Him and prohibits for Him,loves for Him and hates for Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A person does not deal with any thing from the creation, to the exclusion of Allaah, except due to his ignorance of Allaah and his ignorance of the creation.  Otherwise, if he knew Allaah and knew the people, he would prefer his dealing with Allaah to his dealing with the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, all his actions and worship should be in agreement with the command of Allaah and with what Allaah loves and is pleased with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the only actions which Allaah accepts from the one who performs them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this, He tries His worshippers with life and death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Who has created death and life, that He may test you which of you is best in deed. &gt;&gt; [Mulk: 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He made whatever is on the earth as beautification for it so He could test which of them is the best in action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fudayl bin ‘Aayaad said: ‘A good action is one that is sincere and correct.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘O Abu ‘Alee which one is sincere and correct?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘If the action is sincere but is not correct, then it will not be accepted and if it is correct but not sincere it will not be accepted, until it is sincere and correct.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Khaalis</em> (sincere) is that which is for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Sawaab</em> (correct) is that which is according to the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what is mentioned in the saying of Allaah <em>–Ta’ala-</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord.’  &gt;&gt; [Khaf: 110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And who can be better in religion than one who submits his face (himself) to Allaah (i.e. follows Allaah’s Religion of Islaamic Monotheism); and he is a good-doer. &gt;&gt; [Nisa: 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah does not accept actions except those that are sincerely for His Face, following His command. Anything other than these are rejected and returned to the one who performs them– even though he is in a great need of their being accepted – them being scattered in all directions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Saheeh, from the hadeeth of ‘Aeysha, on the authority of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>: ‘Every action which we have not commanded then it is rejected.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every action without a precedent does not increase the one performing it except in distance from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah <em>–Ta’ala –</em> is surely worshipped according to His commands and not by opinions and desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second category is the one who neither has <em>Ikhlaas</em> nor does he follow.  His action is then not in accordance with the <em>Sharia’</em> nor is it sincerely for the one worshipped, such as actions which are beautified for the people, those who show off hypocritically by other than what Allaah and His Messenger legislated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These people are the most evil of creation, they are the most hated to Allaah <em>–Azza wa Jal</em>.  They have a greater share in the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Think not that those who rejoice in what they have done (or brought about), and love to be praised for what they have not done,- think not you that they are rescued from the torment, and for them is a painful torment.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[aal-Imraan:188]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They rejoice in what they have been given of <em>Bida’</em>, misguidance and<em>Shirk</em> and they love being praised for falsely following the Sunnah and <em>Ikhlaas</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many of this type – from those who ascribe themselves to knowledge, poverty and worship – from those who deviated away from the <em>Sirat al-Mustaqeem</em> (straight way).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed they perform <em>Bida’</em> and misguidance, they show off – boasting about their actions, loving to be praised for that which they have not done of <em>Ittiba</em> (following the Messenger), <em>Ikhlaas</em> (sincerity) and<em> Ilm</em> (knowledge). They are the people who have Allaah’s Anger upon them and are the people of misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third category is he who is sincere in his actions, however he is not upon path of following the command, just like the ignorant worshippers and those who ascribe themselves to paths of <em>Zuhud</em>and poverty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everyone who worships Allaah without following Allaah’s command, believing that his act of worship is a form of drawing closer to Allaah, then his condition is like this.  Such as the one who thinks that listening to whistling and the clapping of hands is a form of drawing closer to Allaah or that being in isolation – which necessitates leaving the <em>Jummah</em> prayer and the congregational prayer – is a form of drawing closer to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or the one who thinks that continuous fasting, day and night, is a form of drawing closer to Allaah or fasting the day which all the people refrain from fasting is a form of drawing closer to Allaah or other similar examples.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth category is when his actions follow Allaah’s command, but they are for other than Allaah, such as obedience to those who hypocritically show off or like a man who fights to show off, or fanatically or for bravery or performs <em>Hajj</em> so it can be said that he performs <em>Hajj</em> or reads Qur’aan so it can be said that he recites Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Outwardly, the actions of these people are righteous actions which have been commanded, however they are not righteous and so they will not be accepted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allaah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him), and perform prayer and give the <em>Zakaat</em>: and that is the right religion &gt;&gt;[al-Bayyinah: 5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So everyone has been ordered not to worship other than Allaah except by what He has commanded, having <em>Ikhlaas</em> for Him in worship and these are the people of</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything) &gt;&gt;’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666699;">Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 1095 – From Abu Rashid al-Hubraani who said: Abu Umama al-Bahili took me by the hand and said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> took me by my hand and said to me: ‘O Abu Umama! Indeed from the believers are those who soften (with love) their hearts towards me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ahmad]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the meaning of ‘soften their hearts towards me’ is that they are gentle and incline towards me with love and affection and Allaah knows best.  And this cannot be achieved except with <em>Ikhlaas</em> (sincerity) and following the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> more than any other human being, because Allaah Ta’ala singled that out as an evidence to prove that a person really loves Allaah –Azza wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said: &lt;&lt;Say (O Muhammad): ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you and forgive you of your sins.&gt;&gt; [Aal’Imraan:31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it not about time that those who claim to love the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> in their speech and their <em>an-Nasheed</em> (songs), that they return to adhere to the true love which will lead to the love of Allaah Ta’ala, so that they will not be from those whom, the poet said:<br />
تعصي الإله َ وأنتَ تـُظهرُ حـُـبـَّه ُ *** هذا لـَعـَمْرُكَ في القياس ِ بديع ُ<br />
لو كانَ حـُبـُّكَ صادقا ً لأطعتـــَـــه ُ *** إنَّ المـُحـِبَّ لمنْ يُحـِبُّ مـُطيع ُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You disobey your Lord and present your love *** I swear that this action is innovative</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If your love was truthful you would have obeyed Him *** Indeed the one who loves is obedient to the one whom he loves</p>

</em>Following the Companions</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 -From Hudhayfah bin al-Yamaan (d. 36 A.H.) <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Follow our paths, because verily if you follow us then indeed  you have truly advanced a lot.  And if you oppose us then indeed you have become extremely misguided.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘al-Bida’ by Ibn Wadha/44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 -From Jafar bin ‘Amr (d. 207 A.H.) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘We were a group from the children of the Companions of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, we said:  Verily our fathers have indeed preceded us with <em>Hijrah</em> and companionship of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, so let us strive in worship in the hope that we will reach their excellence.  We came across Tameem ad-Daari (the Companion) as an old man, who could not stand nor sit due to the length of his prayer.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Zuhud’ by Ahmad /249]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – From Salih bin Kaysaan (d. 140 A.H.) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I met up with Zuhri and we would seek knowledge( together), then we said: We should write the <em>Sunnan</em>,  we should write that which came from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, then we should write that which came from his Companions as indeed it is the Sunnah. So I said:  It is not the Sunnah and we should not write it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continues:  So Zuhri wrote it, but I did not write it, so he was successful whereas I became lost.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Jamia Bayyan al-Ilm’ 2/1176]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – From Muhammad Ibn Sireen (d. 110 A.H.) who was asked about combining the Umrah into the Hajj, so he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Umar bin Khattab and Uthman bin ‘Affaan disliked it, and if it was knowledge then they are more knowledgeable than me, and if it was their opinion then their opinion is better.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Jamia Bayyan al-Ilm’ 1/773]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- From Sa’eed bin al-Musayib (d. 93 A.H.)that he was asked about something so he who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Companions of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> differed regarding this and I can have no opinion to place along with theirs.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Jamia Bayyan al-Ilm’ 1/770]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – From Mujahid (d. around 105 A.H.)who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Scholars are the Companions of Muhammad <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Jamia Bayyan al-Ilm’ 1/770]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 – From AbdurRahmaan bin ‘Amr al-Aawza’i (d.156 A.H.) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Knowledge is that which came from the Companions of Muhammad <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, and that which did not come from even one of them, then it is not knowledge.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Jamia Bayyan al-Ilm’ 1/769]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8 – From Ibrahim an-Nakha’i (d. 96 A.H.) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If it had reached me concerning them, i.e. the Companions, that they did not exceed in the <em>Wudu</em> more than a finger nail, then I would not exceed it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ash-Sharh wal-Ibaanah /161]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">How a Companion of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-   is Identified</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">By Miseekah bint ‘Assim al-Quruti</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Companions can be known in a number of different ways:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- Sometimes the Companions can be known by being mentioned in the Noble Qur’aan, like the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;as one of two, when they were in the cave&gt;&gt; [Tawbah: 40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the meaning of that is as-Siddiq <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> [Abu Bakr].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the scholars say: ‘Whoever rejects Abu Bakr’s companionship of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> is a disbeliever.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise the mention of the companionship of Zayed bin Harithah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em>due to the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;So when Zayd had no longer any need for her, We married her to you&gt;&gt; [Ahzab: 37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – By <em>Tawatir</em> (Recurring narratives) like the companionship of Umar, Uthmaan, Ali, Hudayfah, Abu Huriarah, ‘Aeysha and others from the senior Companions <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhum ajmaeen</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – By beneficial information, and that is by a Companion of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> being well-known amongst the other Companions. It is less than<em>Tawatir</em> (Recurring narratives), which means that many of the people knew them, even if it was hidden from a small number of them, like: Thaabit bin Qaays, Dhul-Yadain, Mu’aawiyah ibn al-Hakam as-Sulami, Bareerah the freed slave of ‘Aeysha and others from amongst them <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhum ajmaeen</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – By the testification of other Companions of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam,</em> as in the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbas <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> regarding the seventy thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning; so ‘Ukashah bin Mihsan stood up and said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah make <em>Dua’</em> to Allaah to make me from amongst them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: ‘You are from them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 – By a Companion actually narrating from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>that he heard him <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> saying, or that he witnessed the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> in his time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – By the testification of a <em>Taabaiee’</em> (a successor of the Companions) where he says: ‘So and so from the Companions of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> narrated to me.’  And this has some conditions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a-    That the <em>Isnad</em> (chain) is authentic from that <em>Taabaiee’</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b-    That he is a senior <em>Taabaiee’</em> so that most of his narrations are from the Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">c-    That the <em>Taabaiee’</em> is well known for his memory and precision. No mistake has been experienced from him, since he could have made a mistake and he was not aware of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 – That the person himself says ‘I am a Companion of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.’  That he is known to be just. It is obligatory that his announcement had been made within one hundred years of the death of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>. It has been affirmed by <em>Tawatir</em> (Recurring narratives) that the last of the Companions to die was Abu at-Tufayl bin ‘Aamir bin Waathilah al-Laythi, and what is correct is that he died in the year 110 A.H. so whoever claims companionship after that, then it is not accepted from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a principle, which is beneficial, and through it we can identify the companionship of a large number of Companions by knowing a general characteristic which includes all of them to be from the Companions of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, and this principle is taken from three <em>Athaar</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first: ‘The general people would only place the Companions in charge of battles. Whoever researches narrations which talk about the battles against those who apostated after the death of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and the battles concerning conquering other lands, finds that there had been many Companions mentioned.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second: ‘That Ibn ‘Awf said: ‘No one would have a new born except that he would bring it to that Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and he would supplicate for it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third: ‘There had not remained anyone in Madina, nor Makkah, nor Taif by the tenth year after the <em>Hijra</em> except that he had accepted Islaam and had witnessed the farewell Hajj.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, whoever was present at that time is classified as a Companion under this Companionship due to them seeing the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> even if he himself did not see them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[For References of this section see: ‘Muqqadamah Ibn Salah’ along with its explanation ‘at-Taqyeed’, ‘al-Baith al-Hatheeth’ by Ibn Katheer, ‘al-Isaabah’ by Ibn Hajr &amp; ‘Fath al-Muggeeth’ by Sakhawee.’]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center">By the  <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Why the ascription of Salafeeyah? Is it a call to <em>Hizbeeyah</em>?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani (d.1420A.H) <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Why the ascription of Salafeeyah? Is it a call to <em>Hizbeeyah</em>, or a sect, or <em>Madhab</em>, or is it a new group in Islaam?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the word ‘<em>as-Salaf</em>’ is well known in the Arabic language, and in the <em>Sharia’</em>, and what is important to us here is the research from the <em>Sharia’</em> point of view.  It has been authentically reported from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> that he said to Sayyidah Fatima <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> during the illness from which he died:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">فاتقي الله واصبري، ونعم السلف أنا لك</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Fear Allaah and be patient, for indeed I am a blessed <em>Salaf</em> (Predecessor) for you.[1]’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars used this word ‘<em>as-Salaf</em>’ a lot, and it has been used so much more than can be enumerated, it is sufficient for us to use one example, and that is what we need to fight against <em>Bida’</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">كل خير في اتباع من سلف** وكل شر في ابتداع من خلف</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Every good is in the following of the Salaf * and every evil is in the innovations of the Khalaf</strong><strong>[2]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there are those who claim to have knowledge who reject this ascription, claiming that it does not have any foundation, so they say: it is not allowed for a Muslim to say I am a Salafi.  Its as if they say: it is not allowed for a Muslim to say: I follow the Salaf as-Salih of what they are upon from ‘<em>Aqeedah</em>, worship and manners!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that this type of rejection – if this is what they mean – necessitates being free from the correct Islaam which our Salaf as-Salih were upon, and at the head of them is the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>as is indicated in the <em>Mutawatir</em>hadeeth which is in Bukhari, Muslim and in other books, from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">خير الناس قرني، ثم الذين يلونهم ، ثم الذين يلونهم</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The best people are my generation then those who will come after them and then those after them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore it is not allowed for the Muslim to free himself from the ascription to the Salaf as-Salih, whereas if a Muslim freed himself from any other ascription, then it would not be possible for anyone from the people of knowledge to ascribe them to <em>Kufr</em>(disbelief) or <em>Fasooq</em> (openly sinning).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this person who rejects this ascription, don’t you see that he himself ascribes to a<em>Madhab</em> from the <em>Madhahib</em> (plural: <em>Madhab</em>)?! Whether this <em>Madhab</em> was connected to ‘<em>Aqeedah</em> or with <em>Fiqh</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he is either an <em>Ashari</em> or a <em>Matroodi</em>, or either he is from the <em>Ahl-ul-Hadeeth</em>, or<em>Hanafi</em>, or <em>Shafia’i</em>, or <em>Maliki</em>, or <em>Hanbali</em> from those who enter into the title of <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jammah</em>. Even though he who ascribes to the <em>Ashari</em> <em>Madhab</em> or to the four<em>Madhahib</em> then he ascribes to people who are without doubt not infallible, even though there from those scholars who are correct, I wish he had only rejected the likes of these ascriptions to individuals not infallible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who ascribes to the Salaf as-Salih, then he ascribes to that which is in general infallible, and indeed the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> mentioned that from the signs of the <em>Firqat an-Najeeha</em> (the saved sect) that they adhere to that which the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> was upon and what the Companions were upon, so who ever adhered to it is with certainty upon guidance from his Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Without doubt the clear, manifest, distinguished, evident evidence of this title is to say: I am a Muslim upon the Book and the Sunnah and upon the methodology of our Salaf as-Salih, and that is to summarize it by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">أنا سلفي</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">I am a Salafi.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">By Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah as-Salafi <em>-Rahimullaah-<br />
</em>Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘From the levels of &lt;&lt; It is only You we worship and only You we ask for help&gt;&gt; is the level of <em>al-Istiqaama</em> (being steadfast on the right way).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; Indeed, those who have said, ‘Our Lord is Allaah’ and then remained steadfast – the angels will descend upon them, [saying], ‘Do not fear and do not grieve but receive good tidings of Paradise, which you were promised.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[Fussilat :30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; Indeed, those who have said, ‘Our Lord is Allaah,’ and then remained steadfast – there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve. Those are the companions of Paradise, abiding eternally therein as reward for what they used to do.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[al-Ahaqqaf : 13-14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah said to His Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; So remain steadfast as you have been commanded, [you] and those who have turned back with you [to Allaah], and do not transgress. Indeed, He Sees of what you do. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[Hood :112]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He explained that <em>Istiqaama</em> is the opposite of oppression, which is overstepping the bounds in everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; Say, O [Muhammad], ‘I am only a man like you to whom it has been revealed that your god is but one God; so take a straight course to Him and seek His forgiveness. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"> [Fussilat : 6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; And [Allaah revealed] that if they had remained steadfast on the right way, We would have given them abundant provision So We might test them therein. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[Jinn:16-17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most truthful of this <em>Ummah</em> and the one who had the greatest <em>Istiqaama</em> – Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> was asked about <em>Istiqaama</em>? He answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘That you do not associate anything with Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What he intended was <em>Istiqaama</em> upon pure <em>Tawheed</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar bin al-Khattab <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<em>Istiqaama</em> is that you remain steadfast upon commands and prohibitions. And do not dodge them in the way that foxes swerve away.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Uthmaan bin ‘Affan <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘To be steadfast means that you make your actions purely and sincerely for Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ali bin Abee Taalib <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> and Ibn ‘Abbas <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘To be steadfast means: to perform the obligatory worship.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Be steadfast upon the command of Allaah, fulfil His obedience, and distance yourself from sinning against Him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujahid said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Be steadfast upon the testification of <em>‘</em><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> (‘There is none worthy of worship, in truth, except Allaah’) until they meet Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Be steadfast upon love for Allaah and His worship and do not turn away from Him to the right or to the left.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Saheeh of Muslim from Sufyaan bin Abdullaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said: ‘I said O Messenger of Allaah tell me a statement about Islaam, which I can only ask of from you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> – answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Say, I believe in Allaah, then be steadfast.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in the Saheeh of Muslim from Thawbaan <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> – who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Be steadfast, and you will not be in loss, and know that the best of your actions is the prayer, and no one is continuous upon <em>Wudoo</em> except a believer.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is required from the slave of Allaah is to remain steadfast, and that is being steadfast and upright. If he is not capable of remaining steadfast, then he should do that what is close to remaining steadfast as possible, however, if he falls below that, then he is in loss and in a state of negligence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As is mentioned in the Saheeh of Muslim from the hadeeth of Abu Huraira <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> – who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Adhere to the correct way and if you cannot then that which is nearest to it, and know that none of you will not succeed with just his actions alone.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They asked: ‘Not even you O Messenger of Allaah?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> – answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Not even me, only if Allaah encompasses me with mercy from Himself and His excellence.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All the different levels and status of the Deen are gathered together in this hadeeth, so the command of being steadfast means to be correct, namely to be correct in intentions, statements and in actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8211; mentioned in the hadeeth of Thawbaan that they would not be capable of continuously remaining steadfast, so he referred them to coming closer to being steadfast, namely that they come as close as possible to being steadfast according to their own capability, like the person who shoots at a target but he does not hit the target however he comes close to it.  Along with this he <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> – informed them that being steadfast and coming close to being steadfast will not grant you success on the Day of Judgement by itself. Therefore, one should not just rely upon ones actions alone, or be amazed by his actions, nor should one view his success through his actions alone, rather his success is with the mercy of Allaah and His pardoning and His excellence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Istiqaama</em> is a comprehensive word, its meaning embodies the <em>Deen</em>. And it is to stand in front of Allaah with honesty and adhering to the reality of truth, and fulfilling Allaah’s covenant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Istiqaama</em> is linked to sayings, actions, situations and intentions, so to possess<em>Istiqaama</em> in these matters means that they are done for Allaah and for the sake of Allaah and upon the command of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some righteous people said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Make <em>Istiqaama</em> your companion, not one who seeks a miracle, even though your inner self desires to seek a miracle, because your Lord requests <em>Istiqaama</em> from you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The greatest of miracles is adhering to <em>Istiqaama</em>’.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">Taken from Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> by The <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Naasiruddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2595 – From Jabir bin Abdullaah who said that the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>  passed by a man who kept turning over on his back and front out of severe hunger, so the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> asked the people about him.  They said: ‘He is fasting O Prophet of Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> ordered him to break his fast, and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Is it not sufficient that you are in the path of Allaah and with the Messenger of Allaah<em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> that you have to fast.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Ahmad, and its <em>Isnaad</em> is <em>Saheeh</em> upon the conditions of Imam Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘In this hadeeth is a clear evidence that it is not allowed to fast while travelling if it is harmful to the person fasting, and the saying of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> applies to him: ‘It is not from righteousness to fast while travelling.’ Or the Messenger’s <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> saying: ‘Those are the disobedient ones.’ As for anyone else then he has the choice, if he wants he can fast and if he wants he can break his fast. This is a summary of what the hadeeth in this issue  intended, and there is no contradiction between the Ahadeeth, and all praise belongs to Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ vol.6/1 – No. 2595]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani commented on another hadeeth in ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2884 – The hadeeth of Hamzah bin ‘Amr al-Aslami <em>-Radi Allaahu anhu-</em> when he asked the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> about fasting whilst travelling and the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whichever of those is easier for you then do it. i.e. not fasting in Ramadan or fasting while travelling.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Tamam in ‘al-Fawaid’ and its <em>Isnaad</em> is <em>Saheeh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I brought the research of this wording here, firstly to reference this hadeeth to its source, and secondly to include the reason as to why the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> allowed this and let the traveler have the choice of fasting or breaking the fast, and that is the explanation of this issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People are completely different as is witnessed and well known from their different capabilities and their different natures (i.e. Physically and in terms of <em>Taqwa</em>) so for some people it is easier to fast along with the people and not make up for it, when they have finished fasting. And others differ so they do not fast because of the allowance not to, and then they make up the fasts later.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah send His prayers upon the unlettered Prophet to whom it was revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Allaah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you &gt;&gt; [Baqarah: 185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ vol.6/2 – No. 2884]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#666699;">By Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah as-Salafi <em>-Rahimullaah-<br />
</em>From his book ‘Madarij as-Salikeen’ </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed Allaah mentioned ‘<em>as-Sakeenah</em>’ (Tranquility) in His Book in six places:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) The saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; وَقَالَ لَهُمْ نَبِيُّهُمْ إِنَّ آيَةَ مُلْكِهِ أَنْ يَأْتِيَكُمُ التَّابُوتُ فِيهِ سَكِينَةٌ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;  And their prophet said to them, Indeed, a sign of his kingship is that the chest will come to you in which is assurance from your Lord &gt;&gt;[al-Baqarah: 248]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) The saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; ثُمَّ أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ سَكِينَتَهُ عَلَى رَسُولِهِ وَعَلَى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;  Then Allah sent down His tranquility upon His Messenger and upon the believers &gt;&gt;[Tawbah: 26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3) The saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إِذْ يَقُولُ لِصَاحِبِهِ لَا تَحْزَنْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ مَعَنَا فَأَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ سَكِينَتَهُ عَلَيْهِ وَأَيَّدَهُ بِجُنُودٍ لَمْ تَرَوْهَا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;  and he said to his companion, ‘Do not grieve; indeed Allah is with us.’ And Allah sent down his tranquility upon him and supported him with Angels you did not see &gt;&gt;[Tawbah: 40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4) The saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; هُوَ الَّذِي أَنْزَلَ السَّكِينَةَ فِي قُلُوبِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ لِيَزْدَادُوا إِيمَانًا مَعَ إِيمَانِهِمْ وَلِلَّهِ جُنُودُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمًا &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;  It is He who sent down tranquility into the hearts of the believers that they would increase in faith along with their [present] faith. And to Allah belong the soldiers of the heavens and the earth, and ever is Allah Knowing and Wise. &gt;&gt;[al-Fath: 4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5) The saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; لَقَدْ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِذْ يُبَايِعُونَكَ تَحْتَ الشَّجَرَةِ فَعَلِمَ مَا فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ فَأَنْزَلَ السَّكِينَةَ عَلَيْهِمْ وَأَثَابَهُمْ فَتْحًا قَرِيبًا &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;  Certainly was Allah pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you, [O Muhammad], under the tree, and He knew what was in their hearts, so He sent down tranquility upon them and rewarded them with an imminent conquest  &gt;&gt;[al-Fath: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6) The saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; إِذْ جَعَلَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا فِي قُلُوبِهِمُ الْحَمِيَّةَ حَمِيَّةَ الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ فَأَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ سَكِينَتَهُ عَلَى رَسُولِهِ وَعَلَى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; When those who disbelieved had put into their hearts chauvinism – the chauvinism of the time of ignorance. But Allah sent down His tranquility upon His Messenger and upon the believers &gt;&gt;[al-Fath: 26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> used to read the <em>Ayaat</em> of<em>as-Sakeenah</em> (Tranquility) if matters became intense for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I heard him talk about a great incident which occurred when he was sick, the general intellect is too deficient to comprehend how evil souls emerged and waged war against him in his state of weakness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When this matter became intense, I said to my relatives and those around me: ‘Read the <em>Ayaat</em> of <em>as-Sakeenah</em> (Tranquility).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I would be free from this condition, and I would sit up as if a transformation had taken place and there was nothing wrong with me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also tried this, and I read these <em>Ayaat</em> of <em>as-Sakeenah</em> (Tranquility) when the heart becomes agitated due to what affects it and I witnessed the amazing effects of these<em>Ayaat</em> on the tranquility of the heart and its peacefulness.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From: ‘Samma’aat Ibn al-Qayyim min Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah’ p.352-353 Quoted from: ‘Madarij as-Salikeen’ 2/502]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">Compiled &amp; Translated  by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn Abbas who said the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> used to seek refuge for al-Hassan and al-Hussein, he would say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">‫أعوذ بكلمات الله التامة من كل شيطان وهامة ، ومن كل عين لامة</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I seek refuge for you two with Allaah’s perfect words from every Shaytaan (devil) and poisonous creature and every evil eye.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said that this is how Ibrahim used to seek refuge for Ishaaq and Ismaeel.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari &amp; Tirmidhi with the extra wording, authenticated by Albaani]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>An Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul Ulaa AbdurRahmaan al-Mubarakfooree <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Allaah’s words’:     ‘It has been said that they are the Qur’aan and it has also been said they are Allaah’s names.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Perfect’:               ‘Al-Jazari said: ‘Indeed Allaah’s speech has been described as being Perfect, because it is not permissible for any of His speech to have deficiency or fault like there is in the speech of people.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It has been said that the meaning of ‘Perfect’ here is that it benefits the one seeking refuge with these ‘Perfect words’, and protect him from illnesses and this would be sufficient for him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Poisonous creature’:        ‘Every type of creature that kills with poison. And it is possible that it could mean any crawling animal even if it does not kill, like insects.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Evil eye’:              ‘From every evil type of affliction from the eye.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Tuhfahtul Ahawadhi’ an explanation of Sunan at-Tirmidhi]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>How to Seek Refuge from the Evil Eye for Children</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’  </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani <em>-Rahimullaah-</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani was asked over the phone:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Phone rings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:       yes!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Caller:                  <em>Aslaamu alaykum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:       <em>Wa alaykum as-Salaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Caller:         O Shaykh regarding ‘I seek refuge for you two with Allaah’s perfect words from every Shaytaan (devil) and poisonous creature and every evil eye.’ Is this said three consecutive times or just once?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:       No, it is mentioned once, however if it appears to the one saying this <em>Dua’</em>that he needs to repeat it without specifying three times, then there is no problem with that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Caller:         and should he place his hand on the head of the one sought refuge for?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:       Yes, yes!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Caller:         Even in congregation, if it is a group of children together, how can he place his hand upon all of them?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:       He should place his two hands on two of the children, then repeat this on the rest of the children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Caller:         Right hand and left hand, with both hands?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:       Yes, yes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Caller:                  Regarding the hadeeth that the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">would not sleep until he recited <em>Soorah</em> Mulk, al – Isra, Zumar, and Sajdah, is this when he lies down on his bed at night, or before he lies down?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:       What is important is that he recites before he falls asleep, whether it is whilst he is sitting or lying then it is up to him’</p>

<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 – 1175 – From Hudayfah that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Do not say: whatever Allaah wills and whatever so and so wills, but you should say: whatever Allaah wills then whatever so and so wills.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 137</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- 1176 – From Sahl bin Haneef that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>narrated to him, where he said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said to me:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘You are my messenger to Makkah; so convey my <em>Salam</em> to them, and tell them: that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> orders you with three things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Do not swear by your fathers –[and in another narration: with other than Allaah]– and if you relieve yourselves then do not face the <em>Qiblah</em> nor face your back to it, and do not clean yourselves using bones, nor with dung.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 3953</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – 1178 – From Abdullaah bin Buraidah from his father who said the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever swears by a trust then he is not from us, and whoever causes a wife to hate her husband or a slave to hate his master then he is not from us.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 325</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – 1180 – From Abu Umamah bin Thalabah who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah<em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever acquires wealth of a Muslim by swearing a false oath; then it will be a black speck on his heart, and nothing will change it until the Day of Judgement.’</p>

I took an oath that if Allaah saved me/delivered me upon this, then I would eat from its liver and its hump!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘What a wretched reward you have given it, this is not an oath, indeed an oath is what is done desiring the Face of Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said this about the wife of Abu Dharr who had taken an oath, that if she was saved from the kuffar upon the ride of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> then she would slaughter it.’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – 1184 – From Thabit bin ad-Dhihaak who said: a man at the time of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> took an oath that he would slaughter an animal at<em>Boowana</em> (a certain place), when the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>came he said: I have taken an oath that I would slaughter at <em>Boowana</em>, so the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Was there an idol from the idols of <em>Jahileeyah</em> worshipped there?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘No.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger asked: ‘Was there an <em>Eid</em> (a day of celebration) from the days of celebration at that place?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘No.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Fulfil your oath, indeed an oath is not fulfilled in sinning against Allaah, nor in breaking relations, nor in that which the son of Adam does not possess.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2872</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 – 1185 – From Ibn Abbas <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> from the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There are two types of vows, firstly, that which was for Allaah, so its expiation is fulfilling it. Secondly that which was for Shaytaan then there is no fulfilment of that but the expiation is the penalty of the unfulfilled vow.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 479</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8 – 1186 – From Abu Hurairah from the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Allaah -Azza wa Jal- said: Making a vow does not earn anything for the son of Adam except that which I have destined for him.  Rather, making a vow is something which makes a miserly person give.  He comes to Me with that which he would not offer due to his miserliness.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 478</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9 – 1187 – From Uqbah bin ‘Aamir al-Jahnee who said: my sister made an oath that she would walk to the <em>Ka’aba</em> barefooted, and with her head uncovered, when the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> saw her he asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘What is wrong with her?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They answered that she took an oath that she would walk to the <em>Ka’aba</em> barefooted, and with her head uncovered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Order her to get a ride, and cover herself, perform the <em>Hajj</em> and slaughter a sacrificial animal.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2930</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10 – From Ibn Abbas: that a man came to the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and said: last night I saw in a dream, shaded clouds trickling with clarified butter and honey, and I saw people taking handfuls from it, there were those who were taking a lot and there were those who were taking a little and there was a rope connected from the earth to the sky.  I saw you take it and ascend with it, then another man took it and ascended with it, then another man took it and ascended with it, then a man took it and it was cut off, then connected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr said O Messenger of Allaah! May my father be sacrificed for you, I swear by Allaah if you allow me I will interpret it for you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said to him: ‘Go ahead interpret it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘As for the shaded clouds then that is Islaam, as for the trickling of clarified butter and honey, then that is the Qur’aan and its sweetness trickles for the one who reads a lot of Qur’aan and for the one who reads a little of the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the connected rope from the sky to the earth, then that is the truth which you are upon so you take it then Allaah caused you to ascend, then another man held on and ascended, then another man took it and ascended, then another man took it then it cuts off, then it connects and ascended with it, so tell me O Messenger of Allaah – may my father be sacrificed for you – was I right or wrong?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said: ‘You were right in some of it and wrong in some.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Abu Bakr said: ‘I swear by Allaah that you will narrate to me of that which I made a mistake in.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said: ‘Do not take an oath.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No.121</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">The Ruling of making <em>Dhikr</em> collectively in Unison according to the Imams of the Salaf</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Researched by Ahmad bin Muhammad an-Najjar </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[The scenario]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is collectively coming together to make <em>Dhikr</em> (remembrance of Allaah) in unison (one voice) whether that <em>Dhikr</em> is reciting the Qur’aan, or making <em>Dua’</em> or making<em>Tasbeeh</em> (saying: <em>SubhanAllaah</em>) etc. doing this without the aim of educating or learning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Its ruling According to the Imams of the Salaf ]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the Imams of the Salaf from the (<em>Sahabah</em>) Companions and those that followed them in goodness are all agreed upon the rejection of every innovation in the<em>Deen</em>, and rejecting every worship or form of worship which the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>did not do, nor what his noble Companions did not practice.  There are narrations from a group of the Companions and those who followed their way, concerning this form of making <em>Dhikr</em>, and here are their statements:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Umar bin al-Khattab </strong><em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><strong>]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Abu Uthmaan an-Nahdi who said: ‘A worker for Umar bin al-Khattab wrote to Umar saying that there are a group of people who gather together to make <em>Dua’</em> for the Muslims and the leader.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Umar <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> wrote to him: ‘Bring them to me with yourself.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man came and Umar said to the doorman, prepare the whip. When they entered upon Umar <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> he descended upon their leader by hitting him with the whip.’[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The rightly guided Khalifah Umar bin al-Khattab <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> rejected that a group gathered to make <em>Dhikr</em> in a form that the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>did not do, nor did the best of his Companions. To the extent Umar <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em>did not suffice by rejecting what they did by just speaking about it, rather he beat their leader with a whip, and this shows the great concern the Companions had in rejecting innovated <em>Bida’</em> in the <em>Deen</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From ‘Amr bin Salamah:  We were sitting by the door of Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood before lunch, so that if he came out, we could walk with him to the <em>Masjid</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Moosaa al-Ash’aree came and said: Has Abu Abdur-Rahmaan come out yet?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We said: No.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, he sat down with us, waiting for him to come out, and when he came out, we all gathered towards him, and Abu Moosaa said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O Abu Abdur-Rahmaan! Previously I saw something in the <em>Masjid</em>, which I disliked. But, <em>Alhamdulillaah</em>, what I saw, was nothing but good.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: What was it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Moosaa said, ‘If you live, you will see it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Abu Moosaa said, ‘I saw a group of people, sitting in circles waiting for the prayer.  In every circle there was a man and in their hands were small stones and he would say: ‘Say <em>Allaahu Akbar</em> 100 times’ and they would say ‘<em>Allaahu Akbar</em>’ 100 times.  Then, he would say, ‘Say <em>laa ilaha ilAllaah</em> 100 times’ and they would say ‘<em>laa ilaha ilAllaah</em>’ 100 times and he would say, ‘Say <em>SubhaanAllaah</em>’ 100 times and they would say ‘<em>SubhaanAllaah</em>’ 100 times.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood said, ‘So what did you say to them?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘I did not say anything to them, rather I waited for your opinion [or ‘I waited for your command’].’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘Why did you not command them to count their bad deeds [i.e. seek forgiveness from your deeds] and guarantee them that their good deeds would not be lost?!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he walked and we walked with him until he reached one of those circles and he stood there and said, ‘What is this that I see you doing?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘O Abu Abdur-Rahmaan! These are nothing but small stones with which we are counting, saying ‘<em>Allaahu Akbar</em>, <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> and <em>SubhaanAllaah</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, ‘Count your sins; I guarantee that you will not lose anything of your good deeds!  Beware, O <em>Ummah</em> of Muhammad!  How quick you are to your destruction!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here we are, the Companions of your Prophet – abundant, everywhere and here is his clothing which has not been [wasted away] and his utensils have not been broken. I swear by Him in Whose Hand is my soul, <strong>either you are an <em>Ummah</em> more rightly-guided than the <em>Ummah</em> of Muhammad or you are opening the door of misguidance.’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said; ‘We swear by Allaah, O Abu Abdur-Rahmaan, we did not intend anything but good.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘How many people intend good but never achieve it.  Verily the Messenger of Allaah – narrated to us, ‘Indeed there will be a people who read the Qur’aan but it does not pass beyond their throats.’  I swear by Allaah, I do not know. Perhaps most of them are from amongst you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he went away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Amr bin Salamah said, ‘We saw some of those sitting in those circles fighting on the Day of <em>Nahrawaan</em>, along with the Khawaarij.’<strong></strong><strong>[2]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Ibn Mas’ood <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> reprimanded a group who were gathered together in the form of circles, remembering Allaah, and Ibn Mas’ood used as an evidence against their misguidance in that they opposed that what the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> were upon, those who had witnessed the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, and they knew his statements, his actions, and his situations, which the Companions used to use to show their guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Abu Hanifah an-Nu’man]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Abu Hanifah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘That raising the voice in making <em>Takbeer</em> (saying <em>Allaahu Akbar</em>) is principally a <em>Bida’</em>, because it is <em>Dhikr</em>, and the Sunnah regarding <em>Dhikr</em> is with lowering the voice.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Malik bin Anas]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn Wahab who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I said to Malik <em>-Rahimullaah-</em>: ‘What would you say if you saw a group of people gathering together and all of them together reading one <em>Soorah</em> till the end of the<em>Soorah</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Malik rejected that and found fault with that and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This is not how the people used to do this, rather one man used to recite to another person for learning purposes.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Wahab also said in ‘Taj wal-Ikleel li Mukhtasir Khaleel’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Malik disliked that recitors gather together reciting one <em>Soorah</em>, and he said: ‘this was not from the practice of the people,’ and he regarded it as a <em>Bida’</em>.[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Yahya bin Ma’een &amp; Ahmad bin Hanbal]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Fadl bin Mihraan said: ‘I asked Yahya bin Ma’een and Ahmad bin Hanbal: ‘Indeed we have a group of people who get together and make <em>Dua’</em>, recite Qur’aan (collectively) and remember Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> together, how do you view these people?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Yahya bin Ma’een he said: ‘They should read from the <em>Mus’haf</em> (Qur’aan), and make <em>Dua’</em> after the prayer and remember Allaah individually to themselves.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Fadl bin Muhammad said: ‘I said: ‘I have a brother who takes part with them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahya said: ‘Forbid him from that.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: ‘He does not accept.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahya said: ‘Admonish him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: ‘He does not accept. Should I boycott him?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I came to Ahmad and told him similar to what I had said to Yahya and Ahmad also said to me:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘They should read from the <em>Mus’haf</em>, and remember Allaah Ta’ala individually and seek the hadeeth of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: ‘Should I forbid my brother?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad said: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: ‘And if he does not accept.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad said: ‘Of course he will <em>InshAllaah</em>, since indeed this is an innovation, this type of gathering which you describe.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: ‘and if he does not accept should I boycott him?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad smiled and remained silent.’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If an opponent contests what has preceded and says, there are <em>Sharia’</em> texts which indicate to the excellence of gathering for <em>Dhikr</em>, and this is what is established in Saheeh Muslim from Abu Hurairah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> who said: ‘Indeed Allaah <em>–Tabaraka wa Ta’ala –</em> has  noble Angels who travel around, they search for gatherings of <em>Dhikr</em>, and if they find gatherings where there is <em>Dhikr</em> they sit with those people and they encompass each other with their wings, until they fill that which is between them and the heavens of the <em>Dunyaa</em>, then when they leave they ascend and climb to the heavens.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah <em>– Azza wa Jal-</em> asks them – while He knows more about them than they do -: ‘From where did you come?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will reply:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘We came from worshippers of Yours on the earth, and they were saying:<em>SubhaanAllaah</em> (Far is Allaah from imperfection), <em>Allaahu Akbar</em> (Allaah is the Greatest), <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> (there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah) and <em>Alhamdulillaah</em> (Praise be to Allaah) and they were asking of You. . . .’[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are other similar evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reply to this objection is from different points:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- The wording ‘<em>Dhikr’</em> and ‘<em>Tasbeeh’</em> is mentioned in the texts (Book &amp; Sunnah) unrestrictedly. For an unrestricted wording in the <em>Sharia’</em> it is not allowed to limit it to a particular number or amount, or to a particular form, except if there is a text from the<em>Sharia’</em> present regarding it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <em>Dhikr</em> in a collective form with voices in unison, then this has not been mentioned in the Book of Allaah nor in the Sunnah of His Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, what is mentioned in the texts, with the encouragement to perform <em>Dhikr</em> in a plural form does not indicate in itself to making <em>Dhikr</em> collectively, because it is an unrestricted wording, and an unrestricted wording cannot be limited except with a<em>Sharia’</em> evidence, and there is no proof to restrict making <em>Dhikr</em> in unison in this issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- That the Companions did not understand this form of <em>Dhikr</em> from these texts of the<em>Sharia’</em>, rather they rejected this form, and they dispraised the one who did this form of <em>Dhikr</em>.  They regarded this from the innovated matters in the <em>Deen</em>, as has preceded in the story of Umar and Ibn Mas’ood, and the understanding of the Companions of the texts of the two revealed sources (the Book &amp; the Sunnah) precedes the understanding of other than them.  Rather it is an obligation to follow their understanding, and it is not allowed to abstain from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- That the Imams also rejected what the Companions rejected as has been mentioned from Abu Hanifah, Malik, Ahmad bin Hanbal and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that they are united upon rejecting and criticizing this form of <em>Dhikr</em>, and along with that I will add two more statements of two Imams from the Maliki <em>Madhab</em>, and they are Qurtubi and Tartooshi.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul-Abbas Ahmad al-Qurtubi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the saying of the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘No people gather together in one of the houses of Allah, reciting the Book of Allah and studying it among themselves, without tranquility descending upon them, mercy enveloping them, the angels surrounding them, and Allah making mention of them amongst those who are with Him.’[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The houses of Allaah are the <em>Masajid</em>, as Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; In houses (<em>Masajid</em>), which Allah has ordered to be raised, in them His Name is glorified in the mornings and in the afternoons or the evenings&gt;&gt;[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who hold it permissible to read the Qur’aan in congregation in unison (one voice) adhere to this hadeeth, as is done here in Morocco.  Some of our scholars have disliked that, and held the opinion that it is a Bida’, since it was not the way of the Salaf in reciting like this.  But rather the hadeeth is understood to be that every individual studies the Book of Allaah by them self, or with someone who will correct them.’[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tartooshi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘These <em>Aathaar</em> (narrations) necessitate the permissibility of congregating to recite the noble Qur’aan with the intent of studying it, learning it, and revising it. That takes place by a student reading it to a teacher, or a teacher reading it to a student. And if two people have an equal level of knowledge then one of them reads to the other for revision and studying purposes, this is how teaching and learning occur, without having to recite in congregation.’[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concluding, I bring attention to an issue: which is that being continuous upon gathering for the <em>Dhikr</em> of Allaah – even if it does not include doing so in unison – has not been legislated, because there is no text from the Qur’aan nor from the Sunnah being continuous in gathering in this way. Likewise, being continuous upon this type of congregation resembles the congregations which are permissible, like the five daily prayers, the <em>Juma’</em> prayer, the two <em>Eid</em>, and the <em>Hajj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, there is a distinction between what is taken as Sunnah and custom, and these gatherings, which resemble legislated ones, and between that which is done sometimes, since this is permitted, and this is the guidance of the Companions of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, as they would sometimes gather together.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Imam Ibn Taymeeyah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Gathering for optional prayers, or to listen to Qur’aan, or for the <em>Dhikr</em> of Allaah, etc. if that is done sometimes then it is better since it has been authentically reported from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> that he prayed an optional prayer in congregation sometimes. Likewise, he went out to his Companions and there would be amongst them one who would recite and the others would listen, and the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> would sit with them to listen. And the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> would, if they gathered order one of them to recite while they would listen. . . . .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for taking gatherings successively repeating them, repeatedly and regularly over weeks, months and years, other than gatherings which have been legislated. Then these type gatherings which resemble gatherings for the five daily prayers, the <em>Juma’</em>prayer, the two <em>Eid</em>, and the <em>Hajj</em>, that is because those other gatherings are innovated and newly invented. Therefore, there is a difference between what is taken as a Sunnah and what is taken as a habit and that which resembles what is legislated, and this difference has been mentioned by Imam Ahmad and others from the Imams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr al-Khalaal narrated in ‘the book of manners’ from Ishaq bin Mansoor al-Kosaj that he said to Abu Abdullaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It is disliked that a people gather to make <em>Dua’</em> to Allaah and to raise their hands to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad said: ‘I do not reject for brothers, if they should unintentionally gather except that they should not do it a lot.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ishaq bin Rahawayeeyah said the same as what Imam Ahmad said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the wording: ‘not do it a lot’ means not to take it as a habit so much that it is done a lot, and this is the speech of Ishaaq.’[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymeeyah also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Gathering upon reading, <em>Dhikr</em> and <em>Dua’</em> is good and recommended as long as it is not taken as a regular habit – just like those gatherings which are legislated – and that there is no evil <em>Bida’</em> connected to it.’[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaatabi al-Maliki said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Constantly making <em>Dua’</em> in a form of a congregation was not from the actions of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, as it was not from the statements of the Messenger, nor was it from that which he allowed.’[14]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;">The Messenger’s <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> Supplication For Anas <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu<br />
</em>Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ </span><br />
<span style="color:#808000;">By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’  </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#808000;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">140 – From Qatada who said: I heard Anas saying: I heard Umm Sulaym who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O Messenger of Allaah! Make <em>Dua</em>’ to Allaah for Anas’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: <strong>‘O Allaah increase his wealth and offspring and bless him in what you have provided for him.’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Bukhari and Tirmidhi</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">141-  From Thaabit, from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> came to Umm Haraam and she brought him some dates and margarine but the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Return this to its container and the other to its jug, since I am fasting.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he stood and led us in a two <em>Rakah </em>optional prayer and Umm Haraam and Umm Sulaym stood behind us.  He made me stand on his right hand side – and according to Thaabit – Anas continued: He led us in an optional prayer on a mat. When he finished his prayer, Umm Sulaym said: I have a specific request, make <em>Dua</em>’ to Allaah for your young servant Anas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> never left anything of good from the<em>Duniya </em>and the Hereafter except that he supplicated it for me, then he <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>O Allaah increase his wealth and offspring and bless it for him.’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘My daughter informed me that I had been provided with some ninety odd offspring from my loins. There was not a man from amongst the Ansaar who had more wealth than me, then Anas said: ‘O Thaabit, I do not own any gold or silver except for my ring.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Abu Dawood, I say that this <em>Isnaad</em> is Saheeh upon the conditions of Muslim. It is also collected by Ahmad &amp; Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the narration of Ahmad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Then the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> supplicated for Umm Sulaym and her family.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the narrator mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Anas mentioned that his eldest daughter Ameenah informed him that there were more than one hundred and twenty from his offspring buried when Hajjaj appeared.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Albaani said: that this <em>Isnad</em> of three narrators is authentic upon the conditions of Bukhari &amp; Muslim.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Albaani Commented:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘From the benefits of the hadeeth and its <em>Fiqh</em>:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many benefits in this hadeeth, I will mention some of them briefly, except where detail is necessary:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- That supplicating for increase in wealth and offspring is something which is legislated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari has a chapter heading for this hadeeth: ‘Chapter: Supplicating for blessings in having lots of wealth and offspring.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- And that wealth and offspring are a blessing and goodness if Allaah -Tabaraka wa Ta’ala is obeyed in respect to them. How misguided is the one who tries to limit how many children they have, using so many different means, like birth control or regulating it, let alone aborting the foetus and for the most insignificant reasons, and obtaining <em>Fatawa</em> to make their actions permissible! !</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- Allaah answered the <em>Dua’</em> of His Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> for Anas, and it became reality, until he became the one with the most wealth and offspring from amongst the Ansar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- That it is allowed for the one fasting an optional fast, when he visits a person and food is presented to him that he does not have to break his fast, but he supplicates for the host with goodness. And from the chapters of Bukhari: ‘Chapter whoever visits a people and does not break his fast with them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- That if a man is led in prayer by another man, he should stand on the right of the one leading the prayer.  What is evident is that he stands right next to him, not forward nor just behind him, because if anything like this ever occurred then the narrator would have narrated it, especially since the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> repeatedly led individual companions in prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a hadeeth of Ibn Abbas regarding this in Saheeh Bukhari and Muslim, and Bukhari brought a chapter heading for the hadeeth of Ibn Abbas, and Muslim brought it from Jabir. The chapter which Bukhari mentions is: ‘Chapter: if there are two people praying then one stands <strong>equal next </strong>to the one leading the prayer.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafidh said in ‘al-Fath’ (2/160):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Regarding the saying of Bukhari: ‘equal’ means that he does not stand forward from the Imam and nor just behind him, it is as if the compiler (Bukhari) indicates to what occurs in some of the narrations from Ibn Abbas with the wording: <strong>‘So I stood next to him’</strong> and that apparently means equal to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And AbdurRazzaq narrates from Ibn Juraij  who said: I said to ‘Atta:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘A man prays along with another man, where should he stand?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘On his right hand side.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I asked: ‘Does he stand equal to him so that he is in line with him and one is not ahead of the other?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked: ‘Do you like it that they stand equal so there is no gap between them?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In ‘al-Muwatta’ from Abdullaah bin Utbah bin Mas’ood who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I entered upon Umar bin al-Khattab during the morning before <em>Dhur</em> and I found him in<em>Ruku</em> (bowing in the prayer) I stood in prayer behind him, but he brought me forward until he placed me next to him on his right side.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Albaani) say: This Athar in ‘al-Muwatta’ with an authentic chain from Umar <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em>, along with the previously mentioned Ahadeeth are strong proof of the previously mentioned issue of standing equally in the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the saying that it is recommended that the single person following the Imam should stand slightly behind the Imam, as is mentioned by some of the <em>Madhahib</em>(schools of thought), with some of them elaborating about this issue – along with there being no evidence for it from the Sunnah likewise, it also opposes what is apparent from these Ahadeeth, and this narration of Umar, and the previously mentioned statement of ‘Atta and he is the Imam, the noble <em>Taba’ee</em> (Follower of the Companions) Ibn Abee Rabah and likewise it opposes the other statements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is more befitting for the Believer to leave those statements of the <em>Madhahib</em> (schools of thought) to their founders, believing that they are rewarded for it, because they endeavoured and formulated an opinion intending the truth, and it is upon the believer to follow what is established in the Sunnah, since indeed the best guidance is the guidance of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ vol.1 hadeeth no. 219  p.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His Praise and Blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his  companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">By <em>Shaykh Muhadith Nasir as-Sunnah </em>Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding refuting the book ‘Sunnah Nabaweeyah Bayn Ahl-ul-Fiqh wa Ahl-ul-Hadeeth’ [By Muhammad Ghazali] since there are flaws concerning the hadeeth, many of the scholars have refuted it. What is your opinion about the book? What’s your opinion about the refutations?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh Answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This book is very dangerous to the Sunnah, and to the scholars of the Sunnah and the followers of the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that those who refuted it are united upon the truth, even though their methods may differ. From them are those who are strict, from them are those who are easy going and from them are those who are in the middle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This man [Muhammad Ghazali] in addition to not being a critic<strong>,</strong> he is not established upon the knowledge of hadeeth nor upon the foundations of Fiqh principles, and along with that he adds to his use of evidence the opinions of others mockingly.  This is not what someone does whose aim it is to advise the people, so because of this he exposed himself to many, many problems and he is deserving of these problems. It is sufficient that he attacked the Ahadeeth which are present in the ‘Saheeh’ without following the methodology of the scholars and critics as some of them did in the olden days like; Daraqutni, and the likes of Ibn Taymeeyah, and Ibn al-Qayyim, when they would critically examine some of the Ahadeeth. However, they would criticize with knowledge, piety and reflection.  As for this man then he does not criticize except with his own desires from one direction, and with ignorance of hadeeth and its texts from another direction.  Due to this the scope of refuting him is very extensive, so perhaps those who take part in refuting him with their different methods, they took part in that which was obligatory upon them in supporting hadeeth firstly, and the scholars of hadeeth and its followers. This is a brief answer according to what you mentioned.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Questioner continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Do you not see O noble Shaykh, regarding this topic that it is better for the current scholars of Islaam to schedule a meeting and a debate about this subject, this is from one direction. Also<strong>,</strong> do you not see that it is necessary for the noble scholars of Islaam, the likes of yourself to author a refutation against this man, since these great refutations have an effect upon the people. Also<strong>,</strong> do you not see that there should be more refutations against him, more than a lecture and gathering because he has affected the minds of many of the Muslims?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh responded:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This is true, with no doubt or suspicion, however the issue is, as has been said a long time ago:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Not everything a person wishes, can be achieved * A ship does not want a severe storm to blow’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have many works, which unfortunately do not allow me the scope to undertake some of the other religious obligations, this is due to the many projects that I am connected to.  However, perhaps those who have undertaken refuting this person, should form a committee to study these refutations and choose the best of them, then print them and distribute them to the people, to bring this refutation closer to all the people especially those who have been allured by the philosophy of this man and his tongue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for me personally, I am unable and cannot. I indeed held the opinion for example, of at least going to Afghanistan for calling to the Book and the Sunnah, at least amongst the different Arab nationalities, and I excused myself as you can see of my old age.  Otherwise it is necessary to undertake refuting this man, and from those who refuted this person, <strong>the likes of our brother Dr. Rabia’ bin Hadi, the professor of the subject of hadeeth in the university, you may have come across his refutation, indeed he has more knowledge of hadeeth than other than him</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyway, as for your suggestion of forming a committee of scholars to debate this man, then I don’t think that there will be any benefit whatsoever, because you have been trialed before him with some of the Soofeeyah, who supported some Bida’ and the superstitious acts of the Soofeeyah.  It was seen that he could be rectified and be debated but this did not benefit him whatsoever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So perhaps, what is more advisable or better for rectification and beneficial is to form a small committee made up of some of the noble scholars and they choose the strongest and closest from these refutations in understanding, or that they choose from the collection of these refutations, issues which are stronger, and rewrite them with sentences which are clear and understandable for the general people.  This is my opinion, and Allaah knows best.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">By The Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ Muhammad Nasiruddeen al-Albaani </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘A woman went to the hospital and the doctors aborted her four month old fetus, with the argument that the woman had German Measles or measles and if we did not abort it, it would have come out deformed or mentally disabled; what is your opinion?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh Answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I am asked a lot regarding the likes of this situation, and we hold the opinion that you should not respond to these doctors, since their silent expression says: &lt;&lt;we do not think it but as a conjecture, and we have no firm convincing belief (therein).’&gt;&gt; [Al-Jathiyah: 32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have been informed from more than one source that some women had been informed by some doctors the like of this information [of aborting fetuses], but they did not consent to aborting and to miscarrying, and the new-born was delivered naturally, so this confirms that it is nothing but as conjecture.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, every command is in the Hand of Allaah –Tabarak wa Ta’ala- He has the command and He creates everything, so it is not befitting that some doctors participate in the likes of these matters, of which the reality is hidden from all people. Perhaps some people research into some hidden matters more so than others, so it is not allowed to look into the unknown future for all the people, and no-one knows the unseen except Allaah –Tabarak wa Ta’ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a woman … perhaps gives birth to a fetus that is deformed or similar to a deformed child, or like it is said nowadays, that it is disabled etc. . . . so, in respect to us being Muslims believing in Allaah –Azza wa Jal-  and that He is al-Hakeem (The All-Wise) and al-Aleem (The All-Knowing) there is no fault in His creation. So this variance which we generally see between human beings whether it is in skin colour or in height or shortness in stature or in being males or females, or in health and safety, or regarding diseases and illness etc. then all of this is what al-Azeez (The All-Mighty), al-Aleem (The All-Knowing) has pre-destined. Because the Lord –Azza wa Jal- wants to show His slaves that what they regard as good and ugly, then all of that according to Allaah –Azza wa Jal- is good. The way we look at the creation of Allaah – Azza wa Jal- is not the way the Creator Himself –Tabarak wa Ta’ala- views things, because &lt;&lt;there is nothing like unto Him and He is the All-knowing and All-Seeing.&gt;&gt; [Shura:11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At this opportunity it is necessary for me to mention a hadeeth, which I regard as very great concerning this topic and an answer to this question.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> saw a  man from his Companions, walking wearing a long garment and it was trailing below his ankles, so the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said to him: ‘O so and so, raise your garment since it is closer to piety and better to remain cleaner.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah I am bow-legged.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The shaykh continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘So this person lengthened his garment so that he could cover up this deficiency as he had presumed, and he apologized for this reason for having lengthened his garment so the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said to him: ‘O so and so – [the shaykh said: ‘and here is the main point’ ] – ‘All of Allaah’s creation is good. All of Allaah’s creation is good.’ [Saheeh: ‘Silsilah Saheehah’ 1441]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is why, what we see with our human physical eyes, has to be judged immediately that this is a deficient sight. We see, as is mentioned in an old Arabic proverb: ‘Not past his rabbit like nose’ (tip of his nose).  They used to say of old, ‘so and so does not see past his rabbit like nose’ (does not look further than the tip of his nose).  As for looking far ahead then no! In addition to this no matter how far a human being can see, no matter how very far, it is still a deficient sight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Companion from the Companions of the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>saw himself as defective due to being bow-legged and the disability which was in his calves, so he covered it up by lengthening his garment. Because if he raised his garment slightly then some of the disability would have become exposed, so the Prophet &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> brought his attention to this. That what you see as a deficiency is not a deficiency because Allaah is the One Who created you like that, and this is not from your own doing. Just like Allaah –Azza wa Jal- said: &lt;&lt;This is the creation of Allaah. So show Me that which those (whom you worship), besides Him have created. &gt;&gt; [Luqman: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore this child, this fetus, if it is born naturally and it was disabled or was afflicted with an illness which the doctors previously had presumed, then this is the Will of Allaah which is the Destiny that Allaah made so that it can be a lesson for healthy people.  As it has been said: ‘Health is a crown placed upon the head of healthy people which none can see except a person who is ill.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also a very great, noble prophetic instruction, which is: ‘Do not look at those above you but look at those below you, since it is more befitting that you do not belittle the blessings of Allaah upon you.’ [Saheeh Lighayrihi: ‘Saheeh Targheeb  wa Tarheeb 2233]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So perhaps there is a person who has a beautiful form, however there are people who look at themselves and view themselves as ugly and they might say that this person really is beautiful.  So this is the variance in the creation and in beauty and it is the predestination of Allaah al-Azeez (The All-Mighty), al-Aleem (The All-Knowing) al-Hakeem (The All-Wise).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when Allaah created beauty He also created its opposite, as we have said that it is created for an Infinite Wisdom, we can express this with what has been said a very long time ago: ‘Opposites clarify each other.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it was not for ugliness, beauty would not be known. If it was not for illness, health would not be known. If it was not for males there would not be females. If it was not for females there would not be males.  So all this creation that we see, that Allaah created the people upon, it is from the Wisdom of Allaah –Azza wa Jal- this is why it is not befitting to conform to the opinions of doctors concerning matters which have not yet entered the sphere of life, and when it comes into the sphere of life then comes the saying of the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>: ‘O slaves of Allaah seek treatment, since indeed Allaah did not send down a disease except that He sent down the cure.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the hadeeth of Usamah bin Shareek <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em>, it was also narrated by another noble Companion and he is none other than Abdullaah bin Mas’ood <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu- </em>with an extra wording, he said: ‘Seek cure O slaves of Allaah since indeed Allaah did not send down a disease except that He sent down the cure, whoever knew it, knew it and whoever was ignorant of it, was ignorant of it.’ [Saheeh: ‘Silsilah Saheehah’ 451]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, there is nothing to hinder seeking cure later on, however there is a condition which needs to be taken into consideration, which is, that this seeking cure is due to a matter which the new-born is exposed to, i.e. that it is not allowed to change the creation of Allaah –Azza wa Jal, because Allaah –Azza wa Jal- mentions about the accursed Shaytan in the Noble Qur’aan, that the Shaytaan challenged the will of the Lord of the worlds –Azza wa Jal- in respect to Adam and his offspring saying: &lt;&lt; I will order them to slit the ears of cattle, and indeed I will order them to change the nature created by Allaah.&gt;&gt; [Nisa’:119]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not allowed to change the creation of Allaah –Azza wa Jal- and this has examples, very many examples.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">Compiled &amp; Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The <em>Bida’</em> by which a person would be counted as from the <em>Ahl-ul-Ahwa</em> (the people who follow desires) is that which is well known by the people of knowledge of the Sunnah in it opposing the Book and the Sunnah; such as the <em>Bida’</em> of the Khawarij[1], Rawafidah[2], al-Qadareeyah[3] and the Murjiah[4].’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From: ‘Majmoo’ al-Fatawa Ibn Taymeeyah’ 35/414]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever opposes the clear Book, and the elaborate Sunnah or that which the Salaf of the <em>Ummah</em> held a consensus about, and this opposition is without a valid reason, then this person is dealt in the same manner in which the People of <em>Bida’</em> are dealt with.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From: ‘Majmoo’ al-Fatawa Ibn Taymeeyah’ 35/414]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever worshipped with an act of worship which is not obligatory nor recommended, and he believed that it was obligatory or recommended, then he is a misguided<em>Mubtada’</em>, and this is an evil <em>Bida’</em> not a good <em>Bida’</em>, and the imams of the <em>Deen</em> are in agreement about this, since Allaah is not worshipped except with that which is obligatory or recommended.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From: ‘Majmoo’ al-Fatawa Ibn Taymeeyah’ 1/160]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Distinction Between a Bida’ and Ijtihad</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And many from those of the Salaf and those who of the consecutive generations said and acted upon that which is a <em>Bida’</em> and they were not aware that it was a <em>Bida</em>’, either due to a weak hadeeth which they thought was authentic, or due to what they understood of the <em>Ayaat</em> which were not the intent of the <em>Ayaat</em>, or due to an opinion that they held in an issue where the text did not reach them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From: ‘Majmoo’ al-Fatawa Ibn Taymeeyah’ 19/191]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the one whose sin is hidden or performs a <em>Bida’</em> in secret, that <em>Bida’</em> does not take a person outside of Islaam, and this person is not made <em>Hijra</em> (boycotted) from, on the contrary the person who is made <em>Hijra</em> from is the one who calls to <em>Bida’</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From: ‘Majmoo’ al-Fatawa Ibn Taymeeyah’ 24/175]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Rabee’ al-Madkhalee was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Question: Which <em>Bida’</em> is it by which a person is counted as being outside the circle of<em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jamma’</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The <em>Bida’</em> such as of <em>al-Qadr</em>[5], <em>Bida’</em> of <em>al-Irjaa</em>[6], <em>Bida’</em> of <em>ar-Rafd</em>[7], <em>Bida’</em> of<em>Kharooj</em>[8], and the Soofeeyah <em>Bida’</em> such as the <em>Mawlid</em>[9] which has <em>Shirk</em> and any other types of <em>Mawlid</em>.  Making journeys to graves and other types of <em>Bida’</em> which are similar to this – may Allaah bless you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In having loyalty to the <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> a person becomes from amongst them, and likewise if he aids them and defends them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was said to Ahmad bin Hanbal: ‘Indeed some people sit with the people of <em>Bida’</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad bin Hanbal said: ‘Advise him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The person said: ‘But he rejected the advice.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad said: ‘Count him from amongst them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the one who sits with the <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> and associates himself with them then conclude from him that he is sick and that he is in agreement with these people, and regarding this point there are evidences, from them the saying of the Messenger :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The souls are enlisted soldiers, those who become familiar with each other, associate with one another, and those who oppose each other, differ.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this person who associates himself and becomes familiar with <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> then it is evident that there is an agreement and similarity between the matters, the two people and the two groups.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To clarify, what we have mentioned is concerning the one who leaves the circle of <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jamma’</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Fatawa Fadeelata Shaykh Rabee’ al-Madkhalee’ 14/153]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Rabee’ al-Madkhalee was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question: What are the rulings concerning the people of <em>Bida’</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed these people are divided into those who are <em>Du’waat</em> (callers to <em>Bida’</em>) and those who do not call to <em>Bida’</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who call to <em>Bida’</em>, then these people can be given punishments which have been mentioned by the Imams of Islaam. From these punishments are banishment, just as Umar banished Sabeeg and others. Also from those punishments, are capital punishment, like they killed al-Ja’ad bin Dirham and al-Halaaj and others from the leaders of <em>Bida’</em> and misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for their followers: then these are guided and it is explained to them and they are called to Allaah with wisdom and good exhortation.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Fatawa Fadeelata Shaykh Rabee’ al-Madkhalee’ 14/155]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Rabee’ al-Madkhalee wrote:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>When is a man treated as <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah said: ‘If the scholars of the Companions and those who followed them and those after them differed in a matter then they would follow the command of Allaah in His saying:  &lt;&lt;  (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allaah and His Messenger, if you believe in Allaah and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination. &gt;&gt; [4:59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they would debate an issue, in a consultative, advising manner. And perhaps they would differ in a knowledge based practical issue, yet, they would maintain their friendship and practice restrain to aid brotherhood in the <em>Deen</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, whoever opposes the clear Book, and the elaborate Sunnah or that which the Salaf of the <em>Ummah</em> held a consensus about, and the opposition is without excuse, then this person is dealt in the same manner as the People of <em>Bida’</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Muhammad Abdullah bin Abi Zayed al-Qayrawani (386) in his book ‘al- Jamia’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And there is a saying of the <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah</em>: that this person (of the people of <em>Bida’</em>) is not excused, because his <em>Ijtihad</em> (exertion in deriving a ruling) attracted him to <em>Bida’</em>; because the Khawarij made <em>Ijtihad</em> in interpreting, yet they were not excused. Their (erroneous) interpretation caused them to rebel against the Companions. The Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> labeled them as those that exited from the<em>Deen</em>. But as for <em>Ijtihad</em> (exertion in deriving a ruling) the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> made it such that the <em>Mujtahid</em> (the person who derives a ruling) in rulings is rewarded even if he made a mistake in that ruling.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center">By Shaykh, Allaama, al-Faqeeh Muhammed bin Salih al-Uthaymeen<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If a questioner asks: is the wealth of the non-Muslim who lives in the land of the Muslims permissible for us to take?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer is: that the wealth and blood of the non-Muslim who lives in the Muslim lands under contract, are not permissible for us to take, so much so that the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> – said: ‘Whoever kills a non-Muslim who lives in the Muslim lands under contract will not smell the fragrance of Paradise.’ [Collected by Bukhari in Kitab al-Jizeeyah]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah for goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By this we come to know the enmity, oppression and misguidance of those deceived ones, who transgress upon the wealth of the non-Muslims who have a contract with the Muslims. This is whether that non-Muslim is in your (Muslim country) or he has a contract with the Muslims, or that you are in his country.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed we hear from some of those who live in the non-Muslims lands, who say: there is no problem with spoiling the wealth of these non-Muslims, so you find them destroying street lights, shops and cars, and this is impermissible for them – SubhanAllaah – these people have embraced you, you have a contract with them, they have not agreed to a contract with your laws, and with that you deceive them.  This is the worst type of defamation of Islaam and criticism of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In reality the criticism here and defamation is not for Islaam rather it is these people who attribute themselves to Islaam. This is why it is obligatory for us to know that the wealth of those who have contracts with the Muslims is forbidden. Whether they are those who have a contract with you or you have a contract with them, it is not permissible to transgress upon them because that is oppression.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2005 – ‘Indeed there people who read the Qur’aan, but it does not go pass their throats, they leave Islaam just like the arrow leaves the prey.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by ad-Darmi</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From ‘Amroo bin Salamah:  We were sitting by the door of Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood before lunch, so that if he came out, we could walk with him to the <em>Masjid</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Moosaa al-Ash’aree came and said: Has Abu Abdur-Rahmaan come out yet?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We said: No.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, he sat down with us, waiting for him to come out, and when he came out, we all gathered towards him, and Abu Moosaa said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O Abu Abdur-Rahmaan! Previously I saw something in the <em>Masjid</em> which I disliked. But,<em>Alhamdulillaah</em>, what I saw, was nothing but good.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: What was it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Moosaa said, ‘If you live, you will see it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Abu Moosaa said, ‘I saw a group of people, sitting in circles waiting for the prayer.  In every circle there was a man and in their hands were small stones and he would say: ‘Say <em>Allaahu Akbar</em> 100 times’ and they would say ‘<em>Allaahu Akbar</em>’ 100 times.  Then, he would say, ‘Say <em>laa ilaha ilAllaah</em> 100 times’ and they would say ‘<em>laa ilaha ilAllaah</em>’ 100 times and he would say, ‘Say <em>SubhaanAllaah</em>’ 100 times and they would say ‘<em>SubhaanAllaah</em>’ 100 times.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood said, ‘So what did you say to them?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘I did not say anything to them, rather I waited for your opinion [or ‘I waited for your command’].’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘Why did you not command them to count their bad deeds [i.e. seek forgiveness from your deeds] and guarantee them that their good deeds would not be lost?!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he walked and we walked with him until he reached one of those circles and he stood there and said, ‘What is this that I see you doing?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘O Abu Abdur-Rahmaan! These are nothing but small stones with which we are counting, saying ‘<em>Allaahu Akbar</em>, <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> and <em>SubhaanAllaah</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, ‘Count your sins; I guarantee that you will not lose anything of your good deeds!  Beware, O <em>Ummah</em> of Muhammad!  How quick you are to your destruction!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here we are, the Companions of your Prophet – abundant, everywhere and here is his clothing which has not been [wasted away] and his utensils have not been broken. I swear by Him in Whose Hand is my soul, <strong>either you are an <em>Ummah</em> more rightly-guided than the <em>Ummah</em> of Muhammad or you are opening the door of misguidance.’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said; ‘We swear by Allaah, O Abu Abdur-Rahmaan, we did not intend anything but good.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘How many people intend good but never achieve it.  Verily the Messenger of Allaah – narrated to us, ‘Indeed there will be a people who read the Qur’aan but it does not pass beyond their throats.’  I swear by Allaah, I do not know. Perhaps most of them are from amongst you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he went away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Amroo bin Salamah said, ‘We saw some of those sitting in those circles fighting on the Day of <em>Nahrawaan</em>, along with the Khawaarij.’<strong>[1]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albaani mentions in the <em>Takreej</em> (research) of the above narration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed there is a lesson to be learnt from this narration, for those who follow <em>Sufi</em>paths and <em>Dhikr</em> gatherings which are against the Sunnah.  When someone forbids an evil action that they perform they accuse him of forbidding <em>Dhikr</em> from its very foundation!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is <em>Kufr</em> which no Muslim in this world should fall into; the evil action which they adhere to, from those forms of <em>Dhikr</em> and gatherings which, were not legislated at the time of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, otherwise why would Ibn Masood <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> disapprove of those who were sitting in their gatherings?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it not, a gathering done on a specific day, and doing an amount of <em>Dhikr</em> which is not indicated by the <em>Sharia’</em> but is listed by the <em>Shaykh</em> of the gathering, and he commands them with the amount of <em>Dhikr</em> that they should do from himself, as if he is a legislator on behalf of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;  Or do they have partners with Allaah, who have instituted for them a religion which Allaah has not allowed. &gt;&gt;[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To add to this, the Sunnah which is established by the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> verbally and practically is to perform the <em>Tasbeeh</em> (remembrance of Allaah) on your fingertips, as it is clear in ‘The refutation against al-Habshee’ and in other places.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the benefits which can be reaped from the hadeeth and this story is; that the importance is not of performing a large amount of worship, but rather, is it according to the Sunnah and far away from <em>Bida’</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Masood <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> also indicated to this point in his saying: ‘sticking to the Sunnah is better than striving in <em>Bida’</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And another benefit is: that a small <em>Bida’</em> leads to a greater <em>Bida’</em>.  Do you not see that those people from these gatherings afterwards became from the Khawaarij who were killed by the rightly guided <em>Khalifah</em> ‘Alee bin Abu Taalib?  So is there anyone who will take heed?!’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">Compiled and translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1)</strong> From Abu Hurairah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said: ‘That a man came to the Prophet<em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and said: O Messenger of Allaah! It was so bad I was bitten by a scorpion last night! The Messenger of Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If only you had said when the evening approached: &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">أَعُوذُ بِكَلِمَاتِ اللَّهِ التَّامَّاتِ مِنْ شَرِّ مَا خَلَقَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allaah from the evil of what He has created –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A’outhu bikalimatil-lahi ‘at-tammati min sharri ma khalaqa</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nothing would have harmed you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Malik, Muslim, Abu Daawood, Nisaee’ Ibn Majah and by Tirmidhi who made it Hasan. Al-Albani authenticated it  in ‘Saheeh Targheeb wa Tarheeb’ vol.1 no. 652 p.412.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn al-Qayyim (d.751A.H.)<em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said after quoting this hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Know, that divine natural medicines benefit against disease after having been afflicted with it, and they prevent the disease from occurring. If it does occur then it does not occur in a harmful way even though the disease is annoying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed natural medicines also benefit after having been afflicted with a disease. So, <em>At-Ta’aweedhat</em> (supplications for seeking refuge) and <em>Adhkaar</em> (remembrance of Allaah) either prevent the occurrence of these means, or they either come between the disease and between the complete effect of it, and that is according to the perfection of the<em>Ta’aweedh</em> (supplication for seeking refuge) and according to the strength of it and the weakness of it. So <em>Ruqiya</em> (remedy by recitation of invocations) and <em>‘Aweedah</em> (a supplication for seeking refuge) is used to preserve ones health, and the disappearance of sickness.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Zaad al-Ma’ad’ by Ibn al-Qayyim 4/182]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2)</strong> From Abu Hurairah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever says three times, when the evening approaches: &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">أَعُوذُ بِكَلِمَاتِ اللَّهِ التَّامَّاتِ مِنْ شَرِّ مَا خَلَقَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I seek refuge in the Perfect Words of Allaah from the evil of what He has created –</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Then poison will not harm him that night.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Suhayil said: ‘Our families would learn this <em>Dhikr</em> (remembrance), and they would say it every night, and a young girl from amongst them was bitten, but she did not find any pain.’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3)</strong> From Khola bint Hakeem who said I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever stops at a place on his journey and then says: &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">أَعُوذُ بِكَلِمَاتِ اللَّهِ التَّامَّاتِ مِنْ شَرِّ مَا خَلَقَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allaah from the evil of what He has created –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A’outhu bikalimatil-lahi ‘at-tammati min sharri ma khalaqa</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">nothing will harm him until he leaves that place.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ahmad, Muslim, Abu Daawood, and by Tirmidhi. Al-Albani authenticated it in ‘Saheeh Jamia’ as-Sagheer’ vol.1 no. 6567 p.1118.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Regarding his saying: ‘<em>I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allaah</em>’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Nawawee (d.676 A.H.)<em> -Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As regards his saying: ‘<em>I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allaah</em>’: it has been said the meaning of ‘<em>perfect</em>’ here is, those complete things where deficiency and defects cannot enter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has also been said: beneficial and healing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been said that the meanings of ‘<em>words</em>’ here is the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah knows best.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from the ‘Sharh Saheeh Muslim’ by Imam Nawawee 17/2708/196]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaama’ Muhammad Ali Ulaan al-Bakree as-Siddeeqee (d.1057 A.H.) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘His <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> saying: ‘<em>in the perfect words of Allaah</em>’: means with the Qur’aan, and its complete meaning so deficiency or discrepancy cannot enter it, as it enters into the speech of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been said: the perfect words of Allaah benefit and its ability to cure from everything that is sought refuge from.  Which means: upon the condition that is necessary to have, namely the correct intention and the correct belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bayhaqi (d.458 A.H.) said: ‘they are called perfect/complete because it is not allowed to have discrepancy or any deficiency in Allaah’s words, as there is in the speech of humans,’ he also said: ‘that it reached me that Ahmad used this hadeeth as proof that the Qur’aan is not created.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> : ‘<em>Nothing will harm him</em>’ this generally includes protection for the soul and desires.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Futuhaat ar-Rabbaneeya ala al-Adhkaar an-Nawaweeyah’ 2/652-653]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Sulayman bin Abdullaah bin Muhammad bin AbdulWahaab explained:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Regarding the saying: ‘<em>I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allaah</em>’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what Allaah has legislated for the people of Islaam, that they seek refuge with Allaah instead of what the people of <em>Jahiliyah</em> do, which is to seek refuge from the <em>Jinn</em>. Therefore, Allaah legislated for the Muslims to seek refuge with Allaah and His Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qurtubi (d.671 A.H.) said in ‘al-Mufhim’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It has been said the meaning is: ‘the words here are not attached to any deficiency or defect unlike the speech of humans.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been said the meaning is: complete and sufficient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been said: ‘<em>words</em>’ here refers to the Qur’aan, as Allaah informed us that it is: &lt;&lt;a guide and a cure&gt;&gt; [Fussilat: 44] and this aspect is with regard to guidance, in order to repel that which harms.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As this supplication is seeking refuge with the Attributes of Allaah Ta’ala and turning back to Him, then this turning back to Allaah is something, which is recommended and requested of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this, the one seeking refuge with Allaah and His names and Atrributes must ensure that he is sincere to Allaah in seeking His refuge and relies upon Him whilst seeking refuge. Thus, he recalls these aspects in his heart and in doing that fulfills his request and gains the forgiveness of his sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Apart from what was said by Qurtubi, others have said, ‘the scholars all agree that seeking refuge from the creation is not permissible’ and they use the hadeeth of Khola to illustrate this. They say ‘this hadeeth is evidence that the words of Allaah are not created ‘and they use this to refute the Jahmiyah and Mu’tazilah with regard to their claim that the Qur’aan is created.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars have said ‘if the words of Allaah were created the Prophet would not have ordered us to seek refuge with them because to seek refuge with the creation is <em>Shirk</em>’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykul- Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.)<em> -Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Imaams such as Imaam Ahmad and others have mentioned that it is not permissible to seek refuge with the creation, and they use this as evidence that the speech of Allaah is not created. They also said this is because it is established that the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> sought refuge in the words of Allaah and he commanded us to do so. Due to this the scholars have prohibited the use of incantations and wearing amulets whose meaning is unknown fearing that it could be <em>Shirk</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever slaughters for the Shaytaan and supplicates to him and seeks refuge with him, thus coming closer to Shaytaan with that which he loves, then he has indeed worshipped him, even if it is not called worship, because he is truthful in it and in his service of Shaytaan. Therefore, he is from the servants of Shaytaan and from his worshippers, and due to this, Shaytaan serves him. However the service of the Shaytaan is not considered as worship of this person, because Shaytaan does not humble himself for that person nor does he worship him, unlike that person who actually worships Shaytaan.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Regarding the saying: <em>‘…..From the evil of what is created’</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">i.e. from the evil of every creation which has evil in it, be it animals or other than animals. Whether it is from humans or <em>Jinn</em>, vermin or beast, wind or lightening, or any type of trial in the <em>Duniya</em> and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In relation to this, the evil is not meant in a general absolute sense, it is limited in its meaning and what it refers to, as in ‘from the evil of all creation that has evil in it’ not that one seeks refuge from the evil of everything thing that Allaah has created. Because indeed Paradise, the Angels, and the Prophets do not have any evil. This is the meaning of the speech of Ibn Qayyim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Regarding the saying: <em>‘…..nothing harms him’</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al- Qurtubi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This narration is authentic and it is truthful speech. We know its truthfulness from proof and experience. Because ever since I heard this narration I have acted upon it and nothing harmed me until I left it. One night in bed a scorpion bit me, and I thought about what had happened and realized that I had forgotten to seek refuge with these words.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Tayseer al- Azeez al-Hamid’ &#8211; page 154-155]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdur-Razzaq al-Badr said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Nothing whatsoever harms him, because he has been protected by Allaah’s protection. However, this supplication is conditional just like all other supplications in that it is necessary to have the correct intention, to have good trust in Allaah – Azza wa Jal – and that a person should be regular in reading this supplication, in every place that he may stop in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Fiqh al-Adeeyah wal Adhkaar’ by Abdur-Razzaq al-Badr vol. 3 p.277]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdur-Razzaq al-Badr said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It is recommended for a Muslim that if he stops at a place, then he should say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allaah from the evil of what He has created –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A’outhu bikalimatil-lahi ‘at-tammati min sharri ma khalaqa’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because if he says that, he will be protected and guarded by Allaah’s permission and nothing will hurt him until he leaves the place that he stopped in.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This is a great supplication, in it is taking refuge with Allaah – Azza wa Jal -, adhering to Him and seeking refuge with His statements, in contrast to what the people of<em>Jahiliyah</em> were upon, in seeking refuge with the Jinn, stones and from other things which do not increase them except in sin, transgression, weakness and humiliation, just as Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; ‘And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the masculine among the <em>jinns</em>, but they (<em>jinns</em>) increased them (mankind) in sin and disbelief.&gt;&gt; [Jinn:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Allaah <em>– Tabarak wa Ta’ala –</em> criticised them for their seeking refuge and Allaah clarified their evil consequences and painful results in the <em>Duniya</em> and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What Allaah <em>– Subhanahu – </em>legislated for His slaves, the believers, was seeking refuge with Him Alone, seeking sanctuary with Him instead of with anyone else, since He has the Power and He has the authority even of the forelock of His slaves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for anyone apart from Allaah then that person cannot even possess for himself any benefit nor harm, let alone for anyone else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Fiqh al-Adeeyah wal Adhkaar’ vol. 3 p. 276 &#8211; 277]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">A Detailed Research By Shaykh Muhadith Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani <em>-Rahimullaah-<br />
</em>Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 01</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Contents:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 – A Summary of the Opinion of Shaykh al-Albaani regarding the issue of Placing the Hands Back on the Chest after the Rukoo’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – From the ‘Original Sifat as-Salah’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – From ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ – The Legislation of Placing your Hands on the Chest While Standing in the Prayer Before the Rukoo’ and Not in the Standing After it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – Comments of Shaykh al-Albaani in ‘Saheeh Mawaarid ath-Thamaan’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 – The Comment of Shaykh al-Albaani in ‘Da’eef Jamia’ as-Sagheer’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – From ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ – Pointing with the Finger is Just in the Tashhaud Alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1 –</strong> A Summary of the Opinion of Shaykh al-Albaani regarding the issue of Placing the Hands Back on the Chest after the Rukoo’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>a)</strong> Shaykh al-Albaani said: ‘I do not doubt that placing the hands on the chest in this standing is an innovation and misguidance.  Since it has not been mentioned at all in any of the Ahadeeth of prayer – and there are so many of them! If this issue had a foundation, then it would have been transmitted/conveyed to us even if there was one chain for this action.  What strengthens this opinion, is that not one of the Salaf did this and it was not mentioned by any one of the Imams of hadeeth, as far as I know.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>b) </strong>Shaykh al-Albaani said: ‘As for the statement of Imam Ahmad, which indicates placing of the hands after the Rukoo’ as has been mentioned, is not established in the Sunnah according to Imam Ahmad himself, because indeed he himself chose (optional) between doing it and leaving it!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>c)</strong> Shaykh al-Albaani said: ‘I used to declare in a lot of my lectures and lessons the causes and reasoning regarding this clasping of the hands after Rukoo’ ; that a person is about to introduce a new Bida’ due to relying upon a general hadeeth not knowing that it is specific, and this Bida’ is none other than pointing with the finger in other than the sitting of Tashhaud!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>d) </strong>Shaykh al-Albaani said: ‘The readers should reflect upon how well Wa’il <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> narrates the description of how the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> raised his hands in the opening Takbeer, then how he summarized his words regarding it when he performed the Rukoo’ and standing up from it by saying: ‘he raised his hands likewise’; so if, what some of the respected people ascribe to him, about placing the hands after rising from Rukoo’ was Saheeh then he would have said the likes of: ‘and he placed his right hand over his left hand likewise.’ Or something similar, since this is a time where that explanation would be given as is apparent, so reflect upon this justly.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>e) </strong>Shaykh al-Albaani said: ‘. . . .and that is why the Salaf did not act upon this.’</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 02</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albaani said in the ‘Original Sifat as-Salah’:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Section: Rukoo’ /Prolonging the Rukoo’ and the obligation of being tranquil during it.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> used to order to being tranquil in the Rukoo’; and he said to the person who did not pray properly:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘then raise your head until you are standing straight; [until every bone goes back to its place], (and in a narration: ‘and when rise from Rukoo’; then straighten your back, and raise your head until the bones go back to their joints’)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Messenger <em>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> mentioned: ‘that no one’s prayer is complete, if he does not do that.’(1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">____________________</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) This is from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah, and the extra wording and that which follows it is from the hadeeth of Rifa’ah bin Rafa’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{And the intent of the word ‘bone’ here is: the connected bones of the back and the spine – as is mentioned before in (standing up straight after the Rukoo’…)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Notice:</em></strong> Indeed the intent of this hadeeth is clear and evident and it is to have tranquility during the Rukoo’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for what some of our brothers from the people of Hijaaz and from other than them, use from the hadeeth as proof to show the legislation of placing the right hand on the left in this position of standing after the Rukoo’. Then this hadeeth differs from the collective narrations of the hadeeth – as is well known – amongst the Fuqaha (scholars of Fiqh) entitled ‘the hadeeth of the one who prayed incorrectly’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather this use of evidence is invalid; because this placing of the hands has not been mentioned about the first standing of the prayer in any of the different hadeeth or their wordings.  So how can it be permissible to explain it as the placing of the hands as has been mentioned, by placing the left hand with the right after Rukoo’?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is if he supported that, with the wordings of this hadeeth collectively in this section/topic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how can it be since it indicates clearly in contrast to this?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the placing of hands which they mentioned is not what is immediately understood from the hadeeth at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since the meaning of the word: (bones) is the backbones – as is mentioned – and what supports what has preceded is the action of the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> : ‘……. He stood straight until every bone of the spine returned to its place.’ so reflect upon this objectively.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>I do not doubt that placing the hands on the chest in this standing is an innovation and misguidance.  Since it has not been mentioned at all in any of the Ahadeeth of prayer – and there are so many of them! If this issue had a foundation, then it would have been transmitted/conveyed to us even if there was one chain for this action.  What strengthens this opinion, is that not one of the Salaf did this and it was not mentioned by any one of the Imams of hadeeth, as far as I know.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this does not oppose what Shaykh Tawayjari conveyed in his booklet (p.18-19) from Imam Ahmad <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> that he said: ‘if the person wants; he can leave his hands by the side after coming up from Rukoo’ and if the person wants he can place his hands.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(This meaning is what is mentioned by Salih bin Imam Ahmad in ‘Masaileehi’ (p.90) from his father.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad did not ascribe this to the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, rather he said this with his Ijtihad and his opinion, and an opinion can be wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if there is authentic evidence about an issue being a Bida’ – like this issue that we are dealing with, then just because an Imam said this, then it does not negate it being a Bida’ – just like Shaykhul-Islaam  Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> affirmed in some of his books – ; rather, indeed we find in this statement of Imam Ahmad, that which indicates that  this placing of the hands after the Rukoo’ as has been mentioned, is not established in the Sunnah according to Imam Ahmad himself, because indeed he himself chose (optional) between doing it and leaving it!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So does the noble Shaykh [Tawayjari] think that the Imam also allowed choosing between placing the hands before the Rukoo’ ?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is affirmed that this way of placing of the hands which has been mentioned is not from the Sunnah and that is the intent here.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from the Original Sifat as-Salah vol 2 p.700- 701]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 03</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albaani said in ‘</strong><strong>Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah</strong><strong>’:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2247- ‘When the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> used to stand in the prayer he would take a hold of his left hand with his right hand.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Yaqoob al-Foosi in ‘al-Ma’rifah’ (3/121) and with the same chain al-Bayhaqi narrates it in ‘as-Sunnan al-Kubra’ (2/28) and Tabraani in ‘al-Kabeer’ (22/9/1) from another chain: Abu Nu’aeem said that Musa bin Umayr al-Anbaree narrated to us who said that ‘Alqama bin Wa’il narrated to me from his father that ‘When the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> used to stand in the prayer he would take a hold of his left hand with his right hand.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I saw ‘Alqama do this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Foosi said: ‘and Musa bin Umayr Koofi is Thiqaah (trustworthy).’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (al-Albaani) said: and other scholars graded him Thiqaah (trustworthy), the rest of the narrators are also trustworthy from the narrators of Muslim, so the Sanad (chain of narration) is Saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been collected by Nisa’ee (1/141) from Abdullaah bin al-Mubarak from  Musa bin Umayr al-Anbaree and Qeess bin Saleem al-Anbaree who both said that ‘Alqama bin Wa’il narrated to us with the previous narration and with something similar to that, without mentioning that ‘Alqama did the action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it was collected by Ahmad (4/316) and Ibn Abee Shaybah in ‘al-Musannaf’ (1/390) that Wakeea’ narrated to us: that Musa bin Umayr al-Anbaree narrated to us this narration with a summary of the narration with the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I saw the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> placing his right hand on his left hand in the prayer.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But he did not mention: while standing in the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it was collected by al-Bagawi in ‘Sharh as-Sunnah’ (3/30) from another chain from Wakeea’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, Ahmad (4/316-319) narrated from other chains from Wa’il bin Hajr without mentioning the standing in prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The researcher can have no doubt in the different chains of this hadeeth that the hadeeth is also summarized – as in the narration of Wakeea’ – from the hadeeth of Wa’il which explains the description of the Prophet’s prayer <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, and the standing in the prayer where he would clasp his hands, which is before the Rukoo’.  This was mentioned from two chains:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first:</strong> From Abdul Jabbar bin Wa’il from ‘Alqama bin Wa’il and their freed slave that they narrated to him from his father Wa’il bin Hajr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That he saw the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> raise his hands opposite his ears when he entered into the prayer and said the Takbeer, as was described by Hammam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he gathered his garment (thobe) around him-self.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he placed his right hand on his left hand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he wanted to perform Rukoo’ he took out his hands from his Thobe and then he raised his hands, then said Takbeer, then performed Rukoo’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then when he said: ‘Sami Allaahu liman Hamida.’ (Allaah Hears the one who praises Him)  he raised his hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he performed Sajda (prostration), he would prostrate between his hands.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Muslim (2/130), Abu Awaanah (2/106-107),  Ahmad (4/317-318) and al-Bayhaqi (2/28 &amp; 71).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second narration:</strong> from ‘Aasim bin Kulayb from his father from Wa’il bin Hajr who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I said: Indeed I want to see the prayer of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> how he used to pray?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> stood and faced the Qiblah, said the Takbeer (Allaahu Akbar) and raised his hands until they were opposite his ears.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he took his left hand by his right one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he wanted to go into Rukoo’ he raised his hands like that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he placed his hands on his knees.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he raised his head from Rukoo’ he raised his hands like that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when he prostrated, he placed his head at that place between his hands, then he sat and spread (iftarasha) his left leg….. and indicated with his index finger….’ Until the end of the Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Abu Daawood, Nisa’ee,  Ahmad and others with an authentic Sanad (chain) and it is collected in ‘Saheeh Abu Daawood’ (716-717) with two other narrations from other Imams from a group of Thiqaat (trustworthy narrators) from ‘Aasim, and some of the narrations have extra wording more than others.  The most complete sequence of wording is that of Za’idah bin Qadamah and Bashr bin al-Mufadal and he is Thiqata Thabt (trustworthy and firm) and the wording is his, and Ibn Majah narrates from him with the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I saw the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> praying and he took his left hand by his right hand.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say (Albaani): If the researcher reflects upon just this sentence alone, and he does not know, or at the very least does not call to mind that it is summarized from the hadeeth, then he understands from it the legislation of clasping the hands in every standing position in the prayer, whether it was before the Rukoo’ or after it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the sequence of the hadeeth illustrates that this is a mistake, since it is clear that this placing of the hands is in the first standing of the prayer, and in the wording of ‘Aasim it is clearer, since he mentioned raising of the hands in the Takbeeratul-Ihraam (the opening Takbeer), then he made Rukoo’ and raised up from it, then he said in those two narrations: this is how he prayed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if Wa’il had memorized that, if the placing of the hands was after Rukoo’ ’, then he would also have mentioned it as is clear, because he mentioned the raising of the hands three times before, but if someone separates that sentence from its sequence in the hadeeth, then it is presumed that it is to place the hands back on the chest after raising from Rukoo’.  This is what some of the present-day noble scholars say, without them having a precedence from the Salaf as-Salih, from what I know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What confirms what we have mentioned is the narration of Ibn Idrees from ‘Aasim with this narration with a summarized wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I saw the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> when he said Takbeer, take his left hand by his right hand.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many people fell into this type of presumption due to some narrators mentioning these narrations in a summarized form, or being precise in narrating this hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I used to declare in a lot of my lectures and lessons the causes and reasoning regarding this clasping of the hands after Rukoo’ ; that a person is about to introduce a new Bida’ due to relying upon a general hadeeth not knowing that it is specific, and this Bida’ is none other than pointing with the finger in other than the sitting of Tashhaud!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed there are two Ahadeeth mentioned in ‘Saheeh Muslim’ about pointing in the sitting of Tashhaud, one of them, the hadeeth of Ibn Umar and the other hadeeth of Ibn az-Zubayr. Both have wordings which are general and specific or summarized and detailed: ‘If the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>would <strong>sit in the prayer</strong> he would put his hands on his knees and raise his right finger which is next to his thumb and made Dua’ during it…’ so here the sitting is general.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the other narration: ‘If he <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> used to <strong>sit in Tashhaud</strong> he would place his left hand on his left knee and he would place his right hand on his right knee….’ Until the end of the Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So here the sitting is specific for Tashhaud. And the wording of the hadeeth of Ibn az-Zubayr is similar to this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in the first wording ‘he sat’ includes all sittings in the prayer, like the sitting between the two Sajdahs and sitting between the second Sajdah and the second Rakah which is well known to the scholars as the sitting for rest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I used to say: we are about to see some of them point with their finger in these two sittings!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And before long, it was said to me that some students point with their finger between the two Sajdahs (prostrations)!  Then I saw this with my own two eyes, when one of the graduates from the Islamic University did this when he visited me in my house in the beginning of the year 1404 A.H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we were waiting for a third Bida’ to be introduced; which was none other than pointing with the finger in the sitting for rest in the prayer! Then what we were waiting for took place and Allaah’s aid is sought!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of this type of presumed summary for the legislation of pointing in the prayer is also in the hadeeth of Wa’il from the narration of ‘Aasim bin Koolayb from his father from Wa’il, which is in ‘Musnad Ahmad’ (4/316-319) from two angles:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First angle: generally pointing in the prayer without restricting it to Tashhaud.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is collected by Imam Ahmad (4/116-117) from the way of Shu’ba from Wa’il with the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘While sitting he <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> spread his left thigh away from his right thigh and he pointed with his index finger.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also collected by Ibn Khuzaimah in his ‘Saheeh’ (1/345/697), however he said at the end of it:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘i.e. in the sitting in Tashhaud.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This explanation is either from Wa’il or from one of his narrators, the first one is the stronger opinion due to what follows.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another wording of Wa’il in ‘al-Musnad’ (4/316) from the narration of AbdulWahid with the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘So when the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> sat he spread his left leg….. and he pointed with his index finger.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad followed him up (4/317 &amp; 318) with Sufyaan Thawaree and Zuhayr bin Muwaweeyah and it was also collected by Tabraani 922/78, 83, 85, 90) from their chains and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second angle: Pointing restricted to the Tashhaud.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is in ‘al-Musnad’ (4/319) from another chain from Shu’abah with the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘So when he sat for Tashhaud… he pointed with his index finger and he linked the index finger in a circular form with the forefinger.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Its Sanad (chain) is authentic, and Ibn Khuzaimah also narrated it (698).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul-Ahwaas followed him up which is in Tahawee in ‘Sharh al-Ma’aani’ (1/152), and Tabraani in ‘al-Mu’jam al-Kabeer’ (22/34/80), with extra wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘then he began supplicating with the other.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zaidat bin Qadaamah followed them up with the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘He <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> made a circular ring, then he raised his finger, and I saw him move it and supplicate with it/during it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Abu Daawood and by others from the collector of the Sunnan, and Ahmad (4/318), Tabraani (22/35/82) and Ibn Khuaimah, Ibn Hibban, Ibn al-Jarood, Nawawi and Ibn al-Qayyim authenticated it, and it is researched in ‘Saheeh Abu Daawood’ (717).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu ‘Awwana followed them up with similar to it and in it is mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘then he supplicated’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Tabraani (22/38/90)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And by Ibn Idrees likewise</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Ibn Hibban (486)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And by Salaam bin Sulaym by Tayalisee (1020).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tahawee said commenting on the previous narration of Abul-Ahwaas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘In this is the evidence that the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was at the end of the prayer.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: and this is clear in the narration of Abu ‘Awwana which was indicated to earlier, since he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Then he made Sajdah (prostration) and placed his head on the floor between his hands, then he prayed another Rakah, then he sat and spread his left leg and then he supplicated and placed his left hand on his left knee, and his right hand on his right knee and supplicated with the index finger.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And its Isnaad is Saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise is the narration of Sufyaan Ibn Uyainyah and his wording is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And if the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> sat in the two Rakah, he would recline his left leg and prop up his right leg, and he placed his right hand on his right thigh and raised his finger for the supplication and he placed his left hand on his left leg.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Nisa’ee (1/173) with an authentic chain and by al-Humaydee (885) similarly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: so what becomes clear from these authentic narrations is that moving or pointing with the finger is indeed in the sitting of Tashhaud and unrestricted sitting as is mentioned in some of the narrations is restricted with the sitting in Tashhaud.  This is what necessitates of the clarity from gathering and combining the narrations. The principle of carrying the unrestricted (Mutlaq) upon the restricted (muqayid) is reported in the science of Usool of Fiqh (science of Fiqh), that is why it has not been mentioned by anyone from the Salaf, of pointing unrestrictedly in the prayer nor in every sitting of the prayer as far as I know.  And similarly it is said about placing the hands upon the chest and indeed it is in the standing in the prayer which is before the Rukoo’ ’, implementing the previously mentioned principle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[The Reply to the narration of AbdurRazzaq]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a person says: that AbdurRazzaq narrated from Thawri from ‘Aasim bin Kulayb with a previous Isnaad from Wa’il ….. and he mentioned the hadeeth and the spreading of his left leg in his sitting and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Then he pointed with his index finger and placing his thumb upon his middle finger making it in a circular form, and he clenched the rest of his fingers, then he prostrated (performed Sajdah) and his hands were opposite his ears (i.e. when he placed his hands on the floor).’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the apparent meaning of the narration it indicates that the pointing was in the sitting between the two Sajdahs, due to him saying after mentioning the pointing:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Then he prostrated…’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: Yes, AbdurRazzaq collected this in his ‘Musannaf’ (2/68-69), Imam Ahmad narrated it upon him (4/317) and Tabarani in ‘al-Mu’jam al-Kabeer’ (2/34-35) and Shaykh Habibur-Rahman al-Azaami claims in his comment upon this narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘That this narration was collected by the four Sunnan (Abu Daawood, Nisa’ee, Ibn Majah &amp; Tirmidhi), except that Tirmidhi and Bayhaqi narrated it in a number of dispersed chapters.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This claim is false, indicating his negligence, that what is obligatory to substantiate.  Since not one of those who narrated it mentioned after pointing: ‘Then he prostrated…’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather this is what AbdurRazzaq narrates from Thawri alone.  And Muhammad bin Yusuf al-Faryyabi opposed him in this and he used to adhere to Thawri and he did not mention the prostration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was collected by Tabarani (22/33/78).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullaah bin al-Waleed followed him in narrating this: Sufyaan narrated to me …… the same narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Ahmad (4/318).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Waleed is truthful but perhaps he made a mistake.  His narration being followed up with the narration of al-Faryyabi for him is stronger than the narration of AbdurRazzaq, especially that they mention in his biography that he has Ahadeeth which are not accepted from him; one of them is from his narration from Thawri, see ‘Tahdheeb’ by Ibn Hajr and ‘Meezan’ by Dhahabi, so these extra wordings are from his erroneous presumptions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed from what emphasizes this, is that a large number from the Thiqaat (trustworthy) Huffaadh (memorizers) followed up Thawri in his narration which is preserved and from amongst those who preserved the narration are AbdulWahid bin Ziyaad, Shu’bah, Za’idah bin Qadaamah, Bashr bin al-Mufadal, Zuhayr bin Muaweeyah, Abul-Ahwaas, Abu ‘Awaanah, Ibn Idrees, Salaam bin Sulayman, Sufyaan bin Uyainyah and other than them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So all of these narrators did not mention this extra wording in the hadeeth of Wa’il, rather one of them mentioned it before pointing, like Bashr and Abu ‘Awaana and other than these two and their wordings have preceded and some of them mentioned it clearly that the pointing was in the sitting of Tashhaud, as is preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is what is correct, that which majority of the scholars from the Muhaditheen (Scholars of Hadeeth) and Fuqaha (Scholars of Fiqh) hold the opinion of.  I do not know anyone who said that pointing with the finger is legislated in the sitting between the two Sajdahs except for Ibn al-Qayyim, since his apparent statement in ‘Zad al-Ma’ad’ corresponding to the hadeeth  of AbdurRazzaq.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps that university student whom I indicated to earlier on, blindly followed him in this, or blindly followed those who blindly followed Ibn al-Qayyim from the present day scholars and I explained to him and other students who visited me the irregularity of the narration of AbdurRazzaq and its fragility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of those students informed me from one of the well-known scholars in some Arab lands that he implements this hadeeth of AbdurRazzaq and uses it as an evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this it indicates that he does not specialize in this knowledge, and this is what has compelled me to write this investigation and research, so if I was correct then it was from Allaah and if I was mistaken then it is from myself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask al-Mawla – Subhana wa Ta’ala – to take us by our hands and guide us to the truth which the people have differed in, indeed He guides who He Wills to the straight path and all praise belongs to Allaah the Lord of all the worlds.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest,’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">By AbdurRazaaq bin AbdulMuhsin al-Badr<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<hr />
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 01</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AbdurRazaaq bin AbdulMuhsin al-Badr said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Indeed the best speech and the most excellent remembrance after the Noble Qur’aan is four statements</strong>. They have an exceptional value, they consist of a great matter and have a high status in the <em>Deen</em> of Allaah, and they are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest,’ (Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu akbar).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many texts, which show the excellence of these four statements that emphasize this great matter, and the value of these statements and the resulting great reward when establishing them and their noble excellence and their continuous benefits in the <em>Dunyaa</em> and the Hereafter. We will attempt to present some of the excellence of these statements from some of the texts, which mention these benefits.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- So from the excellence of these words is that they are the most beloved speech to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Muslim collected in his book from the hadeeth of Sumrah bin Jundab <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘The most beloved speech to Allaah consists of four, there is no harm with which one you begin, <em>Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu akbar</em>.’</strong></span>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And collected by Tayyalisi in his ‘Musnad’ with the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There are four statements that are the most beloved speech to Allaah, and they are in the Qur’aan, there is no harm which one you begin with: <em>Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu Akbar</em>.</strong></span>’[2]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- From their excellence is that the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> informed us that they are more beloved to him than what the sun rose upon (i.e. from the <em>Dunyaa </em>and what is in it,)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim collected in his book ‘<em>Saheeh</em>’ from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah who said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Indeed that I say: ‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest,’ (<em>Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu akbar</em>) is more beloved to me than what the sun rose upon</strong></span>.’ [3]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – From their excellence is, what is mentioned in ‘<em>Musnad</em>’ of Imam Ahmad and ‘<em>Shu’ab al-Eeman</em>’ by Bayhaqi with a good <em>Isnaad</em> from Assim bin Bahdalah from Abu Salih from Umm Hani bint Abu Talib who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Messenger of Allaah walked past me so I said: ‘Indeed I have become old and weak – or something similar to this – then he ordered me with an action which I should do while I am sitting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Say <em>Subhana Allaah</em> one hundred times, indeed it is equivalent to freeing one hundred slaves from the offspring of Isma’eel. And</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Say <em>Alhamdulillaah</em> one hundred times, it is the equivalent to one hundred horses saddled with reins ready to carry a person in the path of Allaah. And</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Say <em>Allaahu akbar</em> one hundred times, since it is the equivalent to one hundred camels slaughtered for the sake of Allaah. And</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Say <em>La illaah ila Allaah</em> one hundred times, </strong></span>Ibn Khalf (the narrator from Aasim) said: I think he said<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>: it fills what is between the heavens and the earth and on that day no one will have an action raised except the one who came with the like of it.’</strong></span> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Mundhari said: Ahmad collected it with a <em>Hasan</em> <em>Isnad </em>[5] and the ‘allaama al-Albaani declared its <em>Isnad</em> <em>Hasan</em>.[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reflect upon this great reward, which is a result of these words. So whoever says <em>Subhana Allaah</em> hundred times then it is the equivalent to freeing a hundred slaves from the sons of Isma’eel, the offspring of Isma’eel was mentioned specifically because they are the noblest of the Arabs in lineage.  Whoever says <em>Alhamdulillaah</em> a hundred times then he will have the reward as the one who gave charity of one hundred horses saddled and reined ready to carry the <em>Mujahideen</em> in the path of Allaah. Whoever says <em>Allaahu Akbar</em> a hundred times then he will have the reward as the one who spends camels slaughtered for the sake of Allaah. Whoever said <em>laa illaah ila Allaah</em> a hundred times then it fills what is between the heavens and the earth and no one’s action is raised except if one comes with what was mentioned.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- From the excellence of the status of these words, is that they are an expiation for sins. It is mentioned in ‘<em>al-Musnad</em>’, ‘Sunnan Tirmidhi’ and ‘Mustadrak al-Hakim’ from the hadeeth of Abdullaah bin ‘Amr bin al-‘Aaas <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211; </em>who said the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘There is no person on earth who says: ‘<em>laa illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu akbar, wa Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, La hawla wa la quwwata illa billaa</em>, (There is no capability nor is there any power except with Allaah) except that his sins are expiated even if they were more than the foam on the sea.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tirmidhi declared it to be <em>Hasan</em>, and al-Hakim authenticated it and Dhahabi agreed with him and al-Albaani declared it to be <em>Hasan</em>.[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the meaning ‘expiation of sins’ here it means minor sins, as is mentioned in Saheeh Muslim from Abu Hurairah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211; </em>that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘The five daily prayers, from one <em>Juma’</em> till the next <em>Juma’</em>, from one <em>Ramadhan</em> till the next <em>Ramadhan</em> is an expiation for what takes place between them as long as the major sins are kept away from.’</strong></span> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore expiation of sins has been limited to keeping away from the major sins; because a major sin can only be expiated by repentance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also there is a hadeeth that has been collected with the same meaning by Tirmidhi and other than him from Anas bin Malik <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> walked passed a tree which had dry leaves and he hit that tree with his stick and the leaves began to fall, the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Indeed <em>al-Hamdu lillaahi, wa Subhana Allaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu akbar, </em>cause the sins of a slave of Allaah to fall just like the leaves of this tree are falling.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Declared <em>Hasan</em> by al-Albaani.[9]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- From the excellence of these words is that they are plants of Paradise, Tirmidhi collected from Abdullaah bin Mas’ood, from the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I met the Prophet Ibrahim on the night when I was taken on the night journey, and Ibrahim said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>O Muhammad convey my <em>Salam</em> to your <em>Ummah</em>, and inform them that Paradise has very fine soil, sweet water. That it has lowland and its plants are:  </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘<em>Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu akbar</em>’ </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest)’</strong></span> [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the <em>Isnaad</em> of this hadeeth is AbdurRahman bin Ishaaq, however the hadeeth has two supporting narrations which strengthen this narration from the hadeeth of Abu ‘Ayyoub al-Ansari and from the hadeeth of Abdullaah bin Umar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning is that plants in Paradise grow quickly due to these statements, just like the plants that are planted on lowland and the growth of its plants is fast.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – From its excellence is that there is none better according to Allaah than a believer who lives his life in Islaam and says ‘Allaahu akbar, Subhana Allaahi, la illaah ila Allaah, and al-Hamdu lillaahi,’ a lot.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is collected by Imam Ahmad and by Nisa’ee in ‘Amal al-Yawm wa Laylah’ with a Hasan Isnaad from Abdullaah bin Shaddad: is that a group of three people from the tribe of Udhraah came to the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and accepted Islaam and Abdullaah said that the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Who will look after them?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Talha said: ‘I will.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullaah said: ‘They stayed with Talha and the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>sent out a delegation and one of them went in it and was martyred.  Abdullaah said: then the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> sent another a delegation and another person went with them and was martyred.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullaah continued: then the third person died on his bed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Talha said: ‘I saw these three people who stayed with me [in a dream] they were in Paradise, and I saw the one who died on his bed in front of them, and I saw the one who was martyred last after him and I saw the one who was martyred last behind them.  Talha said: I came to the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and I mentioned this to him, and the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Why did you not stop them from going with the delegation, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>there is none better according to Allaah from a believer who lives his life in Islaam and says ‘<em>Allaahu akbar, Subhana Allaahi, la illaah ila Allaah, and al-Hamdu lillaahi</em>,’ a lot.’</strong></span>[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This great hadeeth shows the great excellence of the one who has a long life and his actions are good, and his tongue continues to be moist with the <em>Dhikr</em> of Allaah – Azza wa Jal, and success is from Allaah Alone.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 02</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh AbdurRazaaq bin AbdulMuhsin al-Badr said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Previously, we covered a number of virtues of these four statements: they are the best speech after the Qur’aan, they are ‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest,’ (<em>Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu Akbar</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here we will continue with another number of benefits from these statements from the Ahadeeth of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> which mention these statements:</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">7- From their excellence is that Allaah chose these statements and chose them for His slave, and Allaah has set aside for the one who remembers Allaah saying them, with great and abundant reward.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the ‘<em>Musnad</em>’ of Imam Ahmad and ‘Mustadrak’ of al-Hakim with an authentic <em>Isnaad </em>from the hadeeth of Abu Huraira and Abu Sa’eed <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhumma</em>: that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Indeed Allaah chose four statements: ‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest,’ (<em>Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu Akbar</em>). So whoever says ‘<em>Subhana Allaah</em>,’ twenty good deeds are written for him, and twenty bad deeds are taken away.  Whoever says ‘<em>Allaahu akbar</em>’ then he gets likewise. Whoever says ‘<em>La illaah ila Allaah</em>,’ then he gets likewise.  Whoever says ‘<em>Alhamdulillaahi Rabbil Al-Ameen</em>’ from his own self then thirty good deeds are written for him and thirty sins are cancelled from him.’</strong> </span>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reward for the slave of Allaah saying <em>al-Hamd</em> (Praise) is increased more than the other four, when he says it from his own self; this is because <em>al-Hamd</em> does not generally occur except after a reason for saying it, like eating or drinking, or the occurrence of a blessing, so it is as if the <em>al-Hamd</em> occurs due to something in return, for that which has been rendered to the slave of Allaah at the time of saying <em>al-Hamd</em>, so if the slave of Allaah mentions <em>al-Hamd</em> from his own self without any pushing factor to do so, nor for a new blessing (which Allaah has given him) then his reward is increased.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">8- From their virtues is: that they are a protection from the Hell-Fire for the one who says them and they will come as a savior on the Day of Judgement for the one who says them and they will precede him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hakim collected in ‘al-Mustadrak’ and Nisa’ee in ‘Amal al-Yawm wa Layla’ and others from Abu Hurairah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said that Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Take your protection.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah against an enemy that has arrived?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘No, but your protection from the Hell-Fire, say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> ‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest,’ (<em>Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu Akbar</em>) since indeed they will come on the Day of Judgement as saviours and preceding good actions and they are the lasting good deeds of the righteous.’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hakim said: ‘This hadeeth is <em>Saheeh</em> upon conditions of Muslim and they did not collect it. Dhahabi agreed with al-Hakim. And it was authenticated by the <em>‘allaama</em> al-Albaani <em>-Rahimullaah</em>.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth includes an addition to the Ahadeeth which have preceded which is describing these statements that they are the lasting good deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَالْبَاقِيَاتُ الصَّالِحَاتُ خَيْرٌ عِندَ رَبِّكَ ثَوَابًا وَخَيْرٌ أَمَلًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong> But the enduring good deeds are better to your Lord for reward and better for </strong>[one’s] <strong>hope.</strong> </span>&gt;&gt; [18:46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The lasting good deeds are those deeds due to which their reward remains, and is continuous, and this is the best at what a slave of Allaah can expect and hope for and expect the best reward.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">9 – And from its benefits is: that they make a curve around the <em>‘Arsh</em> of ar-Rahman and they have a buzzing sound like the buzzing of the bee, by which they mention /remember the one who said them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the ‘Musnad’ of Imam Ahmad and Sunnan Ibn Majah and ‘al-Mustadrak’ by al-Hakim from Nu’man bin Basheer <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Indeed what you remember/mention from the magnificence of Allaah is saying <em>Subhana Allaah, Allaahu Akbar, la illaah ila Allaah</em> and <em>Alhamdulillaah</em>, it curves around the ‘<em>Arsh</em>, they have a buzzing sound like the buzz of the bee, which (mention/remember) its (companion/the one) who says it. Does not one of you want that, or wish that someone still remembers you by it.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Busseeri said in: ‘Zawaid Sunnan Ibn Majah: ‘Its <em>Isnaad</em> is <em>Saheeh</em>, its narrators of trustworthy, and it was authenticated by al-Hakim.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the benefit of this hadeeth is this great virtue, which is that these four statements curve around the  ‘<em>Arsh</em>, i.e. that they go around it, they have a buzzing sound like the buzz of the bee, i.e. a sound which is similar to the sound of the bee and in doing so it remembers the person who said them, and those words are the greatest encouragement for <em>Dhikr</em> with these statements, this is why the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said in this hadeeth: ‘Does not one of you want that, or wish that someone still remembers you by it.’</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">10 – From their excellence: that the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> mentioned that they are heavy on the scales.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nisa’ee narrated in ‘Amal al-Yawm wa Layla’ and Ibn Hibban in his book called ‘Saheeh’ and al-Haakim and other than them from Abu Salma <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘<em>Bakhin Bakhin</em> – and pointed with his five fingers – how heavy they are on the scale: ‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest,’ (<em>Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu Akbar</em>) and a righteous son that dies and his father is a Muslim and he benefits by him.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haakim authenticated it and Dhahabi agreed[4] and the hadeeth has a support from the hadeeth of Thawbaan <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em>, and al-Bazzar collected it in his ‘Musnad’ and said its <em>Isnaad</em> was <em>Hasan</em>. [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying in the hadeeth: ‘<em>Bakhin Bakhin</em>’ this is a word, which is said when, being amazed by something and explaining its excellence.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">11- From the excellence of these words is that for the slave of Allaah they are <em>Sadaqah </em>(giving charity) when he says each one of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is collected by Muslim in his ‘Saheeh’ from Abu Dharr <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em>: Some of the companions of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O Messenger of Allaah, the affluent have made off with the rewards, they pray as we pray they fast as we fast, and they give away in charity the extra of their wealth.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Has not Allah made things for you to give away in charity? </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Every <em>Tasbihah</em> (saying: <em>Subhana Allaah</em>) is a charity, every <em>Takbirah </em>(saying: <em>Allaahu Akbar</em>) is a charity, every <em>Tahmidah</em> (saying: <em>al-Hamdu lillaah</em>) is a charity, and every <em>Tahlilah</em> (saying: <em>la illaah ila Allaah</em>) is a charity, to enjoin a good action is a charity, to forbid an evil action is a charity, and in having relations with your wife is a charity.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, when one of us fulfils his desire (with his wife) will he have some reward for that?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Do you not think that if he were to act upon it unlawfully he would be sinning? Likewise, if he has acted upon it lawfully he will have a reward.’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The poor people thought that there was no <em>Sadaqah</em> except by giving money, and they were incapable of doing that, so the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> informed them that all types of good actions and being good is <em>Sadaqah</em>, and the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> mentioned that at the head of good actions are these four statements ‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest,’ (<em>Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu Akbar</em>).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">12 – From the excellence of these statements is that the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> made these statements in place of the Noble Qur’aan for the one who truly cannot read it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Abu Dawood, Nisa’aee, Daraqutni and other than them from Ibn Abee Awfa <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said: ‘A man came to the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah indeed I cannot learn the Qur’aan, so teach me something that will give me a reward.’ He <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Say: ‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest, There is no capability nor is there any power except with Allaah.’ (<em>Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu Akbar wa La hawla wa la quwwata illa billaa</em>.)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Bedouin said: ‘like this – and he closed his hand – and said: This is for Allaah, what is for me?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اللهم اغفر لي وارحمني وعافني وارزقني واهدني</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Say: O Allaah forgive me, and have mercy on me, and pardon me, and provide for me, and guide me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Bedouin took them [this supplication] and closed the palm of his hand. The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for this person then he has filled his two hands with goodness.’[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Muhaddith</em> Abu Tayyib al-Atheem ‘Abbadi said in his comments on Sunnan Daraqutni its Isnad is Saheeh and Albaani <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said its <em>Sanad</em> is <em>Hasan</em>.[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are some of the virtues mentioned in the Prophetic Sunnah regarding these four statements.  There are specific virtues for every one of these statements. Whoever reflects upon these preceding virtues finds that they are very great, and show the great status of these statements and their lofty status and their many benefits and their advantages upon the believer, the slave of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps the secret to this great excellence – and Allaah knows best – is what has been mentioned by some of the people of knowledge, which is that the Names of Allaah –Tabaraka wa Ta’ala – are all incorporated in these four statements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">As for what is embodied in ‘<em>Subhana Allaah</em>’ is the Name of Allaah which show purity like <em>al-Qudoos </em>(The Holy) and <em>as-Salaam</em> (The Source of Peace).</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">As for ‘<em>Alhamdulillaah</em>’ then it is comprises and affirms the different types of perfection for Allaah –<em>Tabaraka</em> – in His Names and His Attributes.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">As for ‘<em>Allaahu Akbar</em>’ then it contains the Magnificence of Allaah and regarding Him as Great, and that none can enumerate praise upon Him, so whoever this possesses, then, He is the One Who is worthy of worship, which means that there is none worthy of worship except Him.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I swear by Allaah, look how great these statements are, and how magnificent their matter is, and how great is the result of the good for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah that He gives us the capability to observe these statements and to be continuous upon them, and makes us from its people, those whose tongues are moist with remembering them, indeed Allaah is The Protector of that and He is The Capable One.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">From the Works of The Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ Muhammad Nasiruddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong># Principles of Bida’ 1</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Adhering to general texts which have not been implemented\acted upon is not from the Fiqh of the Salaf.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Nasiruddeen Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Adhering to general texts which have not been acted upon, is not from the Fiqh(understanding) of the Salaf. Indeed every Bida’ which some people regard as being good, is generally taken from a general evidence.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Riyadh Saliheen’ researched by Shaykh Muhammad Nasiruddeen Albaani p.136 H#250]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"># Principles of Bida’ 2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It is not a condition in order to reject every individual Bida’ that we need a narration conveyed with an authentic chain from one of the Salaf.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Nasiruddeen Albaani said during his refutation of Shaykh Al-Habshi, in his debate with him regarding the Bida’ of prayer beads:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘. . . . . And is it a condition with the people of knowledge and intellect in rejecting every individual Bida’ that we should have a narration conveyed with an authentic chain from one of the Salaf rejecting every single Bida’? This is not something a person who has smelt the fragrance of knowledge says.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From: ‘ar-Radd ‘ala Taqeeb al-Hatheeth’ by Shaykh Albaani p.54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"># Principles of Bida’ 3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Nasiruddeen Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Coming closer to Allaah Ta’ala cannot be done except with what Allaah has legislated.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Anas bin Malik who said: I was sitting with Ubayy and Abu Talha, and we had just eaten meat and bread, then I called for water to make Wudu. Ubayy and Abu Talha said to me: ‘Why are you making Wudu?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas said: ‘Because of this food we just ate.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘Do you make Wudu because of good things (food)?! One who was better than you(the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>), did not make Wudu after eating.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ahmad, &amp; Albaani said its Isnad is Jayyid]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Nasiruddeen Albaani commented:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This Athar (narration) indicates that the Companions would reject coming closer to Allaah- Ta’ala- with an action which the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> did not legislate whether with statements or actions, as for Anas being concerned with making Wudu for eating meat, then perhaps the saying of the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> reached him: ‘Make Wudu for that meat which has been cooked on fire’, and it did not reach him that it had been abrogated and Allaah knows best.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From: Mishkat 1\107 #329]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"># Principles of Bida’ 4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Mubtadi’ is he who Exaggerates Worship.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Nasiruddeen Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘No one should presume that when we choose to limit ourselves to the Sunnah with regard to the amount of Rakat prayed during Taraweeh, and the impermissibility of increasing upon that, that we regard those from the preceding scholars and those who came after them as being misguided or that we see them as people of Bida’ because they don’t hold this opinion (of limiting to the Sunnah), as some of the people have presumed and believed that we see them as being misguided and they have then used that to justify attacking us!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This presumption of theirs, necessitates clarity, they assume that just because a matter is not allowed then it is automatically regarded as a Bida’, or that just because everyone who says it is permissible or recommended to pray more [in the Taraweeh prayer] that he is a misguided Mubtadi! We say no, never, this presumption is indeed false, and extreme ignorance. Because the Bida’ which a person is criticized for and the Ahadeeeth which are applied in curbing Bida’ are a result of the definition: ‘An invented way of religion which is similar to the Sharia’ but is not from it, intending to follow that way and exaggerating in the worship of Allaah -Subhanahu.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, whoever innovates a Bida’ and intends by it exaggeration in worship, and he knows it is not from the Sharia’, then he is the type of person upon whom these Ahadeeth are applied. As for the one who falls into Bida’ unknowingly, and he did not intended exaggeration in worship, then those Ahadeeth do not include these people at all, and they do not concern them at all, rather they concern those Mubtada’ who stand in the way of disseminating the Sunnah, and regard all Bida’ as good, without knowledge or guidance, nor a clear Book, not even blindly following the people of knowledge and remembrance, rather they do this following desires and satisfying the common folk!’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">Compiled by Zakareeyah bin Ghulam Qadir</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by    Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Allaah Ta’ala gave proofs in His Noble Book concerning the excellence of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em>, and following their way, Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;And the first to embrace Islaam of the <em>Muhajirun</em> and the <em>Ansar</em> and also those who followed them exactly. Allaah is well pleased with them, as they are well pleased with Him. He has prepared for them Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success.&gt;&gt;   [Tawbah: 100]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn Mas’ood that the Prophet  said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The best people are my generation then those who will come after them and then those after them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the Companions are the example and they are the ones to follow. It is obligatory upon every Muslim to follow them in what they understood from the evidences of the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, because they were the most knowledgeable of the people and they had the most correct understanding of the <em>Sharia’</em> texts out of all the people.  Consequently, if a Muslim takes other than their understanding then he will deviate away from the straight path, since the Companions stood with insight, and they viewed everything with their perceptive knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abu Zayed al-Qayrawani said in his book ‘al-Jaama’ (117):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Submission to the <em>Sunnan</em> (plural of <em>Sunnah</em>) cannot be opposed with opinion, nor is it repelled with <em>Qiyas</em> (analogy).  As for the interpretation of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em> then that is how we interpret, and what they acted upon is which we act upon, what they left off is what we leave.  It is sufficient to adhere to what they adhered to, and that we follow them in that what they clarified.  We take them as an example in what they extracted and viewed from the hadeeth. We do not rebel against the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em> in what they differed or what they interpreted, and everything that we have just mentioned is the stance of the <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah</em> and the Imams of the people in <em>Fiqh</em> and hadeeth.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Sama’ani said in ‘Sown al-Mantiq’ (158):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed we have been ordered to follow and been encouraged to do so.  And we have been prohibited from innovating and we have been rebuked concerning <em>Bida’</em>. The flag/sign of the <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah</em> is their following the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em>, and them leaving everything that is innovated and heresy.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The supporter of the <em>Sunnah</em> al-Asbhaani said in his book ‘al-Hujjah Fee Bayaan al-Muhajjah’ (2/437-440):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Knowledge is not having lots of narrations; rather it is following and using those narrations. It is to take the Companions and the <em>Ta’abieen</em> (the Successors of the Companions) as exemplary, even if it means having a little knowledge.  Whoever opposes the Companions and the <em>Ta’abieen</em> then he is misguided, even if he has a lot of knowledge.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Asbhaani continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And that is to clarify for the people the matter of their <em>Deen</em>, so it is upon us to follow the Companions because indeed the <em>Deen</em> came from Allaah Ta’ala and it did not come from the intellects and opinions of men, but rather the Messenger  clarified the <em>Sunnah</em>for his <em>Ummah</em>. And he explained it to his Companions.  Therefore, whoever opposed the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah  in anything from the <em>Deen</em> then he has become misguided.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Rajab said in the book ‘Fadl Ilm as-Salaf ‘ala Ilm al-Khalaf’ (72):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The beneficial knowledge from these sciences, are all precisely connected to the texts with the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, the understanding of the meaning of these sciences and their restrictions are with what has been narrated from the Companions and the Successors and those who followed them, regarding the meanings of the Qur’aan and the hadeeth.  Likewise, what has been mentioned from them of what they said regarding issues of <em>Halaal</em> and <em>Haraam</em>, as well as <em>Zuhd</em>, softening of the heart and knowledge and other issues.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymeeyah said in ‘Kitab al-Eemaan’ (p.114):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘To understand this principle of <em>al-Eemaan</em> the Murjia’ turned away from the explanation of the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, and the statements of the Companions, and the Successors who followed them in goodness. The Murjia’ relied upon their own opinions and they interpreted this principle with their own understanding of Arabic language.  This is the way of the people of <em>Bida’</em>. This is why Imam Ahmad said: ‘The people mainly make mistakes regarding interpretation and analogy.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why we find the Mu’tazilah[1], Murjia’[2], Rafidah[3] and other than them from the <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> explain the Qur’aan with their own intellect, as well as what they interpreted with Arabic language.  This is why you find them not relying upon the Ahadeeth of the Prophet , the Companions, and the <em>Ta’abieen</em> and the Imams of the Muslims.  So the <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> do not rely upon the Sunnah, or upon the consensus of the <em>Salaf</em> or their <em>Aathaar</em>, rather they rely upon the intellect and language, and we find that they do not rely upon the books of <em>Tafseer</em> based upon narrations, and upon hadeeth and <em>Aathaar</em> of the <em>Salaf</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibn Taymeeyah also said in ‘Majmoo Fatawa’ (10/362):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘So knowledge which has been legislated and the rituals of worship which have been legislated are taken from the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah , as for what came from those after them, then it is not befitting that we take that as a foundation even though they are excused for their mistakes, rather they will be rewarded for their<em>Ijtihad</em> (exertion in deriving a ruling) or due to <em>Taqleed</em> (blind acceptance).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, whoever establishes speech regarding the science of <em>Usool</em> (principles) and its branches upon the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> and the <em>Athaar</em> narrated from the previous generations then he has achieved the Prophetic way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, whoever establishes his purpose, worship, good deeds and an understanding connected to the principles of righteous actions and its branches of circumstances of the heart and physical actions upon <em>al-Eeman</em> and the <em>Sunnah</em> and the guidance, which Muhammad  and his Companions were upon, then he has achieved the Prophetic way. And this is the way of the Imams of guidance; you find that Imam Ahmad would say when the principles of the Sunnah were mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The principles of the Sunnah are adhering to what the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah  were upon and the books of <em>Tafseer</em> which have narrations from the Prophet  and the Companions and the successors. This is what is relied upon in its knowledge based principles and its branches………………..’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, regarding <em>Zuhd</em>, <em>Raqaaiq</em> (softening of the heart) and matters of the heart since its knowledge is relied upon the book of <em>Zuhd</em> which has narrations about the Prophets <em>-salawaatAllaah alaihim-</em> from Adam to Muhammad, then upon the way of the Companions and successors and those after them were not mentioned.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[Taken from ‘Tawdeeh Usool al-Fiqh ‘ala Manhaj Ahl-ul-Hadeeth’ p.41]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from Sahab.net<br />
Summarised and Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah and Praise and Peace be upon the one who was sent as a mercy for all the worlds and upon his Family and his Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth is one of the rarest authentic Prophetic hadeeth regarding strong exhortation to be good to women, being gentle with them, being patient with them, having a concern for them, encouragement not to divorce them, and to remain with them until death even if you have been her companion for a long time. Even if she has produced all the offspring that is possible for her, you should not divorce her unless you are certain (that it is the best thing to do), or it is impossible to live with her. Now we will look at this rare hadeeth and some of its benefits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been collected by Ibn ‘Aasakir in ‘Tareekh Dimishq’ from Yahya bin Jabir from al-Miqdam bin Ma’dee Karib al-Kindi that the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> stood amongst the people and praised Allaah and exalted Him and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed Allaah advices you in the strongest possible terms to be good to women, indeed Allaah advices you in the strongest possible terms to be good to women, advices you in the strongest possible terms with regards to women, indeed they are your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your paternal aunts (father’s sisters) and your maternal aunts(mother’s sisters).  Indeed a man from the people of the two books (Jews &amp; Christians) marries a woman and does not hit her, each one of them continues to desire his companion until he dies in old age.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Salmah said I narrated this hadeeth to al-Ala bin Sufyaan al-Ghassanee who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed it has reached me that from the evil hidden sins which Allaah has made<em>Haraam</em>, which are not clearly mentioned in the Qur’aan, are that a man marries a woman and when his companion becomes old and she has  stayed with him for a long time, and has produced all that her womb can, then he divorces her without any reason to do so.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It is collected by Tabarani in ‘al-Mu’jam al-Kabeer’, Ibn ‘Aasakir in ‘Tareekh Dimishq’. And this Isnad is Saheeh.’ [Silsilah Saheehah No.2871]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he quotes al-Harbi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The intent is to encourage the one being advised to have a concern for women, to have patience with them. i.e. and that the people of the Book behaved like this with their women.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This is how they (The Jews &amp; the Christians)  used to behave when they had manners, and were religious, even though they followed a religion that had changed, as for nowadays then they prohibit that which Allaah has made permissible of divorce, and they openly make <em>Zina</em> permissible! !’[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth is a clear refutation against those who do not treat their women in a good way. It is a reminder to everyone who is deceived by the so-called rights of women in the west!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>From the benefits of this hadeeth:</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1-</strong> Advice to be good to women and that the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>repeated this three times to emphasise this point: he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed Allaah advices you in the strongest possible terms to be good to women, indeed Allaah advices you in the strongest possible terms to be good to women, advices you in the strongest possible terms with regards to women . .. .’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The advice of being good to women and living with them in a good way is mentioned in the Book of Allaah Ta’ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And live with them <strong>in</strong> <strong>kindness</strong>. For if you dislike them – perhaps you dislike a thing and Allah makes therein much good.   &gt;&gt; 4:19</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Bukhari mentioned a chapter in his Saheeh : ‘chapter  Advice with regard to women’ then he mentioned a hadeeth from Abu Hurairah <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>&#8211; from the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever believes in Allaah and the last Day then he should not harm his neighbour, and I advise you strongly to be good to women, indeed women were created from the rib bone, and the most bent of the ribs is the top one, so if you tried to straighten it you would break it and if you left it then it would still continue to be bent, so I advise you strongly to be good to women.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the wording collected by Muslim from Abu Hurairah from the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever believes in Allaah and the last Day and testifies about a matter then he should speak good or remain silent and I advise you strongly to be good to women, indeed the woman was created from . . . .’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2-</strong> Then the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> explained that this advice is not specific for a certain type of woman. He explained her relationship with the Muslim male, thus she is a mother, and what will make you aware of what a mother is? The advice which is given concerning being good to the mother, is what you already know and is not hidden from you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> mentions another chapter heading:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Chapter: Who of the people are most deserving of good companionship?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Abu Zur’ah From Abu Hurairah <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>&#8211; who said: A man came to the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah who from the people is the most deserving of my good companionship?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> replied: ‘Your mother.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man said: ‘then who?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> replied: ‘Your mother.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man said: ‘then who?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> replied: ‘Your mother.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man said: ‘then who?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Your father.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[In another narration the man’s name was mentioned clearly as is in ‘al-Adab al-Mufrad’ by Bukhari from Bahz bin Hakeem from his father from his grandfather [Muwaweeyah bin Haydah]  I said: O Messenger of Allaah who . . . . . . . . the next closest relative then those closest after them.’]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected in ‘Adab al-Mufrad’ no.3, Tirmidhi and ‘Irwaa al-Ghaleel’ 829/2232, declared Hasan by Albaani.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this narration there is an extra benefit which is the wording: ‘the next closest relative then those closest after them.’ Which can be used as an evidence for having good companionship with the wife, the daughter the sister and the aunt, and no one can doubt how closely related they are to you O Muslim slave of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the saying: ‘The most deserving of my good companionship?’ Which means who are the foremost people with whom I should fulfil favours for, be good to and honour.  Good companionship is connected to being gentle and kind, having good speech, having good dealings, implementing good manners all of which Islaam brought forth and has encouraged.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajr said in ‘Fath’ that Ibn Battal said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This warrants that the mother should have three times as much as the father, and that is because of the difficulty of pregnancy, then that of the delivery, then that of suckling, these things are specific to the mother and the hardships upon her, after which the father participates in the upbringing of the child.  This  was also indicated in the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And We have enjoined upon man [care] for his parents. His mother carried him, [increasing her] in weakness upon weakness, and his weaning is in two years.&gt;&gt;[Luqaman:14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah equated the mother and the father in what is bequeathed, however, Allaah singled out the mother with these three things, pregnancy, giving birth and suckling the child.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>• She is a wife</strong>, as has been mentioned in the texts[2], likewise the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘The best of you, is the one who <strong>is best to his wife</strong>and I am the best to my wife and if your companions should die then make Dua’ for them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Albaani said in ‘Silsilah Saheehah’ no. 285, ‘it is collected by Tirmidhi, Daraqutni and Ibn Hibban from ‘Aeysha <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em>. Its <em>Isnaad</em> is authentic upon the conditions of Bukhari and Muslim.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here the wording means ‘wives’ due to the hadeeth in which the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘The most complete of the Believers in their <em>Eemaan</em> are those who have the best manners, and the best of you are those who are best to their women.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said in ‘Silsilah Saheehah’ no. 284, ‘it is from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211; </em>collected by Tirmidhi and Ahmad and the first part of the hadeeth is collected by Abu Dawood, Ibn Abee Shaybah in ‘al-Musannaf’, Abu Na’eem in ‘al-Hileeyah’ and Haakim and he said it is <em>Saheeh</em> upon the conditions of Muslim and Dhahabi agreed with him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>• She is a daughter </strong>and there are <em>Ayaat</em> and Ahadeeth[3] which explain the advice of being good to daughters. As for the <em>Ayaah</em> it is the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Allah instructs you concerning your children: for the male, what is equal to the share of two females. &gt;&gt; [Nisa:11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the advice of Allaah for being good to daughters, so that they are not neglected, as they were in <em>Jahileeyah</em>. So much so that at that time they used to bury their daughters alive. Likewise, it was not as the enemies of Islaam behave today (with their daughters), by only looking after them when they are young, but when they reach maturity they leave them to the streets to deal with themselves, astray, struggling  in depravity and committing vile and shameful deeds in the most disgusting manner and offensive form, the like of which the history of mankind has not known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever has three <strong>daughters</strong> and was patient with them, fed them and gave them drink and clothed them from his wealth then they will be a screen for him from the Hell-Fire on the Day of Judgement.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari mentions in a chapter heading in ‘al-Adab al-Mufrad’: ‘Chapter whoever is responsible for supplying sustenance for two daughters or even one.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the narration of Ahmad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘No one has three daughters, or three sisters, or two daughters, or two sisters, and he fears Allaah regarding them and is good to them, except that he will enter Paradise.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn Abbas from the Prophet  <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is no Muslim who has two daughters, and he has good companionship with them except that they will cause him to enter Paradise.’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She is a sister, a paternal aunt (father’s sister) and a maternal aunt (mother’s sister),  and they have all been mentioned with the advice of being good to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the paternal aunt and the maternal aunt then Islaam has encouraged Muslims greatly to have good relations with them  and to be good to those who are the closest of relatives and then the next and then the next.  No one can doubt that the paternal aunt and maternal aunt are connected to a Muslim from the direction of his mother and his father, therefore the paternal aunt and maternal aunt are of the same status as the mother and the father. Due to this, it becomes obligatory to have good relations with them and to be good to them and to honour them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The maternal aunt is of the status of the mother.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Bukhari, Ahmad and Abu Dawood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tirmidhi mentions in ‘Sunnan Tirmidhi’: ‘Chapter: being good to the maternal aunt, with a chain to al-Bara bin ‘Aazib from the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The aunt is of the status of the mother.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tirmidhi said: ‘And this hadeeth has a long story behind it and it is Saheeh.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn Umar <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>&#8211;  who said: ‘A man came to the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and said: ‘Indeed I have committed a major sin, is there any repentance for me?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Do you have a mother?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘No.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Do you have an aunt (mother’s sister)?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Then be good to her.’[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Sunnan Darmi, from Ibn Umar who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘a maternal aunt is of the same status of the mother, and a paternal aunt is of the same status of the father, a niece is of the same status of the uncle, and every relative is of the same status of his relation who is the equivalent thereof, if that person is not an inheritor due to the way they are related.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Sunnan Daraqutni, from Sha’abee who said: Ziyad bin Abu Sufyaan said to a person who would sit with him: ‘Do you know how Umar judged regarding the paternal aunt and the maternal aunt?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘No.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ziyad said: ‘Indeed I am the most knowledgeable of the creation of Allaah about how Umar judged them, he placed the maternal aunt at the same status of the mother, and the paternal aunt at the same status of the father.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3 –</strong> The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> encouraged his Ummah with the advice of being good to women, to honour them, to look after them, and to be patient with them in a general sense and <strong>especially</strong> with the wife. Just as you would like your daughter, or your sister, or your paternal aunt and your maternal aunt to be honoured, and it would make you happy. In the same way you should honour someone else’s daughter (who is your wife) she is like a captive given to you and she has given the flower of her life to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4 –</strong> The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> mentioned in the above mentioned hadeeth that the people of the two books (Jews and Christians) would honour their wives, and a man would remain with his wife all his life, loving her and being good to her, this is despite the fact that they are the people of sin, disbelief and Shirk. Therefore, O <em>Ummah</em> of Muhammad you are the people of <em>Deen</em>, <em>Taqwa</em> and <em>Istiqamah</em>therefore you should be the foremost in adopting these great manners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">Taken from Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">By <em>Shaykh Muhadith Nasir as-Sunnah </em>Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2823 – From AbdurRahmaan bin Jubair bin Nafeer, from his father who said: we were sitting with al-Miqdad bin al-Aswad one day, when a person passed by him and said: ‘<em>Toobah</em> (a tree in Paradise) for these two eyes which saw the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>: ‘I swear by Allaah that we wish we had seen what you have seen and witnessed what you witnessed.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Miqdad became angry, I became astonished, because they did not say anything but good. Then he turned to the man and said: ‘What makes a person wish that he was present when Allaah has made him absent.  He does not know, if he had witnessed it, how he would have been at that time? I swear by Allaah there were a people that were present at the time of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, who Allaah will throw on their nostrils in the Hell-Fire, because they did not respond to the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> nor did they believe in him. Do you not praise Allaah, for taking you out from your mothers’ wombs not knowing anything except your Lord and believing in that which your Prophet was sent with. Indeed you have been saved from trials by others being trialed instead of you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I swear by Allaah, that Allaah sent the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> in the severest time that any Prophet from among the Prophets was ever sent, in any period of time including the <em>Jahileeyah</em> time period (period of ignorance before Islaam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They would not regard any religion better than the worship of idols, then the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> came with the <em>Furqan</em> (the Criterion) he separated the truth from falsehood with this Criterion, and he separated a father from his son, so much so that a man would see his father and his son or his brother as a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed Allaah opened the lock of his heart with <em>Eemaan</em>, and he knows if he is destroyed he enters the fire, it does not make him happy that his beloved is in the fire. And it is about those that Allaah –Azza wa Jal – said: &lt;&lt;And those who say: ‘Our Lord! Bestow on us from our wives and our offspring the comfort of eyes&gt;&gt;’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Ahmad and Al-Albaani declared the <em>Isnaad</em> to be Saheeh</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Albaani commented saying:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘(Notice): This separating mentioned in this hadeeth has a foundation in ‘Saheeh al-Bukhari’ from the hadeeth of Jaabir bin Abdullaah who said: ‘The angels came to the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> while he was sleeping, some of them said: Indeed he is asleep and some of them said: ‘Indeed the eyes are asleep but the heart is awake…’ to the end of the hadeeth, and in this hadeeth it mentions: ‘So whoever obeys Muhammad <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> then he has obeyed Allaah, and whoever disobeys Muhammad then he disobeys Allaah, and Muhammad separated/divided the people.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Albaani) say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This hadeeth is a clear proof that shows that separating/division is not blameworthy in itself. So, some of the people push the people away from the <em>Dawa’</em> to the Book and the Sunnah, and they regard warning against that which opposes the Book and the Sunnah as being from the innovated matters, or they claim that the time to call to the Book and the Sunnah has not arrived! Their claim is that the Book and the Sunnah pushes people away and divides them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is great ignorance with regard to the truthful <em>Dawa’</em> and what is associated to this<em>Dawa’</em> from differences of opinions and hostility towards this <em>Dawa’</em>, as is witnessed in every time and place.  This is the Sunnah (the way) Allaah has ordained for His creation, and you will never find a change or turning off in the Sunnah (the way) of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And if your Lord had so willed, He could surely have made mankind one <em>Ummah</em>, but they will not cease to disagree,- Except him on whom your Lord has bestowed His Mercy &gt;&gt;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">By Shaykh Allaama Muhammed bin Salih al-Uthaymeen</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Taken From ‘The Explanation of Riyadh as-Saaliheen’ </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">360 Chapter- The dislike of praising someone in their presence because you fear that he will be corrupted by conceit/arrogance etc and the permissibility of praising someone who is rightfully secure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1797- From Abu Moosa al- Ashaari <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> who said: The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said ‘You have destroyed or broken this man’s back.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Agreed upon by Bukhari and Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1798 – From Abu Bakra <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em>: A person was mentioned in front of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and another man praised him with goodness the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Woe be to you! You have cut off the neck of your companion’ The Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> kept repeating this statement, then he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If one of you has to praise a person and there is no other option then say, I regard him to be such and such if you regard him as that, and Allaah is the one who takes him to account, and no one can testify about a person, above Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Agreed upon by Bukhari and Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1799- From Hammam bin al-Haarith, from al-Miqdaad <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu- </em>that a man began to praise Uthmaan <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>, al-Miqdaad sat up on his knees and began throwing small pebbles at his face.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Uthmaan said: ‘What bothers you?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘Indeed the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘If you see those who praise people in their presence, then throw dirt in their faces.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam an-Nawawi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘These are Ahadeeth which prohibit praising a person in his presence, however there are many authentic Ahadeeth regarding the permissibility of doing this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars have said: The way we combine these (apparently opposing) Ahadeeth is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the one being praised has perfect Eeman, certainty, is secure in himself, trains his soul and possesses awareness  to the extent that he will not be trialed or deceived by this praise nor will this praise play upon his conscience then in this circumstance it is not prohibited nor is it disliked to praise him in his presence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If however, any of these above matters are feared and that person is not secure, then it is disliked to praise him in his presence, and it is disliked in the strongest terms. The differing Ahadeeth, are understood in this context and according to this explanation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is mentioned regarding the permissibility of praising a person in his presence; there is the statement the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>made to Abu Bakr <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>: ‘I hope you are from them.’  Meaning, he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> hoped Abu Bakr would be from those who will be called to enter Paradise from all its Gates.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another hadeeth (the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said to Abu Bakr <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>): ‘You are not from them.’ Meaning you are not from those who trail their garments below their ankles to show off.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said to Umar <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu:</em> ‘I do not see the Shaytan, except that he follows a pathway other than your path.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>[Taken from the text of ‘Riyadh as-Saliheen’]</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammed bin Salih al-Uthaymeen said in his explanation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author brings forth an explanation concerning ‘praising another person’ and the question arises, is it necessary for a person to praise his brother with what he has or does not have? There are different situations to this scenario.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first situation: That there is benefit in praising him and it is encouragement for him, motivating him to praiseworthy characteristics and noble manners. There is no harm in doing this because it is encouragement for your companion. Therefore if you witness generosity, being good to others, courage  and sacrificing and you mention his qualities in front of him to others in order to encourage him and make him firm in order to continue with what he is doing, then this is good and is what is intended by the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Help one another in <em>Al­-Birr </em>and <em>At-­Taqwa </em>(virtue, righteousness and piety)&gt;&gt; [5:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second situation: That you praise him in order to make apparent his excellence amongst the people in order for this praise to spread amongst the people so they respect him, as the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> did with Abu Bakr and Umar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning Abu Bakr, the Prophet was speaking one day and asked: ‘Who amongst you is fasting today?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr replied: ‘I am.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Prophet asked again: ‘Who amongst you has followed a funeral procession today?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr replied: ‘I have.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said:  ‘Who has given charity today?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr said: ‘I have.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet asked: ‘Who amongst you has visited a sick person today?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr replied: ‘I have.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said: ‘These matters are not gathered in a person except he enters Paradise.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition to this the Prophet once spoke of the one who trails his garment on the ground out of pride and that Allaah will not look at him, and Abu Bakr said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah indeed one side of my garment loosens away from me though I attempt to keep it up.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet replied: ‘Indeed you are not of those who do it out of pride.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said to Umar: ‘I do not see the Shaytan, except that he follows a pathway other than your path.’ This means that when you O Umar follow a pathway then Shaytan runs away from it and takes another pathway.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are examples of the Prophet explaining the excellence of Abu Bakr and Umar, and there is no harm in this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third situation: To praise someone and to take it to an extreme and to describe him in a way that he is not worthy of. This is prohibited and it is lying and deception. For example mentioning a leader or minister or someone of this rank and extolling him and describing him with praiseworthy characteristics which he does not posses. This is not permissible and is harmful for the one being praised.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth situation: someone praises another person with that which he does posses however he fears that the person being praised will be deceived by this and become amazed of his own self  and becomes conceited with himself, and raise himself above others. This is also prohibited and not permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author mentioned ahadeeth regarding praising someone in his presence: ‘Woe be to you! You have cut off the neck of your companion.’ This means that it is as if you have slaughtered him due to your praise of him, this means that your praise caused him to raise himself (become conceited) which is why the Prophet ordered for dirt to be thrown in the face of the those who praise people in their presence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is well known that someone does not sit in a gathering of noble standing and status, except that he praises those present, and  this person is one who praises those of high status but he is not like the one who praises anyone and everyone. This person is the one whom you hear him praise anyone and everyone, [good or bad,] time and time again but the other type of person praises any senior person, judge or scholar etc, whenever he sits with them. In this case it is permissible to throw dust in their face because a man praised Uthmaan <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> so al-Miqdad stood and took some small pebbles and threw them in the face of the person who praised. Uthmaan  asked him ‘ Why did you do that?’  He said, indeed the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘If you see those who praise people in their presence, then throw dirt in their faces.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To conclude it is incumbent upon everyone to only speak good because the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Whoever believes in Allaah and the Last Day, then he should speak good or remain silent.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah is the One who gives success.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">By The Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ Muhammad Nasiruddeen al-Albaani </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is a summary of what the Shaykh al-Albaani (d. 1420 A.H.) said in the introduction to a book entitled ‘<em>Bidaytus – Sooli Fee Tafdeel Rasool </em><em>-salAllaahu ‘alaihi wassalam</em><em> as-Sharraffa w­­a Karrama</em>’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed I firmly believe that it is upon every Muslim who is sincere in his Islaam, to familiarize himself abundantly with a good amount of manners, which Allaah has honoured His Prophet with, in addition to the virtues that Allaah placed upon the Prophet in order for him to excel above all the worlds, from the Jinn and all of mankind altogether, rather even above those Angels who are close to Allaah Ta’ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This familiarization can be attained through the established evidences from the Book and the Sunnah, researching them and having the correct understanding of them, because indeed that is what will, – without any doubt – increase the Muslim in <em>Eemaan</em>, and sincere love for the Prophet  <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Love for the Prophet  <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> which is a primary principle that becomes firm in the heart of the believer is also connected to the love of Allaah<em>Ta’ala</em>, Who out of His Excellence sent us His Messenger, and blessed us – and Allaah Posses all blessings – with the Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Tabarak</em> <em>wa</em> <em>Ta’ala</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; He it is Who sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger from among themselves, reciting to them His Verses, purifying them, and teaching them the Book and <em>Al-Hikmah</em> (<em>As-Sunnah</em>). And verily, they had been before in manifest error &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is why the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There are three characteristics, whoever has them finds the sweetness of <em>Eemaan</em>: that Allaah and His Messenger are more beloved to him than other than them; that when he loves a person he loves him only for Allaah’s sake and that he hates to return to disbelief after Allaah has saved him from it just as he hates to be thrown into the Hell-Fire.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this love continues to rise in his heart until the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, becomes more beloved to him, more beloved than every respected person he knows.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘None of you truly believes until I am more beloved to him than his son, his father and all mankind.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know O brother Muslim, that it is not possible for anyone to rise to this level of love for Allaah and His Messenger except with the <em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> in His worship Alone [rather than to any other than Him].  And singling out the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, by following him from amongst Allaah’s slaves, due to the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; He who obeys the Messenger, has indeed obeyed Allaah &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Say: ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘No, by Him in Whose Hand is my soul, even if Moosa was alive today he would have no recourse except to follow me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Albaani) say:  so if it is not granted even for the likes of Moosa whom Allaah spoke to, to follow other than the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, then would it be granted for anyone other than Moosa?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is from the unequivocal/absolute proofs of the obligation of singularly following the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.  It is from the necessities of the testimony of ‘Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah.’ And this is why Allaah <em>Tabarak wa Ta’ala</em>stated it in the preceding Ayah, that following the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>alone is a proof of Allaah loving a person. And there is no doubt that whoever is loved by Allaah, then Allaah will be with him in all that he does, as is mentioned in the authentic <em>hadeeth</em> <em>al</em>&#8211;<em>Qudsi</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And My slave does not come closer to Me except with that which is more beloved to Me than what I have made obligatory upon him, My slave continues to come closer to Me with the optional deeds until I love him, if I love him I will be his hearing with which he hears, and the sight with which he sees, and his hand with which he grips and the leg with which he walks, and if he asks Me I will definitely give it, and if he seeks refuge then I will definitely give him sanctuary . . ..  ’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this is the divine concern that Allaah has for his beloved slave, then it is obligatory upon every Muslim to take those means which make him more beloved to Allaah. And this is done by no other way than singularly following the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8211; as opposed to anyone else. Only by doing this alone will one be granted the special concern from ones Master [Allaah] <em>– Tabaarak wa Ta’ala –</em>do you not see that there is no path to knowing that which is obligatory and distinguishing that from optional worship except by following the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>alone?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt, that when a Muslim becomes more knowledgeable about the biography of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, and knows more of his beautiful qualities and his excellence, then his love for the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8211; would be more, and thus his following of him <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>would be more extensive and more comprehensive.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What drove me to research and distribute this blessed booklet was for me to help my Muslim brothers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In reality my only goal in this life, after fulfilling the obligatory rights that Allaah has upon me, is to familiarize the Muslims through educating, lecturing and writing about the authentic <em>Seerah</em> of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, from all its different angles according to my capability. And to encourage them to take the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>as the only example to be followed, just as Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>encouraged them in doing so, in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a good example to follow for him who hopes in (the Meeting with) Allaah and the Last Day and remembers Allaah much. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and therein lies their happiness in the <em>Dunyaa</em> and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last piece of work that I worked on was about a year ago (1401 A.H.) when I summarized the book ‘<em>Shammail al-Muhammadeeyah</em>’ by <em>Imam</em> Tirmidhi.  I distinguished between the hadeeth being <em>Saheeh</em> and <em>Da’eef</em> by commenting upon them, this was while I was staying in my new place of migration ‘Amman’ [capital of Jordan], during a time of afflictions that interrupted me, simultaneously I was preoccupied with buying land and building my home.  After staying there for a few months, an event caused disruption resulting in my leaving my home and my family and travelling to the first place I migrated to: ‘Damascus’ where I went back and stayed for two days, and then from there to Lebanon in spite of a lot of turmoil and chaos making it a difficult place to reach.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed I then preceded to complete this book [<em>‘Bidaytus &#8211; Sooli Fee Tafdeel Rasool</em> <em>-salAllaahu ‘alaihi wassalam</em> <em>as-Sharraffa wa Karrama’</em>] despite great problems during this work, and with very upsetting news which caused me much pain, namely the death of my elder brother Muhammad Naajee Abu Ahmad during the season of Hajj, I continued completing this book whilst seeking mercy for my brother, being patient upon this affliction, due to his death. He was the best of my brothers and was the most sincere towards me, and the strongest from amongst them in response to my <em>Dawa</em>’ and he held a great concern for it. He was enthusiastic in calling to the <em>Dawa</em>’ may Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> bestow his abundant mercy upon him.  We were patient, my brothers and his children and his grandchildren and his in-laws with this affliction. May Allaah grant them someone good as he was a good predecessor for them, may Allaah gather us all with him under the banner of the master/leader of the son of Adam, Muhammad <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>&lt;&lt;The Day when there will not benefit [anyone] wealth or children But only one who comes to Allah with a sound heart.&gt;&gt; [26:88-89] and indeed we belong to Allaah and indeed to him is our return.  O Allaah reward me for my affliction and compensate it for me with better than that. O Allaah forgive Abu Ahmad and raise his rank amongst those who were guided to Islaam to the best of creation (the Prophet), and place someone to look after those still alive after him, and forgive us and him O Lord of all the worlds, and make his grave spacious for him, and make light in there for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed I have digressed a lot from what we were dealing with. Everything that happens to humans is protection under the Will of Allaah and His Compassion, so we return to what we were discussing, so I say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you can comprehend that which has preceded in that <strong>Allaah’s Love cannot be attained except by following His Prophet, you should therefore be concerned with following his Sunnah</strong>, and one should spend in that cause, strive with oneself completely. He should not be deceived by that which some of the deceived, misguided people are upon, from amongst the <em>Soofeeyah</em> and frivolous people, those who have taken their religion to be play and amusement, with <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Nasheed</em> (songs) and tunes. <strong>By which they claim that they please Muhammad </strong><strong><em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em></strong>with that which they call ‘religious <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Nasheed</em>’ and they play them constantly for their<em>Dhikr</em> (meetings for remembrance of Allaah) and in their gatherings, which they organize on innovated Eids like the <em>Eid</em> of <em>Mawlid</em> (celebrating the Prophet’s birth) etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed they are –and I swear by Allaah– clearly misguided, and are deviated from the truth.  How can they not be in clear misguidance since they have mixed up the <em>Deen</em>with false amusements, and they have blindly copied shameless singers, with their rhythmical musical tunes, <strong>and they adhere to this in their <em>Soofi</em> paths which kill the hearts</strong>, and divert them from the remembrance of Allaah and the recitation of the Qur’aan.  The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘He is not from us who does not recite the Qur’aan in a beautiful way.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is especially because they add singing to musical instruments and clapping thus completing the resemblance between the two different groups. That is then broadcasted by some foreign radio stations, not only the Arab radio stations. Trying to please the people in the name of <em>Dhikr</em> (remembrance of Allaah) or religious <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Nasheed</em>!  And regretfully some of the religious radio stations have began to follow their footsteps for which Allaah’s aid is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has even reached me that some of the visual broadcasters (Television) have presented some of these <em>Dhikr</em> (remembrances of Allaah) or religious <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Nasheed</em>, as if it is from Islaam, and that it is from the characteristics of sincerity in which Muslims call to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will never forget, once a long time ago I visited a centre from some of the Islaamic organizations, and I was shocked to hear the sound of the <em>Adhaan</em> chanted with musical instruments!  So I questioned them regarding it?  It was said:  ‘It is some Muslim youth from some Arab countries who have come as guests to this organization, and one of them lets them hear the <em>Adhaan</em> with a musical chant,’ and now this is what we hear from many of the Islaamic radio stations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was finally brought to the attention of some Muslim youth, concerning that which those <em>an-Nasheed</em> contain of evil and deviancy opposing the Islaamic <em>Sharia’</em>, so they modified it to a different type of <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Nasheed</em> which talked about enthusiasm, strength and reminders of Islaamic heroism, and they would also adhere to some musical chanting and some of them have even added some musical instruments like the <em>Duff</em>(Arabic drum) etc. to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, I heard it, with my own ears in some music stores, something of the like, so I spoke with them, due to that which is obligatory in the <em>Deen</em> by way of advising them and reminding them that it is not allowed, especially since many of them have begun listening to <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Nasheed</em> as a habit, and it has busied them from reciting Qur’aan or listening to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this is from the evil of the deviancy of keeping away from the <em>Salaf</em>, indeed I am certain that this was not from their practice, even though they used to sometimes recite poetry in wars and battles. This practice is one thing and taking that and applying to it a musical chant and making it a habit and resembling the practice of the people of evil and mere amusements, then that is something else, and it is not hidden from the people of knowledge and insight.  May Allaah have mercy upon the one who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Every good is in the following of the <em>Salaf</em> * and every evil is in the innovations of the <em>Khalaf</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summary: Indeed I advise everyone who reads this book, that they do not suffice with the knowledge in it but follow that up with hopeful consequences which is to sincerely follow this great Messenger, which necessitates the love of Allaah, and His Forgiveness for ones sin, &lt;&lt;and this is the great success&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘We ask Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> that He makes us from them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: A summary from the introduction to ‘Bidaytus &#8211; Sooli Fee Tafdeel Rasool &#8211;<em>salAllaahu ‘alaihi wassalam</em> as-Sharraffa wa Karrama’ p.4 -12]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">Imam AbdurRahman bin Nasr as-Sa’adi</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Jareer bin Abdullaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">‫من لا يرحم الناس لا يرحمه الله</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever does not have mercy upon the people then Allaah does not have mercy upon him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Bukhari &amp; Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh AbdurRahman bin Nasr as-Sa’adi (d. 1376 A.H.) commented on this hadeeth saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The literal wording of the hadeeth indicates that the one who does not have mercy upon the people then Allaah does not have mercy upon him. The understanding of the hadeeth is that whoever has mercy upon the people, then Allaah has mercy upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just like the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said in another hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">‘الراحمون يرحمهم الرحمن. ارحموا من في الأرض؛ يرحمكم من في السماء<strong>‘</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<em>ar-Rahman</em> (The Most Merciful) has mercy upon Merciful people. Have mercy upon those on the earth, and the One above the skies will have mercy upon you.’[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the mercy a slave of Allaah has for the creation is from the greatest means by which the mercy of Allaah is acquired. From the effects of that mercy is goodness in the <em>Dunyaa</em> and goodness in the Hereafter. From the greatest means of Allaah’s mercy being blocked and prevented is if the slave of Allaah does not have mercy to the creation. The slave of Allaah is in great need and dire want of Allaah’s mercy, he cannot do without it for even the blink of an eye, and he cannot do without this mercy due to what it contains of blessings and repelling of punishment from the mercy of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consequently, when a person wants the mercy of Allaah to continue and increase, then he needs to implement all the means by which the mercy of Allaah is gained. All of these means are combined in the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">إِنَّ رَحْمَتَ اللّهِ قَرِيبٌ مِّنَ الْمُحْسِنِينَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Indeed, the mercy of Allah is near to the doers of good. &gt;&gt; [Ara’af: 56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are doers of good (<em>al-Muhsinoon</em>) in the worship of Allaah, and they are <em>al-Muhsinoon</em> to the worshippers of Allaah. The <em>Ihsaan</em> (being good) to the creation has an effect from the effects of the mercy that the slave of Allaah has with the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are two types of mercy that the slave of Allaah has:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First type:</strong> Natural &amp; innate mercy</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has granted some of His slaves this mercy.  He placed compassion, mercy and sympathy in their hearts for the creation.  These slaves of Allaah carryout what they are capable of in benefitting the people and this is what this mercy necessitates and they do so according to their capabilities. They are praised, and rewarded for what they do, and they are excused for that in which they fall short on, and perhaps Allaah wrote a reward for them, due to their truthful intentions even though their strength was not enough to carry out those actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second type</strong> is the mercy that a slave of Allaah acquires by following every path and means in order to characterize his heart with this mercy. The slave of Allaah knows that this description is from the most noble and most complete of manners and behavior.  He strives to characterize himself with it, and he is aware of the reward that Allaah has prepared for being merciful, and what he loses, if he is prohibited from this reward.  He desires excellence from his Lord, and he strives with all the different means to acquire that excellence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The slave of Allaah knows that the reward is equivalent to the type of action carried out, and he knows that Allaah has ordained a religious brotherhood, and a love based on <em>Eemaan</em> between the Believers. Allaah ordered the believers to be brothers loving each other, and to eliminate everything that negates brotherhood from hatred, enmity and evil plotting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The slave of Allaah continues to be acquainted with the means by which he acquires this noble characteristic of being merciful, and he exerts himself in implementing this characteristic so much so that he fills his heart up with this mercy, and sympathy for the creation. How great is this noble manner, and noble and complete characteristic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The effects of this mercy, which is in the hearts, becomes evident upon the limbs and the tongue in striving to do good, righteousness and relaying benefits to the people, and to discontinue harm, and being compelling and offensive to the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sign that shows the presence of mercy in the heart of the slave of Allaah is that he loves that goodness reaches all of the creation generally, and specifically to the Muslims, and he dislikes that evil and harm reaches them. And will be in relation to the level of love and dislike he has, and will be in relation to the level of mercy that he has.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever is afflicted by the death of a beloved person or by other afflictions, and if his sadness upon that person or affliction is due to feeling merciful, then this sadness is praiseworthy, and it does not negate patience and seeking Allaah’s pleasure, this is because when the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> cried due to the death of his grandson, Sa’ad said to him: ‘What is this O Messenger of Allaah?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> followed up his question with another statement and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">‘هذه رحمة يجعلها الله في قلوب عباده، وإنما يرحم الله من عباده الرحماء’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This is mercy, which Allaah places in the hearts of His slaves.  Indeed those whom Allaah has mercy upon from His slaves are those who are merciful.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said at the death of his son Ibraheem:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">‘القلب يحزن، والعين تدمع، ولا نقول إلا ما يرضي ربنا. وإنَّا لفراقك يا إبراهيم لمحزونون’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The heart is saddened, the eyes shed tears, but we only say that which pleases our Lord. And indeed we are saddened by your separation O Ibraheem.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise having mercy upon young children and slaves, and making them happy is also from being merciful­.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for not having concern for them and not having gentleness with them, then this is from coarseness, harshness and cruelty, just like some of the coarseness of the Bedouins when they saw the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and his companions kissing their younger children, one of the Bedouins said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I have ten children I did not even kiss one of them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">‘أو أملك لك شيئاً أن نزع الله من قلبك الرحمة؟’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘How can I hold something for you, with Allaah has removed mercy from your heart?’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, an example of being merciful is the mercy that the prostitute had when she gave water to a dog to drink, he was going to eat dirt due to extreme thirst, and Allaah forgave her due to that mercy.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The opposite of that example is how a woman was punished due to her tying up a cat, she did not feed her or give her drink, nor did she leave her to eat from the leftovers on the earth, until that cat died.[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Additionally from this mercy is that which has been witnessed and experienced, and that is that whoever is kind to his animals by giving them food and drink and beneficial consideration, then Allaah blesses him regarding his animals, and whoever is evil to them, then he is punished in the <em>Dunya</em> before the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">مِنْ أَجْلِ ذَلِكَ كَتَبْنَا عَلَى بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ أَنَّهُ مَن قَتَلَ نَفْسًا بِغَيْرِ نَفْسٍ أَوْ فَسَادٍ فِي الأَرْضِ فَكَأَنَّمَا قَتَلَ النَّاسَ جَمِيعًا وَمَنْ أَحْيَاهَا فَكَأَنَّمَا أَحْيَا النَّاسَ جَمِيعًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Because of that, We decreed upon the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land – it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves one – it is as if he had saved mankind entirely. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Maidah: 32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because the first heart has cruelty, harshness and evil, whereas the other heart has mercy and gentleness and compassion, and he is concerned with reviving all those people from whom he has the ability to revive, in comparison to the first heart which has cruelty, and is prepared to annihilate all the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah to place mercy in our hearts which will obligate us to follow all the ways that gain the mercy of Allaah, and that we sympathize with all the creation of Allaah due to this mercy. And that Allaah makes it a way of gaining Allaah’s mercy and His generosity; indeed He is the Bestower of goodness and the Most Kind.</p>

<p>Ad-Dhahabi commented on this statement in ‘al-‘Uloo’:</p>
<p>‘So this is Qutaibah, being a great trustworthy Imam, who conveyed a consensus of this issue. He had met Malik, Layth, Hammad bin Zayd, the senior scholars and he lived a long life and the memorizers of hadeeth used to crowd around at his door.’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Nawawee said in his explanation of this hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Scholars have said: the reason for the superiority of the mother is due to her becoming tired on your account, her compassion, her serving you, suffering hardship while being pregnant with you, then giving birth to you, then suckling you, then bringing you up, serving you, nursing you and other things.’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘No.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Ibn Abbas said: ‘Repent to Allaah –Azza wa Jal- and come close to Him as much as you can.’</p>

I used to say to him O my son it is night time go to your wife and he would say: ‘O mother I know what you want.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;" align="center">Compiled &amp; Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 – From Abu Umamah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘Treat your sick by giving <em>Sadaqah</em> (charity).’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected in Saheeh al-Jamia’ No. 3358 &amp; declared Hasan by Albaani]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – From Ubadah bin Saamit who said I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘There is no person who is afflicted with a wound on his body, and he gives charity due to that, then Allaah expiates from him the like of what he gave in charity.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ahmad &amp; Albaani declared it to have an authentic Isnaad in Saheehah No. 2273]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – A man asked Abdullaah bin al-Mubarak <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> about ulcers that had sprung out on his knee for about seven years, and he tried to treat it with various treatments, he had asked doctors but to no avail. So Ibn Mubarak said: ‘<strong><span style="color:#808000;">Go and dig a well in a place where people need water, indeed I hope that there springs up water there, and by that you stop bleeding</span></strong>.’  The man did that and Allaah Ta’ala cured him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Seerah ‘Alaam’ 8/407]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bayhaqi quoted a story of our Shaykh al-Haakim Abu Abdullaah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> who was afflicted with ulcers on his face, and he had tried a number of treatments but they did not go away, and it remained like that for nearly a year.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then asked the teacher, Imam Abu Uthmaan as-Sabooni to make <em>Dua’</em> for him in one of his gatherings on Friday, so he made <em>Dua’</em> and many of the people with him said <em>Ameen</em>.  When it came to the next <em>Juma’</em> a woman came to the gathering and left a brief message saying that she had gone back home and exerted herself in making <em>Dua’ </em>for al-Haakim Abu Abdullaah that night, and that she had seen the Messenger of Allaah<em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>in her sleep, and it was as if he was saying to her: &#8220;<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>T</strong><strong>ell Abu Abdullaah to distribute water amongst the Muslims.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I came with that message to al-Haakim, and he ordered that a watering place be built at the door of his home, when they had finished building it, he ordered for water to be poured into it and ice placed into that water, and then the people began drinking from that water.  Not a week had passed by, except that it was obvious that his health had been restored, and the ulcers had ceased. His face had become better than it was before, and he lived like that for a number of years.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected in ‘Saheeh Targheeb wa Tarheeb’ No. 964 Albaani declared it to be Saheeh Maqtu, 1/p.568]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – Abu Tahir as-Silafee said in ‘Mua’jam as-Safr’: I heard Abu Hasan Ali bin Abu Bakr Ahmad bin Ali the scribe of al-Minzi in Damascus saying: I heard Abu Bakr al-Khabazi (d. 449A.H.) in Nisaboor saying: I became sick with a very dangerous illness, and a righteous neighbor of mine saw me and said: ‘Utilize the saying of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘Treat your sick by giving <em>Sadaqah</em> (charity).’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It was summer time, and I bought many watermelons, and a group of poor people and children got together and ate them, then they raised their hands to Allaah –<em>Azza wa Jal-</em> and they made <em>Dua’</em> for me to be cured.</strong>  I swear by Allaah I had not reach the morning except that I regained complete health from Allaah &#8211;<em>Tabaraka wa Ta’ala</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Seerah ‘Alaam 18/44, Tareekh al-Islaam]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 – al-Barzali (d. 841A.H.) said in his Fatwa (5/612): Ibn Rushd was asked about the saying of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>: ‘Treat your sick by giving <em>Sadaqah</em> (charity).’ Is it authentic or not? And what does it mean? And if a person becomes sick and treats his illness with all types of medicines and they did not benefit him, then what is the way of giving <em>Sadaqah</em> as a medicine?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I do not remember this text (narration) in any of the authentic collections of narrations, however, if it is authentic, then the meaning is an encouragement to visit the sick, because it is from the obligatory rights from the Sunnah that it is upon a Muslim that he visit a Muslim if he becomes sick.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the saying ‘The Muslim is a brother of a Muslim, he encourages him to say the testification at the time of death, and he visits him when he is sick, and advises him when he is absent or if he has to testify.’ As for visiting him then this is a good deed, and every good deed is <em>Sadaqah</em>, since it has a connection with the sick person and visiting him brings happiness to him, and just like making <em>Dua’</em>. There is no doubt that there is hope that the <em>Dua’</em> will be answered and he will be cured.  Therefore, it does benefit him as a type of medicine, due to the saying of the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>: ‘He who sent down the illness also sent down the treatment.’<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Barzali said: some of our shaykhs from al-Qarawan understood this to have an evident meaning, namely that if a person gives <em>Sadaqah</em> on behalf of the sick, and that he requests the person whom he gave <em>Sadaqah</em> to, to make <em>Dua’</em> for the sick then it is hoped that he will be cured, due to the saying of the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>: ‘<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The supplication of one of you for his brother in his absence is answered</strong></span>.’<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – ad-Dooree narrated in ‘<em>Tareekh</em>’ and al-Bayhaqi in ‘<em>Shu’ab al-Eemaan</em>’ from Ibraheem an-Nakhai who said: ‘<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>that the Companions used to regard giving <em>Sadaqah</em> as a means of repelling oppression</strong></span>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 – From Hudayfah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> that the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘A <em>fitnah</em> (trail) which a man faces with regard to his family, his wealth, his own self, his son and his neighbor is expiated by fasting, prayer, charity, enjoining good and forbidding evil.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8 – Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Indeed <em>Sadaqah</em> has an amazing effect in repelling different types of trials and tribulations, even if the charity was given by an evil person, or an oppressive person, in fact even if it was given by a non-Muslim! Indeed Allaah Ta’ala repels different types of trials and tribulations due to giving <em>Sadaqah</em>.  This is a matter which is well-known to the scholars and the general folk, and all of the people on the earth can associate with this fact because they have experienced it.’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘al-Wabil as-Sayyib’ p.63]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9 – Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘There are types of medicines which can treat illnesses which the minds of the senior doctors cannot comprehend, and that which their sciences, experiences and measurements cannot reach. These are the medicines of the heart and soul, and the strength of the heart, its dependence upon Allaah and trust upon Him and seeking refuge in Him. Prostrating and feeling in dire need of Allaah and humbling oneself for Allaah. Likewise giving <em>Sadaqah</em> (charity), making <em>Dua’</em>, repentance and seeking forgiveness, being good to the creation, aiding the distressed and liberating from grief and unhappiness.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Indeed these types of medication have been used by various nations, who are upon different religions and communities, and they found that they had an effect in the treatment of illnesses, which even the sciences of the most knowledgeable doctors could not reach, and they have no experience nor measurement of it. We have indeed experienced these matters a great deal and as others have, and we have seen what ordinary medicine can and cannot do.’</strong></p>
