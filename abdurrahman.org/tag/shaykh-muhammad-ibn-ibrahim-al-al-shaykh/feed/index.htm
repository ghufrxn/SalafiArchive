										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Treatment with Hijamah versus medical denial</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Useful note</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Treatment with Hijamah (cupping) and doctors&#8217; denial of its effectiveness:</strong> Hijamah has great effect on health. It is stated in the Hadith of Isra&#8217; (Night Journey): <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<strong>Whenever the Prophet (peace be upon him) passed by a host of angels they would instruct him to command his Ummah (the Muslim nation) to use Hijamah&#8221;</strong></span>. There are waste products that remain in the blood from substances circulated and secreted throughout the body. Unless such waste products are gradually cleared little by little, they would cause great harm to people risking their lives. Since the human body continuously produces substances that are surplus to its requirements, Hijamah has been introduced. Yet, doctors see it ineffective, and this is not strange, for they lack great deal of knowledge about many matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is fair to give each person their right, and doctors should be given their due rights relating to their profession. Yet treatment of diseases is beyond comprehension and restriction, and doctors are not experienced in a lot of methods outside their area of specialization. Allah (Exalted be He) says: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And of knowledge, you (mankind) have been given only a little</strong></span>. (Surah Al-Isra&#8217;, 17: 85) Doctors often deny particular matters prescribed by Shari`ah (Islamic law) due to their great ignorance of their effectiveness. This is because many of them are westernized, have studied under western teachers, or they mainly derive their knowledge from western sources of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their denial of many of the matters prescribed by Shari`ah is not, however, based on scientific principles, but rather a blind pursuance of those who deny prophethood and imperceptible matters such as existence of Jinn (creatures created from fire) and the effect of the envious eye. For instance, they diagnose possession by Jinn as nervous disorders.</p>
