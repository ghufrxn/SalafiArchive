<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 79 : Point 135-136</strong><br />
<strong> Shaykh Ahmad Najmee | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>135</strong>]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong> If you hear a man attacking the narrations (<em>athaar</em>) or rejecting the narrations or desiring some thing other than the narrations then have doubt about his Islam. And do not doubt that he is the person of Desires and Innovator.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>136</strong>] <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that Ruler&#8217;s oppression does not reduce or remove anything that Allaah has made obligatory upon the tongue of his prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). His oppression will be upon himself and your acts of obedience along with him will be complete if Allaah,the Most High,wills. Meaning, the congregational prayer and the <em>jumu&#8217;ah</em> prayer along with them and fighting <em>jihaad</em> along with them. And all acts of obedience accompany them in that , for you will have your intention.</strong></span></p>

<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Yūnus ibn &#8216;Ubayd saw his son come away from the company of a person of the innovated sects, so he said &#8220;<em>O my son! where have you just come from?&#8221;</em> He replied &#8220;<em>from being with Amr ibn Ubayd</em>&#8220;. He said &#8220;<em>O my son! that I should see you coming out from the house of a Khunsaa (hermaphrodite, bisexual) would be more beloved to me than that I should see you coming out from the house of so-and-so.That you should meet Allaah, O my son, as a fornicator , a major sinner, a thief and a treacherous person would be more beloved to me than that you meet Him with the saying of the people of the deviant sects.&#8221;</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Do you not see that the Yūnus ibn &#8216;Ubayd knew that the hermaphrodite would not misguide his son away from his religion whereas the innovator may lead him astray until he becomes a disbeliever.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 80 : Points 140</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The lawful is that which you would witness and swear to be lawful, likewise the prohibited (<em>haraam</em>). That which causes uneasiness in your heart is something doubtful </strong></span>[1].</p>
<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p>[1] An-Nu’maan ibn Basheer said: Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;What is lawful is clear and what is unlawful is clear, but between them are certain doubtful things which many people do not know. So he who guards against doubtful things keeps his religion and his honour blameless. But he who falls into doubtful things falls into that which is unlawful, just as a shepherd who grazes his cattle in the vicinity of a pasture declared prohibited (by the king); he is likely to stray into the pasture. Mind you, every king has a protected pasture and Allah&#8217;s involved limits is that which He has declared unlawful. Verily, there is a piece of flesh in the body, if it is healthy, the whole body is healthy, and if it is corrupt, the whole body is corrupt. Verily, it is the heart.&#8221;</span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 79 : Points 137</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">If you see a man making supplication against the ruler, then know that he is a person of desires. If you see a man a making supplication in favor of the ruler for him to be sound and righteous, the know that he is a person of the Sunnah, if Allah wills.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Fudayl ibn ‘Iyaad </span></strong>[1]<strong><span style="color:#993300;"> said, “If I had a supplication that was going to be answered, I would make it for the ruler.” It was said to him, “O Abu ‘Alee, explain this to us.” He said, “If I were to make it for myself, then it will not extend beyond me. But, if I made it for the ruler, then he will be corrected and, through that, the servants and the land will be set in order” </span></strong>[2].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">So we are commanded to make supplication for them (the rulers) to be sound and righteous. And we have not been commanded to make supplication against them, even if they commit tyranny and oppression, since their tyranny and oppression will be only upon themselves, but their rectitude will be good for themselves and for the Muslims.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Al-Fudayl ibn ‘Iyaad ibn Mas’ood, Shaikhul-Islam, Abu ‘Alee, alYarboo’ee, al-Khurasaanee. He was born in Samarqand and grew up to be a highway robber. However, his heart was moved upon hearing the Qur’an recited and he repented and then travelled in search of knowledge to Koofah, eventually settling in Makkah. Some of his students were Ibn al-Mubaarak, Yahyaa al-Qattaan, ‘Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Mahdee, ‘Abdur-Razzaaq, ash-Shaafi’ee and Qutaibah ibn Sa’eed. Ibn al-Mubaarak said, “No one better than Fudayl ibn ‘Iyaad remains upon the face of the earth.” Haaroon ar-Rasheed said, “I have not seen any scholar with greater dignity than Maalik, nor anyone more pious than al-Fudayl.” As-Siyaar (8/421-441) and Tadhkiratul-Huffaadh (1/245-246) of adh-Dhahabee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] This narration is reported by Abu Nu’aym in al-Hilyah (8/91) with a saheeh isnaad and by al-Khallaal in as-Sunnah (no.9).</p>

<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">If you see a man criticizing anyone from the Companions of  Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>), then know that he is a follower of desires and a person of evil speech because of the saying of Allaah&#8217;s  Messenger (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>), “When my Companions are mentioned then withhold”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) knew of any slips that they were going to make after his death, yet still he did not say about them except good. And his saying , “Leave my Companions and do not say about them anything except good”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Do not discuss anything from their slips or their wars, nor that which you do not have knowledge of. Do not listen to it  from anyone who speaks with it, for  your heart will not be secure if you listen to it.</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 77 : Points 132</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Every Knowledge which worshippers claim to be from hidden inner knowledge (<em>‘Ilmul-Baatin</em>) which is not found in the Book and the Sunnah, then it  is innovation and misguidance. It is not to be acted upon by anyone nor called to </strong></span>[1].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] This is what the extreme innovators, amongst them the <em>Baatinees</em> and extreme <em>Soofees</em>, call to. They explain things away by claiming that they have an outer aspect and an inner aspect. They twist the Book of Allah and His <em>Sharee’ah</em> to suit their own desires. Their claim of receiving hidden religious knowledge, outside of the Book and the Sunnah, is disbelief.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 77 : Points 131</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The blameless one from the Muslims is the one from whom nothing suspicious becomes apparent.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F408965550&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“O you who believe, avoid much (types) of suspicion. Verily some (forms) of suspicion is a sin.”</strong></span> [Surah Al-Hujuraat: 12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Abu Hurairah (<em>radhi Allaahu anhu</em>) reported that Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>Beware of suspicion, for indeed suspicion is the most untruthful form of speech</strong>.” [<em>Saheeh</em> – Reported by Al-Bukhaaree (10/484 of al-Fath) and Muslim (2563)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ahaadeeth with this same understanding I have mentioned here are many. <strong>What the backbiting of the heart means, is: When the heart has firm conviction and holds bad thoughts about someone. But as for the notions that occasionally display in one’s mind or when one talks to himself, then as long as these thoughts do not remain established and continuous in him, it is excused according to the consensus of the scholars</strong>. This is since he has no choice in the matter as to stop it from occurring nor can he find any way to liberate himself from it when it does occur. This is the understanding of what has been authentically established (in the texts).</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 76 : Point 128</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Whoever abandons the <em>Jumu’ah</em> Prayer and the congregational prayers in the mosque, without a valid excuse, then he is an innovator </strong></span>[1]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>. The valid excuse is such as an illness, because of which he is unable to go out to the mosque, or fear of an oppressive ruler and whatever is besides that then there is no excuse for you.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Congregational payer in the mosque is an obligation upon the sane, adult males who are able to attend. This is the most correct saying of the scholars.</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A blind man came to the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) and said: “O Messenger of Allah! I have no one to guide me to the mosque.” He, therefore, sought his permission to perform <em>Salat</em> (prayer) in his house. He (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) granted him permission. When the man turned away, he called him back, and said, “Do you hear the <em>Adhan</em> (call to prayer)?” He replied in the affirmative. The Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) then directed him to respond to it.</span></p>
<p>[Muslim]. <a title="[Riyad-us-Saliheen] The Excellence of Performing Salat (Prayers) in Congregation" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/04/riyad-us-saliheen-imaam-nawawi-chapter-191/">[The Excellence of Performing Salat (Prayers) in Congregation</a> – Riyadh ul saaliheen]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas’ood (<em>radiAllaahu anhu</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Whoever would be happy to meet Allaah tomorrow as a Muslim, then let him preserve (in establishing) these five prayers from the place where they are called from (i.e. masjids), for verily, Allaah has legislated for your Prophet the ways of guidance. And indeed these (five prayers in the masjid) are from the ways of guidance. And if you were to pray in your homes as this man who refrains (to pray in the masjid) prays in his home, then you would have abandoned the Sunnah of your Prophet. And if you were to abandon the Sunnah of your Prophet (s<em>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>) you would go astray. There is not a man that performs the ablution and does it well, then sets out to go to one of these masjids except that Allaah records a good deed for him for every step he takes and raises him up one level and erases one evil deed due to it. You have certainly seen us, and no one would refrain from the prayer (in the masjid) except the hypocrite whose hypocrisy was well known. And indeed a man would be brought supported by two men until he was made to stand in the row (for prayer).”</span></p>

<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The greeting of salaam is to be given to all of Allah’s worshippers.</strong></span></p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“When Allah created Adam (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>), He said to him: `Go and greet that company of angels who are sitting there – and then listen to what they are going to say in reply to your greetings because that will be your greeting and your off-spring’s.’ Adam (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to the angels: `<em>As-Salamu `Alaikum</em> (may you be safe from evil).’ They replied:<em> `As-Salamu `Alaikum wa Rahmatullah</em> (may you be safe from evil, and Mercy of Allah be upon you).’ Thus adding in reply to him: `<em>wa Rahmatullah</em> (and Mercy of Allah)’ to his greeting.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p>Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Enter not houses other than your own, until you have asked permission and greeted those in them.</span>” (24:27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">But when you enter the houses, greet one another with a greeting from Allah (i.e., say: As-Salamu `alaikum – peace be on you), blessed and good</span>.” (24:61)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">When you are greeted with a greeting, greet in return with what is better than it, or (at least) return it equally</span>.” (4:86)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">Has the story reached you, of the honoured guests [three angels; Jibril (Gabriel) along with another two] of Ibrahim (Abraham)? When they came in to him, and said, `Salam (peace be upon you)!’ He answered: `Salam (peace be upon you).</span>”’ (51:24,25)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever amongst you sees an evil, he must change it with his hand; if he is  unable to do so, then with his tongue; and if he is unable to do so, then with his heart; and that is the weakest form of Faith”.</strong></span> [Muslim].</p>
<p>Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Let there arise out of you a group of people inviting to all that is good (Islam), enjoining <em>Al-Ma`ruf</em> (i.e., Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do) and forbidding <em>Al-Munkar</em> (polytheism and disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden). And it is they who are the successful.”</span> (3:104)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“You (true believers in Islamic Monotheism, and real followers of Prophet Muhammad (s<em>allallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) and his Sunnah) are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind; you enjoin <em>Al-Ma`ruf</em> (i.e., Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam has ordained) and forbid<em> Al-Munkar</em> (polytheism, disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden)”.</span> (3:110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“The believers, men and women, are Auliya’ (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) <em>Al-Ma`ruf</em> (i.e., Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do), and forbid (people) from <em>Al-Munkar</em> (i.e., polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden)”.</span> (9:71)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The hypocrites, men and women, are from one another, they enjoin (on the people) <em>Al-Munkar</em> (i.e. disbelief and polytheism of all kinds and all that Islam has forbidden), and forbid (people) from <em>Al-Ma&#8217;ruf</em> (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do), and they close their hands [from giving (spending in Allah&#8217;s Cause) alms, etc.]. They have forgotten Allah, so He has forgotten them. Verily, the hypocrites are the <em>Fasiqun</em> (rebellious, disobedient to Allah).</span> (9:67)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O my son! <em>Aqim-is-Salat</em> (perform <em>As-Salat</em>), enjoin (people) for <em>Al-Ma&#8217;ruf</em> (Islamic Monotheism and all that is good), and forbid (people) from <em>Al-Munkar</em> (i.e. disbelief in the Oneness of Allah, polytheism of all kinds and all that is evil and bad), and bear with patience whatever befall you. Verily! These are some of the important commandments ordered by Allah with no exemption.</span> (Surah Luqman 31:17)</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 73 : Point 123</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Means of earning whose correctness is clear to you are permissible, except for that whose corruptness become apparent. If it is corrupt, then he takes from that which is corrupt, the amount that is sufficient to sustain himself and (he) should not say, “<em>I shall abandon all earnings and just take what people will give to me</em>.” The Companions didn&#8217;t do this, nor the scholars up to this time of ours. ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (radiallaahu anhu) said, “<em>Earnings of which a part is from a lowly source are  better than being in need of the people</em>” </strong>[1].</span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 73 : Point 122</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Know, May Allah have mercy upon you! that the wealth of a Muslim is not permissible to take except for that which he gives willingly </strong>[1]<strong>. If a man has some wealth that was illegally acquired, then he is responsible for it. It is not permissible for anyone to take any thing from him, except with his permission.

<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>To withhold regarding the fighting between ‘Ali and Mu’aawiyah, ‘Aaishah, Talhah and az-Zubayr. May Allah have mercy upon them all and upon those who are with them. Do not dispute concerning them, and consign their affair to Allah, the Exalted and Most High, for Allah&#8217;s Messenger  (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said, “Beware of speaking about my Companions and my in-laws” </strong></span>[1]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong> and his saying, “Allah, the Exalted and the Most High, looked upon the people who fought at Badr and said: Do whatever you wish, for I have forgiven you” </strong></span>[2].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] The hadeeth with this wording is not authentic. However, what is authentic is the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed (<em>radiallaahu anhu</em>), who reports that the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Do not abuse my Companions for, if any of you were to spend gold equal to Uhud in charity, it would not equal a handful of one of them or even half of that</strong></span>.”</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 69 : Point 116</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Beware of looking into rhetorical theology (<em>kalaam</em>) and sitting with the people of rhetorical theology (<em>kalaam)</em> </strong></span>[1].</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] It is reported that Imaam ash-Shaafi’ee (<em>rahimahullah</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“My ruling regarding the people of theological rhetoric is that they should be beaten with palm branches and shoes and led around the markets an it (should) be said: This is the punishment of those who have abandoned the Book and the Sunnah and taken to theological rhetoric.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by al-Baghaawee in<em> Sharh as-Sunnah</em> (1/218).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said,</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 69 : Point 115</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Look into the stars sparingly, just enough to help you to know the times of the prayer. And turn away from whatever besides that, since it invites to apostasy </strong></span></p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani: The Prophet (ﷺ) led us in the Fajr prayer at Hudaibiya after a rainy night. On completion of the prayer, he faced the people and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Do you know what your Lord has said (revealed)?</strong></span>&#8221; The people replied, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Allah has said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8216;In this morning some of my slaves remained as true believers and some became non-believers; whoever said that the rain was due to the Blessings and the Mercy of Allah had belief in Me and he disbelieves in the stars, and whoever said that it rained because of a particular star had no belief in Me but believes in that star.&#8217; &#8220;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Bukhari] [Muhsin Khan&#8217;s Translation]</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qatadah (<em>radi Allaahu anhu</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>&#8220;These stars were only created for three purposes: Allah created them as adornment for the heaven </strong>(sky)<strong>, as missiles for the devils and as signs for navigation. Therefore, whoever seeks to interpret any other meanings for them other than these, then verily he has spoken with his own opinion, he has lost his portion and burdened himself with that which he has no knowledge of.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim both recorded this statement.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><b>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 68 : Point 114</b><br />
<b>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</b></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <i>rahimahullaah</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b style="color:#993300;">When discord (</b><b style="color:#993300;"><i>al-fitnah</i></b><b style="color:#993300;">) occurs, then remain within your house </b></span>[1]<span style="color:#993300;"><b style="color:#993300;"> and flee from proximity of discord (</b><b style="color:#993300;"><i style="color:#993300;font-weight:bold;">fitnah)</i></b><b style="color:#993300;">. And beware of </b><i><b style="color:#993300;">asabiyyah</b></i><b style="color:#993300;"> (bigoted fanaticism) and all fighting that </b><span style="color:#993300;"><b>occurs</b></span><b style="color:#993300;"> between the Muslims for this worldly life, then it is discord (</b><i style="color:#993300;font-weight:bold;">fitnah</i><b style="color:#993300;">). So fear and be dutiful to Allah, He Who is Alone, having no partner. And do not go out in it, and do not fight in it, do not fall into it, do not take sides, and do not incline towards one side and do not love anything from their affairs, since it is said, “</b><b style="color:#993300;"><i>He who loves the actions of a people, </i></b><span style="color:#993300;"><i><b>whether</b></i></span><i><b style="color:#993300;"> they are good or bad, will be just like the one who did them</b></i><b style="color:#993300;">.” May Allah guide us and you to those things that are pleasing to Him and keep us and you away from the acts of disobedience to Him.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><b>NOTES</b></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">[1] Ibn az-Zubayr (<i>radi Allaahu anhu</i>) narrates: My close friend, Abul-Qaasim (<i>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</i>) advised me,</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">“<span style="color:#808000;"><b>If you reach anything of the tumult (</b><b><i>fitnah</i></b><b>), go to Uhud and blunt your sword upon it, then remain in your house</b></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Reported by Ahmad in al-Musnad (4/226 and 5/69). Its <i>isnaad</i> is <i>hasan</i>, as has been mentioned by Shaikh al-Albaanee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) in as-Saheehah (3/no.1373).</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 67 : Point 113 (Part C)</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Whoever allows anything contrary to what occurs in this book, then he is not practicing Allah’s religion and he has rejected all of it, just as if a servant were to believe in everything that Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, said, except that he doubted about a single letter, then he has rejected everything that Allah,the Most High, said and he would be disbeliever, just as the testification that ‘<span style="color:#800000;"><em>None has the right to be worshipped except Allah</em></span>’ will not be accepted from a person unless it is accompanied by true and sincere  intention  and by complete certainty.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Likewise Allah will not accept anything from the Sunnah from one who rejects a part of it. So whoever rejects anything from the Sunnah then he has rejected the whole of the Sunnah. So it is upon you to accept, leave aside contending and disputing; it is not from Allah’s religion at all. And your time, in particular, is a time of evil, so fear and be dutiful to Allah.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 66 : Point 113 (Part B)</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>.. So fear and be dutiful to Allah, O servant of Allah! And upon you is to affirm, to submit, to surrender to and to be pleased with what is contained in this book. Do not hide this book from any one from the people of the <em>Qiblah</em>. Perhaps, by means of it, Allah may bring a confused person back from his state of confusion, or  a person of innovation back from his  innovation, or one astray back from his misguidance so that he is saved through it. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So fear and be dutiful to Allah and adhere to the original old affair. And it is what I have described to you in this book. May Allah have mercy upon a servant, and may be mercy on his parents who reads this book, distributes it, acts upon it, calls to it and uses it as a proof for it is the religion of Allah </strong></span>[1] <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>and  the religion of Allah’s Messenger (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] The Religion of Allah, as is well known, is the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (<em>sallallaahu alihi wa sallam</em>) as understood by the Pious Predecessors. As for the speech of people, everyone is correct in some things and incorrect in others, except for the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alihi wa sallam</em>).</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Foundations of the Innovated Sects are Four</span><br />
Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 64 : Point 110</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b style="color:#993300;">Know that the roots of innovations (</b><em style="color:#993300;font-weight:bold;">Al-Bid&#8217;ah</em><b style="color:#993300;">) are four. From these seventy-two innovated sects branch off, each one of these have offshoots until they amount to two thousand eight hundred. All of them are misguidance. And all of them will be in the Fire except for one, which is those who believe in what is contained in this book, and who holds it as his creed, without having any </b><span style="color:#993300;"><b>uncertainty</b></span><b style="color:#993300;"> in his heart or any doubts. He will be a person of the Sunnah and he is the one who will be saved, if Allah wills </b></span>[1].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] That is, whatever the book comprises of, from the sayings of Allah, the words of His Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) and that which the Companions were united upon.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 63 : Point 108</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Know that the ancient religion is how it was from the death of the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) until the murder of ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan (<em>radiallaahu anhu</em>). His murder was the start of splitting and the start of disagreements. So the Ummah fought amongst itself, split, followed greed and desires and inclined towards this world. There is no permit for anyone to do anything which has been introduced, which the Companions of Allah’s Messenger (<em>sallallaahualaihi wa sallam</em>) were not upon, nor for any man to call to anything innovated before him by people of innovation; he would then be just like the one who innovated it. So anyone who claims that, or speaks according to it, has rejected the Sunnah, opposed the truth and the <em>Jamaa’ah</em> and has made innovation lawful. He is more harmful to the Ummah than Iblees</span> [1].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Al-Laalikaa’ee reports in <em>as-Sunnah</em> (no.238) that Sufyaan ath-Thawree said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Innovation is more beloved to Iblees than sin. A sin may be repented from, but innovation is not repented from.”</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 62 : Point 107</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>He who limits himself to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa salam</em>) and that which his Companions and the Jamaa’ah were upon is successful and triumphs over all the people of innovation and his body is relaxed and his religion is safe, if Allah wills, since the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said, “<span style="color:#800000;">My Ummah will split…</span>” and the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) told us which would be the saved sect, saying, “<span style="color:#800000;">That which I and my Companions are upon</span>” </strong></span>[1]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>. This is the cure, the explanation, the clear affair and the straight and distinct road. The Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said, “Beware of going to extremes and harshness. Beware of exaggeration and cling to the ancient religion” </strong></span>[2].</p>
<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Reported by at-Tirmidhee (no.2643) and others and it is hasan, as has preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] This is not a hadeeth of the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>), but is a saying of Ibn Mas’ood (<em>radiallaahu anhu</em>) as reported by ad-Daarimee in his Sunan (1/50/nos.144. 145), ‘Abdur-Razzaaq in his Musannaf (10/252) and Ibn Nasr in as-Sunnah (no.85) and others and is saheeh as such.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Abbaas (<em>radiallaahu anhu</em>) reports that the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said, <strong>“Beware of exaggeration in the religion for, indeed, those before you were destroyed due to exaggeration in the religion.”</strong> Reported by Ahmad, an-Nasaa’ee and Ibn Maajah and it is saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas’ood (<em>radiallaahu anhu</em>) reports that the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said, <strong>“ Those who go to extremes are destroyed.”</strong> Reported by Ahmad, Muslim and Abu Daawood (Eng. trans. 3/1294/no.4591) and it is saheeh</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 61: Point 105</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><span style="text-align:justify;">Know may Allah have mercy upon you! that whoever speaks about the religion of Allah from his opinion, analogy and interpretation, without proof from the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa’ah</em> , then he has spoken about Allah that which he does not know </span></strong></span>[1].<span style="color:#993300;"><strong><span style="text-align:justify;"> Whoever says about Allah what he does not know is one who has overstepped the bounds (</span><em style="text-align:justify;">Mutakallifeen</em><span style="text-align:justify;">) </span></strong></span>[2].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] In the Book of Allah, speaking about Allah without knowledge is shown to be a form of Shirk. He, the One free from all defects, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: The things that my Lord has forbidden are: shameful deeds, whether open or secret, sins (of all kinds), assigning of partners to Allah for which He has given no authority and saying things about Allah of which you have no knowledge.</strong> </span>[Soorah al-A’raaf (7): 33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Masrooq (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said: We entered upon Abdullah ibn Mas’ood and he said, “O people! Whoever knows something then let him speak according to it. Whoever does not know, let him say, ‘Allah knows best,’ since this, too, is from knowledge, that you say concerning that which you do not know: ‘Allah knows best.’ Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, said to His Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: No reward do I ask of you for this </strong>(Qur’an)<strong>, nor am I a pretender</strong></span>. [Soorah Saad (38): 86]</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 61: Point 104</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Know may Allah have mercy upon you! that knowledge is not in merely narrating a great deal and </strong>(having many)<strong> books. The scholar is the one who follows the Book and the Sunnah, even if his knowledge is limited </strong></span>[1] <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>and </strong>(even if)<strong> he only has a few books. Whoever opposes the Book and the Sunnah is an innovator, even if he narrates much and has many books.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Ash-Shaafi’ee (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said, “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Knowledge is not what is memorized, but what benefits</strong></span>.” Reported in Hilyatul-Awliyaa’ of Abu Nu’aym (9/123).</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 60: Point 103</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Know that there will not cease to be a group of the people of the truth and the Sunnah amongst the people whom Allah will guide and through them</strong> (He will)<strong> guide others and revive the Sunnah through them. They are the ones whom Allah, the Most High, describes, those who are few in the time of controversy. He says:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Only those to whom </strong>(the Scripture)<strong> was given differed concerning it after clear proofs had come to them through hatred one to another </strong></span>[1]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>He singled out these people, saying:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then Allah, by His leave, guided those who believed in the truth concerning that wherein they differed. For Allah guides whom He wills to a straight path </strong></span>[2]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said, </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“There will not cease to be a group of my Ummah uppermost upon the truth. They will not be harmed by those who forsake them, until Allah’s affair comes to pass and they are uppermost.”</strong> </span>[3]</p>
<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>

<p>The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“This knowledge will be carried by the trustworthy ones of every generation. They will expel from it the alterations made by those going beyond bounds, the false claims of the liars and the false interpretations of the ignorant.” </span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 58: Point 101 (Part B)</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>They </strong>(Jahmiyyah)<strong> continued in time and found rulers who were to assist them in this and who subjected those who refused it to the sword or the whip. Knowledge of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa’ah</em> was wiped away and weakened by them so that they became suppressed due to the manifesting of innovation and speech about it and their great number. They established sittings, manifested their opinions, wrote books about them, enticed the people and they sought leadership for them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>It was a very great trial </strong></span>[2]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>. Only those whom Allah protected were saved from it. The slightest that a person would be affected by sitting with them was that he would be caused to doubt about his religion, or to follow them, or to hold their saying to be true,not knowing whether it was the truth of falsehood, so he became one who doubted. So the people were ruined until the time of Ja’far, who was known as al-Mutawakkil </strong></span>[3]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>, through whom Allah extinguished innovation and manifested the truth and the people of the Sunnah. They spoke out, despite their small number and the great number of innovators, right up to this day of ours </strong></span>[4]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>As for their principles and misguidance, some of them have remained acting upon it and calling to it, with none to prevent them from their sayings and actions!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Proclamation was made that everyone had to adhere to the belief of the Mu’tazilah that the Qur’an was created! The scholars were threatened and ordered to agree to this. Those who refused to assent verbally were imprisoned, threatened with death and tortured. Imam Ahmad (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) stood firm, despite months in prison, constantly being brought before those in authority and threatened with death and kept in chains. Eventually, he was lashed severely in public. ‘Alee ibn al-Madeenee said, “<strong>Indeed, Allah aided this religion through Abu Bakr on the Day of Apostasy (<em>riddah</em>) and through Ahmad ibn Hanbal on the day of the trial (<em>mihnah</em>)</strong>.” Reported by adh-Dhahabee in Tadhkiratul-Huffaadh (2/432).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] The ‘Abbaasid caliph, al-Mutawakkil ‘alallaah: Abul-Fadl, Ja’far, son of al-Mu’tasim billaah, al-Qurashee. He died in the year 247 after the Hijrah. May the Mercy of Allah be upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Refer to the letter of Ahmad ibn Hanbal to al-Mutawakkil, mentioned in <em>as-Sunnah</em> of his son, ‘Abdullah, as point number 84.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 58: Point 101 (Part A)</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Some of the scholars, amongst them Ahmad ibn Hanbal, declared the Jahmee to be a disbeliever and not from the people of the Qiblah. His blood is lawful. He does not inherit, neither is inheritance received from him, since he says that <em>there is no Jumu’ah or congregational prayer, no ‘Eid prayer, no charity (Sadaqah)</em> and because they say, “<em>One who does not say the Qur’an is created is a disbeliever</em>.” They allow fighting and killing within the nation of Muhammad (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>). They contradict those who preceded them. They put the people to trial regarding something that neither the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) nor any of his Companions spoke about.</strong></span><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>They desire to empty the Mosques and for the congregations to be neglected. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>They weakened Islam, caused Jihaad to be left and busied themselves with sectarianism. They went against the narrations and spoke up with that which had been abrogated </strong></span>[1]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>. They used verses of uncertain meaning as clear proof and so caused the people to have doubts about their religion. They disputed about their Lord and said, “<em>There is no punishment in the grave, nor any Pond (Hawd), nor any Intercession and Paradise and the Fire have not been created</em>.” They rejected much of what the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said. Those who permit the declaration of their being unbelievers declare them to be so and declare the spilling of their blood to be lawful because of these matters, since whoever rejects a verse from the Book of Allah has rejected the whole Book and whoever rejects a hadeeth from the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) has rejected all of his sayings and is a disbeliever in Allah, the Sublime.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] The Mu’tazilah and the Raafidah denied abrogation (<em>naskh</em>). Before them, the Jews had denied it.</p>

<h3><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Transcript of the Audio:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point Number 101</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And some of the scholars; amongst them Imaam A<u>h</u>mad ibn <u>H</u>anbal said: ‘The <em>Jahmee</em> is a disbeliever, he is not from the people of the <em>Qiblah</em>, his blood can be lawfully shed, he does not inherit nor is inheritance received from him. Since he says, “There is no <em>Jum`ah</em> prayer, no congregational prayer, no <em>`Eid</em> prayers and no charity.” And they said, “Whoever does not say that the Qur·aan is something created then he is a disbeliever.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“The saying of the scholars: “The <em>Jahmee</em> is a disbeliever, he is not from the people of the Qiblah,”</strong> meaning <em>Kaafir</em>; he is a disbeliever on account of his blind sayings because he has negated Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. And there is no doubt that this is the worst of disbelief. Their sayings of disbelief lead to <em>Ta`<u>t</u>eel</em> (total negation), as was said by the Shaykh (the author) and it is denial of the existence of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. And Imaam A<u>h</u>mad <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> has refuted them in his book <em>ar-Radd `alal-Jahmiyyah,</em> and this is printed and verified &#8211; and all praise is for Allaah. And a number of the people have refuted them. Shaykh ul-Islaam refuted them in his huge book <em>Bayaan Talbees al-Jahmiyyah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“He (the Jahmee), his blood is lawful to be shed, he does not inherit not is inheritance taken from him.”</strong> Because he is a <em>Murtad</em> (apostate), so therefore his blood is lawful to be shed because that which renders a person’s blood secure is Islaam whereas the <em>Kaafir</em>; his blood is lawful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Because he says (the Jahmee; the follower of Al-Jahm ibn <u>S</u>afwaan) that, “There is no <em>Jum`ah</em> prayer and there is no <em>Jamaa`ah</em> (congregational) prayer,” </strong>because Al-Jahm denied the <em>Jum`ah</em> prayer and he denied the congregational prayer. All that is sufficient in his view is <em>al-ma`rifatu billaah</em> (a person has awareness of Allaah). So <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) with him is just <em>al-ma`rifah</em> (awareness). So if a person is aware of his Lord in his heart then he becomes a believer; <em>mu·min</em> who is perfect in his <em>eemaan</em> even if he doesn’t pray, even if he doesn’t fast, even if he doesn’t do anything from the acts of worship at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And he said that, “There are no <em>`Eid</em> prayers and no <em><u>S</u>adaqah</em> (charity). </strong>Because he held that deeds are not a part of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) nor its utterance upon the tongue nor is belief either. Rather, <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in his view is near <em>ma`rifah</em> (awareness).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they said, “Whoever does not say that the Qur·aan is something created then he is a disbeliever.” </strong>The <em>Jahmiyyah</em> said, “Whoever doesn’t say that the Qur·aan is created and rather says that the Qur·aan is the speech of Allaah then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) because he has caused Allaah to resemble His creation and <em>Tashbeeh</em> (declaring resemblance to the creation) is <em>kuffar</em> (disbelief).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point Number 101 Continued</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And they permitted use of the sword against the nation of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>! And they contradicted those who came before them, they put the people to trial with something which neither Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> nor anyone from his companions spoke with. They sought for the emptying and abandonment of the mosques and the congregations. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they held as lawful the use of the sword against the nation of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>!” </strong>They permitted killing the Muslims; those who disagreed with them in `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief). And therefore when they gained authority in the time of Al-Ma·moon, what did they do to the Muslims? They killed those of the scholars whom they killed and they tortured those who they tortured in order to try and force them to hold the saying that was the position of the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they contradicted whoever came before them,”</strong> from the Muslims. So these sayings did not appear except from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“they put the people to trial with something which Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> did not speak with.” </strong>They wanted to force the people to accept their saying as occurred in the time of Al-Ma·moon and those who came after him when they tried to force the people to accept the saying that the Qur·aan is created.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they wanted to empty out the mosques and the congregations. </strong>Because their position with regard to <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) is that it is merely awareness, even if the person does not do any action, even if he does not speak with his tongue, even if he does not hold belief in his heart. So therefore, there would be no need for the mosques and the congregations because the prayer is not obligatory in their view.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point Number 101 Continued</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And they weakened Islaam, caused <em>Jihaad</em> to be left and busied themselves with causing separation, they contradicted the narrations and they spoke with that which had been abrogated, they utilised unclear text as proof and they caused the people to have doubts about their religion. And they disputed regarding their Lord and they said: “There is no punishment in the graves nor any great reservoir; <em>al-<u>H</u>aw<u>d</u></em> nor any intercession; <em>shafaa`ah;</em> and that Paradise and the Fire have not yet been created.” And they denied much of that which Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said. So therefore, those who permitted that they be declared disbelievers declared that their blood may be lawfully shed from this aspect. Since whoever rejects a single <em>aayah</em> from the Book of Allaah then he has rejected the whole of the Book and whoever rejects a single <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> then he has rejected all of the narrations. And he is a disbeliever in Allaah, the Sublime.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And they caused weakness in Islaam,” </strong>meaning, the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> weakened Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they caused <em>Jihaad</em> to be left,” </strong>they left off Jihaad in the cause of Allaah because they do not hold that disbelievers are to be declared disbelievers because they have awareness of Allaah. And this means that Fir`awn was a Muslim then because he had awareness of Allaah in his heart. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And in the context of what Musa <em>`alayhissalaam</em> said to Fir`awn when he went to call him to the truth that he said to him: “You indeed know that no-one has sent these signs except the Lord of the heavens and the earth&#8230;” </strong>(Sooratul-Israa· (17), <em>aayah </em>102)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he had awareness of Allaah in his heart. And the people of <em>shirk</em>; the <em>mushrikoon</em> in the time of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>; they had awareness of Allaah in their hearts. Indeed they used to worship Him with different types of acts of worship so they believed that Allaah &#8211; the Perfect &#8211; is the Lord and that He deserves worship. However, they associated others in worship along with Him claiming that those others besides Him will draw them closer to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they contradicted the narrations,” </strong>meaning they contradicted the evidences and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they spoke with the abrogated texts,” </strong>they took a hold of evidences that had been abrogated and they do not act upon the text which abrogates in order to misguide just as Allaah, the Majestic and Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>…So as for those in whose hearts there is deviation then they follow that which is unclear from it… </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the <em>Mutashaabih</em>, from that which is unclear on its own is the <em>Mansookh</em>, those texts that have been abrogated because it is necessary for the person to have awareness of the <em>Naasikh</em> and the <em>Mansookh</em> (the text which abrogates and the earlier text which was abrogated). And also <em>al-mu<u>t</u>laq w`al muqayyad</em> (to have awareness of the unrestricted text and the restricted texts) and the <em>khaa<u>s</u></em> and the `<em>aam</em> (the text which has been specified and the general text). He must have awareness of the branches of knowledge for the derivation of evidences. So, he does not use as evidence just any text, which he finds without seeing whether it is something abrogated or whether it is something which has been made specific by something or whether it is something which has been restricted by something; not examining this on account of deviation and in order to misguide the people. And they say that: “We use the Qur·aan as proof.” But they are not actually using the Qur·aan as proof. The Qur·aan is used as proof by those who accept all of it. But as for one who takes just a part of it and leaves the other parts then he is a disbeliever in it. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>…Do you believe in a part of the Book and disbelieve in other parts?&#8230; </strong>(Sooratul Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>85)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person who does not gather between the <em>Muhkam</em> and <em>Mutashaabih</em> (clear and clarifying texts along with the texts, which are unclear) combine the two then this one is taking a part of the Book and leaving a part. And therefore, He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>…Whereas those firmly grounded in knowledge they say: “We believe in it, all of it.” … </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say: “<em>Kullun</em>” (All of it); meaning the <em>Muhkam</em> (those texts which are clear and clarified) and the <em>Mutashaabih</em> (that which is not immediately clear with regard to its meaning).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>…They say: “All of it is from our Lord”… </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, therefore, they refer the <em>Mutashaabih</em> (those texts, which are unclear) to the <em>Muhkam</em> (to that text, which is clear and clarifies it) so therefore, it explains it and clarifies it. However, this requires a scholar; `<em>aalim</em>. It is not permissible for a pretender to knowledge to enter into it or a person who is a deviant intending to misguide. So, the <em>Mutashaabih</em> (the text, which is unclear) will not be taken hold of except by 1 of 2 kinds of men; either one who is <em>zaa·igh</em> (deviant) and intends to misguide like the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>. And therefore, Imaam A<u>h</u>mad said about them: “They use as evidence that which is unclear from the Qur·aan.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the second type of person who uses the <em>Mutashaabih</em> (those aayahs, which are not on their own clear with regard to their meaning) or otherwise a <em>Muta`aalim</em> (a false pretender to knowledge who doesn’t realise and speaks about Allaah without knowledge.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they used unclear texts as proof,” </strong>and therefore, Imaam A<u>h</u>mad refuted them in his book <em>ar-Radd `alal-Jahmiyyah</em>. He brought the texts which they use as evidence, and he refuted their opinion about them, and he made clear the correct understanding of those texts and he harmonised between the <em>aayahs</em> and <em>a<u>h</u>aadeeth</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“so they caused the people to have doubts about their religion.”</strong> So there is no doubt that this is confusion in thoughts and ideas. So, it is not permissible to speak about matters of knowledge and especially matters of <em>`aqaa·id</em> (creed and beliefs) except one who firmly grounded in knowledge. It’s not permissible for them to be spoken about by half students or by false claimants to knowledge not to mention by people of deviation and misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they disputed concerning their Lord,” </strong>they innovated <em>al-jadal</em> (newly brought about argumentation, religious debating). He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>No-one disputes about the signs (<em>aayaat</em>) of Allaah except for those who disbelieve. So do not let their travelling about upon the land deceive you. </strong>(Soorah Ghaafir (40), <em>aayah </em>4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The believer does not dispute about the <em>aayaat</em> of Allaah. Rather, he accepts them and he believes, he holds as his belief that they are the speech of Allaah and that they are good and guidance. But as for the person who just withholds about them and raises doubts then this is one who disputes about the speech of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they said there is no punishment of the grave,” </strong>This fully confirms with their <em>madhhab</em> because in their view whoever has awareness of Allaah then he is a believer of it and it is not necessary that he has to pray and fast and perform <em>Hajj</em> and perform `<em>Umrah</em> nor carry out the deeds. And based upon this there will be no punishment in the grave because all of mankind have awareness of Allaah and therefore, there is no sin and obedience so those who are in the graves all have awareness of Allaah. So therefore, they will not be punished.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they said there is no <em><u>H</u>aw<u>d</u></em> (Great Reservoir) nor any <em>shafaa`ah</em> (intercession),” </strong>All of the affairs of the hidden and the unseen; <em>ghaib</em>, they denied them because they place reliance upon their intellects alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they said the Paradise and the Fire have not yet been created.” </strong>Meaning the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> said the Paradise and the Fire have not yet been created despite the fact that Allaah has informed that they are already created. He, the Most High said with regard to Paradise:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Paradise has already been prepared for the <em>Muttaqeen</em> (People of <em>Taqwa</em>; those who are dutiful to Allaah). </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>133)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Aw-Iddat</em> (already prepared); it shows that it’s already been prepared and is present and He said with regard to the Fire:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It has already been prepared for the disbelievers. </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>131)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also, the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed that the severe heat in the summer is from the breathing out of the Hellfire and this indicates that it is present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, the fire has 2 breaths; a breathing in, in the winter and that is the severest cold that you find and it has a breath (breathing out) in the summer time and that is the severest heat that you find. The saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“The severest summer heat is from the breathing out of the Hellfire.”</em></strong><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><strong>[3]</strong></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they denied much of that which was said by Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.” </strong>They denied much of that which occurs in the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> because it contradicts their opinion and what they believe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So those who held it lawful to declare them as disbelievers declared their blood lawful to shed from this aspect.” </strong>Those of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em> who declared them to be disbelievers; that he declared them to be disbelievers on account of all of these filthy sayings gathered because they result in there not being any religion left.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Because whoever rejects a single <em>aayah</em> from the Book of Allaah then he has rejected the whole of the Book,” </strong>As has preceded that whoever takes as proof part of the Qur·aan; believes in other parts so regarding some he tends to cling onto it then he has believed only in a part of the Book and he has left the other part. So a person who uses as proof that which is unclear (the <em>Mutashaabih</em>) and leaves aside the <em>Muhkam</em> (that which is clear and clarified) then he is from those who believe in a part of the Book and reject other parts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and whoever rejects a <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> then he has rejected all of the narrations.” </strong>Likewise, the <em>Sunnah</em> contains that which is <em>Muhkam</em> (clear and clarified) and it contains that which is <em>Mutashaabih</em> (that which on its own is unclear). So whoever takes that which is unclear from the <em>Sunnah</em> and leaves off the <em>Muhkam</em> (that which is clear and clarified) then he has rejected all of the <em>Sunnah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And he is a disbeliever in Allaah, the Sublime.” </strong>This is the result and Allaah’s refuge is sought because the one who truly believes in Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The true believer says, “We have <em>eemaan</em> in all of it, we believe in it. All of it is from our Lord.” </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the person of deviation then he takes that which is <em>Mutashaabih</em> (unclear) because it is more fitting for his purpose. And as for the <em>Muhkam</em> (that which is clear, clarifies) then it does not suit his purpose so he leaves it. This is the way of people of the desires, the way of the deviated sects always and it is not specific to the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>. However, its origin was from the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>. However, the people of the deviated sects, all of them in every time, this is their way. They take hold of those proofs, only the ones that will conform to their desires and they leave whatever conflicts with their desires. <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>

So, the <em>Jahmiyyah </em>and the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> and the <em>Raafidah</em> and before them the Jews denied there being any abrogation and they said; “Abrogation does not occur, neither in the Qur·aan nor in the <em>Sunnah</em> and the <em>Salaf</em> have refuted them.`</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> A point that’s brought by some of the explainers, they mention Ibn al-Qayyim with regard to the declaration of the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>; the disbelievers, Imaam ibn al-Qayyim said in his famous poem; An-Nooniyyah that the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> were declared to be disbelievers by 500 scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong><em><u> h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said on this point with regard to the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> is a disbeliever; “this saying where the author mentioned at great length then in summary it is that he passed the judgement that the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> are disbelievers and there is no doubt of the disbelief of the first <em>Jahmiyyah</em>; those who founded it, the initial <em>Jahmiyyah</em> but as for the second (later <em>Jahmiyyah</em>) who had developed into the saying of the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> then those people no-one from the <em>Salaf</em> declared them to be disbelievers. So the speech of the author is not to be taken unrestrictedly. And then he intended here that the affair itself is disbelief. So as for one who is upon it; a particular individual then he is to be examined. Have the conditions meaning declaring him to be <em>kaafir</em> been fulfilled and have any preventing factors been removed or not? So if the conditions for him to be declared a disbeliever are present and any preventing factor is absent then the judgement will be passed upon anyone who denies anything that the author has already mentioned here or who rejects anything from the texts, he will be judged to be a disbeliever if the proof is established upon him; conditions for declaring him so are present and preventing factors are absent.” And then he mentioned the issue with regard to the individual as well-that detail is necessary, Allaahu A`lam.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 57: Point 100</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that the ruin of the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> was that they pondered about the Lord, the Mighty and Majestic. They introduced &#8216;Why?&#8217; and &#8216;How?&#8217;. They abandoned the narrations. And they applied analogy , they weighed the religion according to their opinion. So they came with disbelief openly .They disbelieved and declared the rest of the people to be disbelievers. And the affair led them necessarily to stating <em>Ta&#8217;teel</em> (outright negation).</strong></span></p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And know that the ruin of the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> came about because they pondered about the Lord, the Mighty and Majestic,” </strong>the reason which caused the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> to become misguided to this great extent of misguidance is that they entered into the affair of the Lord, they began searching into it. So it is not permissible for the Muslim to search into the matter of the Lord. Rather, what is upon him is to have eemaan in Him and His Names and in His Attributes and not to enter into the <em>kayfiyyah</em> (how). Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, no-one knows about His Self and about how His Names and Attributes are except for Him, He, the Perfect. He, the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِهِ عِلْمًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah knows whatever is before them and whatever is behind them and they do not encompass Him with Knowledge.</span> </strong>(Soorah-<u>T</u>aa Haa (20), <em>aayah </em>110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, no-one can encompass Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic; He is the one who knows best about Himself and about other than Himself. So, therefore, we do not speak about the affair of Allaah except for that about which there is a proof from the <em>Qur·aan</em> and the Sunnah. And we withhold from whatever does not occur; whatever is not reported.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Jahmiyyah</em> denied the <em>Qur·aan</em> and the <em>Sunnah</em> and they entered with their intellects into the affair of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High to the extent that they said that: ‘<em>He is not within the Universe nor is He outside the Universe, He is not above nor is He beneath, He is not to the right nor is He to the left.</em>’ Therefore, He would not exist then &#8211; Highly Exalted is Allaah above what they say. They said: ‘<em>He does not have hearing, He doesn’t hear and He doesn’t see and He doesn’t have knowledge and He doesn’t have will</em>.’ Therefore, He would be inanimate; non-living thing because an inanimate object is that which is described with these characteristics. So He would in that case be like the idols &#8211; Highly Exalted is Allaah above that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“They imagined and made analogies with regard to the religion based upon their own opinion,” </strong>They followed false analogy, they drew analogy between Allaah and His creation and therefore they denied His Names and His Attributes because in their view they necessitated resemblance. And they did not know that the Names of Allaah and His Attributes are particular to Him, He the Perfect and that the names of the created being and the attributes of the created being are specific to them and there is no resemblance between this and that. So, just as Allaah has a self, which does not resemble the selves of creation then likewise He has Names and Attributes, which do not resemble the names and attributes with the created being. Whoever takes hold of this will be at ease and proceed upon the correct way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So they came with disbelief openly, it was not hidden.” </strong>They disbelieved in Allaah on account of these ugly sayings concerning Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So they disbelieved and they declared the rest of the creation to be disbelievers.” </strong>They declared as disbelievers those people who describe Allaah with His Names and His Attributes because they say they are <em>mushabbihah</em> (they are ones who claim that Allaah resembles His creation) and <em>tashbeeh</em> (declaring the creator resembles the creation) is disbelief; <em>kufr</em>. So we say no, this is not <em>tashbeeh</em> (resemblance). Allaah the Majestic and Most High, He, the Perfect has said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ ۖ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Allaah and He is the All Hearing, the All Seeing.</span> </strong>(Sooratus-Shooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, He negated from Himself <em>tashbeeh</em> (resemblance) and yet He affirmed for Himself Hearing and Seeing even though hearing and seeing are present amongst the created beings. So this shows that this does not resemble that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>&#8220;And the affair unnecessarily led them to stating total negation.” </strong><em>At-Ta`<u>t</u>eel</em> is to deny the Creator, the Perfect and Most High. Because this leads to negation because one who does not hear and he does not see and he does not speak and has no will and has no wish and also is not inside the Universe nor is he outside the Universe and is not above and is not below. Therefore, there was no God who is worshipped in existence at all. So the affair ended up for them with apostasy and total negation.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side-point</strong>: If you read the story of Jahm ibn Safwaan exactly what happened to him. They say he debated with some people who doubted his Lord and he ended up doubting that they had a Lord so he even abandoned the prayer for a period of 40 days or something. They confused him so much with regard to his Creator, who are you going to pray to then? So the Shaykh said they refer the affair of Jahm and the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>, that’s what it lead to, it leads to this; <em>Ta`<u>t</u>eel</em> (negation of the Creator) altogether; denial of the Creator.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 57: Point 99</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Know that whoever says : &#8220;<em>My recital of the Qur&#8217;an is created</em>&#8221; then he is a Jahmi. And whoever remains silent and will neither say it is created nor it is not created then he is a Jahmi. This was the saying of the Ahmad bin Hanbal. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) said: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>&#8220;Whoever amongst you lives long will see great controversy, so beware of the newly introduced affairs for they are misguided.

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/whoever-saysmy-recital-of-the-quran-is-created-then-he-is-a-jahmi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah affirmed speech; <em>al-Kalaam</em> for Himself in many <em>aayahs</em>, from them is the saying; He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُل لَّوْ كَانَ الْبَحْرُ مِدَادًا لِّكَلِمَاتِ رَبِّي لَنَفِدَ الْبَحْرُ قَبْلَ أَن تَنفَدَ كَلِمَاتُ رَبِّي وَلَوْ جِئْنَا بِمِثْلِهِ مَدَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “If the water of the ocean were ink to write down the words of My Lord then the ocean would be exhausted before the words of My Lord were finished&#8230;”</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Kahf (18), <em>aayah</em> 109)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, the words of Allaah with which He commands and forbids and manages the creation with. Who can then enumerate the words of Allaah, He, the Perfect and Most High? They could not be written down by the oceans nor by all of the pens.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the speech of Allaah, the <em>Kalaam</em> is as said by the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“With respect to its type; eternal, with respect to its individual instances, it newly comes about.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Qadeemun-Nau`</em> means that Allaah, the Most High has always had the attribute of speech. However, with regard to individual instances, for example, Allaah, the Most High speaking to Aadam or Allaah, the Most High speaking to Moosaa <em>`alayhissalaam</em> or Allaah, the Most High speaking to Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> or speaking to Jibreel with the <em>Qur·aan</em> then these individual instances of the speech of Allaah; they newly occur.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the <em>Qur</em>·<em>aan</em> is from the newly occurring instances of the speech of Allaah and some individual instances of the speech of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the speech of Allaah is confirmed by the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.</em> And there is no doubt that sound intellect affirms speech for Allaah because it is <em><u>S</u>ifatul Kamaal</em> (hidden attribute of perfection) and negation of it is an attribute of deficiency.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> and they are the followers of Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan who was a foul person who appeared amongst the people and tried to cause them to doubt about the religion of Allaah and he commanded them with apostasy and disbelief. And from that is that he tried to cause them to doubt about the fact that Allaah speaks and he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The speech of Allaah which is present is something created; <em>makhlooq</em>. He created it in the Preserved Tablet or He created it in Jibreel or He created it in Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So it is therefore just an ascription of a created thing to its creator just like saying <em>Baitullaah</em> (the House of Allaah) or <em>Naaqatullaah</em> (the she camel of Allaah).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what he said  ̶ may Allaah disfigure him. He said Allaah does not speak and the ascription of speech to Him is just an ascription of a created thing to its Creator. This is from his <em>mathhab</em> (position). And he also had the position of <em>Al</em>&#8211;<em>Jabr</em> with regard to <em>Qadr</em> (predecree); that people are compelled to do their deeds, no free will. And he had the position of with regard to denying the names and attributes and he also had a position with regard to denying the Sunnah of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and denying the <em>Qur·aan</em> also. So he was a filthy apostate who appeared with the likes of this falsehood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this <em>mathhab</em> was derived from the Jews as was mentioned by Shaykh-ul-Islaam Ibnu Taymiyyah in the introduction to <em>Al-Hamawiyyah</em>. And Al-Jahm, he was not the one who began this <em>mathhab</em>. Before him, there was Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham; he is the one who initiated this repulsive saying. And he took it from <u>T</u>aaloot; the Jew and <u>T</u>aaloot took it from Labeed ibn al-`A`a<u>s</u>am, the Jew who did sorcery upon the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this saying is derived from the Jews, those who distort the speech of Allaah, away from its correct meaning, so this foul <em>mathhab</em> should not be considered something inexplicable when its source is known that it is from the Jews. They infiltrated it amongst the Muslims by means of this foul man Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham, the one who was killed by Khaalid al-Qasree on the Day of <em>Eid ul-A<u>d</u>haa</em> as Ibn-ul Qayyim mentioned.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span style="color:#ff0000;">[1]</span></a> So therefore Ibn-ul Qayyim said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>And on account of that, Khaalid Al–Qasree slaughtered </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>Ja`ad on the Day of the Sacrifice </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>Since he said Ibraaheem was not Allaah’s chosen beloved one</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>No, and nor was Moosaa one who He spoke to and drew close </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>So every person of Sunnah is thanked for that sacrifice</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808080;">What an excellent thing Allaah has brought about through the sacrifice of this brother</span> </em><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span style="color:#ff0000;">[2]</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This saying was taken from him by Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan and it became ascribed to him because he is the one who propagated it but he is not the one who initiated it.<span style="color:#ff0000;"><a style="color:#ff0000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the people of the Sunnah rebuked and criticized them severely (the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>). And they spoke sternly in that regard and this will follow inshaaAllaah, the part that comes after. However, with us now we have a part of this foul <em>mathhab</em>, which is negation of speech for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, a problem arose with the People of the <em>Sunnah</em>, should it be said, “My recital of the <em>Qur</em>·<em>aan</em> is created or is not created?” This is something which they introduced also amongst the Muslims. So should you say: “My recital of the <em>Qur·aan</em> is created or should you say my recital of the <em>Qur·aan</em> is not created or should you <em>tatawaqqaf</em> (withhold)? And say if what you mean is what is recited, that which is recited, then it is the speech of Allaah, it is not created. And if what is meant is a person’s own particular recital of the <em>Qur·aan</em> then his own recital is a created thing and his voice is created. So therefore it must be mentioned with detail and it must be given then with detail.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is the detail, which was stated by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad and Al-Bukhaariyy and a group of the verifiers. So do not say: my recital of the <em>Qur·aan</em> is created unrestricted and do not say it’s not created unrestrictedly and do not withhold. Rather, mention the answer with detail that <span style="color:#333399;">if what you mean is what I’m reciting then that is the speech of Allaah, that is not created or if what is meant is the person’s own particular recitation, his own particular voice then that is created. That is the detail</span>. <span style="color:#ff0000;"><a style="color:#ff0000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator’s side-point: And he quotes three famous lines from the Nooniyyah of Ibn-ul Qayyim, poem on `<em>aqeedah</em>, each line ending in <em>noon</em>, concerning this event that this man Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham that he was killed by Khaalid Al-Qasree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Translator’s side-point: They mention this happened around the year 118 AH in Kufa that Khaalid Al-Qasree who was the governor in Iraq at that time that he slaughtered this evil person Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Translator’s side-point: Some of the people of Knowledge mention is that this saying that we heard was taken by Jahm from Al-Ja`ad and he took it from Taaloot and he took it from Labeed. Then this Labeed ibn al-`A`a<u>s</u>am was a Jew. As we heard he did sorcery upon the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his saying was taken from him by Taaloot; the Jew and from him, his student Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham took this saying, the saying of the Jahmiyyah. And from Al-Ja`ad was taken by his student Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan and each was executed. We saw Al-Ja`ad being executed here and likewise Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan, he was killed as well; his student but before that, each time before the person was executed or killed, he had a famous student who took the saying from him. So, Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan, this saying was taken from him by Bishr al-Marisee and then he, Bishr al-Marisee, he taught this to A<u>h</u>mad ibn Abee Du`aad, the one who was at the head of those who tortured Imaam A<u>h</u>mad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And just briefly with regard to the event; before the event that Khalid al-Qasree slaughtered Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham on the Day of Sacrifices. He gave a <em>khutbah</em> to the people on the `<em>Eid</em> and he said: May Allaah accept your sacrifices for indeed I am going to sacrifice Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham and he came down and he slaughtered Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Shaykh al-Albaaniyy said with regard to this report: “There’s some speech from the scholars, is it established or not? This is reported by a number of the scholars in their books Ad-Daarimee in <em>Ar-Radd `alal-Jahmiyyah</em> and Al-Bukhaariyy in his book <em>Khalq Af`alul-`Ibaad</em> and other books as well. Then Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy in <em>Mukhta<u>s</u>ar al-`Uluw</em>, Ath-Thahabee’s book <em>Al `Uluw</em>, the originate of it, Shaykh al-Albaaniyy comments, he mentions that the first chain of narration for this that there is weakness in it, there is unknown people in the chain. But then he said, however, the narration that comes after it, another narration with a different chain is better than it and perhaps therefore that is why the scholars state that this story definitely happened. Meaning, there is more than one chain of narration before it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> Translator’s side-point:  With regard to the explanation of Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad An-Najmee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he said after mentioning a number of evidences from the <em>Qur·aan</em> affirming that the <em>Qur·aan</em> is indeed the speech of Allaah, not created and the speech of Allaah is an attribute of His. Then he said: ‘And whoever says that anything from the attributes of Allaah is a created thing then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever). This is what the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em> have affirmed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Al-Laalikaa’ee referring to here Imaam Al–Laalikaa`ee in his book <em>Sharh Usool I`tiqaad Ahlus-Sunnah</em>; famous book of `<em>aqeedah</em> mentioned from 550 scholars from the <em>Salaf</em> that they said: ‘Whoever says that the <em>Qur·aan</em> is a created thing then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) and whoever says that his recitation of the <em>Qur·aan</em> is something created then he is an innovator, a <em>Jahmi</em> (he is astray). And likewise, one who remains silent and doesn’t say whether it’s created or not created, he is also a <em>Jahmi</em> (astray). So what Allaah has informed is very clear that the <em>Qur·aan</em> is the speech of Allaah and whoever will not say that then he has belied Allaah in what He has informed of.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Translator’s side point: Obviously the last part of the text here is taken from the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> that’s come a number of times, <strong><em>“Whoever lives long amongst you will see great differing</em></strong>…<strong>”</strong> and the rest of the point taken from the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of Al-Irbaa<u>d</u> Ibn Saariyah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em> reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad, Abu Daawood, At-Tirmithee and Ibn Maajah and declared authentic by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy, the famous <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> that’s come a number of times.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And you should know that the People of Knowledge did not cease refuting the saying of the Jahmiyyah,” </strong></span>the Jahmiyyah; a definition of them has preceded already that they are the followers of Al-Jahm ibn <u>S</u>afwaan who propagated the foul saying that the Qur&#8217;aan is a created thing and who openly proclaimed negation of the names of Allaah and His attributes and he had the saying of <em>Al-Irjaa`</em> (taking actions out of <em>eemaan</em>) and he had a foul <em>ma<u>dh</u>hab</em> (path).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his followers are called the Jahmiyyah as an ascription to al-Jahm. And from the worst, most ugly of their sayings is the saying that the Qur&#8217;aan is a created thing and denying the names and attributes of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, and distorting the speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger with falsehood; explaining it and distorting it with falsehood. So they (Jahmiyyah) are the most dangerous of the sects and the most ugly of the sects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore, the People of the <em>Sunnah</em> and the People of Knowledge did not leave them alone, rather, they rebutted their doubts and refuted their sayings and demolished them. And this is present in the books of the People of Knowledge. From them is the refutation of Imaam A<u>h</u>mad ibn <u>H</u>anbal <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> upon the Jahmiyyah and this is present and is printed. And from them is the refutation of `Uthmaan ibn Sa`eed ad-Daarimee upon Bishr al-Mareesee al-`Aneed and it is printed also. And from them is <em>Bayaanu Talbeesil-Jahmiyyah</em> of Shaykh ul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah and from them is<em> Ijtimaa`ul Juyoosh Islaamiyyah `alaa Ghazwal Mu`attillah w’al Jahmiyyah</em> of Ibnul Qayyim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“until in the <em>Khilaafaa </em>(caliphate) of <em>Banul `Abbaas </em>(`Abbaasids),” </strong></span>in the <em>Khilaafah</em> of Al-Ma`moon who was from the <em>Banul `Abbaas</em>, evil occurred. And those who are not suitable to speak, spoke. They spoke with regard to knowledge and with regard to the fundamentals; those who are not suitable to speak. And if a person speaks about something other than his own speciality, then the affairs will be corrupted. So it is essential that no-one speaks about the affairs of the religion and of knowledge except the people who are specialised in it and the People of Knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the affairs will not be rectified by chaos; by everyone speaking and claiming to have knowledge as is present now from those <em>muta`aalimeen</em> (pretenders to knowledge); those who ruminate (think deeply) upon questions of <em>`aqeedah</em> and speak about <em>eemaan</em> and what is the reality of <em>eemaan</em>. And they speak about things which they have no right to speak about at all. They have no knowledge and they do not learn with the scholars. Rather, they just learned by themselves and they rely upon their own understandings and they start laying down principles from themselves and from their own understandings. So, the affair is very dangerous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“so then in the <em>Khilaafah</em> of <em>Banul `Abbaas</em>, the <em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah</em> (the lowly, despicable folk) started speaking about <em>amaril `aammah</em> (affairs of the masses and the people).”</strong></span> This occurs in a narration; meaning this will be from the signs of the Last Hour that public affairs are spoken about by those who are not known for `<em>ilm</em> (knowledge).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> This is the <em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah</em> (the lowly, despicable folk) and their speaking is one of the signs of the Hour. So it is not right that such a person should speak about the public affairs and about the general matters, which affect everybody. No-one should speak about that except for the People of Knowledge; those who are firmly grounded in knowledge. And this should not be entered into by everyone just as He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَإِذَا جَاءَهُمْ أَمْرٌ مِّنَ الْأَمْنِ أَوِ الْخَوْفِ أَذَاعُوا بِهِ ۖ وَلَوْ رَدُّوهُ إِلَى الرَّسُولِ وَإِلَىٰ أُولِي الْأَمْرِ مِنْهُمْ لَعَلِمَهُ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَنبِطُونَهُ مِنْهُمْ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And if some matters relating to public safety or fear come to them, they broadcast it, and if only they had referred it back to the Messenger and to those in charge with authority amongst them, then the reality of the matter would be known to those who are able to verify and deduce.</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Nisaa·(4), <em>aayah</em> 83)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So public affairs affecting the nation (<em>ummah)</em> are not to be spoken about except by the people who are specifically qualified to do so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And they spoke against the narrations of Allaah’s Messenger<em><u> s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.”</span> </strong>They interfered even in the <em>A<u>h</u>aadeeth</em>, they make attacks upon them and they write works and declare things authentic and declare things weak. And they are not known for knowledge and they did not learn knowledge and they are not from the narrators of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> nor from the Imaams of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em>. So they are therefore, <em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah</em>; these lowly despicable folk. They stand up and they start speaking about the most dangerous thing, which is the science of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> and the knowledge of narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And they adopted analogy and opinion and they declared anyone who disagreed with them to be disbelievers.” </strong></span>What is meant by <em>qiyaa<u>s</u></em> (analogy) here is <em>al-qiyaas ul-baa<u>t</u>il</em> (false analogy). As for <em>al-qiyaas u<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (correct analogy) then that is from the underlying fundamental evidences with the People of Knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, false analogy such as drawing analogy between the Creator and the creation or making analogy between a matter and another matter, which has no connection to it and does not have a common underlying factor. The like of that is false analogy. Because <em>al-qiyaas</em> (analogy) is joining a matter (<em>far·`a)</em> which we do not find a text for, joining it to a matter which there is a text for (<em>asl)</em> and so applying a ruling to it on account of there being an underlying factor (`<em>illah)</em>, common to both of them. So if there is no <em>`illah</em> (common underlying factor) common to both things then it will be a false and futile analogy.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Point Number 98 continued]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So the ignorant, the inattentive and the ones having no knowledge entered into their saying. So therefore they entered into disbelief without knowing. And the <em>ummah</em> was ruined in a number of ways, committed disbelief in a number of ways, committed heresy in a number of ways and went astray in a number of ways and it split and innovated in a number of ways. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Except for those who remained firm upon the sayings of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and upon what he was upon and what his companions were upon who did not go beyond what they had been upon and did not overstep their affair. Whatever sufficed them sufficed him and he did not wish to turn away from their way and their position. He knew that they were upon the correct Islaam and the correct true faith (<em>eemaan)</em>. So he followed them in his religion and found peace. And he knew that the religion lies in following; <em>taqleed</em> and that those who are meant to be followed are the companions of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So the ignorant people, the inattentive ones and the one having no knowledge entered into their saying.” </strong></span>Meaning, the door was opened for everyone. They began speaking about the affairs of knowledge right until now as you know on account of these satellite channels and this speech and this chaos with regard to knowledge has reached the extent that the common masses of people speak about the matters of knowledge and they raise doubts about the matters of knowledge. They raise doubts about the Islamic rulings. They raise doubts about the verdicts of the Imaams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as has preceded, they declare those who disagree with them to be disbelievers to the extent that they declare the earlier Imaams to be disbelievers and to being ignorant people and to the extent that some of them say, “I am a person and A<u>h</u>mad ibn <u>H</u>anbal was a person. We are men and they were men. Maalik was a man and I am a man!” This is the level that the situation has reached with them that there is no special distinction for the saying of the Imaams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“To the extent that they committed disbelief in a way which they did not know.”</span> </strong>They committed disbelief in a way that they did not know. So a person may say a saying of <em>kufr</em> (disbelief) and he does not know that it is a saying of disbelief on account of his being ignorant. So he says that which is disbelief and he promotes disbelief and he doesn’t even know that it is disbelief (<em>kufr)</em> on account of his having entered into something which he is not proficient in. So the danger is very great for him and for the nation (<em>ummah)</em>. If the danger were just restricted to him; the one who is speaking, it would be easier but the problem is that this spreads throughout the <em>ummah (</em>nation).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So the <em>ummah</em> (nation) became ruined through a number of different ways and committed disbelief in a number of different ways,” </strong></span>meaning, they confused and deceived the <em>ummah</em> (nation) and they entered weaknesses into it until there came to be from them those people who adopt sayings of disbelief and they say, “<em>these are sayings of scholars</em>” just as they say about the saying of Al-Jahm and the Mu`tazilah to the extent that they write in the newspapers, then they say about the true scholars (`<em>ulemaa)</em>, “<em>you people, you restrict the truth to just yourselves and you throw away the sayings of the Imaams such as Ibn Seenaa and Ibn `Arabee and Al-Jahm Ibn <u>S</u>afwaan. And those people are scholars who have their value</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and they committed heresy in different ways and went astray in different ways and they split and they innovated in different ways.” </strong></span>All of these calamities were on account of the ignorant people entering into the matters of knowledge and on account of having little fear of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. So when they had very little fear of Allaah, they entered into these matters. And therefore one of the <em>Salaf</em> said: &#8220;<em>Their wara`(piety) was very slight so that is why they spoke</em>.” As for a person who fears Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, then he doesn’t enter into anything if he is not proficient in it and not from its people, in particular the affairs of the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Except for those who remained firm upon the sayings of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and upon what he was upon and upon what his companions were upon and do not step beyond any of them.” </strong></span>They were not secure from these calamities, from disbelief and deviation and misguidance and diverting from the correct way and from mutual enmity and from cutting off ties with each other. No-one was safe from these calamities <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>except</strong> </span>those who adhered to that which Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions were upon just as he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“And my nation will split into 73 sects, all of them will be in the Fire except for one. They said, “Who is it, O Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “Those who are upon that which I and my companions are upon.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And who found sufficiency in whatever sufficed them,” </strong></span>and it is the Book and the Sunnah and that which the <em>Salaf-us-<u>S</u>aali<u>h </u></em><u>(</u>the righteous predecessors) were upon, from the companions and the <em>taabi`een </em>and the most excellent generations and the Imaams. However, the problem lies in those people who say, “<em>They were men and we are men. And their speech has no distinction over our speech</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And he knows that they were upon the correct Islaam and upon the correct <em>eemaan</em> (true faith).” </strong></span>Just as He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَالسَّابِقُونَ الْأَوَّلُونَ مِنَ الْمُهَاجِرِينَ وَالْأَنصَارِ وَالَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُم بِإِحْسَانٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the first and foremost ones from the <em>Muhaajireen</em> and the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em> and those who followed them upon goodness.</span> </strong>(Sooratut-Towbah (9), <em>aayah </em>100)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He `<em>alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu</em> <em>wassalaam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Adhere to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided orthodox Khulafaa after me.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever wants salvation then this is the path to it. And the one who does not want salvation will have whatever he chooses for himself but the harm is not restricted to him; rather, he will also carry the sins of the people along with his own sin. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>لِيَحْمِلُوا أَوْزَارَهُمْ كَامِلَةً يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ۙ وَمِنْ أَوْزَارِ الَّذِينَ يُضِلُّونَهُم بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ ۗ أَلَا سَاءَ مَا يَزِرُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So they will carry their burdens of sin completely on the Day of Resurrection and they will carry from the sins of those whom they misled also without knowledge. Indeed what an evil burden they will bear! </strong></span>(Sooratun-Na<u>h</u>l (16), <em>aayah </em>25)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the companions and the most excellent generations are the ones who were upon correct Islaam and the correct religion. So how can you abandon them and go instead for those for whom there is no guarantee that he is upon the correct religion and that he is upon the truth?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“So this person followed them in his religion and was at peace.”</span> </strong><em>Qalladahum</em>; meaning he followed them, <em>ittaba-’ahum</em>.</p>
<p><strong> وَالَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُم بِإِحْسَانٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>… and those who followed them upon good. </strong></span>(Sooratut-Towbah (9), <em>aayah </em>100)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is meant by <em>taqleed</em> here is <em>ittibaa</em>`; following.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And this person knows that the religion is just in following and that the ones to be followed are the companions of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.” </strong></span>As we have mentioned, what is meant by <em>taqleed</em> here is correct <em>taqleed</em>; following, which is <em>ittibaa`</em> just as Yusuf `<em>alayhissalaam</em> said:</p>
<p><strong> إِنِّي تَرَكْتُ مِلَّةَ قَوْمٍ لَّا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَهُم بِالْآخِرَةِ هُمْ كَافِرُون</strong></p>
<p><strong>وَاتَّبَعْتُ مِلَّةَ آبَائِي إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">I have left the religion of a people who do not truly believe in and worship Allaah alone and who deny the Hereafter. And I have followed the religious way of my forefathers; Ibraaheem and Is<u>h</u>aaq and Ya`qoob.</span> </strong>(Soorah-Yusuf (12), <em>aayah </em>37 and 38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>ittibaa</em>` (following) of the righteous predecessors (<em>Salaf-us-<u>S</u>aali<u>h)</u></em>, this is the truth and there is no blame at all for following them. Indeed blameworthiness is only for those who follow the people who are not deserving of being followed and who take as an example those who are not befitting to be taken as examples.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad in the <em>Musnad</em> and by al-Bazzaar in his <em>Musnad</em> and by at-Ta<u>h</u>aawiyy in <em>Shar<u>h</u> Mushkil ul-Aathaar</em> from a <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of Anas that he said: Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Before the Last Hour, there will be years of deception in which a liar will be believed and a truthful person will be taken to be a liar and in which a treacherous person will be trusted and in which a trustworthy person will be taken to be treacherous. And in it the <em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah</em> will speak. So it was said, “Who are the <em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah</em>?” So he said, “The little evil one who speaks about the public affairs.”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafi<u>dh</u> ibn Katheer said in <em>an-Ni<u>h</u>aayah fil-Fitan w`al-Milaa<u>h</u>im</em>; its chain of narration is good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> As for one of the verifiers of the <em>Musnad</em> of Imaam A<u>h</u>mad; Shuayb al-Arna`ut, he said in his checking of the <em>Musnad</em> of A<u>h</u>mad, the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> is <em><u>h</u>asan</em>, this particular chain is weak as it contains Mu<u>h</u>ammad bin Is<u>h</u>aaq who is <em><u>h</u>asan</em> in <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> but he was a <em>mudallis</em> and he reports it here, he just says, “from”, he doesn’t say that he directly heard it from his Shaykh, he said, “from him”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As an addition to what occurs here, this <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> also occurs as a <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>, reported by Ibn Maajah (4,042) and by Al-<u>H</u>aakim and by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad also and declared <em><u>h</u>asan</em> by Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy in <em>A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (1,887) because it has a number of chains which support it. He also authenticates a <em>hadeeth</em> of Aws ibn Maalik <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> with a similar wording, reported by al-Bazzaar and a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abaraaniyy and he brings that in <em>A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>aheehah</em> (2,253).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> As for the explanation of <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he said, literally the beginning here that, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“the people of knowledge continue rebutting the saying of the Jahmiyyah until it was the <em>Khilaafah</em> of <em>Banul `Abbaas</em>,” </strong></span>he was here narrating the condition that was present and the <em>Khilaafah</em> of <em>Banul Abbaas</em>, the beginning of it was upon good but then the affairs changed after the year 200 when the <em>Khaleefah</em> Al-Ma`moon accepted the call of the Mu`tazilah and became convinced that the Qur&#8217;aan is something created and he called the People of Knowledge to accept this innovation and to accept this saying, which is <em>kufr </em>(disbelief).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, therefore fitnah; tremendous trial occurred, which continued from the year 200 onwards and for 12 years of the <em>Khilaafah</em> of Al-Ma`moon and Al-Mu`ta<u>s</u>im and Al-Waathiq until the <em>Khilaafah</em> was taken on by Al-Mutawakkil `ala-Allaah and then the People of the <em>Sunnah</em> and the <em>Jamaa</em>`<em>ah</em> and the carriers of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> had some respite then and it was the People of Falsehood who were then curbed of doubt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, after Al-Mutawakkil passed away, after that time then the <em>Khaleefas</em> began to lose their authority and the <em>Khilaafah</em> became just a name without any reality. They became an outer form without a true reality behind it and that was because the Turks gained ascendancy and they took hold of the reality of authority and came to actually control the <em>Khulafaa</em>·. They could bring whoever they wanted and appoint him and they could kill this one as they wished and then after that authority passed away from the Turkish people and passed to <em>Banu Booyaa</em>. [Translator’s side point: <em>Banu Booyaa</em> ruled roughly from the year 325 AH till about the year 450 AH.]. Then to <em>Al-Jaraakisaa</em> (the Circassians) until the <em>Khilaafah</em> was ended in the year 656.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then the saying of `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> was realised that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“We are a people who used to be the most humiliated people but then Allaah gave us strength and honour through Islaam so whenever we seek to attain honour by other than that which Allaah gave us honour through, then Allaah will humiliate us.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Al-<u>H</u>aakim in his <em>Mustadrak</em> and he declared it authentic from `Umar and likewise Ath-<u>Th</u>ahabee agreed.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad finished by saying, “Except for the fact that the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al-Jamaa`ah</em> and the people of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> and the people of true `<em>aqeedah</em> have not ceased to be established upon their `<em>aqeedah</em>, not being harmed by whoever opposes them. And therefore, he (meaning the author; al-Barbahaaree <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) therefore made an exception by saying,<span style="color:#993300;"> <strong>“Except for those who remained firm upon the saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his command what he was upon and his prohibition…”</strong></span> to the end of the saying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Checking has preceded and the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> as we had before was reported by at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee and al-<u>H</u>aakim and others and declared <em><u>h</u>asan</em> by Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> <em><u>H</u>adeeth</em> being part of the famous <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of `Irbaa<u>d</u> ibn Saariyah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>, reported by A<u>h</u>mad and Aboo Daawood and Ibn Maajah and being declared <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> by Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5">[5]</a> Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> makes a point here, he said the point of slight objection to a wording, he said, the author’s saying here, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and you should know that the religion is just <em>taqleed</em>,” </strong></span>the point of objection is to be raised against here for the wording because <em>taqleed</em> means to follow without a proof. So if he had said the <em>deen</em> is <em>ittibaa</em>`; used this word, the religion is to follow the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and the Sunnah of His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> upon the understanding of the <em>Salaf</em> of this <em>ummah</em> from the companions and <em>taabi`een</em> and those who followed them upon good from the bearers of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> and narrations. This wording would’ve been what is correct because it conforms to what Allaah has commanded with in His Book when He said:</p>
<p><strong>وَأَنَّ هَٰذَا صِرَاطِي مُسْتَقِيمًا فَاتَّبِعُوهُ ۖ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا السُّبُلَ فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكُمْ عَن سَبِيلِهِ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ وَصَّاكُم بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And this is My straight way so therefore follow it and do not follow the divergent paths, which will take you away from His path. He has enjoined you with that so that you are a people who are dutiful to Him.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-An`aam (6), <em>aayah</em> 153)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p><strong>اتَّبِعُوا مَا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكُم مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَاءَ ۗ قَلِيلًا مَّا تَذَكَّرُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Follow what is being sent down to you from your Lord and do not follow any others besides Him in disobedience to Allaah. Little it is that you take admonition.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah</em> 3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>ittibaa</em>`; following for the <em>Salaf</em>, those who were before us; upon the narration, upon proof, upon the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, this is the truth and Allaah is the one who grants success.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 55: Point 98</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And acknowledge the rights of the Ansaar and the advice given by Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> concerning them and the family of the Messenger. Do not abuse them, acknowledge their virtue and their deeds of excellence. And acknowledge the virtue of his neighbours from the people of Al-Madinah.</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F394398402&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/acknowledge-the-virtue-of-the-ansaar" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“<strong>And acknowledge the virtue of the Ansaar,” </strong></span>from the tribes of the Aws and the Khazraj and the companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, the most excellent of the generations. They are the most excellent of the generations because of his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The best of you is my generation.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And because Allaah chose them to be companions of his Prophet Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and because they gave the <em>Bay`ah</em> (pledge) to the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and they fought Jihaad along with him and they carried the knowledge from him and conveyed it to mankind. So the sahaabah (companions) are the most excellent of the generations and no-one can catch them with respect to their virtue. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Do not abuse my companions for by the One in whose Hand is my soul, if one of you were to spend in charity the like of Mount U<u>h</u>ud in gold, it would not reach the handsful of one of them nor even a half of it.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning; if a person were to spend in charity with the like of the mountain of U<u>h</u>ud, it would not equal a handsful of barley, which was given by a companion. So this shows the virtue of the companions <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em>. So this is tremendous virtue, which must be acknowledged for them <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَالسَّابِقُونَ الْأَوَّلُونَ مِنَ الْمُهَاجِرِينَ وَالْأَنصَارِ وَالَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُم بِإِحْسَانٍ رَّضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا عَنْهُ وَأَعَدَّ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي تَحْتَهَا الْأَنْهَارُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the first and foremost ones from the Muhaajireen and from the Ansaar and those who followed them upon good. Allaah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him and He has prepared for them gardens in Paradise beneath which rivers flow.</span> </strong>(Sooratut-Towbah (9), <em>aayah </em>100)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Majestic and Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>لَّقَدْ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِذْ يُبَايِعُونَكَ تَحْتَ الشَّجَرَةِ فَعَلِمَ مَا فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ فَأَنزَلَ السَّكِينَةَ عَلَيْهِمْ وَأَثَابَهُمْ فَتْحًا قَرِيبًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah was pleased with the believers when they gave you the pledge beneath the tree. So, He knew what was in their hearts and He sent down tranquility upon them and He rewarded them with a victory close at hand.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fat<u>h</u> (48), <em>aayah </em>18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>مُّحَمَّدٌ رَّسُولُ اللَّهِ ۚ وَالَّذِينَ مَعَهُ أَشِدَّاءُ عَلَى الْكُفَّارِ رُحَمَاءُ بَيْنَهُمْ ۖ تَرَاهُمْ رُكَّعًا سُجَّدًا يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلًا مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرِضْوَانًا ۖ سِيمَاهُمْ فِي وُجُوهِهِم مِّنْ أَثَرِ السُّجُودِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ مَثَلُهُمْ فِي التَّوْرَاةِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah and those who are with him are stern against the disbelievers, merciful amongst themselves. You will see them bowing and prostrating seeking bounty from Allaah and His pleasure. Their sign is upon their faces from the traces of prostration. That is their description in the Towraah.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fat<u>h</u> (48), <em>aayah </em>29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, their description in the Towraat.</p>
<p><strong>وَمَثَلُهُمْ فِي الْإِنجِيلِ كَزَرْعٍ أَخْرَجَ شَطْأَهُ فَآزَرَهُ فَاسْتَغْلَظَ فَاسْتَوَىٰ عَلَىٰ سُوقِهِ يُعْجِبُ الزُّرَّاعَ لِيَغِيظَ بِهِمُ الْكُفَّارَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And their description in the Injeel is that of a plant which sends out side-shoots, which support it so that it becomes firm and strong, upright upon its stalk; it pleases those who have planted it so that the disbelievers may become enraged at them.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fat<u>h</u> (48), <em>aayah </em>29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These <em>aayahs</em> are with regard to the companions <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em>, which shows their virtue and their status with Allaah and with His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and they have different levels of excellence amongst themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the four <em>Khulafaa`</em> (Caliphs); they are the most excellent ones from the companions, then the rest of the ten who are promised Paradise then, the <em>Muhaajiroon</em> because Allaah mentioned them first ahead of the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em> and because they (the <em>Muhaajireen</em>) left their homes and their wealth and their homelands for the sake of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic and they migrated in Allaah’s cause. So they have excellence over the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em>. Then the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em> <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em> because they sheltered the Messenger and they gave shelter to the Muslims and supported them and they assisted them with their wealth and they lived in harmony along with them and they loved them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And those who were present at Badr also, they have virtue and specific excellence and those who were present at the pledge of <em>Ri<u>d</u>waan; Bay`atur-ri<u>d</u>waan.</em> He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>لَّقَدْ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِذْ يُبَايِعُونَكَ تَحْتَ الشَّجَرَةِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah was pleased with the believers when they gave you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Messenger </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> the pledge beneath the tree.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fat<u>h</u> (48), <em>aayah </em>18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then those who accepted Islaam before the Conquest are more excellent than those who accepted Islaam after the Conquest of Makkah. So they have different degrees of virtue amongst them. However, overall they are more excellent than others besides them from all generations until the Hour is established. No-one can match them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and the council given by Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> with regard to them,”</strong></span> meaning: the strong advice given by the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> with regard to the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em>. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“No-one will love the An<u>s</u>aar except for a believer and<br />
no-one will hate them except for a hypocrite (munaafiq).”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“<strong>And his neighbours from the people of Al-Madinah; acknowledge their virtue.” </strong></span>Meaning, the person who lives in Al-Madinah and has patience with it, hoping for reward and he has patience upon its hardships, hoping for reward and is constant upon prayer in the mosque of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, he will have reward for that. There is no doubt about it but as for the person who lives therein and he commits evil and he commits shirk along with Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, and he propagates innovations then his punishment will be multiplied for he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever commits innovations in it or who gives shelter to an innovator then upon him will be the curse of Allaah and the angels and all of mankind.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (3,650) and Muslim (2,535) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of `Imraan ibn al-<u>H</u>usayn <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (3,673) and Muslim in his <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (2,541) from Aboo Sa`eed al-Khudriyy <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (3,783) and Muslim (75) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Al-Baraa` <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (7,300) and Muslim (1,370) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of `Aliyy <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s side point: Briefly with regard to the explanation of <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong></span> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah,</em> then he said with regard to the point; <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And his neighbours from the people of Al-Madinah; acknowledge their virtue.”</span> </strong>What is meant by the neighbours here are those people who are not from the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em> (<em>Aws and the Khazraj</em>) nor were they from Quraysh but they were Muslims so they have the right of Islaam and they have virtue for their having patience upon the difficulties in Al-Madinah. So it is obligatory to acknowledge the virtue of the people of virtue and Allaah is the one who grants success.</p>
<hr />
<p>That’s the end of the first of the 2 volumes.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“<span style="color:#993300;">acknowledge the excellence of the Banu Haashim (clan of Haashim)</span></strong>,<strong>” </strong>the Banu Haashim; clan of Haashim ibn `Abd Manaaf (the son of `Abd Manaaf) because `Abd Manaaf had a number of sons and they were:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1)Haashim who is the grandfather of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and (2)`Abdu-Shams who is the grandfather of `Uthmaan ibn Affaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and (3) Nawfal ibn `Abd Manaaf who is the grandfather of <u>H</u>akeem ibn <u>H</u>izaam <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and (4) al-Mu<u>tt</u>alib ibn `Abd Manaaf who is the grandfather of Banu Mu<u>tt</u>alib.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are all the sons of `Abd Manaaf. And the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was raised amongst the Banu Haashim (clan of Haashim), the son of `Abd Manaaf; so he was a Haashimee Qurayshee (larger tribe of Quraysh from the clan of Haashim; children of Haashim). And he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah chose Kinaanah from the descendants of Ismaa’eel and he chose from Kinaanah, the Quraysh and he chose from the Quraysh, Banu Haashim and he chose me from the Banu Haashim.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they are the <em>qaraabah</em> (kinfolk) of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>; the believers from Banu Haashim. They are the <em>qaraabah</em> (kinfolk) who have the right upon the Muslims. It is forbidden for them to accept charity (<em><u>s</u>adaqah)</em> but it is permissible for them to accept a gift (<em>hadiyyah)</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for other than the believers then they have no worth even if they are from Banu Haashim. Rather, it is only when <em>qaraabah</em> (close kinship) comes along with <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) then in that case, there is no doubt that they have distinction over other people and they have the right that they be shown honour and respect and they have the right to be respected and given precedence since this is a part of the respect of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. However, if they are not believers (<em>mu&#8217;mineen)</em> then all that is the case is that they are from Banu Haashim and they are disbelievers so there is no honour for them. And the same goes to everyone who ascribes themselves to the Banu Haashim who is not upon the way of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em> and not upright then he has no worth. So, it is not just being merely closely related on its own that brings about the right. Rather, it is kinship along with having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith). He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>قُل لَّا أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْرًا إِلَّا الْمَوَدَّةَ فِي الْقُرْبَىٰ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, I do not ask you for any reward for conveying the truth to you but I enjoin you to show love towards me by respecting my close relatives (qurbaa).</span> </strong>(Sooratush-Shoorah (42), <em>aayah</em> 23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, the close relatives of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in one saying. And Allaah appointed for them a share of the <em>khumus</em> (fifth part of booty). He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّمَا غَنِمْتُم مِّن شَيْءٍ فَأَنَّ لِلَّهِ خُمُسَهُ وَلِلرَّسُولِ وَلِذِي الْقُرْبَىٰ </strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And you should know that whatever you take as booty then one fifth of it is assigned for Allaah, the Messenger and the close relatives of the Messenger.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Anfaal (8), <em>aayah </em>41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><u>Th</u></em><em>il-Qurbaa</em>-The close relatives of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“<strong>and acknowledge the excellence of the Quraysh and of the Arabs,” </strong></span>after the Banu Haashim (clan of Haashim) is the virtue of the Muslims from the Quraysh. They have excellence over the rest of the Arabs; then the Arabs have excellence over the `<em>ajam (</em>non-Arabs). Why? Because Allaah sent down the Qur&#8217;aan in their language and He sent the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> from them and He chose them to convey His message and therefore, He, the Majestic and Most High, said in the Qur&#8217;aan:</p>
<p><strong>فَاسْتَمْسِكْ بِالَّذِي أُوحِيَ إِلَيْكَ ۖ إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</strong><br />
<strong>وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(<em>In an address to the Prophet <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So hold fast to this Qur&#8217;aan that has been sent down to you. Indeed you are upon a straight and true path and it will be an honour for you. </strong></span>(Sooratuz-Zukhruf (43), <em>aayah </em>43-44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, the Qur·aan will be an honour for you and for your people; meaning the Arabs and you shall soon be questioned concerning it. You people will soon be questioned about the implementation of this Qur·aan and about the call to it and about having conveyed it, because Allaah gave them the duty of bearing it and conveying it to the rest of the world. So this is the aspect for which the Arabs have superiority. They were not given excellence just because they were Arabs alone; rather, they were given superiority on account of what they are specified with by Allaah with regard to the Qur·aan and the Sunnah and the sending of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and because they carry out the duty of conveying this religion. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>كُنتُمْ خَيْرَ أُمَّةٍ أُخْرِجَتْ لِلنَّاسِ تَأْمُرُونَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَتَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمُنكَرِ وَتُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">You are the best nation that has been brought out for mankind, you command the good and you forbid the evil and you truly believe in Allaah.</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<p><strong>وَلْتَكُن مِّنكُمْ أُمَّةٌ يَدْعُونَ إِلَى الْخَيْرِ وَيَأْمُرُونَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمُنكَرِ ۚ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And let there be from amongst you a group who call the people to the good and they command the good and they forbid the evil and they are the ones who will be successful.</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>104)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the aspect in which the Arabs have specific excellence. When they adhere to this religion and they convey it, then they have virtue over others. As for those who do not adhere to this religion then he has no excellence because Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنَّا خَلَقْنَاكُم مِّن ذَكَرٍ وَأُنثَىٰ وَجَعَلْنَاكُمْ شُعُوبًا وَقَبَائِلَ لِتَعَارَفُوا ۚ إِنَّ أَكْرَمَكُمْ عِندَ اللَّهِ أَتْقَاكُمْ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O mankind! We have created you all from a single male and female and we made from you nations and tribes so that you should become acquainted with each other. Indeed the most honourable of you with Allaah are those who have the most <em>taqwaa</em> (the most dutiful to Allaah).</span> </strong>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ujuraat (49), <em>aayah </em>13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“There is no excellence for an Arab over a non-Arab nor for a white person over a black person except on account of taqwaa (dutifulness to Allaah). All of you are from Aadam and Aadam was from earth.” </strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the angle from which the Arabs have superiority. If they establish the duty that Allaah has given to them to propagate this religion and to call to it and to explain it to mankind then they will be more excellent than others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and likewise all the branches of the tribes,” </strong></span><em>Al-Afkhaa<u>th</u></em> means a subsection of the tribes. So first there is the tribe meaning the large unit of the tribe then there are the <em>Afkhaa<u>th</u></em>; branches of the tribe so it is a part of the tribe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So</strong> </span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">acknowledge their station and their rights in Islaam.”</span> </strong>Each one in accordance with his own virtue and right.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“</span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And the freed slave who belonged to a people is from them&#8221;</span>. </strong>This is a <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> Meaning <em>al-`ateeq</em>; meaning a slave who has been set free. So a person who has been set free by the Haashimiyyeen (clan of Haashim), he will have the ruling of being from the clan of Haashim; or somebody who was a slave who had been set free by anybody else, he will have the same ruling as them.</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Muslim (2,276) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Waathilah ibn al-Asqa` <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Translator’s side point: With regard to this narration, they don’t mention any reference here in the footnotes but Shaykh al-Albaaniyy mentioned this narration occurs in the explanation of At-<u>T</u>a<u>h</u>aawiyyah and Shaykh al-Albaaniyy mentioned in his notes, note no. 461 that this narration is <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> and that it occurs in the <em>Musnad</em> of Imaam A<u>h</u>mad especially the first part of the narration and the latter part you can find it also in the <em>Mu`jam al-Awsa<u>t</u></em> of A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abaraaniyy and in the <em>Musnad</em> of Al-Bazdaar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy <u>(</u>6761) from Anas ibn Maalik <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> from the Prophet<em> <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The slave set free by a people is from them themselves.”</strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> As for the explanation of <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong></span> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he said starting off with the point with regard to Banu Haashim he said, “I say Banu Haashim (the clan of Haashim), they have virtue on account of their being close relatives of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, said to His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p><strong>قُل لَّا أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْرًا إِلَّا الْمَوَدَّةَ فِي الْقُرْبَىٰ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, I do not ask you for any reward for conveying the truth to you but I enjoin you to show love towards me by respecting the rights of my kinsfolk</span>. </strong>(Sooratush-Shoorah (42), <em>aayah</em> 23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his saying, <span style="color:#808000;">“<strong>I enjoin you to show love towards me by respecting the rights of my close relatives.” </strong></span>Meaning that that is not counted as taking reward but rather that the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> sought from the nation that they should recognise the rights of his kinsfolk and respect them from their respect for him and that they should show honour to them as a part of their showing honour to him for indeed a Muslim has rights upon the Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then a Muslim who is from the Banu Haashim who clings to his religion will have the right of Islaam and he will have the right that is due to a close relative of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and likewise the rest of the branches of the Quraysh except that Allaah has not put the duty upon us to love those who are not upon the correct `<em>aqeedah</em> and who are not upright upon Islaam. And indeed the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> freed himself from those who are contrary to his way. So he <em><u>s</u>alawaatullaahi wa salaamuhu `alayh</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Indeed the people of the father; meaning so and so, they are not my awliyaa </strong>(friends and allies)<strong>. Rather my guardian Lord is Allaah and my allies are the righteous believers.”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Muslim and Al-Bukhaariyy.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and the rest of the branches,” </strong></span>meaning, the rest of the branches of the Quraysh and the tribes of the Arabs. Their rights in Islaam should be recognised and Allaah grants success.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 54: Point 96</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that temporary marriage of convenience (<em>al-Mut`ah)</em> and marrying a woman merely to make her lawful for her previous husband (<em>al-Isti<u>h</u>laal)</em> are forbidden till the Day of Resurrection.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/temporary-marriage-of-convenience-al-mutah-is-forbidden-till-the-day-of-resurrection" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a matter of <em>fiqh</em> (jurisprudence). However, he brought it here because it has a connection to `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief). Because <em>al-Mut`ah</em> (temporary marriage of convenience) is to declare as lawful something which Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, has made forbidden. And what this term <em>al-Mut`ah</em> (temporary marriage of convenience) means; to marry a woman for a certain set period whether it be long or short and after it, then the marriage ends automatically and does not require divorce.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Mut`ah</em>; this temporary marriage, it used to be permissible at the beginning of Islaam and then the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> forbade it at the Battle of Khaybar.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> Then he permitted it on the day of the Conquest of Makkah. Then he forbade it forever.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So to begin with, it was lawful then it was made forbidden. Then it was permitted then it was forbidden forever. And the Muslims are united in consensus (<em>Ijmaa`)</em> that it is forbidden and that it is <em>nikaa<u>h</u>un baa<u>t</u>il</em> (baseless marriage). And there is consensus of this nation that it is forbidden, no-one disagrees with regard to that except for the <strong>Raafi<u>d</u>ah Ja`firee Shee`ah</strong>. They are the ones who contradict with regard to it. And their differing is not counted and has no value. So there is consensus (<em>Ijmaa</em>`) and text to show that temporary marriage of convenience (<em>al-Mut`ah)</em> is forbidden. It is a futile marriage and it has the ruling of <em>zinaa</em> (fornication).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><em>“al-Mut`ah tan-nisaa,”</em> </strong>Why did Imaam al-Barbahaaree say <em>Mut</em>`<em>ah</em>, meaning <em>Mut’ah</em> of the women, excluding by that <em>Mut`ah</em> of Hajj, which is that a person does <em>Tamattu</em>`, performing `Umrah and then performing Hajj. This is not what is meant here, for Hajj <em>Tamattu</em>` is what was supported by the majority of the People of Knowledge and no-one disagrees with regard to it except a small number but as for <em>Mut</em>`<em>ah</em> of the women meaning temporary marriage, then it’s forbidden by consensus, no-one disagrees about it from those whom disagreement is counted. Whereas, Mut’ah in Hajj is a matter of fiqh but as for Mut’ah, which is temporary marriage, then it is a matter, which has a connection to aqeedah (creed and belief) because it is making permissible that which Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, has made forbidden.</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> The Battle of Khaybar, the well-known battle against the Jews of Khaybar in the 7<sup>th</sup> year of <em>Hijrah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhaariyy reported in his <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (4,261) and also reported by Muslim in his <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (1,407) from Aliyy <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> who said Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> forbade temporary marriage to the women on the day of Khaybar and he forbade eating the meat of domestic donkeys.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 54: Point 90D &amp; 90E</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:(90D)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And they called to sectarianism (<em>furqah)</em> and Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, forbade sectarianism. Some of them declared others to be disbelievers. And everyone called to his own opinion and to calling those who disagreed with him disbelievers. So the ignorant people, the rabble and those having no knowledge went astray. They caused the people to become greedy for the things of this life and to fear worldly punishment. So the people followed them upon fear regarding their religion and out of hope for what they possessed from this world</span>.</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And they called to sectarianism and Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, has forbidden sectarianism.”</span> </strong>Allaah has forbidden sectarianism, splitting; <em>al-furqah</em>. So He said:</p>
<p><strong>وَلَا تَكُونُوا كَالَّذِينَ تَفَرَّقُوا وَاخْتَلَفُوا مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَهُمُ الْبَيِّنَاتُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And do not be like those who split up and differed after the clear signs had come to them.</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah</em> 105)</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا تَفَرَّقَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ إِلَّا مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَتْهُمُ الْبَيِّنَةُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And those who were given the scripture did not differ except after the clear truth had come to them.</strong></span>(Sooratul-Bayyinah (98), <em>aayah</em> 4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they differed and split not upon ignorance but rather upon knowledge; `<em>ilm</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<span style="color:#993300;"> <strong>“And some of them declared others to be disbelievers,” </strong></span>The <em>firaq</em> (sects) started declaring each other to be disbelievers. And this is a sign which is manifest upon them. And this is a proof that they are all upon falsehood. As for the people of the truth and the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> then they do not declare each other to be disbelievers. Rather, they are friends and allies to each other, they love each other and they support each other and they advise each other. And likewise, they do not declare the other sects to be disbelievers except for what the Book and the Sunnah proves to be disbelief. Otherwise, it is the case that they (the people of sunnah) are justly balanced with regard to the matter of <em>Takfeer</em>. They do not declare anyone a disbeliever except for those whom the proof is established that he is a disbeliever and they are not hasty with regard to this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and each one called to his own opinion and to declaring those who disagreed with him to be disbelievers.” </strong></span>This is a sign of the people of misguidance. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>فَتَقَطَّعُوا أَمْرَهُم بَيْنَهُمْ زُبُرًا ۖ كُلُّ حِزْبٍ بِمَا لَدَيْهِمْ فَرِحُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So they split into parties and sects, each one following a separate book, every group rejoicing in what it was upon.</strong></span>(Sooratul-Mu·minoon (23), <em>aayah </em>53)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Zuburan</em>; meaning books. They authored books and this occurs. They author books to support their own position and their own party and they rejoice in what they are upon. And if they had just been upon ignorance then it could be hoped that they would return. However, they rejoice in what they are upon from falsehood and they believe it to be the truth. And this is a punishment from Allaah for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“So the ignorant people and the <em>ra`aa`</em> (the common rabble) and those who had no knowledge went astray.”</span> </strong>They led the ignorant people astray and the rubble and those who had no knowledge. But as for the people of the truth and the people of knowledge then they are not affected by these sects and these misguidances because they know that it is falsehood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And they caused the people to become greedy for things of this world and they cause them to fear the punishment of this world.” </strong></span>That is from the means which they utilise in their trial that they give their followers some of the things, which they crave after.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So the creation followed them therefore, upon fear with regard to their religion and upon hope with regard to what they had of this world.” </strong></span>Many of the people have love of this world so therefore, they will follow anyone who will give them anything from wealth even if he is upon falsehood as a result of their craving for wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Point Continues </strong></span></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:(90E)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So the <em>Sunnah</em> and the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> were suppressed and innovations appeared and became widespread. The people committed disbelief in many ways, which they were not aware of. They applied analogy and considered the ability of the Lord, His signs, His rulings, His commands and His prohibitions according to their own intellects and opinions. So whatever accorded with their intellects, they accepted it and whatever ran contrary to their intellects, they rejected it. So Islaam became a stranger and the <em>Sunnah</em> became a stranger and the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> became strangers within their own homes.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So the <em>Sunnah</em> and the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> became suppressed and innovations appeared and became widespread.” </strong></span>After the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> had been apparent in the <em>quroon al-mufa<u>dd</u>alah</em> (most excellent generations) and the people of evil had been subdued, then the affair became turned around and the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> became suppressed and the people of falsehood became apparent. However, this will not persist. Even if the people of falsehood become apparent at one time then they will decline in the future and they will collapse in the future. And the final outcome will always be for the people of <em>Taqwa</em>; those who are dutiful to their Lord. And Imaam Ibn ul-Qayyim <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said:<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And the truth is aided and tested so do not be surprised for this is the way of the Most Merciful.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And they applied analogy,” </strong></span>Analogy (<em>Qiyaas)</em>, meaning in `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) because `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) has no analogy in it because it is <em>tawqeefeeyah</em> (reliant upon direct text). Action with regard to it is not upon except a proof. And no analogy is made in matters of creed and belief. Analogy can only be in <em>fiqh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and they considered the ability of the Lord and His signs and His rulings and His commands and His prohibitions in accordance with their intellects and their own opinions.” </strong></span>This is al <em>qiyaasul baa<u>t</u>il</em> (the false and futile analogy) making analogy with regard to Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, the One Who cannot be imagined by their minds and their opinions. So they rebut based upon the analogy of their intellects, the speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So whatever conformed with their intellects, they accepted it and whatever was contrary to their intellects, they rejected it.” </strong></span>So they make their intellects and their opinions the judge, so whatever conflicts with it, they reject it, either by <em>ta·weel</em> (interpreting it away) or by <em>raf<u>d</u></em> (directly rejecting it) and not accepting it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<span style="color:#993300;"> <strong>“So therefore, Islaam became a stranger and the <em>Sunnah</em> became a stranger and the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> became strangers within their own homes.” </strong></span>Just as he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Islaam began as a stranger and it will return to being a stranger just the same as it began. So give glad tidings of a tree in Paradise to the strangers.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>So then they said, “Who are the strangers O Messenger of Allaah?” So he said, “Those who are upon correctness when the people become corrupted.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And in one narration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Those who correct whatever the people corrupt.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They correct themselves are upon correctness and they correct whatever the people have corrupted. They are the <em>ghurabaa</em> (strangers). Why are they called strangers (<em>ghurabaa)</em>? Because those who contradict them are many and those who criticise them are many, so they are strangers amongst the people of their own lands and the people of their own time.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator’s side point: Some of the versions have at the end , <strong>“So the people followed them upon fear regarding their worldly life and out of hope for what they possessed from this world.”</strong> <em>W`Allaahu A`lam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Translator’s side point: Quote being from his famous poem <em>Al-Kaffiyaat ash-Shaafiyah</em> along with the explanation of it, they give a reference there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> mentioned in his explanation, “This seems to be referring to the like of the Jahmiyyah and the Mu`tazilah. They brought this matter of analogy and their intellect into the religion and used it to reject the texts; texts with regard to the attributes of Allaah, the Most High and other than them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> <strong>Shaykh Aal Ash Shaykh</strong> continues with the wordings of the <u>h</u>adeeth but this part of the <u>h</u>adeeth is reported by Muslim (145) of a hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> without what follows in the main text here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also reported by Muslim (146) from Ibn `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhuma</em> from the Prophet that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Islaam began as a stranger and it will return to being a stranger just as it began and it will retreat between the two mosques just as a snake returns to its hole.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5">[5]</a> As for the wording, when the companions asked,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Who are the strangers, O Messenger of Allaah? Then he replied, “They are those who are upon correctness when the people become corrupted.”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This wording is reported by A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abaraaniyy in <em>Al-Mu`jam al-Kabeer</em> and <em>Al-Mu`jam al-Awsa<u>t</u></em>, <em>Al-Mu`jam as-Sageer</em> from Sahl ibn Sa`d as-Saai`dee. Al-Haythamee said in <em>Majma` az-Zawaa`id</em>, its narrators are those of the <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> except for Bakr ibn Sulaym and he was reliable as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a side point, Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy declared this narration authentic in <em>As-<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> under <u>h</u>adeeth no. 1273,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The strangers are those who are upon correctness themselves when the people become corrupted.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the last wording that’s mentioned, <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“They are those who correct whatever the people corrupt,”</strong> </span>that is reported by At-Tirmidhiyy and A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abaraaniyy in <em>al-Kabeer</em> from a narration of `Amr ibn `Awf that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The religion began as a stranger and it will return to being a stranger. So give glad tidings to the strangers, those who rectify what the people have corrupted after me from my Sunnah.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>irmidhiyy said, “This <u>h</u>adeeth is <em><u>h</u>asan, <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (good, authentic).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Shaykh al-Albaaniyy in his checking of <u>T</u>irmidhiyy declared this particular report here as <em><u>d</u>a`eef jiddan</em> (very weak, not authentic).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the footnote also, they mention a further wording reported by Ibn Abee Shaybah and Imaam A<u>h</u>mad and ad-Daarimee and Ibn Maajah and others from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Ibn Mas`ood that contains the wording, it was said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Who are the strangers? And that he said, “An-nuzzaa` minal qabaa-il (they are the scattered ones from amongst the tribes).” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They mention here that Imaam al-Bukhaariyy declared that narration to be <u>h</u>asan, as was reported from him by his student, a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>irmidhiyy. And Al-Baghawee said in <em>Shar<u>h</u>us Sunnah</em>, the <u>h</u>adeeth is <em>sa<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> <em>gareeb</em> with a singular chain. And again this particular report here was declared <em>da`eef</em> by Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy in the checking of <em>Sunan Ibn Maajah</em>, <em>W`Allaahu A`lam</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 53: Point 90C</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>..So the affair remained in order until the Khilaafah of Banu so and so then the times changed. The people deteriorated greatly and innovations became widespread, and there came to be many callers to other than the way of the truth and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>.

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/differing-and-fitan-increased-after-the-excellent-generations-had-passed-away" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So the affair remained in order until the Khilaafah of Banu (tribe) of so and so. Then the times changed greatly and innovations became widespread,” </strong></span>Differing increased and <em>fitan</em> (trials and tribulations; discord) increased after the excellent generations had passed away until there came the time of the `<em>Abbaasiyyeen</em>; the `Abbaasid Khaleefahs and Al-Ma`moon al-`Abbaasee appeared amongst them.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> And he was followed by Al-Mu`ta<u>s</u>im and by Al-Waathiq and they adopted the saying of the <strong><em>Jahmiyyah</em></strong>; this deviant sect and they wanted to force the people of the Sunnah upon the saying that the Qur&#8217;aan is created. And they killed some of the <em>Imaams</em> and they lashed others from them. However, the truth remains firm and all praise is for Allaah; it does not depart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and the callers to other than the way of the truth and of the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> became many.&#8221; </strong></span>Many people today say that they are <em>du</em>`<em>aat</em> (callers) and that they are <em>Jama`aat</em> (groups) and there are sects beneath this cover of <em>da`wah</em> (calling); being <em>du`aat</em> (callers) and what they want is to call the people to misguidance except for those whom Allaah has mercy upon from those who remain upon the call to the Book and the Sunnah and the methodology; way of the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in his call. Then this one is upon truth and this is the call of truth. Not everyone who carries the name of giving <em>da`wah</em> will be correct until his methodology (<em>manhaj)</em> is looked into, the methodology, which he precedes upon. So if he precedes upon that which the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions were upon, then he is a caller to truth. And if he is contrary to that which the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was upon in the methodology of <em>da`wah</em> then he is upon <em>baa<u>t</u>il</em> (falsehood). So a person should not be deceived by someone saying that he is from the <em>du`aat</em> (callers) for indeed there are <em>du`aat</em> (callers) who are at the gates of the Hellfire and whoever obeys them, they will throw him into it just as he <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> And therefore, the author said, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“</strong><strong>and there became many callers to other than the way of truth and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>.” </strong></span>Just as is the case now. There are many who claim that they are calling to Islaam underneath this cover. So if their <em>manhaj</em> (methodology) is looked into and their activities then they are found to be in total opposition to Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And trials came about with regard to everything, which Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> had not spoken about nor anyone from his companions </strong><strong><em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em></strong><strong> (may Allaah be pleased with them). </strong></span>Speech became plentiful and differing and rumour mongering and claims of knowledge. However, all of this will fade into insignificance and what is indicated by the Book and the Sunnah will remain and it is the sound methodology and the straight path. However, this requires two matters:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>Firstly,</strong> <em>Al-`ilmu-Naafi’</em>: Beneficial Knowledge; <em>`ilm</em> by which that which the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions and those who followed them upon good were upon.</li>
<li><strong>Secondly,</strong> <em>As-<u>S</u>abaru Wath-Thabaat</em>: Patience and firmness and that you do not move away; depart along with the discord; trials and tribulations or along with the callers to misguidance. Rather, that you should be <em>thaabit</em> (firm) and be patient upon whatever strikes you from rebukes and blame or threats. As long as you are upon the truth then be patient.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>وَاصْبِرْ عَلَىٰ مَا أَصَابَكَ ۖ إِنَّ ذَٰلِكَ مِنْ عَزْمِ الْأُمُورِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And have patience upon whatever befalls you. Indeed that is from those affairs which Allaah has firmly commanded. </strong></span>(Soorah-Luqmaan (31), <em>aayah </em>17)</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator&#8217;s side point: At the beginning of the time of the `<em>Abbaasids</em> and this <em>Khaleefah</em> Al-Ma`moon, he became the <em>Khaleefah</em> in the year 198; the end of the 2nd century.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Translator’s footnote: This is part of the <u>h</u>adeeth of <u>H</u>udhayfah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and it contains the wording that <u>H</u>udhayfah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> said; the famous <u>h</u>adeeth about the different stages in the future, what will happen to this religion, we used to be upon good, we used to be upon evil, he mentions then that Allaah gave this good to us, will there be any evil after this good?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said within that <u>h</u>adeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“I said, so will there be any evil after this good?” So he </strong><em><strong><u>s</u></strong><strong>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</strong></em><strong> said, “Yes, there will be callers at the gates of the Hellfire, whoever responds to them in that, they will cause him to be cast into it.” He said, “I said, O Messenger of Allaah, describe them to us.” So he said, “They have our skin and they speak with our tongue.” So, I say, “What do you command me if that reaches me?” He said, “That you adhere to the united body of the Muslims upon the truth and to their ruler.”</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 53: Point 90B</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>This is how the religion was until the <em>Khilaafah</em> of `Umar ibn al-Kha<u>tt</u>aab; the single <em>Jamaa`ah</em>. And likewise in the time of `Uthmaan. Then when `Uthmaan </strong><strong><em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em></strong><strong> was killed, schism; splitting and differing and innovations came about. The people split into parties and sects. Amongst the people were those who remained upon the truth when the changes first started to occur; they spoke with it, acted upon it and called the people to it.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F388976028&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-killing-of-uthmaan-ibn-affan" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“This is how the religion was till the time of `Umar ibn al-Kha<u>tt</u>aab <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>; the single <em>Jamaa`ah</em>. And likewise in the time of `Uthmaan.” </strong></span>In the lives of the companions and the <em>taabi`een</em> (the next generation after companions), those who opposed the truth kept themselves hidden and they concealed themselves amongst the people such as the <em>Qadariyyah</em> and other than them and that was on account of the strength of Islaam and the strength of the Muslims until the Jews infiltrated. A Jewish man from Yemen who was called Ibn As Sawdaa` `Abdullaah ibn Sabaa`; the Jew. So, he came to Al-Madeenah and he manifested Islaam in the caliphate of `Uthmaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and he began speaking ill of `Uthmaan in gatherings because he was just claiming to be a Muslim as a plot against Islaam.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he started spitting out his poison in gatherings and the foolish people attended and the scoundrels, evildoers and the ignorant ones. And some people or indeed many people desire vilification, they like to hear people being abused, been spoken ill of and they like <em>qeel wa qaal</em> (rumour mongering). So therefore they gathered around him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when his reality became known and he was expelled from Al-Madeenah, he went off to Egypt and he found a village in Egypt, which was famous for dissension, splits and the like. So he immersed himself in it and he spread his poison in it and he vilified; spoke ill of `Uthmaan. Then in the end, he organised a group of them having weapons and strength. So they came to `Uthmaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and raised objections to him and declared him to be in error. So `Uthmaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> responded to them and refuted them; refuted their doubts. Then they went back.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they rebuked themselves whilst they were on the way and they said we have achieved nothing then they went back to `Uthmaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and they encircled him whilst he was in his house and the companions wanted to defend the <em>Khaleefah</em>. However, `Uthmaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> forbade that for fear of <em>fitnah</em> (discord) and for fear of shedding blood hoping that the affair could be dealt with upon the basis of discussion and examination. He wanted to convince them. However, when they saw that they could not reach anything by using evidence then they sprang upon him during the night whilst the rest of the people were sleeping and they killed him <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When they saw that their false doubts had been refuted and that they were not going to be accepted then they ceased the opportunity at a time of inattentiveness. And most of the people were performing Hajj and the people still in Madinah were asleep in security and the matter was under discussion and being examined. So they sprang upon him by night, may Allaah disfigure them. They sprang upon in his house and they killed him as a martyr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> whilst he was reciting the Qur&#8217;aan and he had the <em>mu<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>h</u>af</em>; the written copy of the Qur&#8217;aan so that his blood spilled onto the <em>mu<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>h</u>af</em> <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>. So then <em>fitnah</em> (discord) occurred.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this filthy one (Abdullaah ibn Sabaa), he claims that the <em>Khilaafah</em> should’ve been for `Aliyy and that it was not for Aboo Bakr nor for `Umar nor for `Uthmaan. Rather, that it should’ve been just for `Aliyy and that `Aliyy was the <em>wa<u>s</u>iyy</em> (the one personally appointed to take over) by Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and that those people had wrongfully seized the <em>Khilaafah</em> and taken it by force from `Aliyy. And the amazing thing is that `Aliyy <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> did not claim this nor did he seek the <em>Khilaafah</em> nor did he say &#8220;I have more right to it&#8221;; rather, he gave the <em>bay`ah</em> (the pledge) and he heard and obeyed his brothers, the rightly guided <em>Khulafaa</em>· <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em> <em>ajma`een</em> <em>jamee`an;</em> all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then al-fitnah discord occurred between the Muslims and fighting occurred between the Muslims on account of this filthy one, this one who infiltrated the ranks of the Muslims. However, Allaah caused his hopes to become frustrated. It is correct that tribulations occurred between the Muslims, some of them were killed. However, this did not do anything to Islaam. Islaam and all praise is for Allaah remained strong and established and he did not damage Islaam at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he and the Jews did not damage this religion and all praise is for Allaah. Yes, some calamities occurred for the companions and discord and fighting, however, this was all in the cause of Allaah, <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em> <em>wa ar<u>d</u>aahum</em> (may Allaah be pleased with them and cause them to be pleased). And this filthy one did not really achieve anything and all praise is for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a summary of the affair of the <em>fitnah</em> (discord), which came about on the killing of `Uthmaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>. And this is something which shows that it’s not permissible to rebel against the ruler and that rebelling against him brings about evil in the nation and the shedding of blood and the people have continued to suffer from <em>fitan </em>(discord) from that time till this time of ours now; and you know about the callers to discord, those who call to <em>fitnah</em> (discord) and to rebellion against the rulers and with the excuse of correcting the evil. The <em>Mu`tazilah</em> arose and the <em>Khawaarij</em>, all of them from this aspect and they still continue until this time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So when `Uthmaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> was killed then schism; splitting and differing came about and innovations.” </strong></span>It is obligatory to beware of the callers to misguidance and their affair should not be treated lightly and that it is not permissible to speak against the rulers. And therefore he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> enjoined hearing and obeying and not rebelling against those in charge of the affairs even if they are tyrannical and even if they oppress and even if they are sinful as long as they do not reach the level of clear and open <em>kufr</em> (disbelief). This is how Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> enjoined this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And the people became sects. So from the people were those who remained firm upon the truth when things first changed; and who spoke with it and acted upon it and called to it.” </strong></span>When the <em>firq</em> (sects) came about and differing, then Allaah caused the people of the truth to remain firm upon the truth and upon the Sunnah and they preceded upon that which the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em> had been upon. And the other sects contradict it, what the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions had been upon. So therefore they became deserving of the threat of the Fire in accordance with the degree of what occurred from them.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 52: Point 90A</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, “My nation will divide into 73 sects; all of them shall be in the Fire except one, and it is the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>; the united body upon the truth.” It was said, “Who are they, O Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “That which I and my companions are upon today.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F388472916&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/my-ummah-will-divide-into-73-sects-all-of-them-shall-be-in-the-fire-except-one" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And you should know that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, “My nation will divide into 73 sects, all of them in the Fire except one and it is <em>al-Jamaa`ah</em>; the united body upon the truth,” </strong></span>Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, commanded us to unite; to become <em>ijtimaa</em>` upon the truth.</p>
<p><strong>وَاعْتَصِمُوا بِحَبْلِ اللَّهِ جَمِيعًا وَلَا تَفَرَّقُوا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And cling together to the rope of Allaah and do not separate. </strong></span>(Soorah Aali-Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>103)</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ فَرَّقُوا دِينَهُمْ وَكَانُوا شِيَعًا لَّسْتَ مِنْهُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ ۚ إِنَّمَا أَمْرُهُمْ إِلَى اللَّهِ ثُمَّ يُنَبِّئُهُم بِمَا كَانُوا يَفْعَلُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Those who split up their religion and become sects, you have nothing to do with them. Their affair is just with Allaah. Then He will inform them of what they used to do. </strong>(</span>Sooratul An`aam (6), <em>aayah </em>159)</p>
<p><strong>وَلَا تَكُونُوا كَالَّذِينَ تَفَرَّقُوا وَاخْتَلَفُوا مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَهُمُ الْبَيِّنَاتُ ۚ وَأُولَٰئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And do not be like those who split and differed after the clear signs have come to them. And they are the ones for whom will be a tremendous punishment. </strong></span>(Soorah Aali-Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>105)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He forbade us from splitting and He commanded us with uniting and with clinging on to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger. So He said:</p>
<p><strong>وَأَنَّ هَٰذَا صِرَاطِي مُسْتَقِيمًا فَاتَّبِعُوهُ ۖ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا السُّبُلَ فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكُمْ عَن سَبِيلِهِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And this is my straight way so follow it and do not follow the divergent paths for they will split you and lead you away from His path.</span> </strong>(Sooratul An`aam (6), <em>aayah </em>153)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not permissible to split and differ on account of desires or on account of <em>taqleed</em> (blindly following) fathers and forefathers or as a result of blindly following the Jews and the Christians. Differing is not permissible in the matters of `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) and in the fundamentals of the religion. Rather, it is obligatory to agree and to be united with regard to it. As for differing in issues of <em>fiqh</em> then this occurs. However, it is obligatory to return and refer back to those sayings which the proof establishes. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>فَإِن تَنَازَعْتُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ فَرُدُّوهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَالرَّسُولِ إِن كُنتُمْ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَحْسَنُ تَأْوِيلًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So if you dispute about anything then refer it back to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger if you truly believe in Allaah and in the Last Day. That is better and finer in its outcome.</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah </em>59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore <em>ikhtilaaf</em> (differing) in `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) is not permissible because `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) is <em>tawqeefeeyah</em> (reliant upon text). It is not a place for <em>ijtihaad</em> (scholarly deduction). But as for the issues of <em>fiqh</em> and <em>istinbaat</em> (deduction of rulings) then in that case, each one of the People of Knowledge in that matter who are suitable to promote <em>ijtihaad</em> can strive to deduce rulings and they may differ in their outlooks. However, they should not just remain upon their differing. Rather, they should refer back to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger. So, whoever has proof then they should follow him and take his saying and leave their own opinions. This is the position of the people of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> and this is what the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> directed us to. As for our saying, leave the people and let everyone have his own opinion and the differing of the nation is a mercy as they say then we say <em>haathaa baatil </em>(this is false and futile). Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَلَا يَزَالُونَ مُخْتَلِفِينَ</strong><br />
<strong>إِلَّا مَن رَّحِمَ رَبُّكَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they will continue to disagree except for those who your Lord has mercy upon.</span> </strong>(Soorah Hood (11), <em>aayah </em>118-119)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying, <strong>“Except for those who your Lord has mercy upon,” </strong>indicates that those whom Allaah has mercy upon do not differ and that differing is a punishment (<em>a<u>th</u>aab)</em> and is not a mercy (a <em>ra<u>h</u>mah)</em>. Mercy is for those who do not differ and if they do differ then they refer back to the Book and the Sunnah and they take what is correct and they leave what is wrong. This is the way of <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for each one remaining upon his own opinion and what so and so said and so and so then this is not the way of the Muslims. This is the way of the <em>Ahlul-Ahwaa</em> (innovated sects) and the People of <em>Shahawaat</em> (followers of desires). They search for whatever saying will conform to their desires and whatever will conform to what they want and whatever differs with their desires, they abandon it even if the Imaam whom they say that they take his saying says it. Meaning, they do not accept from the sayings of the Imaams and the scholars except what is in accordance with their desires. As for what contradicts their desires then they reject it. So, this is a proof that they are just following their own desires, whatever conforms with their desires they accept it and whatever is contrary to their desires they abandon it. <em>Wa laa <u>h</u>awla wa laa quwatta illaa billaah</em> (and there is no movement and no ability except with the aid of Allaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is what is called to nowadays in the newspapers and magazines and meetings and conferences mostly and upon the channels. They promote disagreement and they say we are just making things open and easy for the people. With what are we making things open and easy for the people? With abandonment of the Book and the Sunnah and with going along with sayings whose people are not secure from error; those who make errors sometimes and are correct sometimes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas they; meaning the Imaams of the past, they forbade us from taking their sayings except what accords with the proof. They forbade us from taking their sayings, which are in contrary to the proof. So, this is a matter, which it is obligatory to be aware of because the people today have been put to trial on account of those people who confuse things for the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And you should know that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, my nation will split into 73 sects, all of them will be in the Fire except one,” </strong></span>This <u>h</u>adeeth is authentic, when its chains of narration are gathered and its many narrations and the Imaams reported in their works and speak in praise of it and actual circumstances testify to its truth. So he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed that this nation of Muhammad will split into 73 sects and these are the major fundamental sects and there are actually more than these sects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said all of them will be in the Fire, meaning the 72, all of them will be in the Fire except for one and it is the 73<sup>rd</sup> one, which is that which is upon the like of what the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions were upon. So it is what will be saved from the Fire. And therefore, they are called <strong><em>al-Firqatun Naajiyah</em></strong> (the saved sect) and they are called <strong><em>Ahl-us-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em></strong> (the People of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>); the united body upon the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whatever is beside them then they are opposers to the truth under the threat of the Hellfire. So from them will be those who enter the Fire on account of disbelief (<em>kufr)</em> and from them will be those who enter the Fire on account of <em>fisq</em> (evil doing) and from them will be those who enter the Fire on account of <em>ma`<u>s</u>iyyah</em> (sin, disobedience). They are not all the same with regard to entering the Fire. So it is not to be taken from this <u>h</u>adeeth that these sects, all of them are disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“</span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And it is the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>; the united body,”</span> </strong><em>Al-Jamaa`ah</em> (united body) is whoever is upon the truth even if it is a single person. This is the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> (the united body). As for <em>Al-Kathrah</em> (being numerous on its own); a group being numerous then this on its own does not indicate the truth. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p><strong>وَإِن تُطِعْ أَكْثَرَ مَن فِي الْأَرْضِ يُضِلُّوكَ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And if you were to obey most of those upon the earth, they will lead you astray from the path of Allaah.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-An`aam (6), <em>aayah </em>116)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And most of mankind even if you eagerly wish will not be believers.</span> </strong>(Soorah Yoosuf (12), <em>aayah </em>103)</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا وَجَدْنَا لِأَكْثَرِهِم مِّنْ عَهْدٍ ۖ وَإِن وَجَدْنَا أَكْثَرَهُمْ لَفَاسِقِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We have not found most of them to be true to their covenant, We have found most of them to be disobedient ones. </strong></span>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>102)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So being numerous is not what is counted. What is counted is those who are upon the truth even if they are few in number, even if it is a single person then he will be the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> (the body upon the truth).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“<strong>It was said, “Who are they O Messenger of Allaah? He said, “That which is upon that which I and my companions are upon today.” </strong></span>This is the correct path, those who are upon that which the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions were upon, they are the <em>Jamaa</em>`<em>ah</em> (the united body upon the truth).</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 52: Point 89</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> that Allaah, the Most High, showed His Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> what was going to occur in his nation until the Day of Resurrection.</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/allaah-revealed-to-his-prophet-what-will-occur-to-his-ummah-till-the-day-of-resurrection" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> does not know the <em>ghayb</em> (hidden and unseen) and no-one from the created beings knows the hidden and unseen (<em>ghayb)</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>قُل لَّا يَعْلَمُ مَن فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ الْغَيْبَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, no-one in the heavens or on the earth knows the hidden and unseen except Allaah.</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Naml (27), <em>aayah</em> 65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>al-ghayb</em> (hidden and the unseen) is that which is hidden from us, whether it be in the past or in the future, we do not know it. However, the Prophets <em>`alayhimu<u>ss</u>alaatu</em> <em>wassalaam</em>, Allaah shows them something from the hidden and the unseen for the benefit of the <em>da`wah</em> (call to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High). And from them was our Prophet Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> for Allaah showed him some of the matters of the unseen and he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed of them for the benefit of the nation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>عَالِمُ الْغَيْبِ فَلَا يُظْهِرُ عَلَىٰ غَيْبِهِ أَحَدًا</strong><br />
<strong>إِلَّا مَنِ ارْتَضَىٰ مِن رَّسُولٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah is the Knower of the unseen so He does not reveal what He has kept hidden to anyone except to a messenger whom He is pleased with.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Jinn (72), <em>aayah</em> 26-27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Except to a messenger He is pleased with; </strong>meaning that Allaah shows to him whatever He, the Perfect and Most High, wishes. For e.g. the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was walking along with his companions and they passed by two graves so he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“These two are certainly being punished.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The companions were not aware that the two inhabitants of the graves were being punished. Allaah revealed it to His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, the punishment of the two deceased. So he said: <span style="color:#808000;"> “These two are certainly being punished.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was something which Allaah made him aware of and this was from the <em>kha<u>s</u>aa·i<u>s</u></em>, from the matters specific to the Messengers <em>`alayhimu<u>ss</u>alaatu</em> <em>wassalaam</em>. And Allaah made him aware of events that were going to occur in the future and he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed us about <em>Ashraa<u>t</u>is-Saa’ah</em> (The Signs of the Last Hour). He informed us about the <em>fitan</em> (trials and tribulations) in order that we should beware and have fear lest these matters come upon us so that we could be upon clear insight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He informed us for our benefit from the angle of warning so that we could safeguard ourselves. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“This nation will split into 73 sects, all of them will be in the Fire except one.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was news for him (<em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) that splitting would occur in the nation and it occurred just as he (<em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) informed so that we should remain firm upon the truth and not go off along with those who contradict the truth.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator’s side point: <em>Allaah Bi Annallaaha Ta`ala </em>and in some of the versions it has <em>Bi Annallaaha Tabaaraka Wa Ta`ala</em> (Allaah, the Exalted and Most High). Just a slight one addition word; <em>Tabaaraka Wa Ta`ala</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (218) and Muslim (292) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Translator’s side point: In the footnote it mentions checking of this has preceded and it will follow in the next point inshaaAllaah also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Firstly, with regard to the main point that Allaah, the Most High, shows His Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> what will occur in his nation until the Day of Resurrection and the reference for this as some of the verifiers mention is a <u>h</u>adeeth reported by al-Bukhaariyy (6604) and reported by Muslim (2891) as a <u>h</u>adeeth of Hu<u>th</u>ayfah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The Prophet gave us an address; khutbah, he did not leave anything out of it that will happen until the establishment of the Hour except that he mentioned it. Whoever knew of it, knew it and whoever was ignorant of it was ignorant of it and I used to see things happening, which I had forgotten so then I would recognise them just as a man recognises when something has been absent from him then when he sees it again, he recognises it.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> made an important point also with regard to this point that &#8220;<em>Allaah, the Most High made His Prophet <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam aware. He showed him things that would happen in his nation until the Day of Resurrection&#8221;</em>. Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say, this saying contains some degree of generality. So Allaah, the Perfect and Most High did not show His Prophet everything that was going to occur in his nation until the Day of Resurrection because this is from <em>ilm ul-ghaib</em> (the knowledge of the hidden and unseen), which is specific to the Lord of Might and Majesty. However, He showed him some events and some matters that were going to occur. And therefore, there occurs in the two sa<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>s from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> came to the graveyard and gave the greeting, “<em>May Allaah grant you security O believing people and we will if Allaah wills be joining you</em>.” Then he said, “I would have loved that I would have seen my brothers.” So they (the companions) said, “Are we not your brothers Oh Messenger of Allaah?” So he said, “You are my companions and my brothers are those who have not yet come.” So they said, “How will you recognise those who have not yet come from your nation O Messenger of Allaah?” He said, do you see if a man had some horses with white marks upon their heads and their arms and they were amongst some dark horses, would he not recognise his own horses?” So they said, “Yes indeed O Messenger of Allaah”. He said, “Then they will come with white marks on account of the wudu and I will precede you to the <em><u>h</u>aw<u>d</u> </em>(the great reservoir). Indeed some men will be repelled away from my reservoir just as a stray camel is repelled away. I will call to them, Come. So it will be said, they changed after you. So then I will say, <em>suhqan</em>, <em>suhqan</em>, be away, be far away.”</strong><strong style="font-size:1rem;"> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So this is a proof that he was not informed of everything that would occur in his nation but rather, he was informed of some things that were going to have a serious effect. So the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed of some of that just as is written in the books of the Sunnah and that does not mean that he became aware of everything that was going to occur in his nation and everything that would occur amongst them and to them as is believed by some people and I have researched this matter of my refutation of Ibn ul Haaj in the book <em>Awza hul al ishaarah fir raddi ala man ajaza mamnu minal ziyaara</em>, the clear indication in refutation of those who make permissible the forbidden type of visitation of graves.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So refer to that treatise because it is beneficial in its topic and that is from the bounty and beneficence of Allaah and His grant of success. And beware O student of knowledge of being slow or being too lazy to digest this matter because it is something that has great importance and by researching it and understanding it, you can become free from the beliefs of <em>shirk</em> and you can come to know the position of the <em>Salaf</em> well in this matter and Allaah is the one who grants success.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then finally on this point, <strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> summarised this point by saying the <em>ghaib</em> (hidden and the unseen) is of two categories. He mentioned:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Firstly, <strong><em>Ghaib ul-Mutlaq</em></strong>: That which is totally hidden and unseen and that is known only to Allaah, nobody else knows it, and,</li>
<li><strong><em>Ghaib ul-Nisbee</em></strong>: That which is partially hidden and unseen.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That which is partially hidden and unseen refers to that which Allaah has made His Prophets aware of just as, He, the Most High said, the <em>aayah</em> that came at the beginning:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>عَالِمُ الْغَيْبِ فَلَا يُظْهِرُ عَلَىٰ غَيْبِهِ أَحَدًا</strong><br />
<strong>إِلَّا مَنِ ارْتَضَىٰ مِن رَّسُولٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah, the Most High, is the Knower of the hidden and unseen so He does not reveal that which He has kept hidden to anyone except to a messenger whom He is pleased with. </strong></span>(Sooratul-Jinn (72), <em>aayah</em> 26-27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the <em>Ghaib ul-Mutlaq</em>; that which is unrestrictedly hidden and unseen is something specific to Allaah and the <em>Ghaib ul-Nisbee;</em> that which is partially hidden and unseen is that which He made His Prophets aware of.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 51: Point 88</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know, may Allaah have mercy upon you, that it is befitting that the servant should always have fear and concern for as long as he remains in this world because he does not know what condition he will die upon, what conclusion he will have, knowing what state he will meet Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic even if he performed every good deed.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> And it is befitting that a man who has transgressed greatly to the detriment of his own soul should not give up hope in Allaah, the Most High, at the point of death. Rather, he should have good thoughts with respect to Allaah whilst fearing his sins. So, if Allaah has mercy upon him then it is from His favour and if He punishes him then it is because of his sins.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F387969488&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-believer-should-combine-between-fear-hope" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a tremendous matter and it is that the believer (<em>mu`min)</em> should combine <em>al-khawf war-rajaa·</em> (fear and hope) such that in performing his deeds he precedes between fear and hope. So he does not have fear on its own and so therefore despair of the mercy of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong> إِنَّهُ لَا يَيْأَسُ مِن رَّوْحِ اللَّهِ إِلَّا الْقَوْمُ الْكَافِرُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed no-one despairs of the mercy of Allaah except for the disbelieving people.</span> </strong>(Soorah-Yoosuf (12), <em>aayah</em> 87)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَن يَقْنَطُ مِن رَّحْمَةِ رَبِّهِ إِلَّا الضَّالُّونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And who despairs of the mercy of his Lord except for those people who are astray.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ijr (15), <em>aayah</em> 56)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>قُلْ يَا عِبَادِيَ الَّذِينَ أَسْرَفُوا عَلَىٰ أَنفُسِهِمْ لَا تَقْنَطُوا مِن رَّحْمَةِ اللَّهِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say, </strong></span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“O my servants who have transgressed greatly against their own soulsǃ Do not despair of the mercy of Allaah.”</span> </strong>(Sooratuz-Zumar (39), <em>aayah</em> 53)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he should not fear with excessive fear, which causes him to despair of the mercy of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, for this is blameworthy fear. And likewise, he should have hope in Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, however, the hope should not take him and cause him to feel secure of the <em>makr</em> (plot or plan) of Allaah. Rather, he should be fearful of Allaah’s plan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the plan of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, is as befits Him and it is from His perfection. It is not like the <em>makr</em> (plotting) of the created beings, for <em>makr</em> (plotting) in the language is secretly striving for some harm to come upon someone else in a hidden manner such that he is not aware of it. This is what <em>makr</em> means in Arabic. So if that is done for a just cause then it is justice and this is the plotting or planning of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, for He plots against the wrongdoers and the evildoers and causes his punishment to come upon them in a way that they do not perceive and this is justice from Him, He, the Perfect. So He is praised for it but as for if causing harm to come upon someone else is not for a just cause then it is <em>dhulm</em> (oppression) and it is not permissible. And this is the <em>makr</em> (plotting) of the created beings but as for the plotting of the Creator, the Majestic and Most High, then it is something praiseworthy because it is justice and fairness from Him, He, the Perfect and Most High. So this is the difference between the two matters; between the plotting of Allaah and the plotting of the created beings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَكَرُوا وَمَكَرَ اللَّهُ ۖ وَاللَّهُ خَيْرُ الْمَاكِرِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they plot and Allaah plots. And Allaah is the best of those who plot</span>. </strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> 54)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a case of recompense for them. So it is not oppression from Him, He, the Perfect and Most High. Rather it comes about as a result of their plotting. They plotted and Allaah plotted against them as a punishment for them. And this is justice from Him, He, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“One of you may act with the actions of the people of Paradise until there is not between him and it except a cubit; forearms distance and then what was written overtakes him and he acts with the actions of the people of the Fire and therefore he enters it.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He enters the Fire on account of the fact that he has acted with the actions of the people of the Fire and the recompense comes as a result of the action. And since his conclusion was that he acted with the actions of the people of the Fire, he will enter the Fire and the opposite is the case:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“And one of you may act with the actions of the people of the Fire until there is not between him and it except a cubit; forearms distance so then what was written overtakes him and he acts with the actions of the people of the Paradise and therefore he enters it.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He enters it because he performed the actions of the people of Paradise and died upon it. So the Fire will not be entered into except on account of deeds and Paradise will not be entered into except on account of having performed deeds; and deeds are in accordance with their conclusions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person must not be deceived by his own righteousness or his uprightness and therefore feel secure from deviation. How many believers and how many Muslims and how many scholars Allaah has caused them to deviate when acts of disobedience occurred from them? So a person should not feel secure about himself nor praise his own self. So he should not feel secure from deviation and so on account of it mix with the evil people and listen to them and look into matters of trials and tribulations. He should not feel secure for himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The hearts of the servants are between two fingers from the fingers of the Most Merciful One.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He should not feel secure with regard to himself. And the <em>khaleel</em> (the especially beloved one); Ibraaheem <em>`alayhissalaam</em> made supplication (<em>du`a)</em> and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> وَاجْنُبْنِي وَبَنِيَّ أَن نَّعْبُدَ الْأَصْنَامَ<br />
رَبِّ إِنَّهُنَّ أَضْلَلْنَ كَثِيرًا مِّنَ النَّاسِ<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">… And keep me and my children away from worshipping the idols. O my Lord they have led many of the people astray.</span> </strong>(Soorah Ibraaheem (14), <em>aayah</em> 35-36)<strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person should not feel secure for himself from being put to trial and from having an evil conclusion even if he is from the most righteous of the people. And he shouldn’t despair of the mercy of Allaah even if he is one of the worst of the disbelieving ones from the people, for Allaah may favour him with repentance so that he dies upon Islaam and therefore enters Paradise. Because as long as he is still alive then he is open to this or that. So the actions are in accordance with their conclusions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and</strong> <strong>he should have good thoughts with respect to Allaah and he should fear his sins.” </strong></span>He should think good with regard to Allaah and not despair of the mercy of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and he should fear his sins,”</strong></span> meaning he should not hope with a hope that has no fear with it. Rather, he should gather between fear and hope.</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا يُسَارِعُونَ فِي الْخَيْرَاتِ وَيَدْعُونَنَا رَغَبًا وَرَهَبًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They used to hasten to perform good deeds and they worshipped Us and invoked Us upon hope and fear.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Anbiyaa· (21), <em>aayah</em> 90)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were the Prophets and they used to hasten to do good deeds and worship and invoke Allaah, <em>raghaban</em> (with hope); meaning hoping for His reward and <em>rahaban (</em>meaning fearing His punishment). So the Prophets gathered between fear and hope; they did not take one aspect and leave the other aspect. They did not take the aspect of hope and leave off the aspect of fear and they did not take up the aspect of fear and leave off the aspect of hope.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the servant should make his thoughts about Allaah good, particularly at the point of death. The scholars said, while the person is in a state of good health, he should cause the aspect of fear to predominate as a precaution and at the point of death, he should cause the aspect of hope to predominate. Because during life he is able to act and to repent and to seek forgiveness but at the point of death, he is not able to do anything so then he should give precedence to the aspect of hope. And therefore, there occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“One of you should not die except that he has good thoughts with respect to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“<strong>if Allaah has mercy upon him then it is from His favour and if He punishes him then it is on account of sin.” </strong></span>This is just as has preceded that Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, does not grant bliss to the people nor does He punish them except on account of their deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَلَا يَظْلِمُ رَبُّكَ أَحَدًا<br />
</strong><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord does not oppress anyone.</span><br />

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 51: Point 87</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that selling and buying is lawful if it is carried out in the markets of the Muslims in accordance with the rulings of the Book and the Sunnah as long as no deception, oppression or treachery is committed, nor anything contrary to the Qur&#8217;aan or contrary to what is known.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We hold as our belief that <em>al-bayy` wash-shiraa·</em> (buying and selling) is lawful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the, Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَأَحَلَّ اللَّهُ الْبَيْعَ وَحَرَّمَ الرِّبَا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Whereas Allaah has permitted trade and He has forbidden usury.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 275)</p>
<p><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَأْكُلُوا أَمْوَالَكُم بَيْنَكُم بِالْبَاطِلِ إِلَّا أَن تَكُونَ تِجَارَةً عَن تَرَاضٍ مِّنكُمْ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who believe, do not devour each other’s wealth unlawfully but only in lawful trade upon the basis of mutual consent between you. </strong></span>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah</em> 29)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِذَا نُودِيَ لِلصَّلَاةِ مِن يَوْمِ الْجُمُعَةِ فَاسْعَوْا إِلَىٰ ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ وَذَرُوا الْبَيْعَ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>فَإِذَا قُضِيَتِ الصَّلَاةُ فَانتَشِرُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ وَابْتَغُوا مِن فَضْلِ اللَّهِ وَاذْكُرُوا اللَّهَ كَثِيرًا لَّعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe when the call to the prayer is given on the day of <em>Jumu`ah</em> then proceed to the remembrance of Allaah and leave off trade. That is better for you if indeed you knew. So when the prayer is completed then disperse upon the earth and seek from the Bounty of Allaah.</span><span style="color:#008000;"> </span><span style="color:#008000;">And remember Allaah plentifully so that you may prosper.</span></strong>(Sooratul-Jumu`ah (62), <em>aayah</em> 9-10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning of seeking bounty is to seek provision.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said with regard to the mosques:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> يُسَبِّحُ لَهُ فِيهَا بِالْغُدُوِّ وَالْآصَالِ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>رِجَالٌ لَّا تُلْهِيهِمْ تِجَارَةٌ وَلَا بَيْعٌ عَن ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Wherein He (Allaah) is glorified in prayer in the mornings and the evenings by men who are not preoccupied by trade nor by sales away from the remembrance of Allaah&#8230;</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Noor (24), <em>aayah</em> 36-37)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Laa tulheehim</em> (they are not preoccupied, not diverted away). He did not say, “They do not buy and they do not engage in trade.” Rather, He said, “They are not diverted by their trading, away from the remembrance of Allaah.” Rather they attend the mosques and they pray along with the congregation, then they go off to their buying and their selling. And buying and selling is from the purest ways of earning if they are free from <em>ghish</em> (deception) and <em>khadee`ah</em> (trickery) and they are free from selling forbidden goods and from dealing in that which is forbidden and usury (<em>ribaa)</em>. So if buying and selling is free of things which corrupt it, then it is from the purest means of earning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“if the buying is done in the market places of the Muslims,”</span> </strong>whatever is brought to the market places of the Muslims then do not ask about it because the origin is permissibility unless it is something about which it is known that it is something forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“in accordance with the ruling of the Book and the Sunnah,” </strong></span>such that the well-known conditions for trade are fulfilled. So if the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>seven well-known conditions for trade</strong></span> are fulfilled then the transaction is correct and what is sold is <em><u>h</u>alaal</em> (lawful). And the origin is that the market places of the Muslims are established upon that basis.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“as long as no deception or oppression or treachery enters into it,” </strong></span>if deception enters into a transaction and an unknown factor and an element of chance then it will be forbidden (<em><u>h</u>araam)</em> because it has become a case of gambling. Or a case of <em>khidaa`</em> (trickery, swindling) such that he shows something, which is not the actual reality. He shows an item in an appearance, which is not the true reality and this is called <em>at-tadlees</em> (giving a false impression to something) and it is manifesting an item on sale in a form which pleases the one who looks at it but when it is in it&#8217;s unapparent state something different to that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Adh-dhulm; as long as dhulm (oppression) does not enter into the sale,” </strong></span>such that the owner has been compelled and forced to sell it, that he was made to do the transaction for a business transaction can only be <em>`an-taraa<u>d</u>in</em> (by mutual consent). He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“A business transaction can only be by mutual consent.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, said;</p>
<p><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَأْكُلُوا أَمْوَالَكُم بَيْنَكُم بِالْبَاطِلِ إِلَّا أَن تَكُونَ تِجَارَةً عَن تَرَاضٍ مِّنكُمْ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who believe, do not devour the wealth of each other unjustly except and unless it is a business transaction by mutual consent. </strong></span>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah</em> 29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So for the correctness of the sale, there is a condition that there is pleasure and consent of the seller and that he freely chooses to do so and is not compelled to do it because compelling him is oppression; forcing him to sell something he doesn’t want to sell. Unless the forcing him to sell is due to a right that is due such that he is a person who has debts upon him and he refuses to pay them back, for in that case, the judge or the ruler can intervene and can sell from his property what would be sufficient to pay off his debts even if he is not pleased with that because this is compulsion due to a right. And therefore, they said, “<strong>The sale of a person who does so by compulsion is not correct unless it is on account of a right; <em>illaa bi-haqq</em>.</strong>”<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point: </strong>With regard to the <span style="color:#000080;"><strong>seven well-known conditions</strong> </span>for a business transaction to be correct,they are mentioned below very briefly:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><em>Ar-ri<u>d</u>aa</em>: mutual consent.</li>
<li><em>Ar-rashad</em>: the one engaged in that transaction is suitable to be involved in business transactions. So it’s not permissible for a child below the age of discernment or a foolish one who doesn’t have the mental capacity to be involved in a business transaction if their guardian does not give permission.</li>
<li>The thing which is sold is some wealth, property from which permissible benefit can be taken.</li>
<li>The item sold is owned by the one who is selling it or he has permission granted to him to sell it at the time of the contract by its owner or by the legislator.</li>
<li>The ability to take and receive it.<span style="font-size:1rem;"><br />
Translator’s side-point: On the basis of a </span><u style="font-size:1rem;">h</u><span style="font-size:1rem;">adeeth; you can’t sell a runaway slave who has run away from his master, his master can’t sell him. Even if the person could go after him and chase and maybe catch him. That is not permissible. Rather, he has to have the ability to take receipt of the item being sold.</span></li>
<li>The price is something known and what is being paid for likewise is known.</li>
<li>It is a deal, which is being concluded. It is not being made a condition for something else.<strong style="font-size:1rem;"> </strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reference: <em>Al-Mubdi`</em> of Ibn Mufli<u>h</u>, <em>Ar-Rawd al-Murabba`</em> and <em>Manaar us-Sabeel</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s side point: The side examples I gave here are from the notes to <em>Manaar us-Sabeel</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Reported by Ibn Maajah and Ibn <u>H</u>ibbaan from Aboo Sa`eed al-Khudriyy <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>. And Al-Busayriyy said in Misbaah Az-Zujaajah, its chain of narration is <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em>, its narrators are reliable. And Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy said it is <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Translator’s side point: <strong><u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said: “The restriction of the author in his saying that <strong>“</strong><em>it is performed in the market places of the Muslims</em><strong>,”</strong> This is a point which requires examination because buying and selling is permissible even in other than the market places of the Muslims. Is it not permissible to buy and sell along with the Jews and Christians? Is it permissible or not? It is permissible that you can buy and sell and have mutual dealings and lease out and rent. This is a matter about which two people will not disagree and therefore the author <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> restricting it by his saying “<em>in the market places of the Muslims</em>,” I don’t see that there is a necessity for that here at this point. And rather, whoever wishes to buy and sell then let him buy and sell as he wishes in the lands of the Muslims, the lands of the Jews or the Christians, in the lands of the disbelievers, whatever. However, with the condition when that transaction does not aid them upon something false and futile or upon causing harm to the Muslims for e.g. selling weapons to a disbeliever who is at war with the Muslims, that would not be permissible.”</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 50: Points 84-86</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[84] And know that the beginning of Islaam is the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is His slave and His Messenger. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[85] And that whatever Allaah says is just as He said and nothing can contradict what He says and He is true to what He has said. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[86] And to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in all of the revealed laws.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/know-that-the-beginning-of-islaam-is-ash-shahaadataan" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said, “<strong>And you should know, O Muslim, O <em><u>t</u>aalib al-`ilm</em> (seeker of knowledge),” </strong>meaning you should be certain and understand clearly <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“that the beginning, the first part of Islaam is the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah.” </strong></span>These two are the first pillar from the pillars of Islaam as occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth of Jibreel in which Jibreel <em>`alayhissalaam</em> said to the Prophet<em> <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Tell me about Islaam.” He said, “Islaam is that you testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah and that you establish the prayer and that you give the Zakaat and that you fast Rama<u>d</u>aan and that you perform <u>H</u>ajj to the house if you are able to make the way to it.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <strong><em>Ash-Shahaadataan</em></strong> (the two testifications) are the first thing which mankind is to be called to. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“I have been commanded to fight against the people until they say: &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah&#8221;. So if they say it then they have rendered their blood and their property secure from me except on account of a right of Islaam and their reckoning will be with Allaah.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when he (the Prophet) sent Mu`aa<u>dh</u> to Yemen, he said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Indeed you are going to a people from the People of the Scripture, so let the first thing that you call them to be the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the first thing, which the people are to be called to because it is the entry point into the religion of Islaam. As for those who are lax about <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and do not give importance to it from the companions of the various calls and the present day methodologies utilising <em>da`wah,</em> then this is contrary to this tremendous fundamental principle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what is required with regard to the two testifications is not just to pronounce them upon the tongue. Rather, what is required is to state them upon the tongue whilst being aware of their meaning and to act in accordance with what they necessitate. However, whoever testifies that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah then it will be accepted from him. So if he is then upright upon it then he is a Muslim but if something appears from him, which contradicts them then he will be an apostate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the meaning of the testification that <em>Laa ilaaha illallaah</em>, that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah is that you hold as your belief in your heart and that you state upon your tongue and you affirm and you acknowledge that none is deserving of worship (<em>ibaadah)</em> except for Allaah and that everything that is worshipped besides Him is false and futile. And worship of it is false and futile.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْحَقُّ وَأَنَّ مَا يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ هُوَ الْبَاطِلُ وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْكَبِيرُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>That is because Allaah, He is the one who is truly deserving of worship and those whom they worship and invoke besides Him, that is false and futile. And Allaah is the Most High and Exalted One, the Incomparably Great One.</strong></span>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ajj (22), <em>aayah</em> 62)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the meaning of the testification <em>Anna Mu<u>h</u>ammadur-Rusoolullaah</em>; that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, is that you acknowledge outwardly and inwardly that he is the Messenger of Allaah. As for a person who states it upon his tongue but he does not acknowledge his messengership inwardly then this one is a <em>munaafiq</em> (hypocrite).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>إِذَا جَاءَكَ الْمُنَافِقُونَ قَالُوا نَشْهَدُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُ اللَّهِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُهُ وَاللَّهُ يَشْهَدُ إِنَّ الْمُنَافِقِينَ لَكَاذِبُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>When the hypocrites come to you </strong>(Mu<u>h</u>ammad<em> <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, they say, “We testify that you are the Messenger of Allaah.” And Allaah knows that you indeed are His Messenger and Allaah testifies that the hypocrites are certainly liars in their testifying.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Munaafiqoon (63), <em>aayah</em> 1)</p>
<p><strong> يَقُولُونَ بِأَفْوَاهِهِم مَّا لَيْسَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They say with their mouths that which is not in their hearts.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah</em> 167)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the meaning of the testification that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah; <em>Mu<u>h</u>ammadur-Rusoolullaah</em> is, in summary:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>To obey him in whatever he commanded and to attest to the truth of whatever he informed of and to avoid whatever he forbade and prohibited and that Allaah should not be worshipped except with that which He legislated.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>To obey him in whatever he commanded; </strong>so if the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> commanded a matter then you must comply with it.</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤْمِنٍ وَلَا مُؤْمِنَةٍ إِذَا قَضَى اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَمْرًا أَن يَكُونَ لَهُمُ الْخِيَرَةُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِمْ ۗ وَمَن يَعْصِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَالًا مُّبِينًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And it is not for a believing man nor for a believing woman when Allaah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any choice with regard to their affair. And whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger then he has strayed with a clear straying.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A<u>h</u>zaab (33), <em>aayah</em> 36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>To attest to the truth of whatever he informed of;</strong> he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed about some affairs of the <em>ghaib</em> (the hidden and the unseen) of the past and the future. So, he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is to be believed regarding whatever he informed of and he did not speak from desires.</p>
<p><strong>إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا وَحْيٌ يُوحَىٰ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">It is just revelation sent to him.</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Najm (53), <em>aayah</em> 4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, his <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informing about something is something true and something certain. No doubt can come upon it if it is authentic from him <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the phrase: <strong>“and to avoid whatever he forbade and prohibited,” </strong>avoiding whatever the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> forbade and prohibited, that is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا آتَاكُمُ الرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانتَهُوا ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whatever the Messenger gives you then accept it and whatever he forbids you from, then desist and fear and be dutiful to Allaah. Indeed Allaah is severe in punishment. </strong></span>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ashr (59), <em>aayah</em> 7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And that Allaah is not to be worshipped except with that which He legislated.” </strong>Whatever the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> legislated; conveying it from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. And this negates innovations and newly introduced affairs and baseless practices, which the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> did not command. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever does an action, which our affair is not in accordance with then it is rejected.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it then it is rejected.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“And beware of newly introduced affairs.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Adhere to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided orthodox Khulafaa· </span></strong><span style="color:#808000;">(Caliphs)</span><strong><span style="color:#808000;"> who come after me. Cling onto it and bite upon it with your pre-molar teeth. And beware of the newly introduced affairs for every newly introduced affair is a bid`ah </span></strong><span style="color:#808000;">(innovation)</span><strong><span style="color:#808000;"> and every innovation is a going astray</span><em>.</em></strong><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And every <em>`ibaadah</em> (worship), which the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> did not legislate then it is <em>baatilah</em> (false and futile) and there will be no reward in doing it. Rather, there will be sin in it because it is a <em>bid`ah</em> (innovation) and innovation takes a person further away from Allaah and will not draw him closer to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And you should know that the beginning of Islaam is the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger.” </strong></span>This is the first pillar and it is the entrance. Then after it comes the <em><u>S</u>alaah</em> (prayer) then after it comes the <em>Zakaat</em> then fasting <em>Rama<u>d</u>aan</em> then <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> to Allaah’s sacred house, then the rest of the duties and laws of the religion. All of them follow on from the two testifications; the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And that whatever Allaah said then it is just as He said and none can contradict what He has said and He is true to what He has said.”</span> </strong>Whatever Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, said then it is just as He has said. No doubt can ever come upon it. Allaah, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَنْ أَصْدَقُ مِنَ اللَّهِ حَدِيثًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And who is truer in speech than Allaah. </span><br />
</strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> 87)</span></p>
<p><strong>وَمَنْ أَصْدَقُ مِنَ اللَّهِ قِيلًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And who is truer than Allaah in saying.</span><br />
</strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> 122)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: no-one is truer than Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. And if Allaah, the Perfect makes a promise (<em>wa`d)</em> then He does not break it.</p>
<p><strong>وَعْدَ اللَّهِ ۖ لَا يُخْلِفُ اللَّهُ وَعْدَهُ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The promise of Allaah, it is a promise of Allaah, Allaah does not break His promises. However, most of mankind do not know that Allaah will certainly carry out His promise. </strong></span>(Sooratur-Room (30), <em>aayah </em>6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, when He makes a promise then He does not break His promise. And if He <em>tawa`adah</em> (threatens) something then He may pardon, He the Perfect and Most High. So there is a difference between <em>al-wa`d</em> (promises) and <em>at-tawa`ud</em> (threats). So <em>al-wa`d</em> (the promise), He never breaks a promise. And as for <em>at-tawa`ud</em> (a threat) that He has made; <em>al-wa`eed</em> (a threat) then Allaah, the Majestic and Most High may pardon and overlook and may not carry out the <em>wa`eed</em> (threat) as a mercy from Him, He, the Perfect, and as a favour from Him, He, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And to have <em>eemaan</em> in all of the revealed laws.” </strong></span>It is obligatory to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in all of the revealed laws, which Allaah sent down to His Messengers, all of them, in general with regard to those, which have been left unspecified and specifically with regard to those that have been mentioned specifically.</p>
<p><strong>قُولُوا آمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَمَا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْنَا وَمَا أُنزِلَ إِلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَالْأَسْبَاطِ وَمَا أُوتِيَ مُوسَىٰ وَعِيسَىٰ وَمَا أُوتِيَ النَّبِيُّونَ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ لَا نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِّنْهُمْ وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say, “We truly believe in Allaah and in whatever was sent down to us and in whatever was sent down to Ibraaheem and Ismaa`eel and Is<u>h</u>aaq and Ya`qoob and to the tribes and whatever was given to Moosaa and `Eesaa and whatever the Prophets were given from their Lord. We do not make any distinction between any of them and we submit as Muslims to Him.</strong></span>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 136)</p>
<p><strong>قُلْ آمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَمَا أُنزِلَ عَلَيْنَا وَمَا أُنزِلَ عَلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَالْأَسْبَاطِ وَمَا أُوتِيَ مُوسَىٰ وَعِيسَىٰ وَالنَّبِيُّونَ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ لَا نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِّنْهُمْ وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “We have <em>eemaan</em> </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(we truly believe)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> in Allaah and in whatever was sent down to us and in whatever was sent down to Ibraaheem and Ismaa`eel and Is<u>h</u>aaq and Ya`qoob and to the tribes and whatever was given to Moosaa and `Eesaa and to the Prophets from their Lord. We do not make any distinction between them and we are Muslims submitting to Him.</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>84)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, we have <em>eemaan</em> (we truly believe) in all of the divine laws sent down and we truly believe that Allaah, the Majestic and Most High legislates for each time whatever is suitable for it and then He abrogates that with another revealed law, which is suitable for those who come after them. So, when Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was sent, he came with a revealed law, which was firmly grounded and will remain until the Hour is established. It will not be abrogated and it will never be changed. It is suitable for every time and place.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 49: Point 83</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And the Zakaat is due upon gold, silver, dates, grain and cattle in accordance with what was stated by Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. S</em>o if he distributes it then that is permissible and if he hands it over to the ruler then that is permissible and Allaah knows best. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F385907090&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-obligation-of-giving-the-zakaat" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third pillar from the pillars of Islaam is the <em>Zakaat</em> and it is the constant companion of the <em>Salaat</em> (prayer) in many of the <em>aayahs</em> of the Qur&#8217;aan. And the Zakaat is a known due amount from the wealth of the rich to be given to the poor. And the types of wealth upon which the Zakaat is due are  four types:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>An-Naqdaan</strong> (the two forms of currency); gold and silver and that which can take their place with regard to paper currency.</li>
<li><strong>Baheematul An-`Aam</strong> (cattle); camels and cows and sheep.</li>
<li><strong>Al-Khaarij minal-Ard</strong> (that which grows from the earth) with regard to grains and fruits.</li>
<li><strong>Urood ut-Tijaarah</strong> (merchandise); goods which are traded in and it is merchandise, which is offered for buying and selling.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the types of wealth upon which Zakaat is due. As for everything besides these four types of wealth, then if a person wants to give in charity from it and to donate from it then that is up to him. The door to giving in charity and donation is open wide.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“<strong>So if he distributes it (the Zakaat himself) then that is permissible and if he hands it over to the ruler then that is permissible,”</strong></span> it is obligatory upon him to pay the Zakaat because of His saying, He, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَأَقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَآتُوا الزَّكَاةَ  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And establish the prayer and give the Zakaah</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>43)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Aatu</em>; meaning give it, hand it over. So it is obligatory upon the person possessing wealth that he hands it over and he is the one responsible for it. So if the ruler requests it so that he can take charge of it then it becomes obligatory to hand it over to him because obedience to him is obligatory and in order to free the one who gives it from responsibility because the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> used to send out collectors to take the Zakaat from the owners of wealth and to distribute it to those who were deserving of it. And those who are in authority take the place of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in that regard after him. And as for if the rulers don’t demand it then the responsibility is upon the person having the wealth.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> [2]</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> As for the explanation of <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he said: “The Zakaat, which is due upon gold and silver is 1/40<sup>th</sup> i.e 2.5%.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>ni<u>s</u>aab</em> (limit) (if you have that limit then it’s payable); for silver is 595 grams. As for the <em>ni<u>s</u>aab</em> (limit) for gold then it is 20 <em>mithqaals</em> and a <em>mithqaal</em> is 4.23 grams. (Translator’s side point: In other words, for gold &#8211; it works out at 85 grams; if you have 85 grams or more then you have to pay Zakaat upon it).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And dates and what has their meaning such as grapes; their <em>ni<u>s</u>aab</em> is 5 <em>wasaq</em> (loads).(Translator’s side point: They mention that as being something like 653 kg).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise cereal crops such as wheat and barley and corn and millet and rice, the <em>ni<u>s</u>aab</em> for each of these is also 5 loads and 1 <em>wasaq</em>(load) is 60 <em>sa`as</em>; (60 prophetic <em>sa`as)</em>, <em>Allaahu A`lam.</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the cattle then the limits for them are well-known.</p>
<p>[2] <strong>Translator&#8217;s Sidepoint</strong> regarding the Zakah on merchandise, goods for trade</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to the 4<sup>th</sup> category of wealth i.e merchandise, goods for trade &#8211; Shaykh Fowzaan mentions here that is the view of the great majority of the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al Fowzaan</strong> said in his book <em>Al-Mulakha<u>s</u> al-Fiqhee</em>, “More than one have quoted consensus (<em>Ijmaa`)</em> of the People of Knowledge that upon goods which are traded; Zakaat is obligatory upon them, if a year has passed over them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh ul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah</strong> said: The four Imaams and the rest of the nation except for some isolated ones are agreed that it is obligatory to pay it upon the goods for trade. And you can find the rest of the speech of Shaykh ul Islaam in <em>Majmoo` al- Fataawa</em> volume 25, page 15.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the same point <strong>Imaam Ash-Shawkaanee</strong> in his book <em>Nayl al-Aw<u>t</u>aar</em>, he mentioned the same view that it’s obligatory to pay Zakaat upon the goods for trade. Then later on he changed his view in other books <em>Al-Sayl al-Jarraar</em> and <em>Ad-Daraaree al-Mu<u>d</u>iyyah</em> that he mentioned something different (changed the view and said it’s not obligatory) because trade used to occur in his time (<em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) in all the forms of that which was traded in and it is not reported from him anything, which would necessitate this. And Imam Shawkaanee said : &#8220;Ibn ul-Mundhir claimed that there is <em>Ijmaa</em>` consensus upon Zakaat being upon trade but this quote is not correct. So the first of those who disagreed with that are the <u>Dh</u>aahirees and they are a group from the groups of Islaam.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, finally <strong>Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy</strong> mentioned in <em>Tamaam ul-Minnaah</em> that his view was, he said, “<strong>What is the truth is that the saying that Zakaat is not obligatory upon the goods for trade is what is correct because there is no proof for it from the Book or the authentic Sunnah</strong>.” And then he mentioned this saying that it being not obligatory was the saying of some of the scholars before and some of the scholars such as Ataa Abee Rabaa<u>h</u> from the <em>Taabi`een</em> and Ibn <u>H</u>azm and <u>S</u>iddeeq <u>H</u>assan Khaan from the later scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Side point: And likewise, Ibn Qudaamah mentioned in <em>Al-Mughnee</em> this as being the saying of Daawood A<u>dh</u>&#8211;<u>Dh</u>aahiree and also related from Imaam Maalik as one saying, <em>W`Allaahu A`lam</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 49: Point 82</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b style="color:#993300;">And know that the obligatory prayers are five. There is to be no increase in them nor any reduction in their set times. And upon a journey they consist of two </b><em style="color:#993300;font-weight:bold;">Rak`ahs</em><b style="color:#993300;"> except for the Maghrib prayer. Whoever says that they are more than five then he has innovated and whoever says that they are less than five then he has innovated. Allaah will not accept any of them unless they are performed within their times except for the one who forgets then he is excused and must perform it when he remembers it and the </b><span style="color:#993300;"><b>traveler</b></span><b style="color:#993300;"> who may combine the two prayers if he wishes.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F385024055&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-obligatory-prayers-are-five" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The five obligatory prayers have tremendous importance. And it is the second pillar (<em>rukn)</em> from the pillars of Islaam after the two testifications. And whoever abandons it denying its obligation then he is a <em>kaafir </em>(disbeliever) by consensus (<em>Ijmaa`</em> ) of the Muslims. And whoever abandons it <em>takaasulan</em> (out of laziness) whilst acknowledging that this is obligatory then he is a disbeliever upon the correct saying from the two sayings of the scholars. And the proof is his <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam’s</em> saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Between the servant and between disbelief, there is the abandonment of the prayer.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The covenant that is between us and them is the prayer. So whoever abandons it then he has disbelieved.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is clear. And he did not say whoever abandoned it denying its obligation. Rather, he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> made it general along with many evidences, which this is not the place to quote in full.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the prayers became settled at five prayers every day and night. The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said to Mu`aadh ibn Jabal when he sent him to Yemen:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Let the first thing that you call them to be the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah. So if they accept that from you then inform them that Allaah has made five prayers obligatory upon them.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it was made obligatory upon the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and upon his nation on the night of the <em>Mi`raaj</em> (ascent) through the Heavens, which shows its importance. They were first made obligatory as 50 in each day and night. Then the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> returned to his Lord for a reduction until Allaah made it 5 with regard to its performance and they are 50 in the balance because a single good deed is rewarded with 10 times its like. So a single prayer is for 10 prayers. So, it is multiplied to 50 prayers but as for the action then it is 5 prayers in the day and the night.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So whoever says that the prayers are more than 5 then he is a <em>mubtadi’ </em>(innovator) because he has added something into the religion that is not from it and whoever says that they are less than 5 as is said by a sect of the innovators and the people of misguidance that they are 3.</strong> <strong>The prayers are confirmed by the Book and the Sunnah and the consensus of the Muslims as being five prayers.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>أَقِمِ الصَّلَاةَ لِدُلُوكِ الشَّمْسِ إِلَىٰ غَسَقِ اللَّيْلِ وَقُرْآنَ الْفَجْرِ ۖ إِنَّ قُرْآنَ الْفَجْرِ كَانَ مَشْهُودًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Establish the prayers from the time when the sun passes the Zenith until the darkness of the night and establish the recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan in the dawn prayer. Indeed the recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan in the dawn prayer is attended by the angels of the night and the day.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Israa· (17), <em>aayah</em> 78)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> explained them by his saying and his action and they have set times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّ الصَّلَاةَ كَانَتْ عَلَى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ كِتَابًا مَّوْقُوتًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The prayer is a duty prescribed for the believers at set times.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah</em> 103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: An obligatory duty at set times. Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> clearly explained them by his saying and his action. It is not permissible to take them out of their times except on the condition of a valid excuse such as he has slept or forgotten until the time finishes. So then when he remembers or wakes up it becomes obligatory for him to hasten to perform the prayer whatever time it is. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever forgets a prayer or sleeps through it then let him pray it when he remembers it. There is no expiation for it except that.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for deliberately letting it pass beyond its time then it will not be correct from him even if he prays it because he has not prayed the prayer which Allaah commanded him with. Rather, he has just prayed a prayer in accordance with his own desires. So if he deliberately lets it go outside its time then it will not be accepted from him even if he does pray it. So what is upon him is <em>at-tawbah</em> (repentance), that he repents to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic and is constant upon observance of the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the number of the <em>rak`ahs</em> (prayer units in each prayer) was explained by the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. The Fajr prayer is 2 <em>rak`ahs</em> and the Maghrib is 3 <em>rak`ahs</em> because it is the odd number of prayer of the day. And the <u>Dh</u>uhr prayer is 4 <em>rak`ahs</em> and the `A<u>s</u>r prayer is 4 <em>rak`ahs</em> and the `Ishaa· prayer is 4 <em>rak`ahs</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when on a journey, the 4 <em>rak`ah</em> prayers are reduced to 2 <em>rak`ahs</em>; the <u>Dh</u>uhr prayer and the `A<u>s</u>r prayer and the `Ishaa· prayer as occurs in the established Sunnah from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. A</em>nd that occurs in the Qur&#8217;aan:</p>
<p><strong>وَإِذَا ضَرَبْتُمْ فِي الْأَرْضِ فَلَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَقْصُرُوا مِنَ الصَّلَاةِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And when you travel upon the earth then there is no blame upon you if you shorten the prayer.</span> </strong></span>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah</em> 101)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Fajr (dawn) prayer then it remains as two <em>rak`ahs</em> and as for the Maghrib prayer then it is not shortened because it is the witr (odd numbered) prayer of the day time. So if it were shortened then the number of <em>rak`ahs</em> of the day time would become even. And this is how the <em>a<u>h</u>aadeeth</em> occur regarding the prayer. So it is not permissible for anyone to interfere with them; either adding or deleting or taking it out of its time.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Muslim (82) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Jaabir <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> with the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Between a man and between shirk &amp; kufr is the abandonment of the prayer.”</strong></span><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad in the Musnad and by at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee and Ibn Maajah and an-Nasaa·ee from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Buraydah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>. And at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee said it is <em><u>h</u>asan, <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (good, authentic) and it was declared authentic by Ibn <u>H</u>ibbaan and by al-<u>H</u>aakim in Al-Mustadrak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> declared it <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> also in his checking of at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee; declared it <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy in his <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em>; you’ll find it there in a number of places; the first of them being no. 1,395 and also reported by Muslim (19) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of `Abdullaah ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (597) and Muslim (684) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Anas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5">[5]</a> Translator’s side point: <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said regarding the point &#8211; Imaam al-Barbahaaree said that &#8220;<em>whoever adds to those five or deletes from the five prayers then he has innovated&#8221;</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“As for the saying of the author here, “<strong>then he has innovated,</strong>” this is different to his usual practice for he very often uses the wording of disbelief for things which are less than full disbelief and here he used the word innovation whilst knowing that whoever says that the obligatory prayer is more than five or less then he has become a disbeliever by consensus of the People of Knowledge. This being based upon <em>Tawaatur</em> (something reported by huge number of people throughout the generations at every level).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then, these five every one of them is well-known with regard to the number of its <em>rak`ahs</em> so the dawn prayer is 2 <em>rak`ahs</em> and the <u>Dh</u>uhr and `A<u>s</u>r are 4 and Maghrib is 3 and `Ishaa· is 4.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not permissible when in residence to pray less than that and whoever does that claiming that the prayer has been reduced or increased then he is to be made aware of the matter if he is ignorant and if he then still persists then he has disbelieved. So the number of their <em>rak`ahs</em> is taken by narration, which has been passed down by generation after generation from the time of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> to this time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is not permissible to pray less than that except when on a journey in which case the 4 <em>rak`ah</em> prayers are reduced to 2 <em>rak’ahs</em> as is proven by the evidences. And whoever claims that the Maghrib prayer or the dawn prayer should be shortened then he is to be made aware and if he still persists then he becomes a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, their due times have been taken from what has been passed down from one whole generation to the next by transmission of the action and transmission of the saying. So every obligatory prayer from the obligatory prayers has a separate time and its time has a beginning and an end. And it is not permissible to bring it before its time nor to delay it beyond it except that it is permissible for the traveler to gather two prayers due to the ruling of his being a traveler; either delaying the earlier one to the time of the later one and that is by consensus or bringing the second one forward and praying it along with the first one in the time of the first one in the view of some of the People of Knowledge who hold that the <u>h</u>adeeth in that regard is authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is permissible for a person who is ill to combine the prayers to repel difficulty which occurs with praying each obligatory prayer in its specific time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And whoever makes just three times for prayer like the Shi`a; those who permit joining always such that they join the `A<u>s</u>r with the <u>Dh</u>uhr prayer at the time of <u>Dh</u>uhr and they join the `Ishaa· along with the Maghrib at the time of Maghrib based upon the saying of some of their Imaams. Then whoever does that from them and believes it’s permissible then he is an innovator astray. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as is also the case of one who combines `A<u>s</u>r along with Maghrib (the day time prayer along with the night time prayer) or who combines `Ishaa· prayer along with Fajr then he is <em>daalun</em> (astray) also. So therefore <em>jam’</em> (combining the prayers) cannot be except two obligatory prayers, which can share in their times meaning Dhuhr prayer along with `A<u>s</u>r or Maghrib along with `Ishaa·.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whoever abandons the prayer deliberately until its time has passed then he has disbelieved because of the authentic evidences which prove that. From them is his <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam’s</em> saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Between a man and between shirk and kufr is the abandonment of the prayer.”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them is his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The covenant between us and them is the prayer so whoever abandons it then he has disbelieved.”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…to the rest of the evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>jumhoor</em> (great majority) hold that the one who abandons the prayer is not a disbeliever (meaning he abandons it out of laziness) on account of that, yet still in spite of this many of them hold that his repentance should be sought. So either he’ll repent from that otherwise he is to be executed with the prescribed punishment. And the matter there is disagreement between the people of knowledge and Allaah, the Most High, knows best. Unless he leaves it on account of a valid excuse, which is forgetfulness or sleep then it’s obligatory upon him to pray it when he remembers it because of the <u>h</u>adeeth of Anas ibn Maalik <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> who said “The Prophet of Allaah <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever forgets a prayer or sleeps through it then his expiation is to pray it when he remembers it because Allaah, the Most High says:</strong></span></p>
<p><strong> وَأَقِمِ الصَّلَاةَ لِذِكْرِي</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And establish the prayer for my remembrance.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah-<u>T</u>aa Haa (20) <em>aayah</em> 14)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah is the one who grants success.”</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 48: Point 81</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> that Allaah will punish the creation in the Fire in shackles, fetters and chains. The Fire will be inside them and above them and below them. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Whereas, the Jahmiyyah among them <u>H</u>ishaam al-Foo<u>t</u>ee said, “<em>Allaah will only punish them next to the Fire</em>” in rebuttal of Allaah and His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“<strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) that Allaah will punish the creation in the Fire in shackles, fetters and chains. The Fire will be inside them and above them and beneath them,” </strong></span>Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, will cause the Fire to blaze with the bodies of the disbelievers. So they are firewood for the Fire of Hell.</p>
<p><strong>وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمْ وَقُودُ النَّارِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (the disbelievers)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> are fuel for the Fire.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah-Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It will burn with them and use their bodies as fuel and Allaah’s refuge is sought.</p>
<p><strong>فَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا قُطِّعَتْ لَهُمْ ثِيَابٌ مِّن نَّارٍ يُصَبُّ مِن فَوْقِ رُءُوسِهِمُ الْحَمِيمُ ..</strong></p>
<p><strong>يُصْهَرُ بِهِ مَا فِي بُطُونِهِمْ وَالْجُلُودُ </strong></p>
<p><strong>وَلَهُم مَّقَامِعُ مِنْ حَدِيدٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So those who disbelieve will have garments of Fire put out for them, boiling water will be poured down from above upon their heads. It will melt their insides and their skins. And there will be for them hooked rods of iron with which they will be beaten.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ajj (22), <em>aayah </em>19-21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah mentioned that the torment will occur upon the bodies of the disbelievers and that the Fire will burn with them and blaze away consuming them.</p>
<p><strong> يُصَبُّ مِن فَوْقِ رُءُوسِهِمُ الْحَمِيمُ ..</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">…<strong> Boiling water will be poured down upon their heads from above. </strong></span>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ajj (22), <em>aayah </em>19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the Mu`tazilah, there are those who said, <em>“They will not be tortured and the Fire will not blaze away burning their bodies. Rather, they will be punished by the Fire only. As for their bodies then they will not actually burn.”</em> Whereas, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says in the Qur&#8217;aan that they are the Fuel of the Fire and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The first of those whom the Fire will blaze on the Day of Resurrection will be the scholar who did not act upon his knowledge and the one who gave in charity who shows off in giving charity and the mujaahid (who fought in Allaah’s path) who fought to show off.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word <strong><em>al-aghlaal</em></strong> (shackles), its meaning is that his hands will be bound to his neck and Allaah’s refuge is sought. And <strong><em>al-ankaal</em></strong> (fetters) are instruments of torture.</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّا أَعْتَدْنَا لِلْكَافِرِينَ سَلَاسِلَ وَأَغْلَالًا وَسَعِيرًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We have prepared for the disbelievers iron chains and fetters to bind their hands and a blazing Fire. </strong></span><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratul-Insaan (76), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah </em><span style="font-size:1rem;">4)</span></p>
<p><strong>إِنَّ لَدَيْنَا أَنكَالًا وَجَحِيمًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">We have fetters and a raging Fire.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Muzammil (73), <em>aayah </em>12)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This word <em>al-ankaal</em> (fetters), they are instruments of torture; Allaah’s refuge is sought. Chains and shackles and a blazing Fire. And the Fire will be in their bellies inside of them and above them and beneath them.</p>
<p><strong>لَهُم مِّن جَهَنَّمَ مِهَادٌ وَمِن فَوْقِهِمْ غَوَاشٍ ۚ وَكَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِي الظَّالِمِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They (the disbelievers) will have the Hellfire as a bed. Over them, there will be coverings of Fire and likewise, We will recompense the disbelieving wrongdoers.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> With regard to this person mentioned here who needs refuting amongst others; <u>H</u>ishaam al-Foo<u>t</u>ee. In the footnotes they mention that Al-<u>H</u>aafidh ibn <u>H</u>ajar said about him in <em>Lisaan al-Mizaan</em>; he was <u>H</u>ishaam ibn Umar al-Foo<u>t</u>ee, he was from the companions of Al-Hu<u>dh</u>ayl and he was a caller to the position of the Mu`tazilah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> mentions in his lectures of the explanation, he said, “His teacher was <strong>Al-Hu<u>dh</u>ayl</strong>, well-known as Al-`Allaaf and that he had this deviated belief that those who enter the Hellfire, after they have been in the Fire for some time, they will become of the same nature as the Fire so it will become natural for them to the extent that they will feel delight in the Fire. His student <u>H</u>ishaam al-Foo<u>t</u>ee differed with his teacher, he refused to accept that they would actually enter the Fire.

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 48: Point 80</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that heresy, disbelief, doubts, innovations, misguidance and confusion about the religion have not occurred except through rhetorical theology (<em>al-kalaam)</em> and the people of rhetorical theology and through argumentation, debating, disputing and self-amazement. And how can a man boldly enter into debating, disputing and argumentation when Allaah, the Most High says:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>مَا يُجَادِلُ فِي آيَاتِ اللَّهِ إِلَّا الَّذِينَ كَفَرُو</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>None dispute regarding the aayaat of Allaah except those who disbelieve.</strong></span><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Soorah-Ghaafir (40), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah 4</em><span style="font-size:1rem;">)</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So, upon you is to submit and to be pleased and satisfied with the narrations and to withhold and remain silent.</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Explanation of this has preceded and a warning against it.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“So what is upon you is to submit and to be pleased and satisfied with the narrations and to withhold and remain silent.”</span> </strong>Upon you is to submit to the speech of Allaah and to the speech of His Messenger and to withhold from argumentation and raising doubts because that is prohibited. Indeed it will increase confusion. Take hold of the speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger and be satisfied with that so that you are guided and therefore be at peace from whisperings, doubts and false ideas and you will come to be upon clear insight. So Allaah sent down this Qur&#8217;aan as a clarification of everything.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator’s side point: With regard to <em>al-kalaam</em> (rhetorical theology) then <strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said with regard to the meaning of <em>kalaam</em>; it means logic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Translator’s side point: Page 125, for this 1<sup>st</sup> volume, point number 11.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to these Points at the below Links:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Point 10:</strong> <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/12/02/theological-rhetoric-arguing-debating-disputing-are-all-newly-introduced-affairs/">Al-kalaam (theological rhetoric), arguing, debating and disputing are newly introduced affairs</a></p>
<p><strong>Point 11: </strong><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/12/02/speculative-speech-kalaam-about-allaah-is-an-innovation-and-misguidance/">Speculative speech (kalaam) about Allaah, the Most High, is an innovation and misguidance</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Translator’s side point: Explanation of <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he said: The author said, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And you should know that there has not been any heresy or any disbelief,”</strong></span> I say, “Restricting heresy to be a result of <em>al-kalaam</em> (rhetorical theology) and to the people of rhetorical theology and to the people of disputing and argumentation, this refers to what’s mostly the case. However, indeed there are cases of heresy and disbelief, which come about for other reasons besides <em>kalaam</em> (rhetorical theology). And we seek Allaah’s refuge from all the causes of heresy and disbelief and doubts and innovations, Aameen. However, this is what is generally the case with regard to a person who learns <em>kalaam</em> (rhetorical theology) and those who learn the different forms of debating and argumentation and self-amazement. And what is obligatory is to not be amazed at one’s self. And a person’s being outstanding in debating and argumentation is something which is blameworthy in the legislation unless it is to make the truth clear. And there occurs in the authentic <u>h</u>adeeth from the a<u>h</u>aadeeth of `Aa`ishah<em> ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhaa</em> that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The most hated of men to Allaah is the argumentative quarrelsome person.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (2457) and Muslim (2668).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the narration of At-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah hates that person who is very eloquent from the men, the one who moves his tongue around just as the cows move their tongues around.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Tirmi<u>th</u>ee (2,853) and declared <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic) by Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then the author<em> ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said, <strong>“<span style="color:#993300;">How can a person be bold upon argumentation and disputing</span></strong> when Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>مَا يُجَادِلُ فِي آيَاتِ اللَّهِ إِلَّا الَّذِينَ كَفَرُو</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>None dispute regarding the aayaat of Allaah except those who disbelieve.</strong></span></span><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Soorah-Ghaafir (40), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah 4</em><span style="font-size:1rem;">)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So upon you is to submit and to be pleased and satisfied with the narrations and to withhold and be silent.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I say &#8211; what is befitting for the Muslim is to submit to whatever comes from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, in His Book and upon the tongue of His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and to withhold and be silent whatever is besides that knowing that submission to what occurs from the bringer of the legislation <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> should be a submission of <em>ri<u>d</u>aa</em> (being pleased and satisfied) and based upon acceptance and <em>eemaan</em> and attesting to the truth, acting upon whatever requires action from it and believing whatever it necessitates that we believe in. Allaah, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَالْعَصْرِ</strong><br />
<strong>إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ</strong><br />
<strong>إِلَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالْحَقِّ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">By time, mankind is in loss except those who have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) and work righteous and correct deeds and they encourage each other with the truth and they encourage each other with patience.</span> </strong><span style="text-align:justify;font-size:1rem;">(Sooratul-Asr, </span><em style="text-align:justify;font-size:1rem;">aayah</em><span style="text-align:justify;font-size:1rem;"> 1-3)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the meaning of `<strong><em>aamanoo</em> </strong>is <strong><em><u>s</u>addaqoo</em></strong>: they believe and attest to the truth.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 48: Point 79</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that the first ones who will see Allaah, the Most High, in Paradise are the blind then the men then the women with the eyes of their heads just as Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, “You shall certainly see your Lord just as you see the moon on the night when it is full. You will not have any difficulty in seeing Him. It is obligatory to have <em>eemaan</em> in this and denying it is disbelief.”</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The topic of affirmation of <em>ar-ru&#8217;yah</em> (seeing Allaah, the Most High, in the Hereafter) has <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/12/03/true-believers-will-see-their-lord-on-the-day-of-resurrection/"><strong>preceded</strong> </a>and this is re-emphasis of what has preceded and as for this order, which the author mentioned then it needs a proof. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Listen/Read @<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/12/03/true-believers-will-see-their-lord-on-the-day-of-resurrection/"><br />
<strong>The true believers will see their Lord on the Day of Resurrection openly with their eyes</strong></a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> The <u>h</u>adeeth in that regard that we had before in the book with regard to seeing Allaah, the Most High in the Hereafter, not with regard to the order is the <u>h</u>adeeth of Jaabir <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>, reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (554) and Muslim (633).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And on this specific point, the point of this order that those who will see Allaah first are the blind then the men then the women, the one doing the footnotes in one of the versions Khaalid ar-Raddaadi, he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There occurs in this regard a <u>h</u>adeeth which is traced back to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> but it is not authentic. It was mentioned by Ad-Dailamee in his book <em>Firdaws ul-Akhbaar</em> from Samurah ibn Jundub from him tracing back to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> but it’s not authentic. And also al-Laalikaa`ee in his book <em>As-Sunnah</em> quoted this with a weak chain of narration as being the saying of Al-Hasan al-Basree; the Taabi`ee.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said in explanation of this point,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The author <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> made clear that <strong>whoever denies seeing the Creator has disbelieved</strong>. This ruling is a general ruling because whoever denies a matter which is known necessarily from the religion then he’s a disbeliever. As for the person who is overcome by a false doubt (<em>shubhah)</em> and he doesn’t know how to resolve this doubt or he resolves it with a mistake then this is a different matter. Those matters that a person does based upon a false doubt that comes upon him and is not able to arrive at what is correct in the matter then we leave his affair to Allaah. However, if he is a person who knowingly denies these matters then he has disbelieved.”</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 48: Point 78</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that there are three forms of address for the tidings that are given when one dies.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> It may be said, <em><span style="color:#800000;">“Receive good tidings O beloved one of Allaah, of Allaah’s pleasure and of Paradise”</span></em> or </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>it may be said, <span style="color:#800000;"><em>“Receive good tidings O servant of Allaah of Paradise on account of Islaam”</em></span> or </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>it may be said, <span style="color:#800000;"><em>“Receive tidings O enemy of Allaah, of Allaah’s anger and of the Fire.” </em></span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>This was the saying of Ibn Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>.</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F383901782&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The person who is dying whether he is a believer or a disbeliever, will be given tidings at the point of death. So, if he is a believer, he will be given good tidings of Allaah’s mercy and of Paradise. And if he is a disbeliever, he will be given tidings of Allaah’s anger and of the Fire. So, he will not actually die till he knows where he will be and it will not be possible for him to repent or to free himself or to increase in righteous deeds. This is what occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever loves to meet Allaah then Allaah will love to meet him.” So `A`ishah said, “Oh Messenger of Allaah, all of us dislike death.” Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, “That is not the case, O `A`ishah but rather the believer at the point of death will be given good tidings and so therefore, he will love to meet Allaah and so Allaah will love to meet him. Whereas, the disbeliever will be given tidings of the Fire so therefore, he will hate the meeting with Allaah so Allaah will hate to meet him.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ ثُمَّ اسْتَقَامُوا فَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those who said, “Our Lord is Allaah” and then they remain upright then there will be no fear upon them nor shall they grieve.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Ahqaaf (46), <em>aayah</em> 13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ ثُمَّ اسْتَقَامُوا تَتَنَزَّلُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ أَلَّا تَخَافُوا وَلَا تَحْزَنُوا وَأَبْشِرُوا بِالْجَنَّةِ الَّتِي كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those who said, “Our Lord is Allaah” then they remained upright then the angels will descend upon them saying, “Fear not and do not grieve and receive glad tidings of Paradise, which you were promised.”</span> </strong>(Soorah-Fussilat (41), <em>aayah</em> 30)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَلَوْ تَرَىٰ إِذْ يَتَوَفَّى الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا ۙ الْمَلَائِكَةُ يَضْرِبُونَ وُجُوهَهُمْ وَأَدْبَارَهُمْ وَذُوقُوا عَذَابَ الْحَرِيقِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And if you could see when the angels take the souls of the disbelievers striking their faces and their backs saying, “Taste the punishment of the Blazing Fire.”</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Anfaal (8), <em>aayah</em> 50)</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 47: Point 77</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And Allaah, the Exalted and Most High Hears, Sees and Knows. His two Hands are outstretched. He knew that the creation would disobey Him before He created them. His Knowledge takes effect upon them, however, His Knowledge of them did not prevent Him from guiding them towards Islaam. He favoured them with it out of His Generosity, Munificence and Favour so all praise is for Him.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F383448971&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/affirmation-of-attributes-of-allaah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And Allaah, the Perfect and Most High Hears, Sees and Knows.”</span> </strong>This is the third type from the types of Tawheed; to affirm <em>Al-Asma Wa-<u>S</u>ifaat</em> (Names and Attributes) for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, just as they occur in the Book and the Sunnah, along with believing in their meanings and whatever they indicate and not entering into the <em>kayfiyyah</em> (how they are) because how they are is not known except to Allaah but as for their meaning then it is something known. So, it is obligatory upon you to affirm them and to hold as your creed what they indicate just as Imaam Maalik said, “Allaah, the Most High ascended over His Throne.” The ascending is something known. Known in its meaning and how is unknown.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“He knew that the creation were going to disobey Him even before He created them.”</span> </strong>Allaah has knowledge of everything. He knew what was going to occur &#8211; from <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and from <em>kufr</em> (disbelief) and from obedience and from disobedience; nothing is hidden from Him. He knew it before He created the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“His Knowledge of them did not prevent Him from guiding them towards Islaam.” </strong></span>Even though He knew what they would commit from disbelief and from <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) then Allaah called them to Islaam and He called them to true faith; <em>eemaan</em> and He sent the Messengers and He sent down the Books for their guidance and He knew what they would do. However, from His mercy, He did not just leave them and entrust them to His Knowledge about them. Rather, He established the proof upon them and He gave them <em>ikhtiyaar</em> (choice) and <em>mashee&#8217;ah</em> (will) and <em>qudrah</em> (ability). So, they are able to act. So, if they leave action then the sin is their sin and the shortcoming is their shortcoming.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, guides all of the creation; the believers and the disbelievers. With the meaning that He makes the affair clear to all of them. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>.. وَأَمَّا ثَمُودُ فَهَدَيْنَاهُمْ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">As for Thamood then We showed them the way ..</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah-Fu<u>ss</u>ilat (41), <em>aayah </em>17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>We guided them, showed them the way: </strong>meaning, We made it clear to them and directed them towards it. However, they did not accept this. They obstinately rejected and were haughty.</p>
<p><strong>فَاسْتَحَبُّوا الْعَمَىٰ عَلَى الْهُدَىٰ فَأَخَذَتْهُمْ صَاعِقَةُ الْعَذَابِ الْهُونِ بِمَا كَانُوا يَكْسِبُونَ ..</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">.. However, they loved blind error over and above guidance so the awful blast of humiliating torment seized them on account of the sins that they used to earn.</span> </strong>(Soorah-Fussilat (41), <em>aayah </em>17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, on account of what they earned and it was not just because Allaah knew that and decreed it for them but rather because of what they actually earned by their choice and their will and their action. So, guidance; <strong><em>hidaayah</em> </strong>is of two kinds:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>Hidaayatul Irshaad</strong> (the guidance of giving direction) and this is general to the believer and the disbeliever,</li>
<li><strong>Hidaayatut-Tawfeeq</strong> (the guidance of being granted the success of accepting that guidance). This is specific to the believers, those who accepted the guidance of Allaah and His direction. So, Allaah grants them the success of its attainment and He makes them firm.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So He guided them towards Islaam. And He favoured them with it from His Generosity and His Munificence and His Favour. So all praise is for Him.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“From His Generosity,” </strong>meaning that He called them and made clear to them and clarified to them from His Generosity and He bestowed favour because of their need of that. And as for Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, then He has no need at all of them whether they disbelieve or whether they believe, whether they obey or whether they disobey, they will not harm Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, nor will they benefit Him because He is <em>Ghaniyy</em> (independent), He has no need at all of them and this, its benefit or harm only rebounds upon them. So from His mercy upon them, He made clear to them the way of good and the way of evil, and He gave them strength and He gave them ability, and He gave them intellects with which they could distinguish between what harms and what benefits.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 47: Point 76</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And it is not permissible to withhold <em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah </em>(sincere advice) from anyone from the Muslims, whether righteous or sinful in matters of the religion.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> So, whoever withholds it then he has acted deceitfully towards the Muslims and whoever acts deceitfully towards the Muslims then he has acted deceitfully towards the religion, and whoever acts deceitfully towards the religion then he has shown treachery towards Allaah, His Messenger and the believers.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F382959317&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/ad-deenu-an-naseehah-the-religion-is-sincerity" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<span style="color:#993300;"> “<strong>And it is not permissible for you to withhold <em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincere advice) from anyone from the Muslims whether they be righteous or sinful,” </strong></span><em>An-<strong>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</strong></em> (sincerity) is to be pure and free of <strong><em>ghish</em> </strong>(deceit) and a thing that is <em>naa<u>s</u>i<u>h</u></em>; a thing that has its quality of <em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em>, it is a thing that is <em>khaali<u>s</u></em> (pure). So, the believer, it is obligatory that he should be <em>naa<u>s</u>i<u>h</u></em> (sincere); meaning that he should be pure and free of hypocrisy; <em>nifaaq</em> and he should be pure and free of <em>ghish</em> (deceptiveness) and he should be pure and free of <em>khadee`ah</em> (cheating). His outward aspect and his inward aspect should be just the same with regard to truthfulness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity) is the religion just as the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The religion is an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</strong> <strong>(sincerity), the religion is sincerity, the religion is sincerity; an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah. We said, ‘Towards whom O Messenger of Allaah?’ So he said, ‘Towards Allaah and towards His Book and towards His Messenger and towards the rulers of the Muslims and their common folk.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what is meant by it (<em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em>) here is that a person is free of every blameworthy characteristic and that he adorns himself with all the noble and virtuous manners and characteristics. So, the man who is <em>naa<u>s</u>i<u>h</u></em> (has this quality of sincerity) is the one who is not deceptive, does not have any <em>ghish</em> (deceptive) towards anyone. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever deceives us is not from us.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the opposite of <em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity) is <strong><em>al-ghish</em></strong> (deceptiveness). And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> repeated his saying <em>ad-deenun</em> <em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (the religion is sincerity) three times for emphasis and to stress its importance and he limited the religion; all of it to being <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>An-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity) towards Allaah</strong> and His Messenger; this is with regard to <em>`aqeedah</em> (creed and belief). So, a person will not be a Muslim unless his `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) is sound and is free of <em>shirk</em> and his actions are free of innovations (<em>bid`ah)</em> and he is one who is following the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So, this person, he is the one who is <strong><em>an-naa<u>s</u>i<u>h</u></em></strong> (one who is sincere) towards Allaah and His Messenger, i.e the one whose deeds are free of <em>shirk</em> and free of innovations.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sincerity towards the Messenger</strong> <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is to truly believe; to have <em>eemaan</em> in his Messengership, and to love him, and to respect, and honour him <em>`alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam,</em> and to take him as an example to follow, and to give precedence to his saying over the saying of everyone, and to leave off innovations and new introductions, which are something that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> warned against, and to believe him regarding whatever he informed about regarding things of the unseen of the past and the future, and to avoid whatever he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> forbade. This is sincerity towards the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His (<em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying, <strong><em>“…and towards His Book…”</em></strong> the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, it is the Qur&#8217;aan such that you have <em>eemaan</em> that it is the speech of Allaah sent down; not created, it is not the speech of anyone else as is said by the people of misguidance; and that you learn it, and teach it, and that you act upon it, and that you acquire understanding of its meanings, and that you reflect upon it. This is sincerity towards the Book of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High; learning, and teaching, and understanding, and acquiring knowledge of it, and acting upon it. And likewise, from sincerity towards the Book of Allaah is to be plentiful in its recitation and not to be neglectful with regard to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity)<strong><em> “…towards the rulers of the Muslims…”</em></strong> they are those who are in charge of the affairs, those in authority, that you obey them in that which is not disobedience to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. And that you do not remove your hand from obedience, and that you do not rebel against them, and that you do not seek out their mistakes and their hidden faults and expose them to the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from sincerity (<em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah)</em> towards them is that if you have knowledge (`<em>ilm)</em> and you have the ability to sincerely advise them that you do so personally between yourself and them; you cause the advice to reach them and inform them about mistakes, which occur from them or from their subjects, you let them know about that but you do not speak about them in gatherings, for this will be a case of <em>ghish</em> (treachery). So, <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity) is that you convey sincere advice from yourself to them. This is from sincerity towards the person in authority.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, from sincerity towards the person in authority is to carry out the duty that he puts you in charge of carrying out, whether it is a <em>wa<u>z</u>eefah</em> (duty or a post) or being placed in charge of something or other than that from the affairs of the religion and the worldly life, that you carry the duty out which the one in authority has entrusted you with in the best manner and that you do not miss anything of it out and if you see any deficiencies then you inform the one in authority between yourself and him. You inform him of the deficiencies so that he can remedy it. This is sincerity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from sincerity towards those in authority is to make <em>du`a</em> (supplication) for them that they be rectified since if they are sound and rectified, the subjects will be sound and rectified and that you make <em>du`a</em> (supplication) for them. So, if you see a man who is a student of knowledge who does not make supplication for them or who criticises making supplication for them then you should know that he is treacherous (<em>ghaash)</em> and he is not one who is sincere towards the person in authority.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And sincerity<strong><em> “…towards the common Muslims,” </em></strong>is that you direct them to what is correct; and you warn them against errors, and that you command the good and forbid the evil, and that you teach the one who is ignorant, and that you remind the person who is heedless, and that you love for him the good that you love for yourself, and to have compassion for the poor person, and you give charity (<em><u>s</u>adaqah)</em> for the needy. This is <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, that he gives good advice to the person who consults him and he guards secrets for one who trusts him regarding something and to safeguard things which are entrusted with you. He should be sincere from all aspects. And sincerity is with regard to buying and selling such that he does not deceive and does not trick.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity) in brief. So, whoever is not like that then he is treacherous and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever deceives us then he is not from us.”</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by al-Bukhaariyy in disconnected form; meaning in a chapter heading, you’ll find it there in the <em>Book of Eemaan</em>; the 2<sup>nd</sup> book, chapter 42.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it’s reported in connected form by Imaam Muslim (55) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Tameem ad-Daari <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and Imaam Muslim does not have the repetition of his saying (<em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>): <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Ad-deenun na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</strong> (the religion is sincerity)…</span><strong>”. </strong>Meaning; there in <u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> Muslim, it only occurs once that he said: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Ad-deenun na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</strong> (the religion is sincerity)</span>.<strong>”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, that occurs being reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad and Aboo Daawood and at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee and others and at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee said it is <em><u>h</u>a<u>s</u>an, <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (good, authentic).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s side point: Shaykh al-Albaaniyy, likewise, declared it with the addition there as being <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Reported by Muslim (101) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and also reported by Muslim (102 ) with the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever deceives then he is not from me.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The 1<sup>st</sup> wording in Muslim is:<br />
<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever deceives us then he is not from us.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The 2<sup>nd</sup> wording reported by Muslim is:<br />
<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever deceives is not from me.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> <strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said with regard to this first part of the <u>h</u>adeeth:<strong> </strong>“Ad-deenun na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah (the religion is sincerity) and then when they asked, “To whom, oh Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “firstly, lillaah (towards Allaah).”<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, “By obedience to Him and not disobeying Him and by implementing `<em>Uboodiyyalahum</em> (servitude towards Him) and by establishing His Tawheed with regard to His <em>Ruboobiyyah</em> (Lordship) and with regard to His `<em>Uloohiyyah</em> (His sole right to all worship) and with regard to His names and attributes and that you seek by performance of your deeds His face &amp; that you are sincere in your deeds, which you carry out. So, you are sincere in them and true in them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> <strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> mentioned more or less the same point. He added a point also, he had a no. of points, from them was,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Having love for the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and also making supplication for; <em><u>s</u>alaat</em> and <em>salaam</em> upon Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. </em>And not writing just it&#8217;s abbreviated forms like  SAW, SAAW, or SAAS. We seeks Allaah’s refuge from this abridging  of <em><u>s</u>alaat</em> and <em>salaam</em> upon Allaah’s Messenger,  as this is from the <em>Raafi<u>d</u>ah Shi`a</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 46: Points 75</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And you should know that Allaah has favoured some of the servants over others in this world and in the Hereafter, He has done so justly. It cannot be said that He acted unjustly or has shown undue favour. Whoever says that Allaah has favoured the true believer and the disbeliever equally then he is a person upon innovation. Rather, Allaah has favoured the believer over the disbeliever, the obedient one over the sinner and the one He has rendered secure from error over the one who is humiliated; doing so justly. It is His favour, which He bestows upon whomever He wishes and withholds from whomever He wishes.</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And you should know that Allaah has favoured the servants; some of them over others in this world and in the Hereafter,”</strong></span> Allaah has favoured some of the people over others. He has bestowed favour upon the believer over the disbeliever with that which Allaah has given him from <em>eemaan</em> on account of his having <em>eemaan</em> and He withheld from the disbeliever on account of his disbelief. And Allaah favoured the believers, some over others and the Messengers (the <em>Rusul); </em>Allaah favoured some of them over others.</p>
<p><strong>تِلْكَ الرُّسُلُ فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those Messengers, We favoured some of them over others.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>253)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the <em>fa<u>d</u>l</em> (favor/bounty) of Allaah, which He gives to whomever He wishes, He, the Perfect and Most High and no-one may raise any objection to Allaah because this is His <em>mulk</em> (kingdom), that which belongs to Him, He, the Perfect, He can give it to whomever He wishes. So, the kingdom belongs to Him, He can give it to whomever He wishes, He, the Perfect. And the favour that is bestowed is His favour, He may give it to whomever He wishes. So, there could be no objection raised against Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas, the <em>Mu`tazilah</em>; this deviant sect, they say, “<em>It is obligatory that Allaah treats the people equally and gives them all the same</em>.” This is to show evil manners towards Allaah and is to raise objections against Him, High and Tremendously Exalted is Allaah above that which they say. So, Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, bestows favour on some of His creation over and above others and this is His kingdom, it belongs to Him so there can be no objection to Him. He does not punish anyone except for a crime that He has actually committed since to do so would contradict justice and Allaah does not oppress. So, He does not punish anyone without his having committed a crime or punish anyone for somebody else’s crime.</p>
<p><strong>وَلَا تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَىٰ ۚ وَإِن تَدْعُ مُثْقَلَةٌ إِلَىٰ حِمْلِهَا لَا يُحْمَلْ مِنْهُ شَيْءٌ وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَىٰ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And no bearer of sin will bear the sins of another and if someone weighed down with sins were to call someone else to bear his sins for him then he will not be able to find anyone to bear any of them for him even if it be a close relative.</span> </strong>(Soorah-Faa<u>t</u>ir (35), <em>aayah </em>18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, with regard to the aspect of <em>al-jazaa</em>· (recompense) that He gives then His recompense is <em>adl</em> (just) and as for the aspect of <em>al-a<u>t</u>aa·</em> (what He gives freely) then this is <em>fa<u>d</u>l</em> (favour) from him, He, the Perfect and Most High and it is not for anyone to raise any objection to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And whoever says that the favour of Allaah upon the believer and the disbeliever is just the same then he is a person of innovation.” </strong></span>This is the saying of the <em>Mu`tazilah</em>, they say that &#8211; <em>&#8220;It is obligatory upon Allaah to make all of the people believers and that He should not make just some of them disbelievers and some of them believers. He should make all of them rich, He should make all of them scholars.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is to raise an objection against Allaah, the Perfect and Most High because Allaah is <em>Hakeem</em> (All-Wise). And it is not from His wisdom that He should make all of the people the same in knowledge or in riches or in reward and punishment. And it is not from His wisdom that He should make all of mankind wealthy. If all of them were wealthy people then the creation would be ruined because they would not find anyone who would carry out any work and production would cease. And therefore, Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, has favoured some of the people over others with regard to provision. He has made this one rich and this one poor so that the creation can thrive. If they were all rich then they would not produce anything. And if they were all poor then they would not be able to work and produce. So, Allaah has caused them to vary so that the creation should operate and thrive.</p>
<p><strong>وَرَفَعْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ دَرَجَاتٍ لِّيَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُهُم بَعْضًا سُخْرِيًّا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We raised some of them over others in levels so that some of them should employ others to work.</span> </strong>(Sooratuz-Zukhruf (43), <em>aayah </em>32)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, some of them employ others to work for wages. So, when that happens then the creation can grow and prosper and benefits are attained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Rather, Allaah has favoured the believer over the disbeliever and the obedient one over the disobedient one of the sinner and the one He has rendered secure from error over the despicable one,” </strong></span>Allaah favoured the believer over the disbeliever and He gave favour to the obedient one over the sinner; this is His justice (<em>adl</em>), He, the Perfect and His <em>fa<u>d</u>l</em> (favour) so no-one may raise any objection to Him.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator’s side point:  Briefly with regard to the explanation of <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he said after some speech, he said at the end,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Therefore this section, this part here necessitates from us that we have the <em>`aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) that Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, caused His servants to be of different levels as <strong>a favour from Him and as justice</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>لَا يُسْأَلُ عَمَّا يَفْعَلُ وَهُمْ يُسْأَلُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He is not to be questioned about that which He does. Rather, they are to be questioned. </strong></span>(Sooratul-Anbiyaa· (21), <em>aayah</em> 23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it cannot be said, “<em>Why did He make that one a Messenger and make that one a person who is humiliated and why did He make that one a believer who is granted success of correctness whereas He made that one a rejected one and humiliated?</em>” That should not be said. Rather, it is obligatory that we believe that Allaah is free of committing oppression (<em><u>dh</u>ulm)</em> and that He does whatever He wishes and He decrees whatever He wills. However, all His actions are based upon <em>hikmah</em> (wisdom) and <em>ra<u>h</u>mah</em> (mercy) and <em>fa<u>d</u>l</em> (favour) and <em>adl</em> (justice). That is what is obligatory upon us to believe with regard to our Lord, the Majestic and Most High. This is the creed that is supported by the texts of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Prophetic texts and it is that which the scholars of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em> are agreed in consensus upon and Allaah is the one who grants success.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 46: Point 74</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And intellect (<em>al-`aql)</em> is inborn. Each person is given the intellect that Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, wills. They vary in degree of intellect just like a speck at different heights in the heavens. And action is required from each person in accordance with the intellect he has been given. Intellect is not earned, rather, it is a favour bestowed by Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F382462442&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/al-aql-intellect-is-not-acquired-rather-it-is-a-fadl-favour-bestowed-by-allaah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-`Aql </em><strong>عقل  </strong>(the intellect), it is a faculty, which Allaah places in the person by means of which he can comprehend things. By means of it, he can distinguish what is harmful from what is beneficial and what is good from what is evil. No-one knows the nature (<em>kayfiyyah)</em> of the intellect (<em>`aql)</em>. People have groped about in confusion concerning it but they have not reached a conclusion because it is one of the secrets of Allaah, which no-one knows except Him, He, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p>And the `<strong><em>aql</em>  عقل </strong>(intellect), it is called <em>`aql</em> (intellect) with an <em>`ain</em> and a <em>qaaf</em> and a <em>laam</em> because it withholds a person from that which will harm him<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> just as a tethering rope holds an animal back from escaping.</p>
<p>The intellect is also called <strong><em><u>H</u>ijr</em> </strong>(prevention).</p>
<p><strong>هَلْ فِي ذَٰلِكَ قَسَمٌ لِّذِي حِجْرٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Is there not in these oaths sufficient proof for a person possessing <em><u>H</u>ijr</em> (intellect)?</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fajr (89), <em>aayah</em> 5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-<u>H</u>ijr</em> here is <em>Al-`Aql </em>(the intellect). It is called that because it blocks and prevents a person from that, which will harm him.</p>
<p>And it is called <strong><em>An-Nuhaa</em></strong>.<strong>النُّهَى</strong></p>
<p><strong>كُلُوا وَارْعَوْا أَنْعَامَكُمْ ۗ إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَآيَاتٍ لِّأُولِي النُّهَىٰ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>In that there are clear signs for those who possess <em>Nuhaa</em> (intellect).</strong></span><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Soorah </span><u style="font-size:1rem;">T</u><span style="font-size:1rem;">aa-</span><u style="font-size:1rem;">H</u><span style="font-size:1rem;">aa (20), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> 54)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the people of <em>al-`Uqool</em> (intellects).</p>
<p>And it is called <strong><em>al-Lubb</em></strong>.<em> </em><strong>لُبّ</strong></p>
<p><strong> لِّأُولِي الْأَلْبَابِ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">For the possessors of <em>al-Baab</em>.</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah</em> 190)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, the people with intellects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this <em>`aql</em> (intellect) is from the signs of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the saying of the author, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“<em>Huwa mawlood</em> (it is inborn).” </strong></span>What is apparent is that he intended that it is <em>makhlooq</em> (something created) and that it is not something that is ancient or pre-existing or that it is born along with the person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this intellect (<em>al-`aql),</em> as we have mentioned, no-one knows its true reality except Allaah.<span style="font-size:1rem;">And therefore, the people of `</span><em style="font-size:1rem;">ilm-ul-kalaam</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> (theological rhetoric) and the philosophers, they have confused ideas about it and they did not reach a conclusion with regard to the </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">`aql</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> (intellect) because this is not within the scope of their knowledge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the intellect varies:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the people there are those whose intellect is complete such as the prophets; Anbiyaa· `<em>alayhimu<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the people, there are those who have no intellect at all such as the insane person and the mentally retarded and the baby.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the people are those who are in between; between having complete intellect and between not having intellect. Meaning he has intellect but it is not complete.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they vary with regard to its deficiency, some of them have serious deficiency in intellect and some of them have slight deficiency and so on and so forth and this is in accordance with whatever Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, has put into him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the word <em>al-`aql</em> is used to refer to<strong> <em>al-fahm</em></strong> (understanding) also. So it is said “<em>aqalal aayaatil qur&#8217;aaniyyah</em>,” it can be said about a person that he is <em>aqala</em>; meaning he has understood the <em>aayahs</em> of the Qur&#8217;aan because part of the <em>aayah</em> as evidence:</p>
<p><strong> ذَٰلِكَ لَآيَاتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ ..</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">… there are certainly signs for a people who understand.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratun-Na<u>h</u>l (16), <em>aayah </em>12)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: they understand the signs in creation and the <em>aayahs</em> of the Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p><strong>وَتِلْكَ الْأَمْثَالُ نَضْرِبُهَا لِلنَّاسِ ۖ وَمَا يَعْقِلُهَا إِلَّا الْعَالِمُونَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And those are examples, which We strike for mankind and no-one understands them except for the people endowed with knowledge.</span>  </strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratul-Ankaboot (29), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah </em><span style="font-size:1rem;">43)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, <em>al-`aql</em>; this word, which is for intellect, it can also be applied to <strong><em>al-fahm</em> </strong>(understanding) and <em><strong>al</strong></em>&#8211;<strong><em>idraak</em> </strong>(comprehension) and <em>al-fiqhu fid-deen</em> (understanding of the religion) of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p><strong>أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ ..</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230; will you not then have understanding?</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Qa<u>s</u>a<u>s</u> (28), <em>aayah </em>60)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the people, there are those whose intellect is blotted out on account of his disbelief and on account of his heedlessness. So, therefore, he cannot distinguish between what is harmful and what is beneficial. So, he possesses intellect; the faculty, however, he does not derive benefit from his intellect. He is deprived of benefitting from his intellect and Allaah’s refuge is sought, aameen, on account of his disbelief (<em>kufr)</em>. So, he becomes a person who cannot utilise his intellect.</p>
<p><strong>أَمْ تَحْسَبُ أَنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ يَسْمَعُونَ أَوْ يَعْقِلُونَ ۚ إِنْ هُمْ إِلَّا كَالْأَنْعَامِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Or do you think that most of them hear or reason? Rather, they are just like cattle.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Furqaan (25), <em>aayah </em>44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah deprives him of his intellect as a punishment for him since he did not use it with regard to that which benefits him. Rather, he only used it in that which contains no benefit or in that which brings harm. So, <em>al-`aql</em> (the intellect) is from the signs of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And action is required from each person in accordance with the level of intellect that he has been given.” </strong></span><em>At-takleef</em> (being bound by religious responsibility and duty) and commands and prohibitions and reward and punishment, all of them are made dependent upon <em>al-`aql</em> (having intellect).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And the intellect is not acquired, rather it is just a <em>fadl</em> (favour) bestowed by Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.” </strong></span>The intellect is from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. He is the One Who plants it in the person and it is from the secrets of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, in His creation. A person does not earn and acquire intellect himself. Yes, a person can strengthen his intellect by reflecting upon the <em>aayaat</em> (signs) of Allaah by carefully pondering upon the Qur&#8217;aan but as for his earning intellect which is not present, then no, that cannot happen. Allaah is the One Who produces intellect in him. He cannot produce intellect himself and earn it himself. However, he can strengthen it.</p>
<p><strong>أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ فَتَكُونَ لَهُمْ قُلُوبٌ يَعْقِلُونَ بِهَا أَوْ آذَانٌ يَسْمَعُونَ بِهَا ۖ فَإِنَّهَا لَا تَعْمَى الْأَبْصَارُ وَلَٰكِن تَعْمَى الْقُلُوبُ الَّتِي فِي الصُّدُورِ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Will they not travel upon the earth so that they can have hearts with which they can reason or ears which they can hear with? For indeed it is not the sight of the people that becomes truly blind, rather, it is the hearts which are in the chests which become blind. </strong></span>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ajj (22), <em>aayah </em>46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this indicates that reflecting upon the creation and reflecting upon the destruction that occurred to the previous nations on account of their disbelief and their sins, this benefits a person and strengthens his intellect, not that it brings about intellect which was not present in the first place.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator’s side point:  In the Arabic language in its origin, the word <em>`aql</em>, it means الحرس <strong><em>al-hurs</em></strong> (withholding something).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Translator’s side point:  Briefly with the explanation of <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah </em>then he said on this point, “his saying, <strong>“<span style="color:#993300;">Intellect is inborn</span>,” </strong>meaning that it is born along with the person himself and it grows and increases as he grows. So, the intellect begins as something small and then it grows larger along with its person and there is no doubt that the intellects vary in accordance with that which Allaah has given to each person. And Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, has praised in the Qur&#8217;aan, the people of intellect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the people of <em>Usool ul-Fiqh</em> (Fundamentals of Fiqh), which Fiqh is based upon, are in agreement that the intellect (<em>`aql)</em> is what being bound by duties depends upon. And then they disagree about whether the intellect (`<em>aql)</em> whether it is in the brain (<em>dimaagh)</em> or whether it is in the heart. And what is apparent is that there is a close connection between the two of them and the action of one will not be completed except with the other one. So, thinking which occurs in the brain will not be completed except by means of the heart ,in what is apparent. However, the brain is the station of thinking and the place of awareness and what duties are dependent upon. And every person, Allaah has prepared him with that which He prepared him with from faculties and thinking and intellect vary very greatly. We ask Allaah to guide us aright, aameen and to save us from the evils of ourselves, aameen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the great liars have invented <em>a<u>h</u>aadeeth</em> with regard to the intellect and it is a <u>h</u>adeeth which is <em>mawdoo</em>` (fabricated), it is a lie made up in which there occurs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“The first thing that Allaah created was the intellect so He said to it, “come forward” so it came forward then He said to it, “go back” so it went back.””<strong style="font-size:1rem;"><em> </em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a <u>h</u>adeeth, which is <strong><em>mawdoo</em></strong>` (fabricated) by consensus of the scholars and there is no doubt that the intellect (<em>al-`aql)</em> is a gift from Allaah for the servant, which distinguishes him from the rest of the creation and on account of it he comes to deserve reward or punishment and Allaah is the One Who grants success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then finally on this point, <strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em>, he said after mentioning some speech,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So the `<em>aql</em> (intellect) by which a person understands things is a <em>ni`mah</em> (favour) from Allaah, which Allaah has bestowed upon mankind. So with it he can distinguish between the truth and falsehood and between that which is foul and that which is good and between that which is worthless and that which is of value and between innovation and <em>Sunnah</em> and between <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and <em>Shirk</em> and between the way of the <em>Salaf</em> and the way of the <em>Khalaf</em> (the later comers who are not upon their way) and he can distinguish between the path leading to Paradise and the path leading to the Fire. So this is a tremendous favour, which Allaah has bestowed upon mankind to the exclusion of the rest of the created beings upon the earth. So, it is obligatory that we are thankful to Him for it and that we utilise it in that which will draw us closer to Allaah. And the correct and sound intellect conforms to the authentic text and it does not contradict the legislation.</p>

<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in pre-ordainment and pre-decree. And that everything which occurs in this creation then it does not occur by chance randomly. Rather, it is something which has been decreed and written in the preserved tablet; <em>Al-Law<u>h</u> Al-Ma<u>h</u>fu<u>dh</u></em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, knew it and He wrote it in the preserved tablet then He ordained it. Then He created it and He brought it into existence and willed it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nothing is found in this creation without its having been preceded by Allaah’s pre-ordainment and pre-decree. <strong>Everything</strong> has been pre-ordained and from that is good and evil. The good which occurs to mankind is by the pre-ordainment and pre-decree of Allaah. And the evil which occurs for them then it is by the pre-ordainment of Allaah and His pre-decree. And disbelief &amp; true faith and sickness &amp; health and hunger &amp; being full and wealth &amp; poverty; all of this is by the pre-ordainment and pre-decree of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 45: Points 72</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) that it is Allaah who spoke to Moosaa ibn `Imraan `<em>alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> on the day of the mountain; <em>A<u>t-T</u>oor</em>. And Moosaa heard Allaah’s speech, which was with a voice, which he heard from Him not from other than Him. So, whoever says other than this has disbelieved in Allaah, the Tremendous.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F381540059&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/to-have-eemaan-that-it-is-allaah-who-spoke-to-moosaa-on-mount-toor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Affirming <em>kalaam</em> (speech) for Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, is from the fundamentals of `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) of the <em>Ahl us-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em> that Allaah speaks with real speech. Jibreel heard Him and Moosaa `<em>alayhissalaam</em> heard Him when he went towards the fire to take a fire brand and he found that Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, spoke to Him from the bush just as Allaah mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan and Moosaa heard His speech. Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَكَلَّمَ اللَّهُ مُوسَىٰ تَكْلِيمًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And Allaah spoke to Moosaa with speech.<br />
</strong></span>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah </em>164)</p>
<p><strong>وَلَمَّا جَاءَ مُوسَىٰ لِمِيقَاتِنَا وَكَلَّمَهُ رَبُّهُ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And when Moosaa came to our appointed place and His Lord spoke to him.</strong></span>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah</em> 143)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was a second time when Allaah promised him that He would give him the Tawraat so Moosaa went to the appointed place and his Lord spoke to him and gave him the tablets with the Tawraat written upon them. So, Moosaa heard the speech of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He spoke to our Prophet Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> on the night of the <em>Mi`raaj</em> (night ascent) and He made the five daily prayers obligatory upon him. So, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, speaks with speech that is heard and with letters and a voice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Jahmiyyah and the Mu`tazilah then they say, <em>“Allaah does not speak. Because if we were to affirm speech for Him then we would be causing Him to resemble the created being because the created being speaks.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And is analogy to be made between the speech of Allaah and the speech of the created being? There is a difference between the speech of Allaah and the speech of the created being. So, those people (Jahmiyyah and the Mu`tazilah) do not make a distinction between Allaah and between the created being, and Allaah’s refuge is sought, as a result of their stupidity in understanding and in intellect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, speaks in reality with speech that is heard and the Qur&#8217;aan is from the speech of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. Allaah spoke with it and He spoke with the Tawraat and He spoke with the Injeel and He speaks whenever He wishes if He wishes, He, the Perfect and Most High. So, His speech is from His actions, He, the Majestic and Most High. And His actions have no end and no beginning. He speaks whenever He wishes, when He wishes with whatever He wishes, He, the Majestic and Most High. So, <em>al-kalaam</em> (speech) is an attribute of His from His attributes, which are actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“It was from Him, He, the Perfect, not from anyone besides Him.” </strong></span>Not from the tree/bush, not from the preserved tablet, not from Jibreel and not from Muhammad. So it is speech which emanated from Allaah in reality and Jibreel and Muhammad only conveyed and transmitted from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And whoever says other than this then he has disbelieved in Allaah, the Tremendous.” </strong></span>Whoever says that the speech of Allaah is created and that Allaah does not speak and he deprives Allaah of speech then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) because he is denying the truth of what Allaah has said and His Messenger and the consensus of the Muslims unless he is an ignorant person or one who is performing incorrect interpretation or <em>muqallid</em> (blindly following) somebody he has good thoughts about, then this person, it is to be made clear to him and if he then persists then he is judged to be a disbeliever because Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, rebuked the people of <em>shirk</em> for the fact that they worshipped statues, which do not speak. Ibraaheem `<em>alayhissalaam</em> said:</p>
<p><strong> يَا أَبَتِ لِمَ تَعْبُدُ مَا لَا يَسْمَعُ وَلَا يُبْصِرُ وَلَا يُغْنِي عَنكَ شَيْئًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O my father, why do you worship that which cannot hear and not see and cannot benefit you with anything?</span> </strong>(Soorah Maryam (19), <em>aayah </em>42)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said to the disbelievers, those who worshipped the idols:</p>
<p><strong> فَاسْأَلُوهُمْ إِن كَانُوا يَنطِقُونَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So ask them if they are able to speak.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Anbiyaa· (21), <em>aayah </em>63)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High said:</p>
<p><strong>وَاتَّخَذَ قَوْمُ مُوسَىٰ مِن بَعْدِهِ مِنْ حُلِيِّهِمْ عِجْلًا جَسَدًا لَّهُ خُوَارٌ ۚ أَلَمْ يَرَوْا أَنَّهُ لَا يُكَلِّمُهُمْ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the People of Moosaa after he had departed made from their ornaments the statue of a calf, which produced a mooing sound, could they not see that it could not speak to them?</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>148)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this proves that the Lord (<em>Rabb)</em> speaks, He, the Perfect and Most High. And the one who does not speak is not a Lord, how could he then command and how could he prohibit and how could he regulate affairs when he cannot speak? High and Exalted is Allaah above that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in Soorah <u>T</u>aa-Haa:</p>
<p><strong> أَلَّا يَرْجِعُ إِلَيْهِمْ قَوْلًا وَلَا يَمْلِكُ لَهُمْ ضَرًّا وَلَا نَفْعًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">It does not say anything to them in return and does not possess any harm or benefit for them.</span> </strong>(Soorah <u>T</u>aa-Haa (20), <em>aayah 8</em>9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Can they see that it can’t say anything to them in return? Meaning, it does not respond to them when they address it.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">&#8212;</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 45: Points 70 &amp; 71</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[70] And to have <em>eemaan</em> that the deceased will be made to sit up in his grave and his soul will be restored to him in order that <em>Munkar</em> and <em>Nakeer</em> should question him about <em>eemaan</em> and its required duties then his soul will be gently removed from him without any pain. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[71] And the deceased recognises the one who visits him when he visits him and the believer will experience bliss in the grave and the wicked will be punished as Allaah wishes. </strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/eemaan-in-al-fitnatu-fil-qabr-the-trial-in-the-grave" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“</span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And to have eemaan that the deceased will be made to sit up in his grave,”</span> </strong>it is obligatory to have <em>eemaan</em> that the deceased will be made to sit up in his grave and his soul will be restored to his body and two angels will come to him; one of them is <em>Munkar</em> and the other is <em>An-Nakeer</em>. So, they will both question him and this is <strong><em>al-fitnatu fil-qabr</em> (the trial in the grave)</strong> and it is the most severe thing that will come upon the deceased. If he is saved from this trial then he will be saved from that which comes after it and if he is not saved from this trial then he will be destroyed. There will be no salvation for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The two of them will ask him about three matters:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong><em>Man Rabbuk</em></strong><strong>? (Who is your Lord?) </strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the believer will say “<em>Rabbiyy Allaah”</em> (My Lord is Allaah). Whereas, the <em>munaafiq</em> (hypocrite) will say, “<em>Hah! Hah!!</em> <em>Laa adree</em> (Hah! Hah!! I do not know).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they will say to him:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong><em>Maa Deenuk?</em></strong><strong> (What is your religion?) </strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the believer will say, “My religion is <em>al-Islaam</em>.” Whereas, the hypocrite and the doubter will say, <em>“Hah! Hah!! Laa adree</em> (Hah! Hah!! I do not know).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they will say to him:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong><em>Man Nabiyyuk?</em></strong><strong> (Who is your Prophet?) </strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the believer will reply, “My Prophet is Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. Whereas, the hypocrite will say, <em>“Hah! Hah!! Laa adree</em> (Hah! Hah!! I do not know).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the believer will have his grave extended wide for him and he will have bedding provided for him from Paradise and a door will be opened for him leading to Paradise and its pleasant wind and its pleasant fragrance will come upon him and he will experience bliss in his grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas, the <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) and the hypocrite, his grave will be restricted upon him and he will be given bedding from the fire and the door to the fire will be opened for him and its heat and its poisonous wind will come upon him.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is the meaning of his saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And his soul will be restored to him so that Munkar and Nakeer can ask him about <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and about its legislated duties.”</span></strong><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<span style="color:#993300;"><strong> “and the deceased recognises the one who visits him when he visit him,” </strong></span>and therefore it is legislated to visit the graves because the deceased takes comfort in the presence of the one who visits him and this is from the affairs of the <em>barzakh</em> (intermediate period). We do not know about the affairs of the Hereafter and the affairs of the intermediate period except what is established by proof because it is from the <em>ilm ul-ghaib</em> (knowledge of the hidden and unseen), which is not known except by Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is not to be derived from this that anything can be requested from the deceased such that it is said, “<em>Since he knows the one who comes to him then why shouldn’t we request what we need from him?</em>” We say, this was not legislated by Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, nothing may be requested from the deceased. The Companions (<em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>aabah</em>) had not used to request anything from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> even though he was alive in his grave <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in a life of <em>barzakh</em> (intermediate period), not the life of this world.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“and the believer will experience bliss in the grave and the wicked will be punished however Allaah wishes.”</span> </strong>From the fundamentals of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) is to have <em>eemaan</em> in the punishment of the grave and in its bliss, contrary to the Mu`tazilah; those who denied it. They say, “<em>The deceased in his grave is just the same as when we placed him in it, he receives no torment and no bliss</em>,” relying in this upon their intellects and what they see and on their own thinking and they do not believe in the <em>ghaib</em> (hidden and the unseen). An analogy is not to be made between this world and the Hereafter or between the Hereafter and this world. So, it is upon you to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in the <em>ghaib</em> (hidden and the unseen).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the punishment of the grave and the bliss of the grave is established. Indeed it is <em>mutawaatir</em> in the a<u>h</u>aadeeth (meaning something that occurs; every level of transmission of narrations, just so many that every level of transmission, there’s so many people who report it that it’s impossible they could have got together and lied upon it) that the deceased will either be punished in his grave or otherwise, he will experience bliss.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, whoever denies the punishment of the grave and he knows of the texts and he knows of the proofs then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever). As for the one who denies it on account of <em>ta`weel</em> (wrong interpretation) or <em>taqleed</em> (blindly following) somebody else in that saying or <em>al-jahl</em> (ignorant) of it then this person, the truth is to be made clear to him and if he then persists after it has been clearly explained, then he is just to be a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> You find all of this mentioned in the <u>h</u>adeeth of Baraa` ibn `Aazib <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>, reported by al-Bukhaariyy (1,369) and reported by Muslim (2,871) in abridged form. And in longer form by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad in his <em>Musnad</em> and by Aboo Daawood in his <em>Sunan</em> (4,753).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the angels being named as <em>Munkar</em> and <em>Nakeer</em> then that occurs in a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu,</em> reported by Tirmithee as <u>h</u>adeeth 1,071, said authentic by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“When one of you is placed in his grave then two angels; black-blue come to him. One of them is called al-Munkar and the other is called An-Nakeer”.</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Translator’s side point: <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said in his explanation on this point that they will ask about <em>eemaan</em> and about its <em>sharaai</em>`<em>ee</em> (legislated duties),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Perhaps what he intended by this is the general questioning because I do not know anything from the Sunnahs, which indicates that there will be questions about the details of <em>Islaam</em> and <em>Eemaan</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And likewise on the point that came, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Then his soul will be gently taken out of him again without any pain.” ‘<em>Bilaa alam’</em> (without any pain)</span>, </strong>meaning without the pain which occurred for him at his first death.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Translator’s side point: <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said with regard to this point, <strong>“and the deceased in the grave recognises the one who visits him,”</strong> this is based upon the authenticity of the <u>h</u>adeeth which occurs about that. But there is disagreement about its authenticity as far as I know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s side point: The verifier <strong>Khaalid ar-Raddaadiyy</strong> said, “There are a number of a<u>h</u>aadeeth which mention that the deceased recognises the one who visits him when he visit him and takes comfort from his visit. However, nothing from them is authentic.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s side point: <strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said in his explanation, “This is something, which I do not know any proof for, the point that the deceased in the grave recognises the one who visit him. Rather, what is indicated by the proof is just that he hears the footsteps of those who depart after they have buried him.”</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And know that the souls of the martyrs are within the bellies of green birds, which roam freely in Paradise,” </strong></span>for the <em>roo<u>h</u></em> (soul) by means of which a person lives and moves and grasps things by his senses, it is a secret matter from the secrets of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. No-one knows it except Allaah, meaning no-one knows its true reality except Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الرُّوحِ ۖ قُلِ الرُّوحُ مِنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّي وَمَا أُوتِيتُم مِّنَ الْعِلْمِ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they ask you about <em>ar-roo<u>h</u></em> (the soul). Say, the soul is from the private affairs of my Lord and you have not been given of knowledge except a little.</strong></span>(Sooratul-Israa· (17), <em>aayah </em>85)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1<sup>st</sup> explanation of <em>aayah</em>:</strong> Upon the basis that what is meant by the <em>roo<u>h</u></em> here is that by which a person lives; a person and an animal and the rest of the things possessing souls.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> explanation of <em>aayah</em>: </strong>It is otherwise said that what is meant by <em>ar-roo<u>h</u></em>; a type of the angels and Allaah knows best.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>roo<u>h</u></em> in the Arabic language is a term, which is used to refer to that by means of which the possessors of souls will live because <strong><em>al-<u>h</u>ayaat</em> (life)</strong> is of two categories:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong><em><u>H</u></em></strong><strong><em>ayaatu-<u>H</u>arakah:</em></strong> (Moving Life) &#8211; a life which involves movement; animate life and this occurs with those things possessing souls.</li>
<li><strong><em><u>H</u></em></strong><strong><em>ayaatu-Numoo: </em></strong>(Developing Life)<strong><em> &#8211; </em></strong>life that merely involves something growing and growing, this is what occurs in trees and plants.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them (types of life) is the life of the embryo in the womb of its mother before the soul is breathed into it. But when the soul is breathed into it then it becomes animate life, the life of movement. As for before that then it is just the <em>roo<u>h</u></em> (spirit), which is the life of growth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the rhetorical theologians and the philosophers are in confusion about the true reality of the soul and they are unable to comprehend it and they stumble and make many mistakes and were unable to comprehend it.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> We find the like of that in:</p>
<p><strong>يَوْمَ يَقُومُ الرُّوحُ وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ صَفًّا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The day when the <em>roo<u>h</u></em> and the angels will stand in rows.<br />
</strong></span>(Sooratun-Nabaa· (78), <em>aayah </em>38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Allaahu A`lam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Translator’s side point: With regard to different types of life, you can refer to <em>Zaad ul-Ma`aad</em> of Imaam ibn ul-Qayyim volume 5 page 755.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Translator’s side point: <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah </em>said on this point<em>:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“You should know that the souls of the martyrs are in the bellies of green birds that roam around freely in Paradise and they return to lamps beneath the Throne,” </strong></span>this occurs within a <u>h</u>adeeth reported by Muslim (1,887) and it is the <em>`aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) of the <em>Ahl ul-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his saying though that, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“the souls of the wicked and the disbelievers are within the well of <em>Barahoot</em> and they are in <em>Sijjeen.</em>”</strong></span> Then I say, as for the well of <em>Barahoot</em> then it is a well to the East of `<em>Adan</em>; Aden of this place in Southern Yemen, between it and between <em>Ha<u>dh</u>ramawt.</em><em style="font-size:1rem;"> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the saying that, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“the souls of the wicked and the disbelievers are gathered within it,”</strong></span> there is no authentic proof for this. However, it occurs in a narration whose chain of narration contains a <em>majhool</em> (a person who’s unknown); being reported from `Abdullaah ibn `Amr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em> as was mentioned by the one in the footnotes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmad said, “I say what is correct is that which Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, informed of:</p>
<p><strong>كَلَّا إِنَّ كِتَابَ الْفُجَّارِ لَفِي سِجِّينٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The book of the wicked, they (the wicked), their souls will be in <em>Sijjeen</em>.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Mu<u>t</u>affifeen (83), <em>aayah </em>7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the word <em>As-Sijjeen</em> is an intensive form from <em>As-Sijn</em> (restriction) and it is a tight or restricted place and it (<em>Sijjeen</em>) is in the lowest depth of the earth as was said by the People of Knowledge. We ask Allah for safety and security from it, Aameen. And we seek Allaah’s refuge from His anger and from His painful punishment and Allaah grants success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said in his explanation,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And likewise, the souls of the believers in general, there occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth that the soul of the believer will be a bird, which will come and go in Paradise. The souls of the martyrs, it occurs that they will be in the belly of green birds, which come and go in Paradise and the souls of the believers in general, it is established also in the <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> that they will be birds that come and go in Paradise and this is from the proofs from the bliss of the grave for the soul enjoys bliss just as the body enjoys bliss.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the matter of the souls of the disbelievers that they will be in the well of <em>Barahoot</em>, this is not authentic and it is a well in <em>Ha<u>dh</u>ramawt</em>. And it occurs in some reports, which are brought by the scholars of <em>Tafseer</em> and perhaps they are reports from the <em>Banu Israa`eel</em> (People of the Book), which we do not affirm and we do not deny but however, nothing is established on this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The soul of the believer will be a bird, which will eat from the trees of Paradise until Allaah resurrects it returning it to its body on the day when He resurrects it.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <u>h</u>adeeth was declared <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> (authentic) by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy in <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> al-Jaami` as-<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> no. 995 being reported by Imaam Maalik in his <em>Muwa<u>tt</u>a</em>, Imaam A<u>h</u>mad, An-Nasaa`ee, Ibn Maajah and others from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Ka`b ibn Maalik <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu.</em></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 44: Point 68</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was taken by night up through the heavens and he came to the Throne and he spoke to Allaah, the Exalted and Most High. And he entered Paradise and he saw the Fire and he saw the angels and he heard the speech of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic and the Prophets were brought out for him. And he saw the drapery of the Throne and the Footstool and everything within the heavens and everything within the earths whilst awake. Jibreel took him upon <em>al-Buraaq</em> until he took him through the heavens and the five daily prayers were made obligatory upon him that night. And he returned to Makkah that same night and that was before the <em>Hijrah</em> (migration). </strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/eemaan-true-faith-in-al-israa-wal-miraaj" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<strong><span style="color:#993300;"> “And to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was taken by night up through the heavens,”</span> </strong>this is from the <em>mu`jizaat</em> (miracles) of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So a part of having <em>eemaan</em> in the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is to have <em>eemaan</em> in his miracles, which prove the truthfulness of his messengership <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and the greatest of his miracles are the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah. This is the greatest of the miracles of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and is the miracle which will remain until the Hour is established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise from his miracles <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is <em>al-Israa· w’al Mi`raaj</em> (the night journey and the ascent through the heavens). The word <em>al-Israa</em>· (the night journey) is to make a journey by night and the word <em>al-Mi`raaj</em> is to <em>asu`ood</em> (ascend). And he was taken on a journey by night from the sacred mosque in Makkah to the farthest mosque <em>al-Masjid ul-Aq<u>s</u>a</em> in Palestine in a single night in the company of Jibreel <em>`alayhissalaam</em> and he was taken up through the heavens from Jerusalem.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And how he was taken in a single night from Makkah to Jerusalem and then taken up through the heavens and then descended from the heavens and then returned to Makkah in a single night, how did this occur? This was through the ability of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, which is such that nothing can render it incapable. It was not by his own ability <em>`alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>, rather it came about through the ability of Allaah, which is such that nothing can render it incapable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Buraaq</em> was brought to him and it is an animal, which moves very fast. Its step from one step to the next is as far as it can see. So, the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> rode it and Jibreel accompanied him to <em>Bayt ul-Maqdis;</em> to Jerusalem. This is the <em>Israa</em>· (night journey) from Makkah to Jerusalem.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for <em>al-Mi`raaj</em> (the ascent) then he was taken up from Jerusalem to the heavens and he passed beyond the seven levels and reached <em>Sidrat ul-Muntahaa</em> (farthest lote tree) and he heard the speech of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, and He commanded him with the <em><u>S</u>alah</em> (prayer). And on this night he saw Paradise and the Fire and on this night he saw the Messengers and the Prophets in the heavens and Allaah gathered them together for him and he led them in prayer to make manifest his virtue over them. And Allaah made obligatory upon him the five daily prayers whilst he was in the heaven. Then he <em>`alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> descended to Jerusalem then he went from Jerusalem to Makkah in a single night and he entered the morning in Makkah <em>`alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>Israa·</em> and the <em>Mi`raaj</em> (night journey and the ascent) <strong>occurred with his body and his soul</strong>.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1] </a>And it was not just with his soul alone as is said by some of those deniers or some of those who find this matter to be something strange and who say that he was taken on the night journey with his soul but not his body. And the <em>Israa·</em> (night journey) <strong>was not a dream</strong>, rather it occurred whilst he was awake and it is a miracle from he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> miracles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>.. سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي أَسْرَىٰ بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلًا مِّنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ إِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الْأَقْصَى الَّذِي بَارَكْنَا حَوْلَهُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Glorified and Perfect is He Who took His servant by night from the sacred mosque to the farthest mosque, the area around which We have blessed …</strong></span>(Sooratul-Israa· (17), <em>aayah</em> 1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For what purpose?</p>
<p><strong> لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ آيَاتِنَا ۚ إِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ ..</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>… to show him Our signs. Indeed Allaah is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</strong></span>(Sooratul-Israa· (17), <em>aayah</em> 1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he saw on this night amazing things. Just as He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>لَقَدْ رَأَىٰ مِنْ آيَاتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَىٰ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">He </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the Prophet </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">certainly saw some of the greatest signs of his Lord.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Najm (53), <em>aayah</em> 18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said:</p>
<p><strong> لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ آيَاتِنَا ..</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>… to show him from Our signs. </strong></span>(Sooratul-Israa· (17), <em>aayah</em> 1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he (<em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saw from the signs of Allaah on this blessed journey that which he saw. So, it is obligatory upon the Muslim to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in that and to believe in it and that he should not have the slightest doubt about it. And whoever denies it he is a disbeliever (<em>kaafir)</em> since he is denying the truth of what has been said about Allaah and denying the truth about what has been said about the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and denying the consensus (<em>Ijmaa</em>`) of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And he entered Paradise and he saw the Fire,” </strong></span>he entered Paradise (<em>Jannah)</em> and he saw the bliss that was within it and he saw the Fire and he saw the torment that there is within it because Allaah wished to show him from His signs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and he saw the angels,” </strong></span>he saw Jibreel in his angelic form having 360 wings, each wing filling the whole horizon. So an angel, his creation is tremendous, his size is tremendous and Jibreel is the greatest one of the angels and the noblest one of the angels, <em>`alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>. So he saw the angels and he saw the Messengers (<em>Rusul)</em> and they are deceased. Allaah gathered them for him and Allaah has full ability over everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And he saw the drapery of the Throne (<em>Arsh)</em> and the <em>Kursee</em> (Footstool),” </strong></span>and he saw what was around the `<em>Arsh </em>(Throne) and what was around the <em>Kursee</em> (Footstool) and they are two tremendous created things; the greatest, most tremendous of the created things and what was around them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“and everything within the heavens whilst he was awake.”</span> </strong>This is a refutation of those who say that it was a dream. And if it had been a dream, the disbelievers would not have denied it because dreams are not denied. Rather, they denied it happened whilst he was awake.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p><strong>..  أَسْرَىٰ بِعَبْدِهِ ..</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>… He took His servant on a journey … </strong></span>(Sooratul-Israa· (17), <em>aayah </em>1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this word <em>al-`abd</em> (the servant) is a term for the soul and body together. So, the soul alone is not called <em>`abd</em> (servant). The body alone without a soul is not called <em>`abd</em> (servant). So it is not called servant unless it is a body and a soul together.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Jibreel carried him upon <em>al-Buraaq</em>,” </strong></span><em>al-Buraaq</em> was an animal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and the five daily prayers were made obligatory upon him that night.” </strong></span>This is a proof of the tremendousness of these five daily prayers that they were made obligatory upon the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in heaven between him and Allaah without any intermediary as opposed to the rest of the revealed laws for they came down to the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> whilst he was upon the earth by means of Jibreel <em>`alayhissalaam</em>. So, this shows the tremendous importance of these five daily prayers with Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. And the time of the night journey was before the <em>Hijrah</em> (migration) to al-Madeenah and he prayed the five daily prayers in Makkah <em>`alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And he returned to Makkah on that night and that was before the <em>Hijrah</em> (migration).” </strong></span>And he returned to Makkah on that same night and therefore the disbelievers found it something very unlikely and they became overjoyed at this event so that they could belittle the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and ridicule him and mock him. So, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, rebutted their plot and attested to the truthfulness of His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and sent down some Qur&#8217;aan with regard to that.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong>  The night journey and the ascent (<em>Israa</em>· and <em>Mi`raaj</em>) occurred bodily; the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> with his body and his soul together. You can refer to the <em>Tafseer</em> of Ibn Katheer and <em>Fat<u>h</u> ul-Baaree</em> of Al-<u>H</u>aafidh ibn <u>H</u>ajar and <em>Sharh</em> <em>ul-`Aqeedah</em> <em>a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>ahaawiyyah</em> of Ibn Abee al-`Izz.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2] </a><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> There’s a <u>h</u>adeeth that Shaykh al-Albaaniyy authenticates in <em>A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> as no. 306 that describes what happens the next morning after the night journey; how the disbelievers of Makkah reacted. <u>H</u>adeeth that Al-<u>H</u>aakim reported in his <em>Mustadrak</em> volume 3, page 62 from `Aisha <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhaa</em> that she said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“When Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was taken on the night journey to Al-Aq<u>s</u>a mosque, he entered the morning telling the people about that. So some people who had believed in him and affirmed his truthfulness turned apostate and they hastened with that news to Aboo Bakr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and said, “What do you think of your companion, he claims he was taken on a night journey this night to Jerusalem?” So he said, “Did he say that?” They said, “Yes.” He said, “If he said that then he has spoken the truth.” They said, “Will you believe him when he said he went to Jerusalem last night and came back before he entered the morning?” He said, “Yes, I believe him in something which is even harder than that. I believe him with regard to reports which come all the way from heaven, which come down in a single morning or a single evening.” So, therefore, he became known as A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>iddeeq (the truthful one) who attested to the truth, <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.”</span> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the explanation of <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah,</em> then he said on this point:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“To have eemaan that the Messenger of Allaah; his chest was split open and the portion of Satan was taken out and it was filled with eemaan (true faith) and wisdom. And he was taken on a night journey by Jibreel upon Al-Buraaq whose step is as far as it could see and he reached Jerusalem and the Prophets were gathered for him and he led them in prayer as their Imaam. Then Jibreel took him up to the lowest heaven and requested that it be opened and each heaven was opened for him and in the first heaven that he found; Aadam and in the second heaven; Ya<u>h</u>ya and `Eesaa and in the 3<sup>rd</sup> heaven; Yoosuf and in the 4<sup>th</sup> heaven; Haaroon and in the 5<sup>th</sup> heaven; Idrees and in the 6<sup>th</sup> heaven; Ibraaheem and in the 7<sup>th</sup>; Moosaa and in one narration the other way around (with regard to Ibraaheem and Moosa) and that Jibreel took him up to Sidrat ul-Muntahaa (farthest lote tree). Then he took him up to a place where he could hear the scratching of pens and he heard the speech of his Lord, the Mighty and Majestic when the five daily prayers were made obligatory upon him. So then he went back to Moosaa and informed him so he said, “Go back to your Lord and ask him for a reduction.” And finally his Lord said to him, “They are five and they are 50 (in reward), the saying will not be altered with Me.”</strong></span><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Agreed upon]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You can find this narration mentions details reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (3,342) and Muslim (163) from a narration of Abu Tharr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Shaykh says mentioning that <u>h</u>adeeth, “Meaning 5 with regard to their performance and 50 with regard to the reward and each good deed has the reward of 10 times over and that he entered Paradise and he saw in it domes or mounds made of pearl and other than that from the events, which occur in the <em>Israa·</em> and the <em>Mi`raaj.</em> And this was a matter of extra virtue bestowed upon him granted specifically by Allaah to His Prophet and to the last of His Messengers Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam,</em> no-one else shared with him in it. And he entered the next morning in Makkah and when he informed Quraish of what had happened, they rejected what he had said. Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا جَعَلْنَا الرُّؤْيَا الَّتِي أَرَيْنَاكَ إِلَّا فِتْنَةً لِّلنَّاسِ وَالشَّجَرَةَ الْمَلْعُونَةَ فِي الْقُرْآنِ ۚ وَنُخَوِّفُهُمْ فَمَا يَزِيدُهُمْ إِلَّا طُغْيَانًا كَبِيرًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We did not make that which We showed to you except as a trial for the people a</strong></span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">nd the accursed tree mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan and We caused them to fear but it does not increase them except in great transgression.</span>  </strong>(Sooratul-Israa (17), <em>aayah</em> 60)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the saying of the author, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Jibreel took him upon <em>al-Buraaq</em> until he took him through the heavens,” </strong></span>this is a matter requiring inspection (meaning something doubtful) since he did not carry him upon <em>al-Buraaq</em> except when he took him to Jerusalem. What’s correct is that he travelled upon <em>al-Buraaq</em> from Makkah to Jerusalem only, then <em>al-Buraaq</em> was left in Jerusalem then he was taken by Jibreel up through the heavens. As for him ascending from Jerusalem to the heavens then what is apparent that it was upon the <em>Mi`raaj</em> (the heavenly stairway) and not upon <em>al-Buraaq</em> as was said by the author, may Allaah have mercy upon him and success is granted by Allaah.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 43 : Point 67</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And speech and argumentation and disputing about <em>al-Qadr</em> (pre-decree) in particular are forbidden with all of the sects because pre-decree (<em>al-Qadr)</em> is Allaah’s secret. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And the Lord, the Majestic, the Most High,</strong><a style="color:#993300;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> </span><strong style="color:#993300;font-size:1rem;">He forbade the prophets from speech concerning pre-decree and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> forbade argumentation about pre-decree and it was detested by the companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and by the <em>taabi`een</em> and it was detested by the scholars and by the people of piety and they forbade argumentation concerning pre-decree (<em>al-Qadr)</em>.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So upon you is to submit, to affirm, to have <em>eemaan</em> in and to hold as your belief whatever Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said about all matters and to be silent about other than that.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F380082461&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/al-qadrpre-decreeis-allaahs-secretdont-arguedispute-about-it" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the fundamentals of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and from the pillars of <em>eemaan</em> is to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in pre-ordainment and pre-decree. And al-Qadaa w’al Qadr (pre-ordainment and pre-decree) refers to the events that will occur that Allaah has pre-decreed and pre-ordained since eternity. And everything which occurs then it does not happen by chance, randomly or without having been pre-decreed by Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. Rather, Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, knew whatever was, whatever has been in the past and whatever will be in the future. Then He wrote that in <em>al-Law<u>h</u> al-Ma<u>h</u>fudh</em> (preserved tablet). The saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The first thing that Allaah created was the pen. He said to it, “Write whatever is going to occur until the Day of Resurrection&#8221;. So, the pen wrote whatever was going to occur until the Day of Resurrection.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the creation of the pen was before the creation of the heavens and the earth by fifty-thousand years and the Throne of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, was upon the water.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, here there has been a problematic point for the scholars, was the throne created before the pen or was the pen created before the `<em>Arsh</em> (Throne)? And what is correct is that the `<em>Arsh</em> (throne) was created before the pen<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> because at the time when Allaah created the pen and commanded it to write whatever it was going to be then His throne was upon the water and this is why the <em>Allaamah</em>; the great scholar Ibn ul-Qayyim <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah </em>said:<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><em>“And the people differ with regard to the pen with which the decreed matters were written by the Great Recompense r(Ad-Dayyaan), Allaah, the Most High, </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><em>Was it before the Throne or after it?</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><em>There are two sayings mentioned by Aboo `Alaa al-Hamathaanee,</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><em>And the truth is that the Throne was before because it was there before the writing, </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><em>Before the writing, it stood upon its supports, </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><em>And the writing of the honourable pen came afterwards,</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><em>After it was brought into existence without any time between.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And speech with regard to pre-decree has already preceded. However, what is intended now is the <strong>prohibition of delving into it.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And speech and argumentation and disputing with regard to <em>Qadr </em>(pre-decree) is specifically forbidden,” </strong></span>We already have known that <em>eemaan</em> in pre-decree and pre-ordainment with its levels is a pillar from the pillars of <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, whoever does not believe in pre-decree and preordainment, he is not a <em>mu&#8217;min</em> (believer) because he has denied a pillar from the pillars of <em>eemaan</em>. And likewise, it is not permissible to argue about pre-decree and pre-ordainment to say <span style="color:#800080;">&#8220;Why will Allaah punish like that? Why does Allaah do such and such?&#8221;</span> as has preceded. It cannot be said why and how? So, no objections, no queries are to be made with regard to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. And you are not to enter into pre-ordainment and pre-decree with argumentation for you will not reach any <em>nateejah</em> (result or conclusion).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is upon you is to submit and to have <em>eemaan</em> and that you do not enter into any affair from the affairs of Allaah. This (pre-decree)  will not be known except by Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, and you will not reach any results and therefore it is said, “<strong>Pre-decree is Allaah’s secret.</strong>”<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah’s secret cannot be reached and cannot be encompassed so therefore don’t try to enter into it. It is upon you to have <em>eemaan</em> (believe) in whatever occurs in the texts of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah and that you stop at that. And that you turn your attention to performing righteous deeds and to leaving off sins and acts of disobedience and that you do not say, <span style="color:#808080;">“If Allaah has decreed for me that I am from the People of Paradise then I’ll be from the People of Paradise even if I don’t do any action and if Allaah has decreed for me that I am to be from the People of the Fire then I’ll certainly be from the People of the Fire.”</span> So this is false and futile speech, he should not say the like of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is not permissible to enter into these affairs because this is not the business of the servant, this is Allaah’s affair. Your business is to act, this is what is required from you. As for entering into pre-ordainment and pre-decree then it is to enter into a maze or a labyrinth from which the servant will never emerge.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“This is prohibited with all of the sects because the pre-decree is Allaah’s secret,” </strong></span>With all nations because pre-decree is the secret of Allaah and a secret cannot be encompassed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Majestic and Most High says:</p>
<p><strong>وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلَّا بِمَا شَاءَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they cannot encompass anything from Allaah’s knowledge except what He wishes. </strong></span>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 255)</p>
<p><strong> وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِهِ عِلْمًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they cannot encompass Allaah with their knowledge.</span><br />
</strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Soorah </span><u style="font-size:1rem;">T</u><span style="font-size:1rem;">aa Haa (20), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah </em><span style="font-size:1rem;">110)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not try to enter into the affairs of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, stick to your own affairs, stick to righteous deeds and leaving off sins and performing repentance from them, set your own record in order whilst you are still alive, occupy yourself with yourself. As for occupying yourself with pre-decree and pre-ordainment and &#8220;<em>why did such and such occur</em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>If Allaah has decreed all things then  in that case I don’t need to act</em>&#8220;. All of this is false and futile speech, there is no value to it and when the companions said to the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Should we not just rely upon what has been decreed for us? He said, “Rather act for everyone will have that which he was created for made easy for him.&#8221; </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, sent down:</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّ سَعْيَكُمْ لَشَتَّىٰ &#8211; 92:4</strong></p>
<p><strong>فَأَمَّا مَنْ أَعْطَىٰ وَاتَّقَىٰ &#8211; 92:5</strong></p>
<p><strong>وَصَدَّقَ بِالْحُسْنَىٰ &#8211; 92:6</strong></p>
<p><strong>فَسَنُيَسِّرُهُ لِلْيُسْرَىٰ &#8211; 92:7</strong></p>
<p><strong>وَأَمَّا مَن بَخِلَ وَاسْتَغْنَىٰ &#8211; 92:8</strong></p>
<p><strong>وَكَذَّبَ بِالْحُسْنَىٰ &#8211; 92:9</strong></p>
<p><strong>فَسَنُيَسِّرُهُ لِلْعُسْرَىٰ &#8211; 92:10</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Your deeds are diverse so as for the one who gives in charity and is dutiful to Allaah and believes in Allaah’s reward then We will make easy for him acts which are pleasing to Allaah. And as for the one who is miserly and thinks himself to be self-sufficient and denies Allaah’s reward then We will make easy for Him actions, which Allaah hates</strong>.<strong>”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8] </a>(Sooratul-Layl (92), <em>aayah </em>4-10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So you should carry out the <em>sabab</em> (means), either for the salvation of your own soul or for its destruction by your actions, which you perform by your own choice and your own will. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“All the people go out in the morning and the person then either sets his soul free or he destroys it.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And, the Lord, the Majestic, the Most High, forbade the prophets from speech with regard to pre-decree,”</span> </strong>Allaah forbade the creation; the prophets and other than them from speaking about pre-decree. And it is not mentioned from the prophets that they ever raised any objection to pre-decree because they knew the tremendousness of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, and His wisdom and they submitted and they adopted correct manners with respect to Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, and they had not used to ask about anything, which did not contain a point of welfare for them or a benefit, so the prophets would not ask about it. Likewise, the followers of the prophets would never ask about it. Rather, the prophets and their followers used to turn themselves towards action and give attention to it. They did not used to ask about pre-decree and pre-ordainment except from the aspect of belief and having <em>eemaan</em> in it. And having <em>eemaan</em> in pre-decree and pre-ordainment, if you have <em>eemaan</em> in it, it renders you at peace from doubts and from false ideas and from grief. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“You should know that whatever befalls you was never going to miss you and whatever misses you was never going to befall you.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So do not say: “If only I had done such and such then such and such would have been the case but rather, you should say, “<em>Qadr Allaah wa maa shaa·a fa`al</em> (it was the decree of Allaah and whatever He wishes He does.)”<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> forbade disputing about pre-decree and the companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam;</em> <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum,</em> they detested it and the <em>taabi`een</em>, they detested it and the scholars and the people of piety detested it, arguing about pre-decree.” </strong></span>When the Qadariyyah (those people who denied pre-decree) appeared at the end of the time of the companions, the companions strongly rebuked and refuted them and warned against them and made it clear that a servant, what is upon him is to have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) that whatever befalls him was not going to miss him and whatever misses him was never going to come to him and that whoever does not believe this then Allaah will burn Him in the Fire.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a> So upon this, their sayings were united when the sect of the Qadariyyah appeared in their time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So upon you is to submit and to affirm and to have <em>eemaan</em>,”</strong></span> this is what is obligatory upon you with regard to pre-decree and pre-ordainment; submission to the pre-ordainment of Allaah and His pre-decree and not to raise objections to it and that you believe as your `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) that Allaah does not do anything except for a wise purpose and that He does not punish anyone except on account of his deeds. So, any deficiencies are from you so instead of blaming pre-decree, you should blame yourself and you should repent to Allaah. So, no-one can prevent repentance (<em>tawbah)</em> and Allaah accepts repentance from those who repent. So, why do you then occupy yourself with something, which will have no benefit for you? So, upon you is to submit and to yield and comply and not to enter into that which is not your concern, There occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> that he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“From the excellence of a person’s Islaam is that he leaves off that which is not his concern.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And believing whatever Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said about all matters and be silent about whatever is besides that,” </strong></span>Meaning believe whatever the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, the one who does not speak from his own desires and do not make accusations against the a<u>h</u>aadeeth or raise doubts about them. As long as they are established from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> then they are not an arena for hesitation.</p>
<p><strong>فَلَا وَرَبِّكَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ حَتَّىٰ يُحَكِّمُوكَ فِيمَا شَجَرَ بَيْنَهُمْ ثُمَّ لَا يَجِدُوا فِي أَنفُسِهِمْ حَرَجًا مِّمَّا قَضَيْتَ وَيُسَلِّمُوا تَسْلِيمًا &#8211;</strong> 4:65</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So know by your Lord they will not be believers until they make you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Muhammad</span><span style="color:#008000;"><em><u> s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam)</em></span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> judge in whatever disputes occur between them then they do not find any difficulty in themselves from the judgement you have passed, rather they accept with full submission.</span>  </strong>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah </em>65)</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤْمِنٍ وَلَا مُؤْمِنَةٍ إِذَا قَضَى اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَمْرًا أَن يَكُونَ لَهُمُ الْخِيَرَةُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِمْ ۗ وَمَن يَعْصِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَالًا مُّبِينًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And it is not right for any believing man or any believing woman that when Allaah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they have any other choice in their affair and whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger then he has strayed far away.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A<u>h</u>zaab (33), <em>aayah </em>36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the like of these <em>aayahs</em>. So, what is obligatory upon you is to follow and to submit and to yield and comply. With regard to matters; meaning in all matters, the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> conveyed from Allaah everything, which the people need from the matters in their religion and he made it clear and Allaah completed the religion through him and there is no good except that he guided his nation to it and there is no evil except that he warned them from it and he left them upon the clear white path, its night is just the same as its day, no-one strays away from it except one who is destroyed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And stay silent upon whatever is other than that.”</span> </strong>This is just as has occurred in the <u>h</u>adeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah has made certain duties obligatory upon you so do not neglect them and He has made certain things forbidden for you so do not commit them and He has remained silent about some things as a mercy upon you, not forgetting so do not ask about them.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should not ask about anything except something which you need in your religion or your worldly life. And from the excellence of a person’s Islaam is his leaving off that which is not his concern. As for that which you do not have need of then asking about it is from the superfluous matters; extra unnecessary matters :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> forbade qeel wa qaal </strong>(loose conveying of useless speech) <strong>and asking too much and wasting wealth.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So your questions should be in accordance with the level of your need and do not ask about that which you do not have a need of.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator’s side point: In some wordings; <strong>“He whose name is Majestic” </strong>or in some of the narrations; <strong>“The Exalted and Most High.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Reported by Aboo Daawood in his <em>Sunan </em>and by a list of others; Imaam A<u>h</u>mad, at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee and by others besides.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s side point: This <u>h</u>adeeth is declared <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic) by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy and it’s a narration of the companion `Ubaadah ibn as-<u>S</u>aamit <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> That’s also been taken from the authentic <u>h</u>adeeth where they mention in a footnote that Muslim reported in his <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> from `Abdullaah ibn `Amr ibn al-Aa<u>s</u> <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa </em>who said that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah, the Most High, wrote the pre-decreed measures of all the created things fifty-thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth and His `Arsh (Throne) was upon the water.”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> This is the saying of the majority of the scholars and you can refer to the book <em>Bughyat ul-Murtaad</em> of Shaykh ul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah and likewise <em>al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah</em> of al-<u>H</u>aafidh ibn-Katheer, (right at the start of <em>al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah</em>) and in that reference al-Haafidh ibn-Katheer mentions that, “The saying that the pen was created first was the saying of some people and he mentioned it was the saying of the famous <em>mufassir</em>; Ibn Jareer a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abariyy and it was the saying of Ibn al- Jawzee and others besides them and as for the saying that the Throne was created first then the pen then this as he mentioned is the saying of the majority of the scholars, <em>W`Allaahu A`lam</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> From the famous scholars of these days who said that the Throne was created first before the pen was Shaykh ibn `Uthaymeen <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> and from those scholars who said that the pen was created before the Throne then Shaykh al-Albaaniyy <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>. Then there is some difference amongst the people of the Sunnah with regard to which of those two were created first <em>Allaahu A`lam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5">[5]</a> From the famous poem <em>Nooniyyah</em> of Ibn ul-Qayyim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6">[6]</a> Ibn `Abdul Barr said in his book <em>al-Istidhkaar</em>, “The scholars said and the wise people from olden times said, “Pre-decree is Allaah’s secret thing so do not look into it.””</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref7" name="_ftn7">[7]</a> <strong>Translator&#8217;s Side Point:</strong> Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> in his explanation something that is very commonly brought by people with regard to pre-decree,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">“The intellect may say &#8211; &#8220;Allaah has decreed all the decrees of the creation and He has made some of the people; People of Bliss (People of Paradise) and some of them wretched people; People of the Fire. So, the wretched people are therefore not able to be People of Bliss&#8221;, then the intellect becomes bewildered. Therefore, it is obligatory to withhold and to have <em>eemaan</em> that Allaah does not oppress anyone from His creation and He does not punish anyone from them except with the proof being established.<em> </em></span></p>
<p><strong>قُلْ فَلِلَّهِ الْحُجَّةُ الْبَالِغَةُ ۖ فَلَوْ شَاءَ لَهَدَاكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</strong> &#8211; 6:149</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And with Allaah is the decisive proof so if He had wished He would have guided you, all of you. </strong></span>(Sooratul-An`aam (6), <em>aayah</em> 149)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref8" name="_ftn8">[8]</a> Reported by al-Bukhaariyy (6,605) and Muslim (2,647) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of `Aliyy <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref9" name="_ftn9">[9]</a> Reported by Muslim (223) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Maalik al-Ash`ariyy <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref10" name="_ftn10">[10]</a> This <u>h</u>adeeth has preceded on page (319) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of `Ubaadah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and preceded on page (322) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref11" name="_ftn11">[11]</a>Taken directly from the <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The strong believer is better and  more beloved to Allaah than the weak believer and there is good in all of them, be eager upon that which can benefit you and seek the aid of Allaah and don’t be incapable and if something befalls you then do not say if only I had done such and such then such and such would’ve happened but rather you should say, Qadr Allaah, it was the decree of Allaah and whatever He wishes He does because saying ‘if only’, this opens up the door to the action of Satan.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Muslim (2,664).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref12" name="_ftn12">[12]</a> From `Abdullaah ibn Fayrooz ad-Daylami who said, “Something occurred in myself regarding this matter of pre-decree and I feared that it would corrupt for me my religion and my affair so therefore, I went to Ubayy ibn Ka`b and I said, <em>‘O Aboo Mundhir, something has occurred in myself with regard to this matter of pre-decree so I feared for my religion and my affair, so tell me something about that so that hopefully Allaah will benefit me through it.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he said, <em>‘If Allaah were to punish all the inhabitants of the heavens and the people of His earth then He would be punishing them and He would not be being unjust to them. And if He were to be merciful to them then His mercy would be better for them than their deeds. And if you had the like of Mount U<u>h</u>ud in gold or like the mountain of gold, which you spent it in Allaah’s cause, it would not be accepted from you unless and until you believed in pre-decree so that you know whatever happens to you was not going to miss you and whatever missed you was not going to come to you and if you were to die upon other than this, you will enter the Fire. And there will be nothing wrong for you to go to my brother `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood and ask him.’</em><em style="font-size:1rem;"> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, ‘So, I went to `Abdullaah and I asked him so he mentioned the like of what was mentioned by Ubayy and he said to me’, <em>‘There will be no harm if you go to <u>H</u>u<u>t</u>hayfah.’</em><em style="font-size:1rem;"> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I went to <u>H</u>u<u>t</u>hayfah and I asked him so he said the same as the two of them had said and he said,<em> “Go to Zayd ibn Thaabit and ask him.’ </em>So I went to Zayd ibn Thaabit and I asked him so he said,<em> ‘I heard Allaah’s Messenger <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam say</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘If Allaah were to punish the inhabitants of His heavens and the inhabitants of His earth then he would punish them and he would not be wronging them and if He were to have mercy upon them then His mercy would be better for them than their deeds deserve and if you had the like of the Mount U<u>h</u>ud in gold and you spent it in Allaah’s cause, Allaah would not accept it from you until you believed in pre-decree, all of it so that you know whatever befalls you was not going to miss you and whatever misses you was not going to befall you and if you die upon other than this, you will enter the Fire.”’</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad and Aboo Daawood and Ibn Maajah and the wording is his and declared authentic by Ibn <u>H</u>ibbaan and by Shaykh ul-Islaam Muhammad ibn `Abdul Wahhaab in <em>Kitaab at-Tawheed</em> and likewise declared <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref13" name="_ftn13">[13]</a> Reported by at-Tirmithee who said it’s <em>ghareeb </em>and by Ibn Maajah and by Al-Bayhaqi in <em>Shu`b al-Eemaan</em> and Ibn <u>H</u>ibbaan and others from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> There is some speech with regard to the scholars about the authenticity of this <u>h</u>adeeth, some of them don’t accept the <u>h</u>adeeth being authentic from the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and as for Shaykh al-Albaaniyy <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he declared the <u>h</u>adeeth <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> in his checking of Tirmithee, <u>h</u>adeeth being <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam,</em> <em>W`Allaahu A`lam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref14" name="_ftn14">[14]</a> Reported by <u>T</u>abaraanee in <em>Mu`jam al-Kabeer</em>, ad-Daaruqu<u>t</u>nee in his <em>Sunan</em>, al-<u>H</u>aakim, al-Bayhaqi and others besides from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Tha`labah al-Khushaniyy and the wording of the text of it was declared authentic by Ibn Katheer in his <em>Tafseer</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh al-Albaaniyy declared this <u>h</u>adeeth (<u>h</u>adeeth occurs as no. 30 in Imaam an-Nawawi’s 40 <u>h</u>adeeth) to be <em><u>d</u>a`eef</em> (weak) in his checking in his book <em>Ghayatul Maraam</em>  as hadeeth no. 4 because he mentioned the <em>Taabi`ee</em> is not established; Maqhu who heard from the companion Aboo Tha`labah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>. However Shaykh al-Albaaniyy before that in the book 2 <u>h</u>adeeth that  declared <em>hasan</em> (good) a narration with the wording from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Dardaa` <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“That which Allaah has declared lawful in His Book then it is lawful and whatever He forbade then it is what is forbidden and whatever He remained silent about then it is that which He has pardoned so accept from Allaah that which He has pardoned for Allaah does not forget anything.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 42 : Point 66</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And if you hear a man speaking against the narrations and not accepting them or denying anything from the narrations of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam,</em> then doubt his Islaam since he is a person having a despicable opinion and saying. No attack may be made upon Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> nor upon his companions since we have only come to know of Allaah and His Messenger and the Qur&#8217;aan and what is good and what is bad in this world and the Hereafter by way of the narrations. So, the Qur&#8217;aan needs the Sunnah more than the Sunnah needs the Qur&#8217;aan.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And if you hear a man speaking against the narrations and not accepting them or denying anything from the narrations of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> then doubt his Islaam,”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> Since from the meaning of the testification that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah is to obey him with regard to whatever he commanded and to believe him regarding whatever he informed of and to avoid whatever he forbade and prohibited and that Allaah is not worshipped except with that which He legislated. This is the meaning of the testification that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا آتَاكُمُ الرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانتَهُوا ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whatever the Messenger gives you then accept it and take it and whatever he forbids you from then keep away from it.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ashr (59), <em>aayah</em> 7)</p>
<p><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe, obey Allaah and obey the Messenger.</span><br />
</strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratun-Nisaa· 4, </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> 59)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is obligatory upon the Muslim is that he complies with whatever occurs in the a<u>h</u>aadeeth from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> since they are the second revelation after the Qur&#8217;aan. Because the fundamental evidences in Islaam upon which there is agreement are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly,</strong> the Qur&#8217;aan;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly,</strong> the Prophetic Sunnah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And thirdly,</strong> consensus; <em>Al-Ijmaa`.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These evidences, it is not permissible for a person to say, “I will not accept as evidence except the Qur&#8217;aan alone and I will not accept the Sunnah as evidence,” as is said by the Khawaarij and whoever follows their way and they say that the Qur&#8217;aan is <em>mutawaatir</em> (reported by huge numbers of people at every level of transmission so huge that they cannot be gathered together upon a lie) so they say, “the Qur&#8217;aan is <em>mutawaatir</em> and is rendered secure from deficiencies but as for the Sunnah then it is what is narrated by narrators and is therefore open to deficiencies.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is to accuse the whole <em>Ummah</em> (nation) and its scholars and the companions and the <em>taabi`een</em> (those who conveyed the narrations) in lacking in reliability and of lacking in trustworthiness whereas the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed about those people in his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“It will soon occur that a man who is full (belly) will be reclining upon his couch and will say &#8220;<em>Between us and you is the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. So, whatever we find in it to be permissible then we will take it to be permissible and whatever we find in it to be forbidden then we will take it as being forbidden</em>.” Then He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, “Indeed, I have been given the Qur&#8217;aan and the like of it along with it.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>`alayhissalaatu wassalaam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“May Allaah make bright the face of a person who hears my saying and he retains it and he coveys it just as he heard it or sometimes one who has something conveyed to him may better comprehend it than one who actually heard it.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>`alayhissalaatu wassalaam</em> said when he gave the <em>khu<u>t</u>bah</em> (address) in Arafah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Let the one who witnesses amongst you convey to the one who is absent.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the one who heard conveys from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. This is a trust; <em>amaanah</em>, which was established by the narrators of <u>h</u>adeeth and by the men of <u>h</u>adeeth, may Allaah reward them with good, Aameen. And they protected the Prophetic Sunnah from foreign things and from lies and they conveyed it pure and clear just as it came from the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> faithfully and this is from the miracles of this Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.</em> So, the Sunnah is not an arena for withholding or for making accusations. Rather, it is obligatory to believe it and it is obligatory to act upon it just as it is obligatory to act upon the Qur&#8217;aan because it is <em>wa<u>h</u>iyy</em> (revelation) from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said with regard to the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا يَنطِقُ عَنِ الْهَوَىٰ</strong> &#8211; 53:3</p>
<p><strong>إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا وَحْيٌ يُوحَىٰ</strong> &#8211; 53:4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He </strong>(the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>)<strong> does not speak from his desires, it is just revelation inspired. </strong></span>(Sooratun-Najm (53), <em>aayah </em>3-4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the <em>a<u>h</u>aadeeth</em> are revelation from Allaah even though their wordings are from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. As for the Qur&#8217;aan then its wording and meaning is from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High and as for the Sunnah and the Prophetic <em>a<u>h</u>aadeeth</em> then their meanings is from Allaah and their wordings are from the speech of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> who does not speak from his own desires. So, his <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> wordings are preserved from error and are true and are not open to doubt. So, whoever denies the Sunnah then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) because he has discontinued the second fundamental. And the Qur&#8217;aan must have the Sunnah because it explains it and clarifies the meaning of the Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p><strong> وَأَنزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ الذِّكْرَ لِتُبَيِّنَ لِلنَّاسِ مَا نُزِّلَ إِلَيْهِمْ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We have sent down to you the reminder </strong>(the Qur&#8217;aan)<strong> for you to then explain to the people that which was sent down to them. </strong></span>(Sooratun-Nahl (16), <em>aayah </em>44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Sunnah clarifies the Qur&#8217;aan and explains the Qur&#8217;aan because the Qur&#8217;aan comes with some things, which are <em>mujmalah</em> (unspecified) such as the prayer (<u>S</u>alaah) and the Zakaah and the Hajj and <u>S</u>iyyaam (fasting), the command for these is in the Qur&#8217;aan but how to perform them is not mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan. So, the Qur&#8217;aan comes with some things, which are unspecified such as the prayer and the Zakaah and the Hajj and fasting, the Sunnah explains them and clarifies them. It explains the Zakaat and its amounts and fasting when it is to begin and when it is to end and the rights of Hajj; how a person should perform Hajj. So, he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Take your rights of Hajj from me.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Pray just as you have seen me praying.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High said:</p>
<p><strong>لَّقَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ فِي رَسُولِ اللَّهِ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is indeed for you in Allaah’s Messenger a fine pattern of conduct to follow.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A<u>h</u>zaab (33), <em>aayah </em>21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Sunnah therefore explains the Qur&#8217;aan and clarifies it and indicates it and the person who says, “I will act upon the Qur&#8217;aan but I will not act upon the Sunnah” he is a <em>ka<u>th</u>aab</em> (liar) for he has not acted upon the Qur&#8217;aan because the Qur&#8217;aan has within it:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا آتَاكُمُ الرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانتَهُوا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whatever the Messenger gives you then take it and whatever he forbids you from then desist.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ashr (59), <em>aayah</em> 7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is within it:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا يَنطِقُ عَنِ الْهَوَىٰ</strong> &#8211; 53:3</p>
<p><strong>إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا وَحْيٌ يُوحَىٰ</strong> &#8211; 53:4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And he </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the Messenger </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> does not speak from his desires, it is just revelation inspired.</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Najm (53), <em>aayah </em>3-4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;aan, it is stated that the Sunnah clarifies it.</p>
<p><strong> وَأَنزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ الذِّكْرَ لِتُبَيِّنَ لِلنَّاسِ مَا نُزِّلَ إِلَيْهِمْ  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We sent down to you </strong>(Prophet Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>)<strong> the reminder </strong>(Qur&#8217;aan)<strong> so that you should clarify to the people what has been sent down to them. </strong></span>(Sooratun-Na<u>h</u>l (16), <em>aayah </em>44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when he leaves off acting upon the Sunnah then he has not acted upon the Qur&#8217;aan, which he claims that he acts upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the people are some who make a distinction between the a<u>h</u>aadeeth and who say &#8211; &#8220;<span style="color:#993366;">the <u>h</u>adeeth which is <em>mutawaatir</em> (<u>h</u>adeeth which has so many narrators at every level of transmission that it is impossible they could have got together and invented it) brings about knowledge (<em>ilm</em>) but the <u>h</u>adeeth which are <em>aa<u>h</u>aad</em> (which doesn’t reach that level), it only amounts to <u>dh</u>ann (surmise/uncerainity)&#8221;</span>. And this is <em>baa<u>t</u>il</em> (false and futile) because everything which is authentic from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and which is established, it brings about `<em>ilm</em> (knowledge) whether it’s <em>mutawaatir</em> or <em>aahaad</em>. So, there is no distinction to be made between the level of proof of the <u>h</u>adeeth which is authentic. It is obligatory to comply with all of it and to act upon it without any distinction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Soofees also do not act upon the Sunnah, indeed not even upon the Qur&#8217;aan. They only act upon their own tastes and their own feelings and they say, <span style="color:#993366;">“We take from Allaah directly and we do not take by way of the Messenger because we have reached Allaah so therefore, we have no need of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And the Messenger is just for the common folk, those who have not yet reached Allaah.”</span> And this is from the most baseless falsehood and the most open disbelief and Allaah’s refuge is sought. Aameen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Or he denies anything,” </strong>whoever denies the Sunnah in general and says, “<span style="color:#993366;">The Sunnah is not to be acted upon, only the Qur&#8217;aan is to be acted upon&#8221;</span> or who denies a part of the Sunnah, which are the authentic a<u>h</u>aadeeth and says, “<span style="color:#993366;">They are not to be acted upon</span>” and some of them say, “<span style="color:#993366;">Hadeeth is not acted upon except with the condition that it conforms to the Qur&#8217;aan</span>” and this is <em>baatil</em> (false and futile) and is an accusation against the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> that he may bring something which contradicts the Qur&#8217;aan. So, this saying is not permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> sometimes came with things, which were not in the Qur&#8217;aan such as the prohibition of being married to a woman along with her paternal aunt and her maternal aunt. The Qur&#8217;aan contains the prohibition of being married to two sisters, whereas, the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“A man may not combine a woman and her paternal aunt nor between a woman and her maternal aunt.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is obligatory to act upon whatever the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And if you see a person doing any of this; rejecting the authentic narrations from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> or denying anything from them then accuse his Islaam for he is a man who is despicable in his position and his saying.” </strong>The person who says this, either he will be from the Khawaarij or he will be from the Jahmiyyah and the Mu’tazilah or he will be from the Soofees; those who claim that they have no need of the a<u>h</u>aadeeth because they have reached Allaah and they take from Allaah directly and they say, “<em>You people take your religion from someone who is dead but we take from the Everliving One Who never dies</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And no accusation may be made against Allaah’s Messenger<em><u> s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> nor against his companions,” </strong>No accusation may be made against Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> because he is rendered secure from error by Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. So, the person who accuses the Messenger or attacks him and says that he follows his desires or that he behaves unjustly or that he oppresses and the like of that then this one is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise the person who makes an attack upon the companions of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> because Allaah is pleased with them and has praised them and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was pleased with them and praised them and repeated words of praise upon them and they were the best of generations. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The best of you are my generation…”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Do not abuse my companions for by the one in Whose hand is my soul, if one of you were to spend the like of U<u>h</u>ud in gold, it would not reach even a handsful amount of one of them nor even a half of it.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَالسَّابِقُونَ الْأَوَّلُونَ مِنَ الْمُهَاجِرِينَ وَالْأَنصَارِ وَالَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُم بِإِحْسَانٍ رَّضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا عَنْهُ وَأَعَدَّ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي تَحْتَهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا أَبَدًا ۚ ذَٰلِكَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ</strong> &#8211; 9:100</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the First and Foremost ones from the Muhaajireen and the An<u>s</u>aar and those who followed them upon good, Allaah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him and He has prepared for them gardens of Paradise beneath which rivers flow, they will remain forever therein, that is the tremendous success.</span> </strong>(Sooratut–Towbah (9), <em>aayah </em>100)</p>
<p><strong>لَّقَدْ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِذْ يُبَايِعُونَكَ تَحْتَ الشَّجَرَةِ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah was pleased with the believers when they gave you the pledge beneath the tree.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fat<u>h</u> (48), <em>aayah </em>18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tree is the tree where the pledge; <em>bay</em>`<em>ah</em> was given at <u>H</u>udaybiyyah; the pledge that the companions gave to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in the 6<sup>th</sup> year after the Hijrah, pledge of <u>H</u>udaybiyyah, <em>Bay’atu</em> <em>Ri<u>d</u>waan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> فَعَلِمَ مَا فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ فَأَنزَلَ السَّكِينَةَ عَلَيْهِمْ وَأَثَابَهُمْ فَتْحًا قَرِيبًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So, He knew what was in their hearts and He sent down tranquillity upon them and He rewarded them with a victory close at hand.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fat<u>h</u> (48), <em>aayah </em>18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said at the end of the Soorah:</p>
<p><strong>مُّحَمَّدٌ رَّسُولُ اللَّهِ ۚ وَالَّذِينَ مَعَهُ أَشِدَّاءُ عَلَى الْكُفَّارِ رُحَمَاءُ بَيْنَهُمْ ۖ تَرَاهُمْ رُكَّعًا سُجَّدًا يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلًا مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرِضْوَانًا ۖ سِيمَاهُمْ فِي وُجُوهِهِم مِّنْ أَثَرِ السُّجُودِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ مَثَلُهُمْ فِي التَّوْرَاةِ ۚ وَمَثَلُهُمْ فِي الْإِنجِيلِ كَزَرْعٍ أَخْرَجَ شَطْأَهُ فَآزَرَهُ فَاسْتَغْلَظَ فَاسْتَوَىٰ عَلَىٰ سُوقِهِ يُعْجِبُ الزُّرَّاعَ لِيَغِيظَ بِهِمُ الْكُفَّارَ ۗ وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ مِنْهُم مَّغْفِرَةً وَأَجْرًا عَظِيمًا</strong> &#8211; 48:29</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah and those who are with him…</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Fat<u>h </u>(48), <em>aayah 29</em>)<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the companions (<em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>aabah</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>…those who are with the Messenger (the companions) are stern against the disbelievers, merciful amongst themselves, you will see them bowing and prostrating seeking the bounty of Allaah and His pleasure. Their sign will be upon their faces from the trace of prostration, that is their description in the Towraat… </strong></span>(Sooratul-Fath (48), <em>aayah </em>29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, their description, which is mentioned in the Towraat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">…and their description in the Injeel.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fath (48), <em>aayah </em>29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning their description in the Injeel, which was sent down to ‘Eesaa is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They are like a plant, which sends out a side shoot, which strengthens it and it becomes firm and stands straight upon its stalk, the sowers are pleased at it so that the disbelievers should become enraged at them.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fath (48), <em>aayah </em>29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this <em>aayah</em> is an example about the description of the companions. So, this shows that the person that becomes enraged at the companions or who hates them, he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) as is shown by the end of the <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">…so that the disbelievers should become enraged at them.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Fath (48), <em>aayah </em>29)<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Because we have only come to know of Allaah and we have come to know of His Messenger and we have come to know of the Qur&#8217;aan and we know of good and evil in this world and the Hereafter by way of the <em>aathaar</em> (narrations).” </strong>By way of the narrations, which they narrated and they are the a<u>h</u>aadeeth, which they reported from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So, whoever makes an attack upon the narrations is making an attack upon the Islamic legislation because it was narrated in that case by narrators who were liars and who are not trustworthy and this is the intent of the Jews and the Magians to plot against the Muslims. So, a group of them abuse the companions and their intent is to abolish the <em>sharee</em>`<em>ah</em> (Islamic legislation) for if they can abolish its carriers and its narrators and they can attack the best ones of this nation then their attacking other than the companions is even more likely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“For indeed the Qur&#8217;aan has more need of the Sunnah than the Sunnah has for the Qur&#8217;aan.” </strong>The Qur&#8217;aan has more need of the Sunnah as we have mentioned because the Sunnah explains and gives explanation of the Qur&#8217;aan. So, there are some things left unexplained in the Qur&#8217;aan, which have been explained in the Sunnah. So, Allaah has commanded the prayer but He has not made clear the number of its rak`ahs and He has not made clear the description of the prayer and this was made clear by the Messenger<em><u> s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Pray as you have seen me praying.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <u>H</u>ajj comes in the Qur&#8217;aan <em>mujmalan</em> (unexplained) and its explanation was left to the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So, he performed <u>H</u>ajj with the Muslims in the Farewell <u>H</u>ajj and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Take your rights of <u>H</u>ajj from me.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, learn from my actions and my sayings what will enable you to carry out your rights of pilgrimage and Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p><strong>لَّقَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ فِي رَسُولِ اللَّهِ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ لِّمَن كَانَ يَرْجُو اللَّهَ وَالْيَوْمَ الْآخِرَ وَذَكَرَ اللَّهَ كَثِيرًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is for you in Allaah’s Messenger a fine example for whomever has hope in Allaah and in the Last Day and who makes mention of Allaah a great deal.</span> </strong></span>(Sooratul-A<u>h</u>zaab (33), <em>aayah </em>21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Qur&#8217;aan has need of the Sunnah for it to clarify it. So, the person who accepts Qur&#8217;aan only then he will cut off the Qur&#8217;aan from that which explains and clarifies it and this is the goal of the people of misguidance and those who have deviation in their hearts. Because the people of deviation accept one part of the evidences and they leave the other part which explains it and clarifies it off and they take one part of the evidences, which are unclear and they leave the clear and decisive part, which clarifies it and explains it. This is the way of the people of deviation and the way of those who pretend to have knowledge and the ignorant ones; those who claim knowledge and those who do not know the correct way of deriving evidence nor the principles of establishing proof. So, they make forbidden and declare things lawful without any insight and Allaah’s refuge is sought, <em>aameen,</em> because they have not followed <em>al-manhaj al-`ilm</em> (the correct knowledge based methodology). Rather, they have just learned by themselves or from their own books or with those who are ignorant like themselves.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 41 : Point 65</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that no-one will enter Paradise except by the mercy of Allaah. And that Allaah will not punish anyone except according to the degree of his sins. And if He were to punish all the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth; the righteous and the wicked amongst them, then He will be punishing them without being unjust to them. And it is not permissible to say about Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, that He is unjust since the unjust is the one who takes something that is not his to take, whereas creation and decree is for Allaah. The creation is His creation and the world is His world. He is not to be questioned about what He does but they will be questioned. And it is not to be said, &#8216;Why?&#8217; and &#8216;How?&#8217; And no-one can enter between Allaah and His creation. </strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/know-that-no-one-will-enter-paradise-except-by-the-mercy-of-allaah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And you should know that no-one will enter Paradise except by the mercy of Allaah,” </strong><em>Al-Jannah</em> (Paradise) is expensive and exalted and it cannot be reached through deeds, no matter how much a person works and even if he does all the acts of obedience then his deeds will not meet up to the favours that have been bestowed upon him. So, if he were to be brought to account for those favours then no deed would remain for him. This is from one aspect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second aspect</strong> is that Paradise is expensive and it does not have a price that can be assessed in terms of deeds or wealth or other than that, no-one knows how tremendous it is except for Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. However, Allaah enters the believers into Paradise by His <em>ra<u>h</u>mah</em> (mercy) by means of their deeds. So, deeds are just a <em>sabab</em> (means) towards entry into Paradise but they do not necessitate entry into Paradise nor are they the price for Paradise. And therefore, he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“No-one from amongst you will enter into Paradise through his deeds.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is in order that a person should not become amazed and complacent at his own deeds. It is not stated so that he should abandon performing deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p><strong> ادْخُلُوا الْجَنَّةَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Enter into Paradise on account of that which you used to do.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratun-Na<u>h</u>l (16), <em>aayah</em> 32)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Baa here does not show compensation or the price. Rather, the Baa here, <strong>“Bimaa Kuntum Ta’maloon”</strong> is to show a cause or a means, meaning by means of that which he used to do as is shown by the <u>h</u>adeeth that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“None of you will enter into Paradise through his deeds.” So, they said, “Not even you Oh Messenger of Allaah?” So, he said, “Nor even me unless Allaah covers me with His mercy.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, a person should not become amazed at his own deeds. However, a person will not enter into Paradise except by means of deeds. So, if a person did not perform any deeds, he will not enter Paradise because he has not carried out the means.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And Allaah does not punish anyone except in accordance with the degree of his sins,” </strong>Paradise is <em>fa<u>d</u>l</em> (a favour) from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High and is through the mercy of Allaah and deeds are a means for entry into it and the People of the Fire will not be punished except in accordance with their sins. They will not be punished because of the sins of other people and they will not be punished whilst not having any sins. So, this is from `<em>adl</em> (justice). So, Paradise is from <em>al-fa<u>d</u>l</em> (favour) and the Fire is from <em>al-`adl</em> (justice).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And if He were to punish the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth, the righteous ones of them and the wicked ones of them then He will be punishing them without being unjust to them.” </strong>This is just as has preceded that a person no matter how many deeds he performs then his deeds will not match up to even a part of the favours of Allaah upon him. If Allaah were to punish him that would be justice because of his falling short in giving thanks for the favours of Allaah upon him. And this speech which he mentioned is the text of a <u>h</u>adeeth from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“If Allaah were to punish the inhabitants of His heavens and the people of His earth then He would punish them and He would not be unjust to them. And if He were to be merciful to them then His mercy would be better than their deeds deserved.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because He would punish the evildoer on account of his evil acts and He would be punishing the righteous person because of the fact that his deeds did not qualify him for entry into Paradise because he did not match the favours of Allaah upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“It is not permissible to say about Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, that He is unjust,” </strong>Allaah, the Majestic and Most High has declared Himself free of <em><u>dh</u>ulm</em> (oppression, injustice).</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا رَبُّكَ بِظَلَّامٍ لِّلْعَبِيدِ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord is not unjust to the servants.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah Fu<u>ss</u>illat (41), <em>aayah </em>46)</p>
<p><strong>لَا ظُلْمَ الْيَوْمَ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There will be no injustice on this day. Allaah is quick in reckoning.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah Ghaafir (40), <em>aayah</em> 17)</p>
<p><strong>وَلَا يَظْلِمُ رَبُّكَ أَحَدًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord does not wrong anyone.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Kahf (18), <em>aayah </em>49)</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا ظَلَمْنَاهُمْ وَلَٰكِن كَانُوا هُمُ الظَّالِمِينَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">We did not oppress them. However, they were the wrongdoers.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Zukhruf (43), <em>aayah </em>76)</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا ظَلَمْنَاهُمْ وَلَٰكِن كَانُوا أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We did not oppress them but rather they oppressed their own souls.</span> </strong>(Soorah Na<u>h</u>l (16), <em>aayah </em>118)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> reported the words of his Lord, He the Most High that He said: (Hadeeth Qudsi)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“O My servants I have made oppression forbidden for Myself and I have made it forbidden for you to oppress one another so do not commit oppression.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, is a just judge and oppression (<em><u>dh</u>ulm</em>) does not befit Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And oppression is only one taking that which is not His to take whereas creation and decree is for Allaah.” </strong><em>A<u>dh</u>&#8211;<u>dh</u>ulm</em> (oppression) is to wrongfully take the right of the people. And do the people have any right over Allaah? They have no right upon Allaah and no-one can make anything binding upon Allaah. Rather, the right of the servants with Allaah is that He should not punish one who does not associate anything with Him. <span style="color:#800080;">This is a right which He, the Perfect, has given as a favour</span>. And oppression (<em><u>dh</u>ulm)</em> is to put something in other than its due place. So, Allaah does not put punishment upon those who deserve bliss and He does not give bliss to those who deserve punishment. Rather, He gives bliss to those who deserve it and He gives punishment to those who deserve it and this is <em>al-`adl</em> (justice) but as for the opposite then that would be oppression. If He were to punish the people of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and bestow honour to the people of disbelief, this would be oppression and Allaah is free of that. It is not possible that He will punish the people of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and bestow honour upon the people of disbelief and that He will enter the disbelievers into Paradise and enter the believers into the Fire. This does not befit Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And Allaah; creation and decree are for Him and the creation is His creation and the world is His world.” </strong>Allaah, the Most High said:</p>
<p><strong>أَلَا لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالْأَمْرُ ۗ تَبَارَكَ اللَّهُ رَبُّ الْعَالَمِينَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Is not creating and commanding His? Exalted is Allaah, the Lord and nurturer of the whole of creation.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Alaa lahul- khalq,” </strong>Is creating not His?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is to bring things into existence from non-existence. So, all the created being were created by Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, no-one can create along with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>اللَّهُ خَالِقُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah is the Creator of everything.</span><br />
</strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratuz-Zumar (39), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah </em><span style="font-size:1rem;">62)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>أَمْ جَعَلُوا لِلَّهِ شُرَكَاءَ خَلَقُوا كَخَلْقِهِ فَتَشَابَهَ الْخَلْقُ عَلَيْهِمْ ۚ قُلِ اللَّهُ خَالِقُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَهُوَ الْوَاحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Or do they set up partners for Allaah who they claim create with the like of His creation such that the creation is confused for them? Say, Allaah is the Creator of everything and He is the One, the Overpowering Subduer. </span> </strong>(Sooratur-Ra`d (13), <em>aayah </em>16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Or do they set up partners for Allaah who create with the like of His creation such that the creation would be confused for them?”</strong> Such that that created by the servant resembles that created by Allaah, this is impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say, “Allaah is the Creator of everything and He is the One, the Overpowering Subduer.”’</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُم مَّا تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَرُونِي مَاذَا خَلَقُوا مِنَ الْأَرْضِ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “Do you see that which you call upon besides Allaah? Show me what they have created upon the earth.”</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Ahqaaf (46), <em>aayah </em>4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“<em>al-khalq</em>,” creating is for Allaah alone, <em>w`al-amar,</em>” and the decree and the command is for Him,” </strong><em>al-amar</em> (command/decree) is legislating and sending down legislation. So, the Creator, He is the one who commands and forbids and legislates for His servants whatever is beneficial for them and He it is Who forbids whatever is harmful for them and it is not for anyone to command or forbid or to obligate an act of worship or to prohibit anything without a proof.</p>
<p><strong>أَمْ لَهُمْ شُرَكَاءُ شَرَعُوا لَهُم مِّنَ الدِّينِ مَا لَمْ يَأْذَن بِهِ اللَّهُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Or do they have partners who legislate things from the religion for them that Allaah has not given permission for.</span> </strong>(Soorah ash-Shooraa (42), <em>aayah</em> 21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the <em>amar</em> (decree/command) is for Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, the command relating to what occurs in creation and relating to what is pre-decreed, <em>w’al amrush-shar`ee</em> (and the command relating to what is legislated), He commands and He prohibits, He, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p><strong>أَلَا لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالْأَمْرُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Is not the creating and the command for Him?</span><br />
</strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah </em><span style="font-size:1rem;">54)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He made a distinction between <em>khalq</em> (creating) and <em>al-amar</em> (commanding). So, this shows the command is not something created and this contains a refutation of the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>; those who said that the Qur·aan is created and that the speech of Allaah is created. So, Allaah had made a distinction between the creating and between the command. The command is from His speech and His legislation and Allaah has made a distinction between the creation and between the command. So, this proves that the speech of Allaah is not created.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And the world is His world, He, the Majestic and Most High.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the abodes are three;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly,</strong> <em>daarud-duniya</em> (the abode of this world),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second,</strong> <em>wa daarul-barzakh</em> (intermediate period in the grave),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the third one,</strong> <em>wa daarul-qaraar wahiyaa al-aakhirah</em> (the abode of permanent residence and it is the Hereafter).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of them belong to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And He will not be asked about what He does but they will be asked,” </strong>He cannot be asked about what He does, He, the Perfect and Most High because His actions contain no deficiency and there is no shortcoming in them. So, they are perfect and precise and they never suffer from any deficiency or any shortcoming and questions are only to be asked about one who has deficiencies or shortcomings in his actions. So, Allaah cannot be asked about what He does because His actions are perfect and complete.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second reason;</strong> it is not just on account of His overpowering and His Lordship as is said by those who say it that He cannot be asked because of His tremendousness, He, the Perfect and Most High and because of His Majesty. However, it is not this alone, rather, He is not to be asked also because His actions are perfect and precise. They do not suffer from any deficiency at all or any flaws, contrary to the created being for he will be asked about his actions because he commits errors and his deeds are deficient and observations are to be made concerning him. So, he will be questioned because he is deficient from every aspect except for those who are rendered complete and aided and supported by Allaah. And therefore, he said, <strong>“But rather they will be questioned.”</strong> This is the difference between the Creator and the created being that Allah is not to be questioned whereas, the created being will be questioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“</strong><strong>And it is not to be said, &#8216;Why?&#8217; and &#8216;How?&#8217; And no-one can enter between Allaah and His creation.</strong><strong>” </strong>No objection is to be raised about Allaah such that it is said, “Why did Allaah create such and such and How did Allaah create these things?” This is not permissible with respect to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. Rather, it is upon us to submit and to comply and to believe that the actions of Allaah are perfect and complete and do not suffer any deficiency or shortcoming. So, even if some of the points of wisdom or the underlying reasons remain hidden to us then still we do not ask about them, rather, we submit. So, if we understand the wisdom and the underlying reason then this is fine but if we do not understand it then we submit and we do not raise objections to Allaah or withhold from action until we know the wisdom or the underlying reason.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 40 : Point 64</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> that when children are afflicted by anything in the life of this world then they feel pain. And that is mentioned because Bakr ibn ukht `Abdul Waa<u>h</u>id said &#8220;<em>they do not feel pain</em>&#8221; and he lied.</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/when-children-are-afflicted-by-anything-in-the-life-of-this-world-then-they-feel-pain" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This matter is mentioned on account of those who say that children do not feel any pain. And he mentioned this to refute this man and this man it is said that he was from the <em>Khawaarij </em>also<em>. </em>And the <em>Khawaarij</em> have even more surprising things than these worthless sayings on account of their ignorance and on account of their pretence to knowledge. When a child suffers something, he screams and he cries and he calls out for help and this is a proof that he indeed feels pain and this is something witnessed and felt. However, this man has strange sayings and from them is this issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Al <u>H</u>aafi<u>z</u> ibn <u>H</u>ajar said in Lisaan ul-Meezaan: &#8220;Bakr ibn ukht `Abdul Waa<u>h</u>id ibn Zayd al-Ba<u>s</u>ree al-Zaahid&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was mentioned by Ibn <u>H</u>azm in <em>Al-Milal W’al Ni<u>h</u>al</em> as being one of the <strong><em>Khawaarij</em> </strong>that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993366;">“With regard to every sin, even a small sin, even a slight lie which a person told as a joke that the person who does it is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever), a <em>mushrik</em> (one who associates partners with Allaah) from the People of the Hellfire except that if he is from the people who fought at Badr then he will be a <em>kaafir</em>, a <em>mushrik</em> but he is from the People of Paradise”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his student `Abdullaah ibn `Eesaa used to say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993366;">“The insane person and the children and the animals never ever feel any pain on account of every ailment or anything else because Allaah never oppresses anything even by the extent of a tiniest ant.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qutaybah (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) quoted this matter of pain from Bakr himself. From his foul sayings is that, “Whoever steals anything even to the amount of a mustard seed will remain in the Hellfire forever along with the disbelievers” and Ibn Qutaybah refuted this at length.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 40 : Point 63</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And Allaah rewards the martyr (<em>shaheed</em>) for his martyrdom.</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The martyr (<em>ash-shaheed)</em> is the person who is killed on the battlefield whilst fighting against the disbelievers. He fights so that the word of Allaah is uppermost.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everything of this person will be forgiven by Allaah, except for a <strong>debt</strong> (<em><strong>ad-dayn</strong>)</em> which is upon him because a debt is the right of the people and a right of a person will not fall away unless it is given to him or he pardons with regard to it. But as for the sins which are between the person and Allaah then Allaah will forgive them all on account of a person being martyred in the cause of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are also <strong>martyrs who are not killed upon the battlefield</strong> such as a person who dies through the plague, he is a martyr (<em>shaheed)</em> and one who is killed defending his wealth or his honour or his family then he is a <em>shaheed</em> (martyr) or the person who dies in an unexpected accident such as a fire or by drowning, he is a martyr with Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, meaning he will have the reward of a martyr but he is not the same as the martyr who dies on the battlefield with regard to rulings. Rather, he is washed and shrouded and a funeral prayer is said over him. <span style="font-size:1rem;">As for the martyr who dies upon the battlefield then he is not washed and he is not shrouded in any clothes except those he was killed in and funeral prayer is not said over him and he is buried with his blood upon him.</span><a style="font-size:1rem;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> When they mention that there are other martyrs besides the martyr who’s killed upon the battlefield, Shaykh Fowzaan mentions examples especially the one who dies through plague, one who is killed defending his wealth or his honour or his family, one who dies in a sudden accident like a fire or drowning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al Bukhaariyy reported in his <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (653) and Muslim reports it also (1,914) on Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> who said Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The martyrs (<em>shuhadaa</em>) are five; the one who dies of the plague and the one who dies of an abdominal complaint and the one who drowns and the one who has a house structure fall upon him and the martyr who is killed fighting in Allaah’s cause.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the wording here is that of Al-Bukhaariyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there also occurs from Jaabir ibn al-`Ateeq <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> who said Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The martyrs are seven besides the one who is killed in Allaah’s cause; the one who dies of the plague is a martyr and the one who drowns is a martyr and the person who dies from pleurisy is a martyr </strong></span><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>and the person who dies of an abdominal complaint is a martyr and the one who dies in a fire is a martyr and the one who dies underneath a building falling is a martyr and the woman who dies whilst pregnant is a martyr.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Imaam Maalik in his <em>Muwa<u>tt</u>a</em>, Imaam A<u>h</u>mad in his <em>Musnad</em> and Aboo Dawood, Ibn Maajah and An-Nasaa`ee and Ibn <u>H</u>ibbaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy said with regard to this narration, “It is <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam An-Nawawi</strong> said in his explanation of Muslim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars said these types of death are <em>shahaadah</em> (martyrdom) on account of Allaah, the Most High bestowing His favour because of their severity and how painful they can be. And there occurs in another <u>h</u>adeeth in the <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever is killed defending his wealth then he is a martyr and whoever is killed defending his family then he is a martyr.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it’s already been explained in the Book of <em>Eemaan</em> and there occurs in another authentic <u>h</u>adeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever is killed defending his sword is a martyr.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam an-Nawawi</strong> said that the the scholars said: what is meant by the martyrdom of those people, all of them besides the one who is killed fighting in Allaah’s cause,  is that &#8211; in the Hereafter they will receive the reward of the martyrs. As for this world, then they are to be washed and funeral prayer said over them. And there has already preceded in the Book of <em>Eemaan</em> an explanation of that. And the fact that the martyrs are of <strong>three categories</strong>:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><span style="color:#993366;"><strong>Firstly</strong></span>, the martyr who is the martyr with regard to this world and the Hereafter and he is the one who is killed whilst fighting the disbelievers.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><span style="color:#993366;"><strong>Secondly</strong></span>, one who is a martyr in the Hereafter but not with regard to the rulings of this life and they are the ones mentioned here &#8211; meaning the two <u>h</u>adeeth we just heard, those who are treated as being the martyr in the Hereafter with regard to the rulings in this life, we can treat them as normal people that have died.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><span style="color:#993366;"><strong>Thirdly</strong></span>, one who is apparently a martyr in this world but not so in the Hereafter, he is the person who steals something from the Booty or who is killed whilst fleeing.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> said on this point,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say (with regard to the point that <strong>“the martyr is rewarded for his martyrdom, the sick person is rewarded when he is sick”</strong>) that occurs in authentic a<u>h</u>aadeeth, which show that a Muslim who falls sick is rewarded during his illness because he knows Allaah caused him to become ill and is the one Who cures. As for martyrdom then it is a very high level, which Allaah gives to whoever He wishes from His servants. However, it cannot be attained except through <em>ikhlaa<u>s</u></em> (making ones deeds purely and sincerely for Allaah) and through <em>mutaaba</em>`ah (following the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> as example). So whoever is killed fighting truly in Allaah’s cause then he is a martyr from the martyrs of this world and the Hereafter if he is killed fighting between the disbelievers and the Muslims. And likewise, one who is killed by the innovators (<em>mubtadi`oon)</em> such as the <em>Khawaarij</em> and their like and that occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth with regard to the <em>Khawaarij</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Glad tidings of a tree in Paradise are for those who fight them and they kill him.”</span> </strong>[Reported by Aboo Daawood and others.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the martyrs with regard to the Hereafter, then they are many and from the martyrs of the Hereafter are the one who dies through the plague, through a stomach complaint, in a fire, being drowned and a building falling upon him and so on.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 40 : Point 62</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> that when a man becomes ill, Allaah gives him reward for his illness.</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F378202253&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/allaah-causes-afflictions-to-strike-the-believers-to-purify-them-multiply-their-reward" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah does not allow the reward due to the believers to become lost and He causes afflictions to strike the believers in order to <strong>purify them</strong> or to <strong>multiply their reward</strong>. He may cause calamities to happen to the believer to wipe away his sins and to purify him from sins. And it may be the case that he does not have sins but He still causes them to happen to him in order to raise his ranks in the Hereafter because Allaah has written for him a high rank in Paradise, which he cannot reach through his deeds. So, therefore Allaah tries him with afflictions so that He multiplies the reward for him so that he can reach this level. So the believer is upon good and therefore he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“How amazing is the matter of the believer, all of his matters are good for him. If something pleasing comes upon him then he gives thanks and that will be good for him and if something harmful comes to him then he has patience (<u>s</u>abr) and that will be good for him and that will not be except for the believer (mu&#8217;min).”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So indeed the believer is struck by afflictions and they are something beneficial for him for either Allaah will wipe away his sins with them or otherwise Allaah will raise his rank on account of them.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Muslim (2,999) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Suhayb <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> <strong>Translator&#8217;s Side Point:</strong> Some of the People of Knowledge mentioned that if a person is struck by affliction and he has patience upon it then he is rewarded. And if he doesn’t have patience, shows displeasure and the like then that’s something different. W`Allaahu A`lam.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 40 : Point 61</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> that when Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> spoke to those thrown into the abandoned well on the day of Badr, meaning the People of <em>Shirk</em> that they heard his words. </strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>has <em>mu`jizaat</em> (miracles) and a <em>mu`jizah</em> (miracle) is a matter, which is extraordinary and a person is not able to bring them about himself. Rather, they are things created by Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p><strong>وَقَالُوا لَوْلَا أُنزِلَ عَلَيْهِ آيَاتٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِ ۖ قُلْ إِنَّمَا الْآيَاتُ عِندَ اللَّهِ </strong> &#8211; 29:50</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(People of </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Shirk</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">said, “If only miraculous times were to be sent down to him </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Prophet </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">from his Lord.” Say, “The miraculous times are only with Allaah.”</span> </strong>(Sooratul-`Ankaboot (29), <em>aayah</em> 50)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were demanding that he should himself bring miraculous times to prove his Messengership as they said. But the miraculous times are with Allaah. The Messenger did not bring any sign except from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p><strong> قُلْ إِنَّمَا الْآيَاتُ عِندَ اللَّهِ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “The signs are only with Allaah.”</span> </strong>(Sooratul-`Ankaboot (29), <em>aayah</em> 50)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He is the one Who manifests miracles, the Perfect and Most High. And He causes them to happen at the hands of His Messengers to attest to their truthfulness. And an example of that is &#8211; the dead person, if you speak to him, he will not hear you and he will not know what you are saying. However, the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>spoke to those who had been killed at Badr from Quraysh, those who used to harm him and harm the Muslims in Makkah and who haughtily rejected true faith and disobeyed and who tyrannized the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and expelled him and who expelled his companions and harmed them. So, Allaah caused them to be overpowered at Badr and they were killed. And their leaders and their eminent people were killed; Shaybah Ibn Rabee`ah and `Utbah ibn Rabee`ah (his brother) and Aboo Jahl Ibn Hishaam and a large number of the eminent ones of the Quraysh were killed at Badr. Then the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> ordered that they should be thrown into an old well from the wells of Badr and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> stood over them and addressed them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“O so and so, son of so and so! O Aboo Jahl Ibn Hishaam! O `Utbah! O Shaybah! O Umayyah!” He addressed them one by one, saying “Have you found what your Lord promised you to be true for I have indeed found what my Lord promised me to be true?” So then Umar said to him “O Messenger of Allaah, how can you speak to them when they have started to decay and they cannot hear.” So he <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam responded, “You people cannot hear any better what I am saying than they can. However, they cannot talk.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was a miracle from the miracles of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, which Allaah caused to happen at his hand.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (3,976) and reported by Muslim (2,873, 2,874 and 2,875).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Narration mentions this happened three days after the battle. In one narration it mentioned when the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> conquered a people then he would remain at that place for three days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This report that he did likewise at Badr, he stayed there for three days and just before he was going to travel and go back to Madeenah, on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day then he stood over the old well and said this saying, he spoke to them, he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Did you find what your Lord promised you to be true? Indeed, I found what my Lord promised me to be true&#8230;”</span> </strong>To the end of the <u>h</u>adeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say &#8211; the disagreement that there is amongst the People of Knowledge about whether the people in the <em>Barzakh</em> (period in between this life and the hereafter, those in the grave and the like), can they hear those people who address them or is that just specific to the people of that well at Badr?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of them extend this matter and claim that all the people in that life (the <em>Barzakh)</em> can hear the speech that is said to them and some of the People of Knowledge restrict it to the place where the text is mentioned and that is what is apparent from the established texts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the people of <em>Sufism</em> then they extend this matter in a reprehensible manner to the extent that they claim that a dead person even knows what happens amongst his family whether good or bad. And Ibn ul-Qayyim <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> reported in his book <em>Ar-Rooh</em>, some reports from them, which are suspect and Allaah is the one who grants success.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aalih as-Suhaymee</strong> had said on this same point, he mentioned that there are some people who say the dead in general can hear. However, upon verification from the sayings of the people of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em>, what is correct is that we restrict ourselves in the matter of the dead hearing because it is a matter of the <em>ghaib</em> (hidden and unseen) and in matters of the hidden and the unseen, we do not increase upon them upon what occurs from the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And what’s established is two cases where the dead hear:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>Firstly</strong>, the leaders of the Quraysh who were killed at Badr that they heard the words of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>when he addressed them,</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>Secondly</strong>, the deceased, who has died and been buried; they hear the footsteps of his family going away after they are buried.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Beyond that we do not extend the matter any further. Rather, the rest of it falls under the general <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<p> وَمَا أَنتَ بِمُسْمِعٍ مَّن فِي الْقُبُورِ &#8211; 35:22</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And you cannot cause those who are in the graves to hear.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah Faa<u>t</u>ir (35), <em>aayah </em>22)</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 39 : Point 60</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> that along with every raindrop there is an angel who descends from the sky with it until he places it wherever Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic has commanded him to. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F377789015&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/along-with-every-raindrop-there-is-an-angel-who-descends-from-the-sky-with-it" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, sends down the rain from the sky in measured proportion. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَأَنزَلْنَا مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً بِقَدَرٍ فَأَسْكَنَّاهُ فِي الْأَرْضِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We sent down rain from the sky in due measure and We caused it to settle in the earth.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Mu&#8217;minoon (23), <em>aayah </em>18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, preordained the coming down of rain and He gave it its due measure and amount and the earth where it should fall. And He distributes it, He, the Perfect and Most High, however He wishes. So, He dispatches it. And He commands and it rains. And He commands and it stops. And along with it are angels. And there occurs in the description of the angel Meekaa`eel that he is entrusted with the raindrops (<em>al-qa<u>t</u>r)</em> and with the plants. So, the angels carry out duties, which Allaah has entrusted them with and from that is <em>al-qa<u>t</u>r</em> (the raindrops).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Some of the verifiers, they mention that this point: <strong>“Along with each raindrop, there is an angel to bring it down,”</strong> then this is reported by Ibn Jareer At-<u>T</u>abariyy in his <em>Tafseer</em> and Abu Shaykh in his book <em>Al-`Azama</em> as being a saying of one of the Taabi`een, Al-<u>H</u>akam Ibn `Utaybah as being his saying and likewise reported by Abu Shaykh in his book <em>Al-`Azama</em> as also being the saying of another <em>Taabi`ee</em> Al-<u>H</u>asan al-Ba<u>s</u>ree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for <strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aalih As-Suhaymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> then he mentions this report is reported from some of the <em>Salaf</em> and it does not contradict any text.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the explanation of <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> on this point, “There occurs in the footnote (to the earlier edition) that it is reported from Ibn Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhuma</em> that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“There is no plant upon the land nor in the sea except there is an angel entrusted with it to write down whatever leaf or the like falls away from it</strong>.<strong>”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Refer to the <em>Tafseer</em> of Ibn Katheer) and the person doing the footnotes said so this proves even more so this matter here (meaning there must be an angel for every raindrop as well).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmad criticised this saying and said, “This is <span style="color:#ff9900;">questionable from  two aspects</span>;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>firstly</strong>, that it is not established from the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> as far as I know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>, that even this report here that’s quoted from Ibn Abbaas, the indication of this report as being proof for what author Baarbahaaree mentioned <strong>“along with every raindrop that descends, an angel comes down until he places it wherever Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic commanded him to,”</strong> is not clear since the report mentions writing down whatever is going to fall from that plant where as the issue here is with every raindrop coming down with an angel appointed to bring it down until he places it, meaning something different.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we believe in the ability of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic and we believe that Allaah knows every leaf that falls and every raindrop that falls from rain, knows where it’s going to fall. However, the coming down of an angel along with every raindrop until he places it in its place, this is a matter that is not established from the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So, I say this point is questionable and Allaah is the one who grants success.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 39 : Point 59</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Four <em>takbeers</em> (sayings of <em>Allaahu Akbar</em>) are to be said for the funeral prayer. This was the saying of Maalik Bin Anas, Sufyaan ath-Thawree, <u>H</u>asan Ibn <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u>, A<u>h</u>mad ibn <u>H</u>anbal and the <em>Fuqahaa</em> (jurists) and this was the saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F377778497&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/four-takbeers-are-to-be-said-for-the-funeral-prayer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a <em>mas`alatun far`eeyah</em> (matter of detail). However, he mentioned it here because of the disagreement occurring with regard to it and to make clear the Sunnah in that regard because the book is called <em>Sharhus-Sunnah</em> (Clarification of the Sunnah). And what is famous with the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em> (People of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>) and with the Imaams is that the <em>takbeers</em> that are said over the <em>janaazah</em> (funeral prayer) are four <em>takbeers</em> as occurs in the authentic <u>h</u>adeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The Prophet </strong><em><strong><u>s</u></strong><strong>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</strong></em><strong> prayed funeral prayer over An-Najaashee (the ruler of Abyssinia) in the absence of his body and he said four takbeers.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And most of the <em>a<u>h</u>aadeeth</em> mention four and in some of the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em>, there is an addition for five or more. However, that which the Muslims have consensus upon is four and whatever is additional to it is a point of disagreement and the Muslim should not go to that about which there is disagreement and leave aside that about which there is consensus and which there is agreement upon and therefore cause trouble to the people particularly with respect to the Imaams of the mosque; they should not cause trouble to the people because the people are not accustomed to any addition to four. So, if you want to pray over the <em>janaazah</em> more than four <em>takbeers</em> then do it yourself but do not cause trouble to the people and bring them rare and obscure sayings and divergent reports for this is not from the way of the student of knowledge. The students of knowledge should bring harmony amongst the people and not cause trouble to them and they should act upon which there is consensus and restrict themselves to that. This is what is required and this is the intent of the author in mentioning the four because that is what is agreed upon. So, they should not be added to and trouble therefore caused to people in that regard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And it is the saying of Maalik Bin Anas and Sufyaan ath-Thawree and <u>H</u>asan Ibn <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> and A<u>h</u>mad ibn <u>H</u>anbal,” </strong>Maalik ibn Anas is the Imaam of <em>Daarul-Hijrah</em>  (the Imaam of the place where the <em>Hijrah</em> was to, meaning the Imaam of Madeenah); Imaam Maalik was one of the four Imaams. And Sufyaan ath-Thawree; he was Sufyaan ibn Sa`eed ath-Thawree, the famous Imaam from the Imaams of <em>fiqh.</em> And Al-<u>H</u>asan ibn <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> ibn <u>H</u>ayy; he was from the major Imaams. And A<u>h</u>mad ibn <u>H</u>anbal; he was one of the four Imaams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And it was the saying of the jurists; the people of <em>fiqh</em>, <em>Fuqahaa</em> and this was said by Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>,” </strong>meaning it is the saying of many of the jurists who are following the Sunnah of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So, it is not befitting for the student of knowledge to cause trouble with the people with the argument that he knows that there is another saying or another <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> with regard to an addition. The scholars used to know that there was disagreement in certain matters but they would not bring this and cause trouble to the people nor would they contradict that which action was upon.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 39 : Points 57-58</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[57] And you should know that whatever befalls you was never going to miss you and whatever missed you was never going to come to you.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[58] And there is no creator along with Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F377740142&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/know-that-whatever-befalls-you-was-never-going-to-miss-you" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the text of the <u>h</u>adeeth just as the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said to Ibn Abbaas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“And know that whatever befalls you was not going to miss you and whatever comes to you was never going to miss you.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whatever strikes you was never going to miss you; whatever misses you was never going to come to you. Even if you eagerly sought after it and want it but it missed you then you should know that Allaah did not decree it for you and whatever came upon you was never going to miss you. So, do not say, “If only I had done such and such this wouldn’t have befallen me.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying <strong>“And there is no creator along with Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic,” </strong>this follows on from the levels of preordainment and predecree. It contains a refutation of whoever says that the person creates his own actions. So, Allaah, He is the one Who is alone in creating, He, the Majestic and Most High. No-one can create along with Him. So, it is all from the creation of Allaah alone, He, the Perfect and Most High. And therefore, He, the Majestic and Most High says:</p>
<p><strong>قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُم مَّا تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَرُونِي مَاذَا خَلَقُوا مِنَ الْأَرْضِ أَمْ لَهُمْ شِرْكٌ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ ۖ ائْتُونِي بِكِتَابٍ مِّن قَبْلِ هَٰذَا أَوْ أَثَارَةٍ مِّنْ عِلْمٍ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “Do you see whatever you invoke besides Allaah, show me what they have created in the earth or do they have any share with Allaah in the heavens? Bring me any scripture, which came from Allaah before this Qur&#8217;aan, which states this or any remnant of knowledge, which proves it, if you are truthful.”</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Ahqaaf (46), <em>aayah </em>4)</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ لَن يَخْلُقُوا ذُبَابًا وَلَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا لَهُ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those whom they worship besides Allaah can never create even a fly even if they all gather together to do it.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Hajj (22), <em>aayah </em>73)</p>
<p><strong>أَمْ جَعَلُوا لِلَّهِ شُرَكَاءَ خَلَقُوا كَخَلْقِهِ فَتَشَابَهَ الْخَلْقُ عَلَيْهِمْ ۚ قُلِ اللَّهُ خَالِقُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَهُوَ الْوَاحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Or do they set up partners for Allaah who can create just as He creates such that the creation is confused for them. Say, Allaah is the Creator of everything and He is the one, All-Powerful Subduer.</span> </strong>(Sooratur-Ra`ad (13), <em>aayah </em>16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, described those who make images in His saying: (as part of Hadeeth Qudsi)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“So who is a greater wrong-doer than someone who tries to create like My creation.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning that he tries to produce the outward form of that which Allaah has created.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of the narration mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“.. let them then create a single grain of corn or let them create a single barley corn.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or in one narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“.. or let them create the tiniest ant.” </strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No-one is able to do this and if someone is able to fashion the outward form (<em><u>s</u>oorah),</em> he is not able to produce life in it. The life is from the creation of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, no-one is able to do it even if he can make a precise image and form or something, he is not able to breathe a soul into it and to put life into it. This is the creation of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High and therefore, it would be said to those people who make images on the Day of Resurrection:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Give life to that which you created.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In order to manifest their inability and as a punishment for them.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 39 : Points 54-56</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[54] And to have patience with the judgement of Allaah. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[55] And to have <em>eemaan</em> in all the decrees of Allaah, the good and the bad, the sweet and the bitter. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[56] Aand to have <em>eemaan</em> in whatever Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, has said. Allaah knew whatever the servants were going to do and where they were heading to, they do not escape from the knowledge of Allaah and there is nothing in the earth or in the heavens except that which is known by Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F377372234&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/glad-tidings-to-those-who-have-patience-when-they-are-struck-by-calamity" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A mention of this has already preceded at the beginning of the levels of <em>eemaan</em> in <em>Al-Qa<u>d</u>aa W’al Qadr</em> (preordainment and predecree). And using predecree and preordainment as an evidence when calamities strike, which a person <strong>does not have a choice about</strong>, is something praiseworthy because this shows his being satisfied and his submitting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَبَشِّرِ الصَّابِرِينَ</strong> &#8211; 2:155</p>
<p><strong>الَّذِينَ إِذَا أَصَابَتْهُم مُّصِيبَةٌ قَالُوا إِنَّا لِلَّهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ</strong> &#8211; 2:156</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And give glad tidings to those who have patience, those who when they are struck by calamity, they say “Indeed we belong to Allaah and to Him we shall return.” </strong></span>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 155-156)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for using predecree and preordainment as a proof for <strong>evil deeds</strong>, which they <strong>commit and do by choice</strong> then they have no argument in predecree for that. Rather, they are punished for their deeds and they are falling short and the gate to repentance is open instead of arguing with Allaah saying: “Why did You decree this upon me?” while you have abandoned the repentance. This is from blameworthy inabilities. Rather, hasten to repentance and seek forgiveness and blame yourself. So, this is what is required from the servant that he should look at his own deeds.</p>
<p><strong> وَلْتَنظُرْ نَفْسٌ مَّا قَدَّمَتْ لِغَدٍ ۖ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ</strong> &#8211; 59:18</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And let each soul look and see what deeds it puts forward for the Day of Judgement.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Hashr (59), <em>aayah</em> 18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at your deeds, it is possible for you to change them and to repent from them and to seek forgiveness. As for preordainment and predecree then that is the affair for Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, it is not your matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they will not exit from the Knowledge of Allaah,” </strong>everything Allaah has full knowledge of it and He, the Perfect and Most High fully encompasses it. He knows the disbelief of the disbeliever and the sin of the sinful person and the oppression of the oppressor. It is not hidden from Him. He knows the obedience of the obedient person and the actions of the obedient person. He knows this and that. However, He gives them some respite, gives them some time perhaps they will repent, perhaps they will return back. So if they repent, well and good otherwise in front of them is the reckoning; the <em>hisaab</em>. So, Allaah does not neglect them at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And there is not in the earth nor in the heavens except that which is known by Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic,” </strong>this is just as has preceded, everything is known by Allaah, whatever was in the past and whatever will be in the future, all of it Allaah has encompassed it with His Knowledge, nothing whatsoever is hidden from Him, He, the Perfect and Most High. He knew it and He decreed it and He wrote it and He wished it and willed it and He created it.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 38 : Point 53</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to be pleased and satisfied with the decree of Allaah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F377268440&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in <em>al-Qa<u>d</u>aa w’al Qadr</em> (Allaah’s preordainment and predecree). This is a <em>rukn</em> (pillar) from the six pillars of <em>eemaan</em>, which are mentioned by Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">You have eemaan (true faith) in Allaah, and in His angels, and His books, and in His Messengers, the Last Day and that you have true faith in al-Qadr (predecree), the good of it and the bad of it</span><em>.</em></strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is that you believe that Allaah has preordained all things and predecreed them always and He, the Perfect and Most High, has written them in the preserved tablet and He created it and brought it into existence by His wish, He, the Perfect and Most High. And having <em>eemaan</em> in predecree and preordainment covers <strong>FOUR</strong> levels:</p>
<p><strong>The First Level:</strong> Level of <em>al-`ilm</em> (knowledge), which is that Allaah knew by His Eternal Knowledge all things before they came into existence.</p>
<p><strong>The Second Level:</strong> To have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) that Allaah wrote all things down in the preserved tablet before they existed. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>مَا أَصَابَ مِن مُّصِيبَةٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا فِي أَنفُسِكُمْ إِلَّا فِي كِتَابٍ مِّن قَبْلِ أَن نَّبْرَأَهَا ۚ إِنَّ ذَٰلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ &#8211; 57:22</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>No calamity befalls upon the earth nor in yourselves except that it was written in a book before We brought it about. Indeed that is easy for Allaah. </strong></span>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>adeed (57), <em>aayah </em>22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Third Level: </strong>To have <em>`eemaan</em> (true faith) that Allaah willed and wished these newly occurring events. Disbelief and true faith, obedience and disobedience, righteousness and wickedness, good and evil; all of that was willed and wished by Allaah, by His will relating to the creation, His <em>Iraadah al-Kowniyyah</em>. So, nothing occurs within His Sovereignty except that which He wills. However, He willed the good and He willed `<em>eemaan</em> and He willed evil for a <em><u>h</u>ikmah</em> (wise) purpose as a trial and as a test. So, Allaah willed that which is good and He loves it and is pleased with it and He willed that which is evil but He does not love it and He is not pleased with it. However, He willed it to occur for a wise purpose and in order to test and to try. And if there nothing except good then there would be no distinction for anybody and there would be no test and no trial, all of the people would be people of good. And if there were nothing except evil then there would be no distinction for anyone in performing righteous deeds. So, this gives the result that Allaah tries the servant to make clear the good from the foul and the believer from the disbeliever and it is a trial and a test, which He, the Perfect and Most High brings about for them and He did not create these things without purpose.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>The Fourth Level:</strong><em> Al-Khalq w’al eejaad</em> (creation and bringing into existence); whatever happens Allaah is the one who created it and brought it into existence. And everything that occurs then Allaah is its Creator. And the actions of the people are created by Allaah and they are actions done by the servant. Allaah, the Majestic and Most High says:</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>اللَّهُ خَالِقُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ ۖ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَكِيلٌ</strong> &#8211; 39:62</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah is the Creator of everything and He is the Trustworthy Disposer of all affairs.</span> </strong>(Sooratuz-Zumar (39), <em>aayah </em>62)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Perfect and Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <strong>وَهُوَ الْخَلَّاقُ الْعَلِيمُ</strong> &#8211; 36:81</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He, Allaah is the All-Knowing Creator Who creates repeatedly.<br />
</strong></span>(Soorah Yaaseen (36), <em>aayah </em>81)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَاللَّهُ خَلَقَكُمْ وَمَا تَعْمَلُونَ</strong> &#8211; 37:96</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And Allaah created you and whatever deeds you do.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratu<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>aafaat (37), <em>aayah </em>96)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, they are things created by Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, meaning people’s deeds, good or evil and they are actions done by the servants and things earned by the servants by their own choice and will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the true believer believes in these four levels; (1) <em>al-`ilm, (2) w’al kitaabah, (3) w’al mashee&#8217;ah w’al iraadah, (4) al-khalq w’al eejaad.</em>These four levels with regard to predecree, the believer believes in them; the level of knowledge, the level of writing and the level of wish and will and the level of creation and bringing into existence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>And the believer is pleased and satisfied with predecree and preordainment. When calamities occur, he does not become annoyed and does not become vexed. He withholds himself from annoyance and he withholds his tongue from complaining to other than Allaah and he withholds his hand from striking the cheeks and tearing the openings of the garment. So this is being pleased and satisfied with the preordainment and predecree</strong>.</span> And it is that you know that whatever befalls you was never going to miss you and whatever misses you was never going to happen to you just as the Prophet said, and `<em>eemaan</em> will not be completed except with this.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Muslim (Hadith No.8) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of `Umar ibn al-Khattaab <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu </em>and this is a part of the famous <u>h</u>adeeth of Jibreel where Jibreel `alayhissalaam came to the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in the form of a man and asked him about `<em>eemaan</em> and <em>Islaam</em> and <em>I<u>h</u>saan</em> and the signs of the Hour, this was the answer the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> gave when he was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“What is `eemaan? And he replied that it is that your truly believe in Allaah and in His angels and in His Books and in His Messengers and in the Last Day and that you truly believe in predecree; the good of it and the bad of it.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Part of the famous <u>h</u>adeeth, reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad in the <em>Musnad</em> and Aboo Daawood in his <em>Sunan</em> and Ibn Maajah in his <em>Sunan</em> from a <u>h</u>adeeth of `Ubaadah ibn a<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>aamit <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>. Declared authentic by Ibn <u>H</u>ibbaan by Shaykh al-Islaam Muhammad ibn `Abdul Wahhaab in his book At-Taw<u>h</u>eed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Also declared <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic) by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy likewise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad An-Najmee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said, </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Being pleased and satisfied with that which Allaah has decreed should occur&#8221; &#8211; This is a tremendous level and what is meant by &#8216;<em>what is ordained should occur</em>&#8216; here? It is that it means which a person has no actions himself in bringing about such as illness and health, being rich or being poor and death and all of the calamities that occur, that which strike the person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the people are divided into <strong>two categories</strong> with regard to them or it is to be said the servant here, there are two states that he can have in this case; one of them is higher than the other:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>The first of them is <em>ar-ri<u>d</u>aa</em></strong> (being pleased and satisfied) with that and it is the highest condition such that he is pleased whatever Allaah has decreed to occur, Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic and whatever provision He has given you a share of and with whatever calamities He has preordained for you. So, being pleased and satisfied with these decrees, which strike the servant from Allaah these are things, which come purely from His decree. Neither the person himself nor anyone else can repel them and being pleased with these decrees is a tremendous level and it is an honourable state of the soul such that the servant is hoping for the reward that will come about as a result of the calamity after it strikes him such that if he were to be given a choice between receiving the reward for it or that calamity not occurring he would choose the reward instead. You have the first and the highest level.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>So if he is not from the people of <em>ri<u>d</u>aa</em>, those who are actually pleased with it then at least let him be from the <strong>People of <em><u>S</u>abr</em> (have patience)</strong> upon it. This is the 2<sup>nd </sup> level So, he still has patience when that is decreed to happen to him. So, he bears it hoping for reward for it and in submission to the decree and the ordainment, Allah, the Mighty and Majestic said:</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> وَالضَّرَّاءِ وَحِينَ الْبَأْسِ ۗ أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ صَدَقُوا ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُتَّقُونَ &#8211; 2:177</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those believers who have patience upon extreme poverty and illnesses and at the time of fighting. They are the ones who are true and they are the ones who are dutiful to Allaah.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>177)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth:<strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“If Allaah loves a people, He puts them to trial. Whoever is pleased, then Allaah’s pleasure is for him and whoever is angry then there is anger for him.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah is the one who grants success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by At-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee and Ibn Maajah from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Anas and Imaam A<u>h</u>mad. Also, reported as a <u>h</u>adeeth of Mahmood ibn Labeed, slightly different wording. Shaykh al-Albaaniyy authenticates the <u>h</u>adeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>A point of note from Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad An-Najmee:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible to be pleased and happy with sins nor to use predecree as an excuse for them. Rather, it is obligatory to strive to remove them and Allaah, the Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>كُنتُمْ خَيْرَ أُمَّةٍ أُخْرِجَتْ لِلنَّاسِ تَأْمُرُونَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَتَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمُنكَرِ وَتُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">You are the best nation brought out for mankind, you command the good and you forbid the evil and you truly believe in Allaah.</span> </strong>(Soorah-Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">Whoever amongst you see an evil, let him change it with his hand and if he is not able then with his tongue and if he is not able then with his heart for that is the weakest of <em>eemaan</em></span></strong>. [Reported by Muslim.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if it can be imagined that the disbelievers occupy a land from the lands of the muslims, is it permissible that we just say that this is a matter of predecree and leave it as that and not strive to remove this evil until we free the muslims in their lands so that they are at peace from being overcome by the diebeleivers? The answer is that it is not permissible for us to just be silent about that nor should we be pleased and happy with it nor just have patience upon that and Allaah is the one who grants success.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 38 : Point 52</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to make one’s deeds purely and sincerely for Allaah.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Making one’s deeds purely and sincerely for Allaah such that there is no <em>shirk</em> in it for Allaah will not accept any action except that which is done purely and sincerely for His Face, having no <em>shirk</em> in it nor association of others along with Him in it. And this is one of the <strong>two conditions</strong> for an action to be acceptable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <strong>second condition</strong> is <em>al-mutaaba`ah</em> (following the example of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in doing that action) and acting upon the Sunnah such that the action is in conformity with the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> such that it does not contain <em>bid`ah</em> (innovation) because Allaah does not accept innovation. Rather, He punishes for them even if a person exhausted himself in doing deeds. If he did not make the deeds purely and sincerely for Allaah, then they will be scattered dust. And if a person exhausted himself in doing a deed which is not in conformity with the Sunnah then it will be rejected. And it will not be accepted except along with these two conditions that it is done purely and sincerely for Allaah alone and it’s done in conformity with the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>وَقَالُوا لَن يَدْخُلَ الْجَنَّةَ إِلَّا مَن كَانَ هُودًا أَوْ نَصَارَىٰ ۗ تِلْكَ أَمَانِيُّهُمْ ۗ قُلْ هَاتُوا بُرْهَانَكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ</strong> &#8211; 2:111</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong style="font-size:1rem;">And they (the People of the Book) said no-one will enter Paradise except for one who is a Jew or a Christian. That is their false hope. Say, “Bring your proof if you are speaking the truth.” </strong></span><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah </em><span style="font-size:1rem;">111)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, this is to refute what they are negating.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>بَلَىٰ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لِلَّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ فَلَهُ أَجْرُهُ عِندَ رَبِّهِ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</strong> &#8211; 2:112</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Rather it will be entered by whoever submits his face to Allaah and he is a doer of good then his reward will be with his Lord and there will be no fear upon them nor will they grieve.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>112)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever submits his face to Allaah,” </strong>meaning he makes his deeds purely and sincerely for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“He is a doer of good,” </strong>meaning one who is following the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and this applies to everyone, the Jews and the Christians and the rest of the world, it must be with these two conditions; with purity and sincerity for Allaah and with following the Messenger.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 38 : Point 51</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in the <em>Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u></em> (retribution) on the Day of Resurrection between all of the creation; the descendants of Aadam, the beasts of prey, the reptiles, even between the tiniest ants until Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic brings about retribution between them. For the People of Paradise from the People of the Fire and for the People of the Fire from the People of Paradise and for the People of Paradise from each other and for the People of the Fire from each other. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F376101761&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/eemaan-in-the-qisaasretribution-on-the-dayofresurrection-between-all-of-the-creation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is already preceded that Allaah will resurrect the creation on the Day of Resurrection in order to recompense them for <strong><em>jazaa</em></strong>· (to give them their due reward), in order to recompense them for their good deeds and their evil deeds with regard to the descendants of Aadam. And for <strong><em>Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u></em> </strong>(retribution/revenge/retaliation ) to be established with regard to again the descendants of Aadam and for the animals. So, the animals will be resurrected for <em>Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u> </em>(retaliation) only, whereas the descendants of Aadam will be resurrected for jazaa (recompensing) and <em>Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u></em> (retaliation) between them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And to have <em>eemaan</em> in the retribution on the Day of Resurrection between all of the creation; the descendants of Aadam, the beasts of prey and the animals,” </strong>all of them will be raised for <em>al-Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u></em> (retribution) between them. As for the animals then when vengeance has been taken from some for others then they will end up being turned to dust. But as for the descendants of Aadam then they will be in two groups; a group will be in Paradise and a group will be in a Blazing Fire and they will not die after that ever. They will remain forever either in Paradise or in the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Even to the extent that retaliation will be taken for the tiniest ant from the other tiniest ant,” </strong>to the extent that <em>a<u>th</u>&#8211;<u>th</u>arrah</em> (tiniest ant) will gain vengeance over each other because Allaah does not consent to <em><u>z</u>ulm</em> (oppression) ever because He is the most just and wise of Judges and He is the most just Arbitrator. He does not consent to <em><u>z</u>ulm</em> (oppression) even between the animals and the tiny ant. On the Day of Resurrection they will be resurrected and vengeance will be taken for some upon others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <em>mu&#8217;minoon</em> (believers) and the first matter concerning which retribution will be taken between them on the Day of Resurrection will be with regard to the shedding of blood from the rights of mankind and they’ll take revenge upon each other after they have crossed over the <em><u>s</u>iraat</em> (bridge) of the Hellfire and before they enter into Paradise. They will be stopped and retribution will be taken from some in favour of others. And then when they have been cleansed and purified, permission will be given to them to enter into Paradise because no-one will enter Paradise whilst he has any act of oppression due upon him. Because Paradise is the abode of those who are good and pure and no-one will enter it except those who are good and pure, those who have no reckoning left upon them nor anything owed to anyone else nor any sins to the extent that the believer who is sinful will be punished in the Fire in accordance with the level of sin or otherwise Allaah will pardon him in accordance with His wish and will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاءُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah does not forgive that <em>shirk</em> is committed with Him but He forgives whatever is less than that to whomever He wishes. </strong></span>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah</em> 48)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to any sins that are less than <em>shirk</em>, if He wishes, He will forgive him and if He wishes, He will punish him in accordance with the level of his sins until he becomes clean and purified from sins then he will enter into Paradise. So, no-one will enter into Paradise except one who is pure, be it by recompensing or by punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“To the extent that Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic will bring about retribution between them for some from others and for the People of Paradise from the People of the Fire and for the People of the Fire from the People of Paradise,” </strong>so, the believer if he has wronged the disbeliever then retribution will be taken for the disbeliever on the Day of Resurrection and vice versa. The disbeliever if he has wronged the believer then retribution will be taken for the believer on the Day of Resurrection. So, no-one will be just left having acts of oppression left upon him and to the extent that the believer will be avenged upon the believer.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he said with regard to this point, “There occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth that Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic will call out on the Day of resurrection and say “al-Malik and ad-Dayyaan (I am the King, I am the One Who brings about retribution) and it is not befitting that anyone from the People of the Fire should enter the Fire whilst he has anything due from the People of Paradise that is due to him nor is it befitting for anyone from the People of Paradise to enter Paradise whilst there is any right due from him for someone from the People of the Fire until I take retribution for him even if it is for a single slap.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>So we (companions) said, “How will it be when it is the case that we will come to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic naked, uncircumcised and empty-handed?”. </strong></span><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>said, “with good deeds and bad deeds.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Jaabir ibn `Abdillaah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhuma</em> and declared authentic by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is important is that they will not enter the Paradise or the Fire until the rights have been be taken from them for each other. Then when they have been purified and cleansed and the People of Paradise will be entered into Paradise and the People of the Fire enter the Fire and success is granted by Allaah.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 37 : Point 50</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And everything that Allaah has decreed should pass away will pass away but not Paradise, the Fire, the Throne (<em>`Arsh)</em>, the footstool (<em>Kursee)</em>, the Horn (<em>A<u>s-S</u>oor)</em>, the Pen (<em>Qalam)</em> and the Inscribed Tablet (<em>Al-Lawh)</em>. Nothing of these will ever pass away. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Then Allaah will resurrect the creation upon what He caused them to die upon on the Day of Resurrection and He will bring them to account as He wishes. A group will be in Paradise and a group will be in the blazing Fire and He will say to the rest of the creation; those who are not created to persist, “Be dust.”</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/everything-that-allaah-has-decreed-should-pass-away-will-pass-away" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And everything that Allaah has made it binding for that it will pass away then it will pass away</strong>.<strong>”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Majestic and Most High said:</p>
<p><strong>كُلُّ مَنْ عَلَيْهَا فَانٍ</strong> &#8211; 55:26</p>
<p><strong>وَيَبْقَىٰ وَجْهُ رَبِّكَ ذُو الْجَلَالِ وَالْإِكْرَامِ</strong> &#8211; 55:27</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Everyone upon the earth will perish but the Face of your Lord full of Majesty and Honour will remain.</span> </strong>(Sooratur-Ra<u>h</u>maan (55), <em>aayah</em> 26-27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of the creation will pass away and nothing will remain except Allaah, the Perfect and Most High and in His saying, He, the Perfect:</p>
<p><strong>كُلُّ نَفْسٍ ذَائِقَةُ الْمَوْتِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Every soul shall taste death.</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>185)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He, the Perfect and Most High:</p>
<p><strong>وَنُفِخَ فِي الصُّورِ فَصَعِقَ مَن فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَن فِي الْأَرْضِ إِلَّا مَن شَاءَ اللَّهُ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the Horn will be blown and all who are in the heavens and the earth will fall down dead except whomever Allaah wishes.</span> </strong>(Sooratuz-Zumar (39), <em>aayah </em>68)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of <em>illaah mann shaa-Allaah</em> (except whomever Allaah wishes). They (the People of Knowledge) said, “it means the angels or the wide-eyed <u>H</u>oor (women in Paradise) and Allaah knows best.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the whole of the creation will die and then they will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p><strong>ثُمَّ إِنَّكُم بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ لَمَيِّتُونَ &#8211; 23:15</strong></p>
<p><strong>ثُمَّ إِنَّكُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ تُبْعَثُونَ &#8211; 23:16</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then after that you should die then on the Day of Resurrection, you will be raised up to life. </strong></span>(Sooratul-Mu·minoon (23), <em>aayah </em>15-16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Muslim should remember death and he should prepare for it with righteous deeds and he should ask Allaah that his life ends with a good conclusion (<em><u>h</u>usn ul-khaatimah)</em> and he should repent from evil deeds and this is the benefit of remembering death. When he remembers death then he should make preparation for it and therefore, he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Remember the cutter off of pleasures; death for you will not remember it over a large amount except that it will render it small nor over a small amount except that it will increase it.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is not befitting that the Muslim should be inattentive to death. Rather, he should remember death always at all times and he should prepare for it and he should have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) in the resurrection; the Day when mankind will rise from their graves, standing up for the Lord of the whole of creation.</p>
<p><strong>ثُمَّ نُفِخَ فِيهِ أُخْرَىٰ فَإِذَا هُمْ قِيَامٌ يَنظُرُونَ</strong> &#8211; 39:68</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then the Horn will be blown again and they will be standing, looking on.</strong></span>(Sooratuz-Zumar (39), <em>aayah </em>68)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The souls shall be restored to them after the bodies have been resurrected from the graves and then they will be led to the gathering place (<em>ma<u>h</u>shar)</em> to the end of what they encounter in the Hereafter from great hazards that they will have to pass through until they settle after that either in Paradise or either in the Fire for indeed Paradise and the Fire are the two abodes of permanent residents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying <strong>“Everything will pass away except what Allaah has written to pass away will pass away but not Paradise, not the Fire and not the `<em>Arsh</em> (the Throne) and not the <em>Kursee</em> (Footstool),” </strong>for they will not pass away; those two (Paradise and the Fire), they will not pass away and they will not seize to exist. Allaah created them to persist. And as for the heavens and the earth then they will be changed. The heavens will split apart and the earth will split open and this universe will change.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p><strong>يَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الْأَرْضُ غَيْرَ الْأَرْضِ وَالسَّمَاوَاتُ ۖ وَبَرَزُوا لِلَّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ</strong> &#8211; 14:48</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">On the Day when the earth is changed to other than the earth and the Heavens and they </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the people)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> will appear before Allaah; the One, the Irresistible Subduer.</span> </strong>(Soorah Ibraaheem (14), <em>aayah </em>48)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the `<em>Arsh</em> (Throne) then it will not change and Paradise and the Fire will not pass away and will not change. <em>W’al Kursee</em> (and the Footstool); it is below the `<em>Arsh</em> (Throne) and the `<em>Arsh</em> (Throne) is bigger than it and the <em>Kursee</em> is wider than the heavens and the earth and the `<em>Arsh</em> (Throne) is wider than the Footstool.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And the Horn,” </strong>the <em><u>S</u>oor</em> is the Horn, which is the Horn which is with the Angel Israafeel. It will be blown along with the souls in it and the souls will fly back into their bodies and come to life with the permission of Allaah.</p>
<p><strong>ثُمَّ نُفِخَ فِيهِ أُخْرَىٰ فَإِذَا هُمْ قِيَامٌ يَنظُرُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then it will be blown another time and they will be standing up looking.</strong></span>(Sooratuz-Zumar (39), <em>aayah </em>68)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And the Pen and the Preserved Tablet,” </strong><em>Al-Lawh ul-Ma<u>h</u>fudh</em> (Preserved Tablet) and the Pen with which Allaah wrote the decreed measures, meaning the decreed measures of how everything would be.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Nothing from this will ever pass away,” </strong>these things which Allaah created to persist; the Throne and the Footstool and the Preserved Tablet and the Pen and Paradise and the Fire and the souls, which were created then they will not pass away.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Then Allaah will resurrect the creation upon what He caused them to die upon on the Day of Resurrection,” </strong>meaning He will resurrect them upon what He caused them to die upon with regard to disbelief or true faith (<em>eemaan)</em>, everyone will be resurrected upon his deeds, meaning upon the deeds that he did. And having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in the resurrection is one of the six pillars of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in the Last Day occurs joined along with <em>eemaan (true faith)</em> in Allaah in many <em>aayahs.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>W’al Ba’th</em> (and Resurrection), it is restoring mankind to life after their death in the world of the Hereafter. So, they live in this world for the purpose of action then they will die and they will be buried in the earth and they will remain in it for as long as Allaah wishes in the place of waiting and that is <em>Daar</em> <em>ul-Barzakh </em>(Place of Separation), the period separating this world and the Hereafter.Then they will be resurrected from these graves and they will arise from them alive just as they used to be, nothing from their bodies will be lost then the souls will be restored to their bodies then they will be led to the <em>mahshar</em> (gathering place) for the recompensing for their deeds, which they did in the world whether good or bad.</p>
<p> <strong>وَلَا تُجْزَوْنَ إِلَّا مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</strong> &#8211; 36:54</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And you will not be recompensed except for what you did. </strong></span>(Soorah Yaaseen (36), <em>aayah </em>54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, no-one will be rewarded for good that was done by somebody else or punished for the action of someone else.</p>
<p><strong>وَلَا تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَىٰ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of sins committed by someone else.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-An`aam (6), <em>aayah</em> 164)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everyone will be recompensed in accordance with his own deeds whether good or bad and this is justice (<em>adl)</em> from Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. He will not leave them without any recompensing when they had wearied themselves in this life in performing deeds and worship if they were righteous ones. Or wearied themselves, and Allaah’s refuge is sought, with disbelief and <em>shirk</em> and sin and causing corruption upon the earth if they were disbelievers. He will not leave them without a recompensing. This is justice from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. So, this is the meaning of His saying here that everyone will be recompensed in accordance with his deeds. And since this is the case then it is obligatory upon the servant to look to his deeds, whilst he’s still alive. So, whatever is good then he should equip himself with that and whatever is evil then he should repent to Allaah from it and free himself from it as long as that is possible. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَلْتَنظُرْ نَفْسٌ مَّا قَدَّمَتْ لِغَدٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe, fear and be dutiful to Allaah and let each soul look at what deeds it has put forward for tomorrow.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ashr (59), <em>aayah </em>18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Take account of yourself in this world before the reckoning, take account of yourself for your deeds and examine them and rectify whatever is corrupt from them and add to whatever is good from them and awaken from heedlessness. This is what is required from the person of intellect and therefore, he <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Al-kayyis (the wise one) (meaning al-`aaqil (the prudent one)), the person of intelligence, he takes account of his-self and acts for that which comes after death. This is the astute person, the `aaqil. And the incapable person is the one who allows himself to follow his desires (meaning in this world) and just has vain hopes in Allaah.</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The incapable person is the one who allows himself just to follow his desires and just has vain hopes in Allaah</strong>, he wants paradise and he wants salvation but he doesn’t do anything. So, this person is incapable, and Allaah’s refuge is sought, <em>aameen</em>, with blameworthy incapacity, it is not physical inability. If he is actually not able to do i.e he does not have the ability to perform deeds, then this one would not be taken to account.</p>
<p><strong>لَا يُكَلِّفُ اللَّهُ نَفْسًا إِلَّا وُسْعَهَا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah does not burden a soul except with what it is able to do.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>286)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, this one; the <strong>`<em>aajiz</em> </strong>(truly incapable person) has ability and he is able to act but the inability is due to laziness &amp; not-caring. This is the one who is truly incapable and yet along with this, he has vain hopes that in the Hereafter he will be from the people of Paradise without any deed, without any action. It is not possible that this one will be from the people of Paradise without any deed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And He will take account of them as He wishes, there will be a group in Paradise and a group in the blazing Fire,” </strong>He will take account of them for their deeds, He, the Perfect and Most High and <em>Al-<u>H</u>isaab</em> (the Reckoning), it is al-<em>munaaqashah</em> (examination) regarding the deeds. So, the people will be in different categories with regard to reckoning. Four categories of people with regards to reckoning in the herefater.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the believers, there will be those who will receive no reckoning so he will enter Paradise without any reckoning and any punishment. May Allaah make us from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them will be those who will be given an easy reckoning and that is just presentation of records.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them are those who will be interrogated in the reckoning :<br />
<strong>“Whoever is closely examined regard his record will be punished.”</strong><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) will not be reckoned with a reckoning involving weighing of deeds. Rather, he will only be reckoned with a reckoning that involves confessing that he will be shown his deeds and his disbelief and his <em>shirk</em> for him to confess it and he will not be able to deny anything at all then he will be sent to the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“There will be a group in Paradise and a group in the blazing Fire,” </strong>this is derived from the <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<p> وَتُنذِرَ يَوْمَ الْجَمْعِ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ ۚ فَرِيقٌ فِي الْجَنَّةِ وَفَرِيقٌ فِي السَّعِيرِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And warn them of the Day of the Gathering about which there is no doubt, there will be a group in Paradise and a group in the blazing Fire. </strong></span>(Sooratush-Shooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A group there will be in Paradise</strong> and they are the people of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) <strong>and there will be a group in the blazing Fire</strong> and they are the people of disbelief and transgression.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And He will say to the rest of the creation from those who are not created to persist, “Be dust”,” </strong>Allaah will raise up the creation on the Day of Resurrection; the humans and the animals and the birds.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>وَمَا مِن دَابَّةٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا طَائِرٍ يَطِيرُ بِجَنَاحَيْهِ إِلَّا أُمَمٌ أَمْثَالُكُم ۚ مَّا فَرَّطْنَا فِي الْكِتَابِ مِن شَيْءٍ ۚ ثُمَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يُحْشَرُونَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is not a creature upon the earth nor any bird, which flies with its two wings except that they are communities like you. We have not neglected anything from the Book. Then they will be gathered to their Lord.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-An’aam (6), <em>aayah </em>38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And, He, the Most High said:</p>
<p><strong>وَإِذَا الْوُحُوشُ حُشِرَتْ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And when the wild beasts are gathered. </strong></span>(Sooratut-Takweer (81), <em>aayah </em>5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The created beings will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection in order to establish justice between them to such an extent that revenge will be taken from some for others. The animals; revenge will be taken from some in favour of others to the extent that revenge will be taken for the hornless ram from the ram (male sheep) with horns as occurs in the authentic hadeeth.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then when vengeance has been taken from some for others, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High will say to them “Be dust” because they were not raised up to remain and persist in the Hereafter. Rather, they were only raised up for recompensing only and this is from the justice of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. Then the disbeliever will say:</p>
<p><strong> يَا لَيْتَنِي كُنتُ تُرَابًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> “would that I could be dust.” </strong></span>(Sooratun-Nabaa (78), <em>aayah </em>40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When it will be said to the animals “Be dust”, the disbeliever will vainly wish that he could be like them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> This was mentioned by Al-Baghawee in his Tafseer from A<u>d</u>&#8211;<u>D</u>a<u>hh</u>aak <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(A<u>d</u>&#8211;<u>D</u>a<u>hh</u>aak; famous <em>mufassir</em> of the Qur&#8217;aan referred from a group of <em>Taabi’een</em>, A<u>d</u>&#8211;<u>D</u>a<u>hh</u>aak ibn Muzaahim al-Hilaalee al-Khurasaanee who died in the year 105).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Baghawee mentions that he said (referring to the ones who are accepted), “they are Ridwaan and <em>Al-<u>H</u>oor</em> (the wide-eyed <u>H</u>oorees) and Maalik and Az-Zabaaniyah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> The first part of the <u>h</u>adeeth, <strong>“remember the cutter off of pleasures; death,”</strong> is reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad and at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee and Ibn Maajah and an-Nasaa`ee and Ibn <u>H</u>ibbaan in his <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>. That <u>h</u>adeeth up to that wording there was declared <em><u>h</u>asan</em>; <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (good; authentic) by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the full wording then al-Bayhaqee reports that wording <strong>“&#8230;for you will not remember it&#8230;”</strong> in <em>Shu’b al-Eemaan</em> as the <u>h</u>adeeth of ibn `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhuma</em> and Shaykh al-Albaaniyy declared that particular narration weak in <em>Da`eef al-Jaami` W`Allaahu A`lam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Al-<em>Kursee</em> (the Footstool), Ibn Abee <u>H</u>aatim reported in his Tafseer from Muqaatil that he said in explanation of His saying, He, the Most High:</p>
<p> <strong>كُلُّ شَيْءٍ هَالِكٌ إِلَّا وَجْهَهُ</strong> &#8211; 28:88</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Everything will perish except for Allaah’s Face. </strong></span>(Sooratul-Qasas (28), <em>aayah </em>88)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“All the living things in particular from the inhabitants of the heavens and the angels and whoever is upon the earth and all animals; all living things and then the heavens and the earth will be destroyed after that and Paradise and the Fire will not be destroyed and whatever is within them nor the Throne and nor the Footstool.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> Reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad in his <em>musnad</em> and At-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee and Ibn Maajah and Al-<u>H</u>aakim and Al-Baghawee in <em>Sharhus-Sunnah</em> and others from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Shaddaad ibn Aws <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu </em>and it was declared authentic by Al-<u>H</u>aakim and declared <em><u>h</u>asan</em> (good) by At-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee and Al-Baghawee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> As for Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy then he declared this narration <em><u>d</u>a`eef</em> (weak) in his checking of <em>Mishkaat </em>in <em>A<u>d</u>&#8211;<u>D</u>a`eefah</em> <u>h</u>adeeth 5,319 because of the weakness of its narrator Aboo Bakr ibn Abee Maryam al-Ghassaanee, <em>W`Allaahu A’lam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Famous narration from `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> with a similar meaning to the end of what’s reported.

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 36 : Point 49</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And the blood of a Muslim who bears witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger cannot lawfully be shed except on account of one of three matters; fornication after having been married or one who turned apostate after having <em>daleel</em> or one who murders a believing soul without right then he is executed for it, other than that then the blood of the Muslim is unlawful for the Muslim to shed forever until the Hour is established</span>.</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F375298469&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-blood-of-a-muslim-cannot-lawfully-be-shed-except-on-account-of-one-of-three-cases" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The issue of killing a Muslim comes after the issue of marriage because Islaam came to protect matters of honour and to protect blood from being shed and to protect property. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Your blood and your wealth and your honour are forbidden for you.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“All of the Muslim is forbidden for the Muslim; his blood and his property and his honour.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So having spoken about <em>al-a`raa<u>d</u></em> (matters of honour) in the previous sentences in what is connected to marriage and divorce, he moved onto the matter of preservation of blood from being shed. So, the Muslim when he bears witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah then his blood and his property become forbidden to shed. And therefore, Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“I have been commanded to fight against the people until they say none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah. So, if they say it then they have rendered their blood and their property safeguarded from me except on account of a right of Islaam and their reckoning will be with Allaah, the Most High</span>.</strong><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, whoever announces his Islaam and utters the two testifications then we accept that from him and we count him as being a Muslim and we apply the rulings of the Muslims upon him even if in his heart there is hypocrisy (<em>nifaaq)</em>, for that will be between him and Allaah. Allaah will bring Him to account and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>accepted Islaam of the hypocrites (<em>munaafiqeen)</em> and he applied the outward rulings upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, whoever commits one of those things that nullifies Islaam then in that case he is judged to be guilty of <em>riddah</em> (apostasy). So, either he will then repent or otherwise, he will be executed as a protection for the religion. This is the <strong>first matter</strong> that renders the blood of a Muslim lawful to be shed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <strong>second matter</strong> from those things that renders the blood of a Muslim lawful to be shed is <em>al-Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u></em> (retaliatory killing); <em>an-nafsu bin-nafs</em> (a life for a life).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الْقِصَاصُ فِي الْقَتْلَى ۖ الْحُرُّ بِالْحُرِّ وَالْعَبْدُ بِالْعَبْدِ وَالْأُنثَىٰ بِالْأُنثَىٰ ۚ فَمَنْ عُفِيَ لَهُ مِنْ أَخِيهِ شَيْءٌ فَاتِّبَاعٌ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَأَدَاءٌ إِلَيْهِ بِإِحْسَانٍ ۗ ذَٰلِكَ تَخْفِيفٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَرَحْمَةٌ ۗ فَمَنِ اعْتَدَىٰ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ فَلَهُ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>وَلَكُمْ فِي الْقِصَاصِ حَيَاةٌ يَا أُولِي الْأَلْبَابِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Oh you who believe <em>al-Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u></em> (legal retribution) for those who have been murdered is prescribed for you. The free person for the free person and the slave for the slave and the female for the female and whoever pardons and overlooks for his brother and accepts payment of blood money instead then this should be adhered to with fairness and payment of blood money should be made in a good manner. This is an alleviation from your Lord and a mercy. So, whoever then transgresses after acceptance of the blood money and kills the murderer then for him there will be a painful punishment. And there is for you in <em>Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u> </em>(legal retribution) the saving of life, O people of understanding, that you may become righteous</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 178-179)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u></em> (retaliatory execution) results in the preservation of life even though the murderer is killed because a would-be murderer, if he knows that he’s going to be killed, he will withhold from killing. And the rest of the people, if they see the murderer being killed then they will stop themselves from killing. So therefore, blood will be safeguarded on account of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, <em>al-Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u></em> (retaliatory execution) is a means for preservation of life and even though the one upon whom retribution is taken is killed then it is a killing which leads to preservation of life of the rest of the society and transgression against blood will be reduced. As for the case, if the murderer were to be left and it were to be said this contradicts human rights and he were to be left and not executed then this will result in the shedding of blood and destruction of security and causing those people who are in a state of security to instead be in fear and it will bring about many evils and killing will increase and bloodshed will occur to the extent that they used to say even in the times of ignorance (<em>jaahiliyyah),</em> “<strong>Execution is the best deterrent to murder</strong>.” So, killing the criminal is the best deterrent to murder in the future and in this regard is the <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>وَلَكُمْ فِي الْقِصَاصِ حَيَاةٌ يَا أُولِي الْأَلْبَابِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And there is for you in legal retribution the saving of life, O people of understanding.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>179)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And those people who say that <em>Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u></em> (retaliatory killing) runs contrary to human rights then we say to them that the person who’s being transgressed against, “Is he not a human?” So, in taking retribution, there is protection for his right.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <strong>third</strong> of those whose blood it is lawful to shed is the <em>thayyib</em> (one who’s married or has been married) who commits zina (fornication). <em>Ath-thayyib</em> is the person who has had sexual relations with his wife in a correct marriage. So, if he then after that commits <em>zinaa</em> (fornication) then he is stoned to death with stones until he dies and his blood is rendered lawful on account of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, these are the matters which render the blood of a Muslim lawful to be shed. Either <em>al-Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u></em> (retaliatory execution for murder) a life for a life or one who commits fornication after being married or <em>al-murtadd</em> (the apostate); the one who has left the religion of Islaam, the one who commits something, which breaks a person’s Islaam. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever changes his religion then kill him.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“And the one who abandons his religion and leaves the Jama’ah (united body).”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this contains a refutation of those who deny the punishment for apostasy seeking to use as evidence his saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>لَا إِكْرَاهَ فِي الدِّينِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is to be no compulsion upon the religion.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>256)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this use of evidence is an error because killing the apostate; it&#8217;s goal is not to force anyone to accept the religion. Rather, the goal from it is <strong>to protect the religion</strong> from being played around with by someone who has entered into it freely by choice and then he abandons it after having borne witness that the religion is true.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And the blood of a Muslim person who bears witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah is not permissible,” </strong>the Muslim is the one who bears witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah. However, along with the two testifications, there must be action that he establishes the prayer and gives the <em>Zakaah</em> and fasts Rama<u>d</u>aan and performs the <u>H</u>ajj to the house for whoever is able to make his way to it; action is essential.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And whatever is besides that then the blood of the Muslim is forbidden for the Muslim to shed forever until the Hour is established,” </strong>the blood of the Muslim is forbidden for the Muslim. There will not come a time when it is permissible for him to shed the blood of a Muslim ever for Allaah unless he transgresses against and attacks the people in their homes or he commits Highway robbery or revolts against the authority of the ruler or other than that then he is killed to repel his evil if his evil cannot be repelled except through killing him.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Reported by al-Bukhaariyy (6,878) and Muslim (1,676) from `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu</em> `<em>anhu</em> who said Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The blood of a Muslim who bears witness than none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that I am the Messenger of Allaah is not permissible to be shed except on account of one of three cases; a life for a life and a previously married person who commits fornication and one who abandons his religion and leaves the Jamaa`ah.”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Reported by al-Bukhaariyy in his <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (67) and Muslim (1,679) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Bakrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu</em> `<em>anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Reported by Muslim in his <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (2,564) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu</em> `<em>anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> Reported by al-Bukhaariyy in his <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (25) and Muslim (22) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of `Abdullaah ibn `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu</em> `<em>anhuma</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5">[5]</a> Reported by al-Bukhaariyy in his <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> in two places Hadeeth Nos. (3,017) and (6,922) from `Ikrimah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Some heretics were brought to `Aliyy <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> so he burnt them to death. So, that news reached Ibn `Abbaas so he said, “If it had been me I would not have burnt them with fire because of the prohibition of Allaah’s Messenger </strong><em><strong><u>s</u></strong></em><strong><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>,</strong><strong> “Do not punish with the punishment of Allaah.” However, he would have killed them because of the saying of Allaah’s Messenger </strong><em><strong><u>s</u></strong></em><strong><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>,</strong><strong> “Whoever changes his religion then kill him.”</strong><strong style="font-size:1rem;"> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6">[6]</a> Reported by al- Bukhaariyy (6,878) and Muslim (1,676) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of `Abdullah ibn Mas’ood <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu</em> `<em>anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Imaam ibn Qudaamah al-Maqdisee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said in his famous book <em>Al-Mughnee</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“The People of Knowledge are united in consensus upon the obligation of killing the apostate and that is reported from Aboo Bakr and `Umar and `Uthmaan and `Aliyy and Mu`aadh and Aboo Moosaa and Ibn `Abbaas and Khaalid <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu</em> `<em>anhum</em> and others besides them and no one criticised that from them so it is <em>Ijmaa</em>` (consensus).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, Imaam an-Nawawi mentioned in his explanation of Muslim in the book <em>Kitaab al-Imaarah</em> (Book of Leadership) when he’s speaking about the <u>h</u>adeeth of Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam’s</em> sending of Aboo Moosaa al-Ash’aree to Yemen then later on he sent Mu`aadh to go to Yemen after him so when Mu`aadh arrived, he found that there’s a Jewish man there captured who had accepted Islaam and then left Islaam and become a Jew again; he was awaiting execution. So Aboo Moosaa offered a cushion for Mu`aadh to sit down so Mu’aadh refused, “till you kill him”. Imaam an-Nawawi commented upon that <u>h</u>adeeth and said, <span style="color:#993300;">“It shows the obligation of killing the apostate and they are agreed in consensus upon his killing.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ibn `Abdul-Barr said in his book <em>At-Tamheed</em> when he was speaking about the narration of `Aliyy <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu</em> `<em>anhu</em> when he killed the apostates. Ibn `Abdul-Barr then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“The <em>fiqh</em> of this <u>h</u>adeeth is that whoever apostasizes (leaves his religion) then his blood becomes lawful and his neck is struck, meaning he’s beheaded and the ummah is united upon that.”<em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref7" name="_ftn7">[7]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“And I say and it is not permissible to kill any soul except for one of these three by consensus and success is granted by Allaah.”</span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 35 : Point 48</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And if a man divorces his wife three times then she has become forbidden for him and she will not be permissible for him unless she marries another man.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F375231515&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/if-a-man-divorces-his-wife-three-times-then-she-has-become-forbidden-for-him" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And if a man divorces his wife three times then she has become forbidden for him,” </strong>if a man divorces his wife three times (three separate times divorces) then she becomes forbidden for him by consensus (<em>ijmaa`)</em> just as if he were to say “you are divorced” <strong>then</strong> afterwards he says “you are divorced” and <strong>then</strong> he says “you are divorced” or if he says to his wife “you are divorced <strong>then</strong> divorced or and so divorced” because this indicates a sequence and she becomes irrevocably divorced and separated from him if the number of divorces reaches three and she becomes forbidden for him unless and until she has married another husband besides him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">الطَّلَاقُ مَرَّتَانِ ۖ فَإِمْسَاكٌ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ تَسْرِيحٌ بِإِحْسَانٍ ۗ وَلَا يَحِلُّ لَكُمْ أَن تَأْخُذُوا مِمَّا آتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ شَيْئًا إِلَّا أَن يَخَافَا أَلَّا يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ اللَّهِ ۖ فَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلَّا يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ اللَّهِ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَا فِيمَا افْتَدَتْ بِهِ ۗ تِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ فَلَا تَعْتَدُوهَا ۚ وَمَن يَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَ اللَّهِ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الظَّالِمُونَ &#8211; 2:229</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">فَإِن طَلَّقَهَا فَلَا تَحِلُّ لَهُ مِن بَعْدُ حَتَّىٰ تَنكِحَ زَوْجًا غَيْرَهُ ۗ فَإِن طَلَّقَهَا فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَا أَن يَتَرَاجَعَا إِن ظَنَّا أَن يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ اللَّهِ ۗ وَتِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ يُبَيِّنُهَا لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ &#8211; 2:230</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Divorce is twice then you may either retain her upon reasonable terms or release her in a good manner.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Up until His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if then he divorces her for the third time then she is not permissible for him after that unless and until she has married another husband besides him. And if he (second husband) then divorces her, in that case there is no harm if the two of them wish to reunite provided that they think they can establish the limits laid down by Allaah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 229-230)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is if the divorces are separate even if it is within a single sitting but as for a person who says “you are divorced, you are divorced, you are divorced” without a word of adding in between, in this case we examine if he intended by repeating it just to emphasise it then it will be a single divorce but if he was intending establishing that he wanted to divorce her three times then she will be irrevocably divorced from him if it reaches the third one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if the divorces are said with a single word such as his saying “you are divorced three times over” or “you are divorced three times” then the majority hold that it counts as three divorces and she becomes separate irrevocably from him and forbidden for him unless and until she marries a different husband besides him. And this is the position of the four Imaams but in the saying of some of the verifiers that the three is counted only as one divorce and the matter; there is prolonged disagreement with regards to it. However, what will suffice us is that we know that divorce three times over makes her forbidden for him not forever more but rather it makes her forbidden for him unless and until she marries a different husband besides him and then he divorces her in that case. But as for entering into matters of disagreement then this does not concern us at the moment. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the intent of the author in entering these matters in `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief), and Allaah knows best, is to make clear that the matter of marriage is an important matter, which is obligatory to give care and attention to in accordance with legislated principles for it so that people should not be lax about it and about its legal procedures and because the book is entitled <em>Sharhus-Sunnah</em>; literally ’An Explanation of the Sunnah’ meaning clarification of the Sunnah in every matter and from that is the issues of marriage.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator’s side point: People of Knowledge make clear the woman marrying her second husband from the authentic evidences, has to be correct in marrying the second husband, not just as a trick to try and get back to the first one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said in his explanation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his saying, <strong>“So</strong> <strong>if a man divorces his wife three times then she has become forbidden for him and she will not be permissible for him unless she marries another husband besides him,” </strong>this matter, there is a great disagreement about it amongst the scholars. The majority hold that if a man divorces his wife three times at once with a single saying then she becomes forbidden for him; divorced from him. Whereas, from the People of Knowledge, there are some who say that the divorce, which makes her forbidden, is the divorce in accordance with the Sunnah that he divorces her in a period that is free from menses and he has not had sexual relations with her. So, as for divorcing three times with a single word then it is counted as one and a middle and balanced saying is that it’s counted still as three in accordance with his intention and the matter, there is a great deal of speech about it and Allaah is the one who grants success.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 35 : Point 47</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And there is no marriage except with a guardian (<em>walee)</em> and two just witnesses and a dower (<em>sadaaq)</em> whether it be a small amount or a large amount.

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/there-is-no-marriage-except-with-a-guardian-two-just-witnesses-a-dower" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a <em>fiqh</em> issue and it is an explanation of the conditions for the correctness of marriage (<em>nikaah)</em> with the <em>jumhoor</em> (majority) of scholars and from them is that it should be along with the permission of the <em>walee </em>(guardian) and that a woman may not marry herself off and from its conditions is <em>al</em> <em>ish</em>&#8211;<em>haad</em> (to have witnesses) to the contracting of the marriage. So, a marriage may not be contracted in secret without witnesses. So, from the position of the Muslims is to openly announce marriage and the matter of the <em>walee</em> (having a guardian) is a point where there is some disagreement. The <em>jumhoor</em> (great majority) hold that having the <em>walee </em>(guardian) is essential whereas with the <em>Hanafees</em>, there is no harm in a woman marrying herself off without the permission of the guardian. However, this is a saying that is not the correct saying, it is contrary to the evidence because of his saying <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“There is no marriage except with a guardian and with two just witnesses.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying in the other <u>h</u>adeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“A woman may not marry off another woman and a woman may not marry off herself, for the fornicatress (the one who commits zina, fornication) is the one who marries herself off.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whichever woman gets married without the permission of her guardian then her marriage is invalid, invalid, invalid.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So even though some of the jurists declare it to be correct (meaning a woman getting married without the permission of her guardian; <em>walee</em>) based upon <em>ijtihaad</em> (personal striving) from that scholar then what is counted is the evidence and therefore the author stated this matter even though it is a matter of <em>fiqh</em> to make clear that this is the correct position and it is the position which the majority of the People of Knowledge were upon that which is proven by the Prophetic Sunnah and in order that the marriages of the Muslims should be correctly regulated and not be entered upon by secrecy and <em>i<u>h</u>tiyaalaat</em> (fraudulent tricks). Rather they should be clear and open for indeed marriages are from the most important of affairs because upon them families are built and from them offspring are produced and upon them lineages are built and something even more severe is built upon them rendering the private parts lawful. So, therefore it is essential that the legislated principles are applied to contract a marriage as occurs in the <em>a<u>h</u>aadeeth</em> and in the <em>aayahs</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, <strong>“And it should be with a <em>sadaaq </em>(dower) and with a dower whether it’s a small amount or a large amount,” </strong>as for the <em>sadaaq</em> (dower) then it is not a condition (<em>shar<u>t)</u></em>. However, it is <em>waajib</em> (obligation). And therefore, if the marriage were to be contracted without a <em>sadaaq</em> (dower) then the contracting of the marriage will be correct. However, a <em>sadaaq</em> (dower) will be appointed for her in accordance with that of women who are like her because this is a right of hers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And whoever does not have a <em>walee</em> (guardian) then the ruler is the guardian for the one who does not have a guardian,” </strong>having a <em>walee</em> (guardian) is essential.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>walee</em> (guardian) is the wife’s close male relatives; the closest and then the next closest from them. Firstly, her father then her grandfather and so on upwards and then her son and the son of her son and so on downwards and then her full brother and then her brother through her father; meaning her brother who shares the same father but the mother is different and then her full paternal uncle and then her uncle who is the brother of her father and then the son of her full uncle (son of the father’s brother) and then the son of her uncle who is the brother of her father. This is the guardian (<em>walee)</em> of the woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if it occurs that a woman does not have a <em>walee</em> (guardian) from her close male relatives then her guardianship is taken on by the ruler or the one who represents the ruler and he is the judge in the court. So marriage must have regulating principles and it may not be anarchy just in accordance with the desires and lusts of the people. <a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn3">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad and Aboo Daawood and At-Tirmithee and Ad-Daarimee and A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>h</u>aawiyy in <em>Shar<u>h</u> Ma`aanee al-Aathaar</em> from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Moosaa Al-Ash`aree <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu</em> `<em>anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> This <u>h</u>adeeth was declared <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic) by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy as <u>h</u>adeeth 1,839 in <em>Irwa al Ghaleel </em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Reported by Ibn Maajah and Ad-Daaraqutnee in his <em>Sunan</em> and Al-Bayhaqee in his <em>Sunan al-Kubraa</em> from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah and it was declared <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic) by Ibn al-Mulaqqin in <em>Al-Badr Al-Muneer</em> to the standard of Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaaniyy in his checking of Ibn Maajah declared this <u>h</u>adeeth <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> except for the sentence about <em>az</em>&#8211;<em>zaaniyah</em> (fornicatress), the first part being authentic supported by other narrations; <strong>“A woman may not marry off another woman and a woman may not marry herself off”</strong>, that being authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad in his <em>musnad</em> and by Aboo Daawood, At-Tirmithee and Ad-Daarimee and by A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>h</u>aawiyy in <em>Sharh Ma`aanee al-Aathaar</em> from a <u>h</u>adeeth of `Aa`ishah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhaa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Side point:</strong> This <u>h</u>adeeth was declared <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic) also by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn3">[4]</a><strong>Side point:</strong> Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said in his explanation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And there is no marriage except with a guardian and with two just witnesses with a dower whether it be a small amount or a large amount,” </strong>this is the position of the <em>jumhoor</em> (the great majority) and it is what is the truth. So, therefore, those who say that the woman can marry off herself without the permission of her guardian is a saying, which is false, opposite to the evidences and contrary to them. Indeed, it opens up a breach for the people of corruption. So, it is obligatory to believe that this is futile. And likewise, her getting married without a dower. However, if the dower is not stated at the marriage then what is correct is that it does not make it null and void and is still counted as a valid marriage but she should be given a dower the same as women who are like her and her close relatives and women of her age; meaning the dower that is well-known amongst the people, whether it be a small amount or a large amount, at that time and at that place and this woman is called <em>Anwalliyah</em>; one who has given up the affair to someone else with the jurists.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Whoever</strong><strong> does not have a guardian then the ruler is the guardian for one who has no guardian; a <em>walee</em>,” </strong>this is the correct saying. So the woman who does not have a guardian then her guardian will be the ruler because of the <u>h</u>adeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The ruler is the guardian for the one who does not have a guardian.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the evidences with regard to the necessity of having a <em>walee</em> that brings some of the <em>aayahs</em> of the Qur·aan, each of the <em>aayahs</em> that they bring Sooratun-Noor (24) <em>aayah</em> 32, Sooratul-Baqarah (2) <em>aayah</em> 221, Sooratul-Baqarah (2) <em>aayah</em> 232, each of them in an address with regard to marrying the women and the address with regard to marrying off is the addresses to the men; men marrying off the women as opposed to an address to the women looking to get married. With regard to the point where the Shaykh mentioned that a woman getting married without any guardian and saying that it’s permissible for a woman to marry herself off without any guardian, this opens up a door to people who want to cause corruption.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they mention in the footnote, Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee himself he said, “I myself heard that there was one of the jurists from the <em>Hanafee’s</em> in one of the Arab lands and he had a son who was deviant and he used to hear from his father that it is not a condition for marriage that a woman has the permission of her guardian. So, this son when he used to hear that, used to accompany a group of people who were evildoers and they used to do illicit sexual acts with the women. He taught theevil group that what they should do is say to the prostitute woman, when you go to pay her you should say, “marry yourself to me” and she should say “I marry myself to you” and he should say “I accept it” and then when he’s finished his night with her then you say to her “you’re divorced” and on the second night, you can do it with a different woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh said, “So you can see that this <em>madhab</em> has been used here contrary to the evidence as a means for causing corruption even though the <em>Hanafee</em> <em>madhab</em> itself does not make the like of this permissible. However, it makes permissible only a marriage, which is going to be permanent and it does not make permissible mixing waters of one man with another when divorced. Rather, there must be an `<em>iddah</em> (waiting period) making sure her womb is clear, even a woman who frees herself by <em>khulah</em> or a slave girl who is poor.”</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 34 : Point 46</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> that Allaah, the Most High knew whatever was going to occur from the start of time and whatever was not going to occur. Whatever was going to happen then Allaah fully comprehended and enumerated it. And whoever says that He does not know except what has already occurred or what is occurring then he has disbelieved in Allaah, the Tremendous. </strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory to affirm the knowledge of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High and its encompassing everything. So, He has full knowledge of everything and He has full ability over everything and His <em>ilm</em> (knowledge) has no beginning and no ending. His <em>ilm</em> (knowledge) is just like the rest of the attributes established for Him forever. So, just as Allaah has no beginning then likewise, there is no beginning for His names and His attributes and His actions, He, the Perfect and Most High. And just as Allaah has no end, then likewise there is no end for His names and His attributes and His actions, He, the Majestic and Most High. So, He along with His names and His attributes is the First One with no beginning and He along with His names and His attributes is the Last One with no ending just as he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said addressing his Lord, He, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“You are Al-Awwal (the First One) so there is nothing before You and<br />
You are  Al-Aakhir (the Last One) so there is nothing after You and<br />
You are Az-Zaahir (the Uppermost One) so there is nothing above You and<br />
You are <em>Al-Baatin</em> (the Closest One) so there is nothing closer than You.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And to have <em>eemaan</em> that Allaah, the Most High knew whatever was going to be from the start of time and whatever was not going to be and whatever exists, He enumerated it and comprehended it all,” </strong>Allaah knew whatever was and has passed away in previous time and He knows whatever will be in the future and He knows whatever will not be, if it were to be; how it will be. So, Allaah’s knowledge comprehends everything and therefore He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَلَوْ رُدُّوا لَعَادُوا لِمَا نُهُوا عَنْهُ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">If they were to be sent back, they will return to doing whatever they had been forbidden from.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-An`aam (6), <em>aayah</em> 28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah knew that if they were to be returned to the world, they would return to doing what they had been forbidden from, meaning if they were returned to the world then they would return to disbelief even though their returning to the world would never happen ever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And whoever says that He does not know except what has already occurred or what is occurring then he has disbelieved in Allaah, the Tremendous,” </strong>whoever restricts the knowledge of Allaah to events that have already occurred only and that He does not know what is going to occur before it actually happens then he has disbelieved in Allaah because he has denied the knowledge of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High and he has denied the comprehensiveness of the knowledge of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High and He has affirmed for Allaah deficient knowledge so he becomes a disbeliever on account of this, for the knowledge of Allaah cannot be restricted. As for the knowledge of the created being then it is restricted no matter what level it reaches.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَفَوْقَ كُلِّ ذِي عِلْمٍ عَلِيمٌ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And above every person possessing knowledge there is one who knows more.</span> </strong>(Soorah-Yoosuf (12), <em>aayah </em>76)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every person who has knowledge, there will be another person who knows more than him and above all of them is Allaah, the Most High with His knowledge. And He commanded His Messenger to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>رَّبِّ زِدْنِي عِلْمًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Oh my Lord, increase me in knowledge. </strong></span>(Soorah <u>T</u>aa-<u>H</u>aa (20), <em>aayah </em>114)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the person who restricts the knowledge of Allaah and says He knows such and such but He does not know such and such, this one is a disbeliever (<em>kaafir</em>) since he has belittled Him and denied the generality of His knowledge of everything.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Muslim (2,713) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“With regard to this sentence, there appears to be something missing in  the wording here and what is apparent that the meaning is <strong>“And He does not know what will be except after it has occurred”</strong> and this was the statement of Hishaam ibn Al-Hakam; the head of misguidance, the one who said Allaah does not know things until they actually happen. So, he clearly stated that He, the Perfect does not know anything until He brings about knowledge for Himself of it and this is clear disbelief. Refer to the book <em>Al-Fissal</em> of Ibn Hazm.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I,Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad, say, the saying that “Allaah does not know things until they have actually happened,” this is the saying of some of the Mu`tazilah and it is a false and futile saying. Whoever believes that then he has disbelieved. So, knowledge (<em>al-ilm)</em> is an attribute of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. Allaah knew whatever was and whatever will not be and whatever is. If something were to occur, how it will be and He wrote it down in the preserved tablet (a<em>l-Lawh al-Mahfudh)</em> before He created the heavens and the earth. So, therefore, whoever denies <em>al-ilm (</em>Allaah’s knowledge) then he is a disbeliever. It’s obligatory that his repentance should be sought and he’ll either repent or he’ll be executed for disbelief and apostasy. And the Salaf (predecessors) said with regard to the <em>Qadariyyah</em>, “Argue with them concerning Allaah’s knowledge for if they deny it, they are disbelievers.” And success is granted by Allaah.”</p>
