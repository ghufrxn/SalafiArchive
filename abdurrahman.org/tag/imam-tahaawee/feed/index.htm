Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;"><span class="fontstyle0">4.  ولا شيء يعجزه‏<br />
And nothing renders Him incapable;</span> </span></strong></p>
<iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F357043148&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe>
<p><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/allaah-is-al-qadir-nothing-renders-him-incapable" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an affirmation of the perfection of His Power and Ability. Allaah the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He (Allaah) has full power over everything</strong></span><br />
(Sooratul-Maa.idah (5), <em>aayah </em>120)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And Allaah was and is fully capable of everything</span></strong><br />
(Sooratul-Kahf (18), <em>aayah </em>45)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He (Allaah) always was and is All-Knowing, All-Powerful</strong></span><br />
(Soorah Faa<u>t</u>ir (35), <em>aayah </em>44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And القَدِير (<em>Al-Qadeer</em>) means: the One who is extremely powerful. So His Power, He the Perfect and Most High, is such that there is nothing that can cause Him to be unable. Whenever He wants something He just says to it, “<strong>Be</strong>” and it is.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this contains affirmation of the <em>qudrah</em> (قدرة &#8211; power and ability) of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and it contains affirmation that His Power includes and covers everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the term that some authors use (about Allaah):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah has full power over whatever he wants,” this wording is an error because Allaah did not restrict His Power to His Will. Rather, He said (about Himself),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>(Allaah) has full Power over everything</strong>.” So therefore you should say that which Allaah the Perfect and Most High said about Himself. This (a similar statement) only occurs in the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He (Allaah) has full Power to gather them (the people) together when He Wishes</strong></span> (Sooratu<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because, the gathering of the creation has a certain time in the future and He is fully able to gather them at that time, meaning, the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And from His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and whatever creatures He has created and spread within them. And He (Allaah) has full Power to gather them together when He Wishes.</strong></span> (Sooratu<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [4][1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[1] Translator’s side point:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And there is nothing which causes Allaah to be incapable”</strong>: This is a denial but what is meant by it is not a mere denial because denial on its own is not from the belief of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em>; rather, it is the position of the innovators.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the people of the Sunnah then their way is the way of the Qur.aan which gives a general denial of certain things for Allaah and gives a detailed affirmation of Attributes for Him. And whenever there is a denial then the denial is there to affirm something which is its perfect opposite. So this denial is there because of affirmation of its perfect opposite i.e. nothing renders Him incapable because of the perfection of His Power and Ability.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further side point: In his explanation, Ibn Abil-`Izz said regarding <em>ta<u>sh</u>beeh</em>: Affirming attributes for Allaah when the creation have the like of those attributes, for example, affirming that Allaah is the All-Knowing when we affirm that the creation has knowledge and affirming that Allaah has Sight when the creation has sight and affirming that Allaah has a Hand when the creation has hands. This fact is what leads the <em>mu`a<u>tt</u>ilah</em> into denying certain attributes because they say that if you affirm for Allaah a Hand then you are declaring Him like the creation and if we affirm for Allaah a Face then amongst the creation we have faces, so if we affirm a Face for Allaah then we will be making Him like the creation. So therefore they deny any Hand for Allaah and deny any Face for Allaah and so on with other attributes as well. They say that in that way they will stay clear of making the Creator like the creation.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="Marker"><strong>Source</strong> : Shaikh al-Albaanee&#8217;s checking and notes to the Sharh and Matn  of Aqeedah Tahaawiyyah<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext"><b>His Name and Lineage: </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext">He was the Imaam, the Muhaddith, the Faqeeh, the Haafidh, the noble Scholar, Abu Ja&#8217;far Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Salaamah bin Salama &#8216;Abdul-Malik bin Salama Al-Azdee At-Tahaawee. Al-Azadee is an ascription to a well-known tribe from Qahtaan. At-Tahaawee is an ascription to the land Tahaa in Upper Egypt.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Search for Knowledge: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His lineage in knowledge is connected to his family and uncles, for his father was from the scholars and his uncle was the Imaam Isma&#8217;eel bin Yahyaa Al-Muznee. (Died 264H). He was born in 239H. When he reached the age of adolescence, he moved to Egypt in search of knowledge. Al-Muznee was the one with the most knowledge of Fiqh amongst the companions of Imaam Muhammad bin Idrees Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee in his land. And likewise his mother was from the people of knowledge and narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he linked with the scholars of Egypt as well as those who came to Egypt. And his teachers were many, as were his students.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every time the scope of his horizons would widen, he would find himself confused amidst a score of Fiqh issues. And he would not find the sufficient answers from his uncle that would soothe his confusion over these issues. So he began to examine what his uncle would do when he was faced with these kinds of contradictory opinions. His uncle would refer a lot to the books of the associates of Abu Haneefah (i.e. Hanafis), and he would favor many of the opinions of Abu Haneefah with regard to these issues. These favored opinions of his were recorded in his book &#8220;Mukhtasar Al-Muznee.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after that he was left with no choice but to look into the books of the associates of Abu Haneefah and adopt their methodology in establishing fundamental principles and deriving subsidiary rulings. This is such that when he completed his knowledge of the madh-hab of Imaam Abu Haneefah, he changed to that madh-hab and became one of its followers. But this did not prevent him from opposing and contradicting some of the (erroneous) opinions held by the Imaam (Abu Haneefah) and preferring the opinions of the other Imaams (on certain issues). This is because he, may Allaah have mercy on him, was not a muqallid (blind follower) of Abu Haneefah. But rather he only saw the methodology of Abu Haneefah in Fiqh as being the most exemplary of methodologies, according to his opinion &#8211; so he treaded that path. This is why you will find him in his book &#8220;Ma&#8217;aanee Al-Athaar&#8221; affirming some views that his Imaam (Abu Haneefah) did not hold. What supports what we stated just now, is what Ibn Zoolaaq stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I heard Abul-Hasan &#8216;Alee Ibn Abee Ja&#8217;far At-Tahaawee say: I heard my father say: &#8216; (and he mentioned the virtues of Abu &#8216;Ubayd Harbaway and his Fiqh and said) He would ask me about (Fiqh) issues. So one day I gave my answer to one issue, so he said to me: &#8216;This is not the opinion of Abu Haneefah.&#8217; So I said: &#8216;O judge (Qaadee), do I have to hold the same opinion for every opinion that Abu Haneefah held?&#8221; So he said: &#8216;I didn&#8217;t think you were more than a blind follower.&#8217; I said to him: &#8216;And does anyone blindly follow someone except he who is a fanatic?&#8217; He said: &#8216;Or a simple-minded person.&#8217; So this story spread throughout Egypt, such that it became a proverb and the people memorized it.'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was educated under many shuyookh, whom he took knowledge and benefited from. He had more than three hundred teachers. He would spend lots of time with those scholars that came to visit Egypt from different parts of the world, such that he would add to his knowledge what knowledge they had. This shows you the extent of the concern he had for benefiting and learning from the scholars, as well as the intense eagerness he had for acquiring knowledge. Many scholars praised him and described him as being reliable, trustworthy, a Faqeeh, intelligent, a good memorizer and a pious worshipper. He had a high proficiency in Fiqh and Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Scholars&#8217; Praise for Him: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Yoonus said: &#8220;At-Tahaawee was reliable, trustworthy, a Faqeeh, intelligent, the likes of whom one did not come afterward.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Adh-Dhahabee said in his At-Taareekh al-Kabeer: &#8220;He was the Faqeeh, the Muhaddith, the Haafidh, one of the elite personalities, and he was reliable, trustworthy, knowledgeable of Fiqh and intelligent.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer said in Al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah: &#8220;He was one of the reliable, trustworthy and brilliant scholars of Hadeeth (Haafidh).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He served as an intermediary for the knowledge between those who came before (Salaf) and those who came after (Khalaf). The scholars praised him and mentioned him as being a Muhaddith (scholar of Hadeeth), one whose report was reliable and an established narrator. He was distinguished and highly proficient in writing. And he became the most knowledgeable of Fiqh amongst the Hanafis in Egypt. This was even though he had a share in the Fiqh of all of the madh-habs of Fiqh and Hadeeth, and he knew of the various sciences of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Books: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his writings, then for the most part, they are verifications and compilations, containing many benefits. Among his writings is &#8220;Al-&#8216;Aqeedah At-Tahaawiyyah&#8221;, which we are writing the introduction for now, as well as for its explanation (by Ibn Abee Al-&#8216;Izz). Even though the size of the book is small, its benefits are many and its methodology is that of the Salaf. And you will find that it contains everything the Muslim needs concerning his Creed. There is also his book &#8220;Ma&#8217;aanee Al-Athaar&#8221;, which is a book in which he presents different areas of research in Fiqh along with their evidences. And during the course of his research, he mentions the issues in which there are differences of opinion amongst the scholars. And he lists the proofs and evidences for each opinion and debates them, outweighing which one appears to be the truth according to him. This book will accustom the student of knowledge with understanding Fiqh and it will acquaint him with the areas of difference of opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He left behind many other great works, close to forty different books, amongst which are: Sunan Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee, Mushkil Al-Athaar, Ahkaam-ul-Qur&#8217;aan, Al-Mukhtaar, Sharh Al-Jaam&#8217;i-ul-Kabeer, Sharh Al-Jaam&#8217;i-us-Sagheer, Ash-Shuroot, Nawaadir al-Fiqhiyyah and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam At-Tahaawee was well known and famous for commanding good and forbidding evil, for voicing out the truth and returning to that which he held to be the truth without being affected by the (other) scholars, rulers and associates.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufficient for us is the agreement of the majority of the scholars upon accepting this Creed, which has been truthfully called: &#8220;An Explanation of the Creed of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah.&#8221; And no one speaks against it except for those who rebel against the Creed held within it such as some remnants from the Mu&#8217;tazilah and the people of Hulool and Ittihaad (Sufi belief that Allaah is incarnate within His creation), and those who follow any opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Death: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam At-Tahaawee died on a Thursday at the beginning of Dhul-Qa&#8217;adah in 321H and was buried in the Qaraafah graveyard in Egypt. May Allaah have mercy on him.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>140.Eemaan is one entity, and its people regarding it are the same. **</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>141.And variation in excellence between them is by fear and dutifulness, and by opposing desires, and by adhering to what has most right.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Quote from Shaykh Fawzan</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This is a mistake. Because eeman is not one entity and its people are not all the same. Rather eeman varies in levels of excellence and it increases and it decreases, except in the view of the murji&#8217;ah&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Commentary from Imam Ibn Baz</strong> (Source : <a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;PageID=94&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=14">alifta.net</a>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His statement, &#8220;<em>Faith is the same for the faithful in terms of its basis</em>&#8221; is disputable, even Batil (null and void), for the faithful are not the same in terms of faith. Rather, they vary considerably in faith. The faith of the messengers is not like that of others. Similarly, the faith of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs and the rest of the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet), may Allah be pleased with them, is like not that of others. Likewise, the faith of Mu&#8217;mins (believers) is not like that of Fasiqs (people flagrantly violating Islamic law). Faith varies according to the awareness of Allah, His names, attributes, and Shari`ah (Islamic law), according to Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream), unlike Al-Murji&#8217;ah (a deviant Islamic sect claiming that Faith is restricted to belief, not deeds) and those who follow them. Allah is the One sought for help.</p>

<p><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Commentary from Shaykh Ibn Baz : ( from </strong><a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;PageID=94&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=14"><strong>alifta.net</strong></a>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This restriction should be considered. A disbeliever embraces Islam on the pronunciation of the Two Shahadahs (Testimonies of Faith) if he has not already pronounced them. If he has already pronounced them, he re-embraces Islam by Tawbah (repentance to Allah) for the cause for his disbelief. He may get out of the fold of Islam for many reasons other than ingratitude, as indicated by scholars in the Chapter on the Ruling on the Murtad (Apostate). Such causes include blasphemy against Islam or the Prophet, peace be upon him, or making a mockery of Allah, His Messenger, Book, or anything of His Shar` (Law) for Allah, Exalted be He, says: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><em>Say, &#8216;Is it Allah and His verses and His Messenger that you were mocking?&#8217; Make no excuse; you have disbelieved after you had believed.</em></span>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the causes for disbelief is idolatry, supplicating to the dead, making Istighathah (beseeching for help) to them and the like, for this contradicts the testimony of &#8220;There is none worthy of Worship except Allah,&#8221; which indicates that worship is an exclusive right of Allah Alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Other causes for disbelief are making Du`a&#8217; (supplication), Istighathah, Ruku` (bowing), Sujud (Prostration), slaughtering, making a vow, and the like to something other than Allah. He who does any of these things to something other than Allah, including idols, angels, Jinn (creatures created from fire), the dead, and other creatures, commits Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and does not act upon the testimony of &#8220;There is none worthy of Worship except Allah&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All such acts bring one out of the fold of Islam, according to the Ijma` (consensus of scholars) of the scholars. These are not merely acts of ingratitude. The evidence for this is derived from the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Prophet. There are many other acts that cause a Muslim to be declared a disbeliever and they are not then merely acts of ingratitude. Such acts are cited by the scholars in the Chapter on the Ruling on the Murtad. So you can refer to them. May Allah grant us success.</p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [121]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) of the Muslims, is that the Messengers (<em>Rusul</em>) are the most excellent of the creation and that the Messengers (<em>Rusul</em>) vary in levels of excellence. So they hold as their creed and belief, that Allaah took Ibraaheem as a <em><u>Kh</u>aleel</em> (an especially beloved one) just as Allaah, the Most High, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;..and Allaah took Ibraaheem as a <u>Kh</u>aleel (an especially beloved)&#8221; </span> (Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah </em>125)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this word <em>‘al-<u>kh</u>ullah’</em> (الخلة), it means: the highest of the levels of love. So Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, has love for His believing servants and for the <em>muttaqeen</em> ( المتقين &#8211; the people of <em>taqwaa</em> – those are dutiful to Him) and He has love for the <em>mu<u>h</u>sineen</em> (المحسنين &#8211; the doers of good) and He loves those who frequently repent (التوابين &#8211; <em>at-tawwaabeen</em>) and He loves <em>al-mutta<u>t</u>ahhireen</em> (المتطهرين – those people who purify themselves). However, <em>al-<u>kh</u>ullah</em> is a special degree which has not been attained except by two of the creation: Ibraaheem and Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em>`alayhima<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>. Just as he <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Allaah took me as an especially beloved one (<u>Kh</u>aleel) just as He took Ibraaheem as an especially beloved one (<u>Kh</u>aleel).”</span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And Allaah spoke directly to Moosaa&#8221; </span> (Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah </em>164)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, He (Allaah) gave excellence to some of the Prophets over others, even though all of them were upon a very high level. However, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, gave excellence to some over others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Those are the Messengers; We gave excellence to some of them over others. From them are those to whom Allaah spoke directly and He raised some in degrees of excellence.&#8221;</span> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>253)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, every Prophet was given by Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, a degree of excellence particular to him. So he gave to Ibraaheem and Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em>`alayhima<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam, al-<u>kh</u>ullah</em> (that He made them His specially beloved). And He gave to Moosaa the excellence that He spoke to him directly, without an angel in-between. And Moosaa heard His Speech; so He the Perfect called to him (ناداه &#8211; <em>naadaahu</em>) and spoke privately to him (ناجاه &#8211; <em>naajaahu</em>). And the term <em>‘al-munaadaat’</em> (المنادات) means ‘a raised voice’ and <em>‘al-munaajaat’</em> (المناجات) is ‘speaking with a low voice’. Both of these occurred for Moosaa <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> and this was a virtue not attained by anyone besides him. And He said at the end of the <em>aayah, “takleemaa</em> (تكليما – with Speech)” for emphasis so that no one could say that this was something metaphorical. So when He has emphasized it with this verbal noun, this proves that it is true and real Speech from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. So this contains affirmation of <em>al-Kalaam</em> (الكلام – Speech) for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. And it contains affirmation of the virtue of Moosaa <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> over other Prophets with regard to this characteristic. <strong>And the fact that a Prophet had a particular quality special to him does not necessitate that he is better than the others unrestrictedly. Rather, it means that he was more excellent than other Prophets with regard to this particular quality.</strong></p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Explanation – Point [105]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This follows on from what preceded from the speech about Pre-ordainment and Pre-decree. And it has already preceded that from the levels of having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in Pre-ordainment and Pre-decree is having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in whatever He wrote in <em>Al-Law<u>h</u> Al-Ma<u>h</u>foo<u>z</u></em> (the Inscribed or Preserved Tablet).  And that is, that Allaah created the creation and the first thing that He created was the Pen (<em>Qalam</em>) and He said to it, “Write!” So it replied, “What should I write?” So He said, “Write whatever is going to happen until the Day of Resurrection.” So the Pen wrote down, by the command of Allaah for it to write down, whatever was going to happen until the Day of Resurrection, as occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And no one knows how the Preserved Tablet (<em>Al-Law<u>h</u></em>) is, and how the Pen is, except Allaah. And they are two created things from the things which Allaah the Mighty and Majestic has created; we have <em>eemaan</em> in that. And so, therefore, the author said: <strong>“We have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in the Preserved Record and in the Pen, and in whatever has been inscribed in it.” </strong>Meaning: <em>Al-Law<u>h</u> Al-Mahfoo<u>z</u></em> (The Preserved Tablet) and the writing that is in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is the second level from the levels of <em>eemaan</em> in Pre-ordainment and Pre-decree, and it is: <em>eemaan</em> in the writing in the Preserved Tablet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [105][2]<span style="font-size:13.3333px;">[3]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] This is a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Aboo Daawood and At-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ee and Aboo Ya`laa from the statement of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, and it is also reported by Al-Bayhaqee as a statement of the Companion, which carries the ruling of being from the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. It was declared <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Mu<u>h</u>ammad ibn `Abdul `Azeez ibn Manee`, made a note on this point: <strong>We have eemaan in the Preserved Tablet</strong>; he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah, the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Indeed, it is a Praiseworthy Qur·aan contained in a Preserved Tablet.<br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Burooj (85), <em>aayaat </em>21-22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Noble Qur·aan is written down in the Preserved Tablet, just as Allaah, the Perfect, mentioned. And Jibreel <em>`alayhis-salaam</em> heard it from Allaah and conveyed it to our Prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em>`alayhi<u>s</u> <u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>. So it was sent down from your Lord in truth, and He did not say ‘from the Preserved Tablet’. And there is no contradiction between its being in the Preserved Tablet and between its being sent down from Allaah, as was clarified by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah. And <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>ul-Islaam said also, that the Preserved Tablet is above the heavens and there occurs in a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> that no one looks into it except Allaah, the Mighty and the Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: So this shows the misguidance of those who state that the soul of a person can see what is contained in the Preserved Tablet. This is just a statement from the philosophers and from the people of superstitious stories from the worshippers – whether righteous or unrighteous, as is their firm belief. So beware of it because it is a lie.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Pen which is mentioned, then it is what Allaah created; and it wrote the measure of everything in the Preserved Tablet just as occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Ubaadah ibn A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>aamit reported by Aboo Daawood from the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The first thing that Allaah created was the Pen and He said to it, “Write!” So it said, “O my Lord, and what shall I write?” He said, “Write down the decreed measure of everything right until the Hour is established.”’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the scholars disagree – was the Pen the very first thing that was created or was it the <em>`Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Allaah’s Throne)? They have two sayings in that regard. Ibn Al-Qayyim mentions both of them in his Nooniyyah and he preferred the view that the Pen was created after the <em>`Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah, </em>he said on this point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say, with regard to the Preserved Tablet, it is what is mentioned in the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed, it is a Praiseworthy Qur·aan contained in a Preserved Tablet.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Burooj (85), <em>aayaat </em>21-22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that is from the <em><u>Gh</u>ayb</em> (Hidden and Unseen) which it is obligatory that we have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) in it. And its true reality is not known except to Allaah. And the belief that some righteous people can look into what’s contained in it – this belief is <em>kufr</em> (unbelief) in the <em>aayaat</em> and <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> which clearly state that no one knows the <em><u>Gh</u>ayb</em> (Hidden and Unseen) except Allaah, the Most High.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s Side Point:</strong> With regard to the point about which was created first: the Pen or the Throne, <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>)<em>, </em>he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The explainer (Ibn Abil-`Izz in his explanation of A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>h</u>aawiyyah), he explained here, that the scholars differed whether the Pen was the very first thing created or the Throne (`<em>Ar<u>sh</u></em><u>)</u>. The scholars had two sayings in that regard and there is no third (saying). (Some of the scholars of the <em>Sunnah</em> said that Allaah’s Throne was first and then the Pen was created and some said that the Pen was created and then after that, Allaah’s Throne was created, and there is no third saying).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And in my view the most preferable one is the first (that the Pen was the very first thing created) as is clearly stated in my note (that he made for A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>h</u>aawiyyah). And I say now, whether what is most correct is this or that, then this difference shows that the scholars are agreed that there was a first created thing. And the idea that created things came into creation and there is always something before it, they are contrary to this agreement (of the scholars).”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Explanation – Point [84] <span style="color:#003366;">(continued from Lesson 22)</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(In the previous lesson, we ended with the saying of <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Fawzaan: This is the intercession which is confirmed, with its conditions, and it is of different types.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From them are: some types which are specific for the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and there are some types which are shared between him and between other prophets, and angels and righteous people and the children who die before reaching puberty. All of these people will intercede with Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As for the intercession which is specific for the Prophet </strong><strong><em><u>s</u></em></strong><strong><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em></strong>, then there are various types for this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: His intercession, <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>, interceding for the people of the <em>mawqif</em> (الموقف<em> – </em>the standing place) when the standing becomes very prolonged on the Day of Resurrection, and when the distress becomes severe and when the crowding together of the people is severe and the sun is drawn close to the people’s heads and tremendous distress comes about. Then the people in the gathering place will want someone to intercede for them for the Judgment to be carried out for them so that they can leave the stopping place and go either to Paradise or to the Fire. So they will go to Aadam <em>`alayhis-salaam</em> and he will excuse himself because of how dreadful and serious the standing will be. Then they will go to Noo<u>h</u> <em>`alayhis-salaam – </em>the first of the Messengers, and he will excuse himself. Then they will go to Moosaa – the one to whom Allaah spoke directly, and he will excuse himself. Then they will go to `Eesaa <em>`alayhis-salaam</em> and he will excuse himself also. Then they will go to Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and he will say, “I am the right one for that; I am the right one for that.” Then he (<em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) will go and fall down in prostration (<em>sajdah</em>) in front of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and he will praise Him and repeat words of praise upon Him and he will make supplication to Him until it is said to him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Raise your head and ask and you will be given it! And intercede and your intercession will be accepted.”[1]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He will be granted that he can intercede) after he makes <em>du`aa·</em> (supplication) and after he has sought permission; he will not just intercede straight away. Rather, he will make prostration (<em>sajdah</em>) and he will make <em>du`aa·</em> (supplication) and he will repeat words of praise upon Allaah, and he will seek to draw nearer to Him by means of His Names and His Attributes. Then, permission will be given to him for him to intercede; then he will intercede for judgment to be passed between the creation, and Allaah will accept his intercession. And Allaah the Perfect and Most High will come to pass judgment between His servants. He, the One free of all imperfections, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">But no! When the earth is crushed to dust; and your Lord comes, and the angels – row upon row.</span></strong>  (Sooratul-Fajr (89), <em>aayaat </em>21-22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the One free of all imperfections, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do they but await that their Lord comes, screened by clouds, and the angels, and the affair is ended.</span></strong>  (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>210)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is his, <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>, intercession regarding judgment being passed between the creation. And this is a tremendous station (which Allaah will give to him) and through it, will give honour and nobility to the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And this is <em>Al-Maqaam Al-Ma<u>h</u>mood</em> (المقام المحمود) – the Praiseworthy Station about which Allaah, the One free of all imperfections, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And during the night get up and pray as something extra for you. Indeed Allaah will certainly raise you to a Praiseworthy Station.</span></strong>  (Sooratul-Israa· (17), <em>aayah </em>79)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because the first to the last of the people will praise him for it, and his, <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>, virtue will be made manifest in this tremendous station.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second intercession</strong> which is particular for the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam,</em> is his interceding for the people of Paradise to enter into Paradise.[2] So, the first one who will request that the gate of Paradise is opened will be Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, and he will be the first one who enters into it.[3] And the first nation who will enter it will be his nation <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third intercession</strong> which is particular to the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam,</em> is his interceding for the people of Paradise, that Allaah should raise their stations and levels. So, he will intercede for some people so that Allaah should raise their levels higher in Paradise; so Allaah will raise them higher through the intercession of the Prophet <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>.[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The fourth intercession: </strong>and it is shared (it’s something for the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>and for others besides him); it is the intercession with regard to the <em>Ahlil-Kabaa·ir</em> (أهل الكبائر – those guilty of major sins) from the believers, for those who deserved to enter into the Fire, (intercession) that they do not enter the Fire. And also with regard to those who have entered it, that they should be taken out of it. This is the place about which the sects disagree. So the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> and the <em><u>Kh</u></em><em>awaarij</em> and their like, they deny this and they say, “Whoever enters into the Fire will not come out from it.” Whereas the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah</em> (the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>), they affirm it just as it occurs and they hold it as their creed and belief. And it is obligatory upon the Muslim that he holds this as his creed and belief and he has <em>eemaan</em> in it, and that he asks Allaah that He grants the right of intercession to His Prophet <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam </em>in this regard, since he is in need of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The fifth intercession:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is particular to the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, and it is his intercession with regard to his paternal uncle Aboo <u>T</u>aalib. Aboo <u>T</u>aalib died upon <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and upon the religion of `Abdul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib who was a <em>mu<u>sh</u>rik</em> (a person of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>). And he said that he was upon the religion of `Abdul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib, and he died upon that; so he became of the people of the Hellfire who will remain in it forever. However, Allaah, the Mighty and the Majestic will grant His Messenger <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam </em>the right to intercede for Him (Allaah) to reduce the punishment for him so that he will be in a shallow part of the Fire, but even so, he (Aboo <u>T</u>aalib) will still think that there is no one who is suffering a worse torment that him, even though he is the person out of the people of the Fire who is suffering the lightest punishment.[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the intercession with regard to the people guilty of major sins is shared. So the angels will intercede, and the prophets will intercede and the beloved servants of Allaah (will intercede) and the righteous people will intercede,[6] and the children who died below the age of puberty will intercede for their parents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [84][7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <em><u>H</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree as <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 3340, 4712, 7510 and by Muslim; it is from a longer <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] From Anas ibn Maalik <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh </em>that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“I am the first one who will intercede regarding Paradise.”</strong> Reported by Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s Side Point: In explanation of this <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>, A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>eebee said, “Meaning: I will intercede for the disobedient ones from my Ummah, for them to enter into Paradise. Or it is said: I am the first one who will intercede in Paradise with regard to raising the ranks of the people in it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] From Anas ibn Maalik <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh, </em>who said, “Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘I will come to the gate of Paradise on the Day of Resurrection and I will request that it be opened. So the gatekeeper will say, “Who are you?” So I will say, “Muhammad.” So he will say, “I have been commanded regarding you, that I should not open it for anyone before you.”’”</strong> Reported by Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Translator’s Side Point: Maybe there is a slight oversight in the text of the explanation here. <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Fawzaan <em>hafi<u>z</u>ahullaah,</em> says here that this intercession of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, </em>for the people of Paradise who are in Paradise to have their ranks raised higher than what they deserve so that they are given higher places than what they deserve. Here, he says that this is specific to the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. However, as we had when the <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> <em>hafi<u>z</u>ahullaah </em>explained Al-`Aqeedah Al-Waasi<u>t</u>iyyah, he mentioned this type of intercession and he mentioned that it was not particular to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> – that it was for him and for others besides him as well from the Prophets, martyrs, righteous, and so on; they also have the right to this intercession. Likewise <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Ibn Baaz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> in his explanation of Al-Wasai<u>t</u>iyyah, he mentioned the same point – that this type is not specific to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. Wallaahu a`lam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] From Al-Abbaas ibn `Abdul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu,</em> that he said to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, “Will you be able to suffice your uncle in anything since he used to look after you and become angry for you?” So, he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> replied,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“He will be in a shallow part of the Fire and if it were not for me, he would be in the lowest depth of the Fire.”</strong> Reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree as <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 3883, and also by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] So, from Aboo Sa`eed (Al-<u>Kh</u>udree) <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh,</em> from the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah the Most High will say, ‘The angels have interceded and the Prophets have interceded and the believers have interceded and none remains except for the Most Merciful of those who show mercy. Then He will take a handful out of the Fire and will bring out a people who never did any good; they will become charcoal and He will cast them in a river at the mouth of Paradise called the River of Life, then they will sprout like the sprouting of seeds on the bank of a torrent, and then they will be entered into Paradise.’” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><u>H</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) said in his small notes with regard to the intercession: “It is something <em>mutawaatir</em> (something supported by <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> which has many, many narrators at every level of narration) also. And Ibn Abee `Aa<u>s</u>im, in his book: As-Sunnah, he brings six chapters about it – from chapters 163 to168, with <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> numbers 784 to 832. And the explainer (Ibn Abil-`Izz), he mentions a number of them, <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, in his explanation, and they include the fact that his intercession, <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, is of eight (8) different types.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Translator’s Side Point:</strong> </span>Sometimes the people of knowledge abridge the types of intercession and sometimes they mention them in detail. When they mention them in detail they mention that they are eight (8) different types – the first three (3) of them being particular for the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam:</em></p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>The greater intercession – which is the intercession for the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>for the Judgment to be carried out when the people go to each of the Prophets and then they go to the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And as we have heard that occurs in the authentic <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em>, reported by Bu<u>kh</u>aaree and Muslim: that he will make <em>sajdah</em> beneath the Throne and make <em>du`aa·</em> to Allaah and praise Him and so on, and his intercession will be granted. This is the ‘greater intercession’ and the standing place there is the <em>Maqaam Al-Ma<u>h</u>mood</em> (the Praiseworthy Standing Place) which will be granted to no one except the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</li>
<li>The intercession for the people of Paradise to be able to enter into Paradise. <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-U<u>th</u>aymeen <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> mentions that after the people cross the bridge over the Hellfire, there will be an archway where they will be stopped and any remaining rancour or feeling in their hearts towards each other will be removed and after that is the gate of Paradise. It will not be opened until the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> intercedes for it to be opened. The evidence being the <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh,</em> reported by Muslim: “I am the first of those who will intercede with regard to Paradise.”</li>
<li>The intercession of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> for his uncle Aboo <u>T</u>aalib – that his punishment in the Fire is reduced.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These three types are particular to the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. The next five are general – for the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and for other than him. The first and greater intercession is agreed upon by all the sects. It is agreed upon by the people of the Sunnah and the deviant sects as well (<em>Mu`tazilah</em>, <em><u>Kh</u></em><em>aawarij</em> etc.).</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;" start="4">
<li>The intercession for those people who deserve the Hellfire, from the people of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> who have committed major sins (the disobedient ones) – the intercession that they don’t have to enter the Fire. <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-U<u>th</u>aymeen <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> mentions as evidence for this: the supplication that is said in the funeral prayer for the deceased. This type of intercession is denied by the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> and the <em><u>Kh</u></em><em>aawarij</em>.</li>
<li>For those people of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> &#8211; the disobedient ones guilty of major sins who deserve entry into the Fire and who have entered into the Fire, intercession that they should be taken out from the Fire. <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-U<u>th</u>aymeen mentions that there are many <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> to support this. Amongst them is a <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo Sa`eed al-<u>Kh</u>udree –one wording of which we heard – reported by Muslim and also in longer wording by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree as <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> Again, the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> and the <em><u>Kh</u></em><em>aawarij</em> deny this type.</li>
<li>For the ranks of the people of Paradise – that their ranks should be raised higher. The explainer of Al-Waasi<u>t</u>iyyah – Ibn Al Fayaa<u>d</u> mentions that there is agreement about this type as well. An evidence for it is the <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree as <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> 4323 – <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo Moosaa <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh, </em>that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> made supplication for one of the Companions and said,</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“O Allaah! Forgive `Ubayd Aboo `Aamir.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“O Allaah! On the Day of Resurrection, make him above many of Your creation from the people.”</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;" start="7">
<li>The intercession with regard to believers whose good and bad deeds are equal &#8211; they are the people of ‘The Heights’ – <em>Al-A`raaf</em> (الأعراف) and are mentioned in the seventh <em>soorah</em>; the intercession that they should be allowed to enter into Paradise, and they will.</li>
<li>The intercession for some of the believers to enter into Paradise without there being any reckoning upon them. The evidence for that being the <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Ukkaa<u>sh</u>ah about the seventy thousand (70,000) people who would enter Paradise without reckoning. <em><u>H</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree, Muslim and others.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is an excellent book on this topic of <em>a<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>sh</u>afaa`ah</em> by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Muqbil <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>: <em>A<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>afaa`ah </em>(الشفاعة) where the <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> compiles all the different <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> about <em>a<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>sh</u>afaa`ah</em>. It is more than 300 pages long.</p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Explanation – Point [84] [Part 01]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>A<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>sh</u>afaa`ah</em> (the intercession) is also from the important matters of `<em>aqeedah </em>(creed and belief)[1] because people have gone astray with regard to affirming it. Some people went beyond the due limits in affirming it and others took a middle way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, with regard to the intercession on the Day of Resurrection, then the people have become divided about it, into <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>three categories:</strong></span></p>
<p>A people who went beyond the limits in affirming it to such an extent that they seek it from the dead and from the graves and from the idols and (from) the trees and (from) the stones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> And they worship besides Allaah that which cannot harm them and cannot benefit them; and they say, “These are our intercessors with Allaah.”</strong></span> (Soorah Yoonus (10), <em>aayah </em>18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(The people of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>, they say,) “We do not worship them except so that they should draw us closer in nearness to Allaah.” </span></strong> (Sooratuz-Zumar (39), <em>aayah </em>3)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And a group who go beyond bounds in denying intercession, such as the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> and the <em><u>Kh</u>awaarij</em>. So they denied that there would be any intercession regarding the people who commit major sins (<em>ahlul-kabaa·ir</em>). And they contradict the proofs from the Book and the Sunnah which are <em>mutawaatir</em> (reported by huge number of narrators at each level of narration) affirming the intercession (<em>a<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>sh</u>afaa`ah</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah</em> (the people of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>), they took a middle path. So, they affirmed the <em><u>sh</u>afaa`ah</em> (intercession) in the manner mentioned by Allaah and His Messenger; and they truly believe in it – without <em>ifraa<u>t</u></em> (إفراط – exceeding the limits) and <em>tafree<u>t</u></em> (تفريط – falling short of what is required).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>a<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>sh</u>afaa`ah</em> (intercession) in the language, is derived from <em>a<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>sh</u>af`</em> (الشفع – that which is even) meaning: the opposite of ‘odd’ (الوتر – <em>al-witr</em>) because the word <em>al-witr</em> means: ‘a solitary person’ (that which is single), whereas <em>a<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>sh</u>af` </em>(that which is even) means: ‘more than one’, be it two or four or six; it is what is called ‘the even numbers’.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the Legislation it means: acting as an intermediary to carry out needs; that an intermediary comes in-between the person who has a need and the one who possesses what he wants. And it is of two categories: (the first is) interceding with Allaah and (the second is) interceding with the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <strong>intercession with the creation</strong>, then that is of two categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A <strong>good intercession</strong> (شفاعة حسنة &#8211; <em><u>sh</u>afaa`atun <u>h</u>asanah</em>) which is, when it is done with regard to affairs which are good, beneficial and permissible; that you mediate with someone who possesses the needs required by the people, in order that he should carry out those needs for them. He, the One free of all imperfections said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> Whoever intercedes for a good cause will receive a share of the reward for it. </span></strong> (Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah </em>85)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he, <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Intercede and you will receive reward, and Allaah will bring about whatever He wills upon the tongue of His Messenger.”</strong> [3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is <em><u>sh</u>afaa`atun <u>h</u>asanah</em> (good intercession) and there is reward for it because it involves bringing about benefit for the Muslims in their needs being carried out and in their attaining that which they seek which is beneficial for them, and as long as it does not involve transgression or wrong-doing against anyone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <strong>the second category</strong> (of intercession amongst the creation) is: <strong>evil intercession</strong> (شفاعة سيئة &#8211; <em><u>sh</u>afaa`atun sayyi·ah</em>) which means: interceding for affairs which are forbidden; such as interceding so that prescribed punishments which have become binding should be dropped. And the like of this, enters into those who the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> cursed in saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah has cursed whoever gives shelter to a person of transgression.”</strong> [4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, interceding with regard to seizing the property of other people without right and giving it to those who do not deserve it; Allaah the Most High said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever intercedes for an evil cause then he will have a share of the sin of it. </span></strong> (Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah </em>85)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <strong>intercession with Allaah</strong>, then it is not like interceding with the creation. For intercession with the Creator, that means: that Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, honours some of His servants by granting them that they may supplicate for some of the Muslims who deserve punishment because they have committed major sins (other than <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>), so the person intercedes with Him that He should pardon those people and not punish them because that person was a believer upon <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>. So therefore, the one interceding, he intercedes with Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, that He should pardon that person. Or, regarding someone who has entered the Hellfire because of sins, so the one who is interceding, intercedes with Allaah for that person to be taken out and for the punishment to be removed from him. And this is called ‘the intercession regarding the people who committed major sins’[5].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, interceding with Allaah has two conditions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first condition</strong> is that it is done only with the Permission of Allaah. So no one can intercede with Allaah, except with His Permission. So, He is the One who permits the person who intercedes, to intercede. And as for before He has granted Permission, then no one can precede Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Who is there that can intercede with Him, except with His Permission? </span></strong> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>255)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He is not like the created beings whom people come to in order to interceded with them even if they do not give permission for it. So Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, no one can intercede with Him except with His Permission.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second condition</strong>: that the person you are interceding for is one of the people of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed </em>(one who worships Allaah alone) and he is from the people of <em>eemaan</em> (he is a true believer – a <em>mu·min</em>) from those whom Allaah is pleased with – being pleased with their sayings and their actions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they cannot intercede except on behalf of those He (Allaah) is pleased with.</span></strong>  (Sooratul-Anbiyaa· (21), <em>aayah </em>28)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Allaah is pleased with that person’s sayings and actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And these two conditions occur together in the saying of Allaah the Most High,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Except, after Allaah has granted permission for whomever He wishes and is pleased with.</span></strong>  (Sooratun-Najm (53), <em>aayah </em>26)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘After Allaah has granted permission’ – this is the first condition; ‘and someone He is pleased with’ – that is the second condition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the unbeliever (<em>kaafir</em>), he will not be benefitted by any intercession.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Then they (the unbelievers) will not be benefitted by the intercession of those who intercede. </span></strong> (Sooratul-Mudda<u>thth</u>ir (74), <em>aayah </em>48)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">For the wrongdoers (from the unbelievers), there will be no devoted friends nor anyone to intercede for them, who will be of aid.</span></strong>  (Soorah <u>Gh</u>aafir (40), <em>aayah </em>18)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the intercession mentioned in the Qur·aan is of two types: intercession which is negated or denied, and that is intercession which has its conditions (one or both of them) absent; and intercession which is affirmed, which is intercession which fulfils those conditions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So as for the unbeliever, then he will not be benefitted by intercession. Even if all the inhabitants of the heavens and of the earth were to intercede for him, Allaah still would not accept their intercession because this person is a <em>mu<u>sh</u>rik</em> (one who worships others besides Allaah), he is an unbeliever (<em>kaafir</em>) in Allaah the Majestic and Most High. Allaah is not pleased with him in his sayings and his actions. Except, for what occurs with regard to the intercession of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> with regard to his uncle – Aboo <u>T</u>aalib, for this is a special and particular intercession; and also, it is not an intercession for him to come out from the Hellfire, but rather an intercession for the punishment to be reduced upon this man because of the assistance he gave to the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and because of his sheltering him and defending him <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>. So the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> will intercede for the punishment to be reduced for him, only.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the confirmed intercession with its conditions, and it is of different types.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Point [84][6] to be continued <em>inshaa· Allaah</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] As is indicated in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of <em>a<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>sh</u>afaa`ah</em>, reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree as <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> 3340, 4712, 7510, and also by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s Side Point: It’s a long <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> mentioning the Day of Resurrection, when the people would be suffering from the length of the waiting. Then they will go to the Oolul-`azm from the prophets – Aadam <em>`alayhis-salaam</em>, then Noo<u>h</u>, then Moosaa and `Eesaa, asking each of them to intercede with Allaah for the judgment to begin. Finally it will be said to them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Go to the Prophet <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam; so they will come to me and I will prostrate beneath the Throne, and it will be said, ‘O Mu<u>h</u>ammad, raise your head and intercede, your intercession will be accepted, and ask and you will be given.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s Side Point: Some of the explainers mention that’s why, the way it’s derived in the Arabic language, is that when somebody has a need, the person who intercedes to help him, it’s as if he makes that first person, he makes him two by going and joining him in his request and going and interceding with the person who can fulfil that request.  (He is one person and you have made him even, <em><u>sh</u>af`</em>). That’s why it’s called <em>a<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>sh</u>afaa`ah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] <em><u>H</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree as <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 1432 and reported by Muslim; it is from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo Moosaa <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The full wording of Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree begins: that the companion Aboo Moosaa <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em> said, “Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam,</em> when a beggar used to come to him, or someone having a need (and) this was transmitted to him, he used to say this, ‘Intercede and you will receive reward…’.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] From a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Alee <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em> who said, “We do not possess anything with us except for the Book of Allaah and this scroll from the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, </em>containing the wording that he said, ‏</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Al-Madeenah is a sacred area between `Aa·ir and such-and-such. Whoever introduces transgression within it, then upon him is the Curse of Allaah and the angels and all of mankind. No obligatory deed and no optional deed will be accepted from him…’<em>” </em>Reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree as <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 1870 and by Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] الشفاعة في أهل الكبائر &#8211; <em>a<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>sh</u>afaa`ah fee ahlil-kabaa·ir</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) said about the <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> about the <em><u>sh</u>afaa`ah</em>, “The <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> about that are <em>mutawaatir</em> (reported by a huge number of people at every level) also. And Ibn Abee `Aa<u>s</u>im, in his book: As-Sunnah, he brings six chapters about this – chapters 163 to 168, and he brings the <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> in that regard numbering <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> number 784 to 832 (about 48-49 <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em>) and the explainer (Ibn Abil-`Izz) in his explanation mentions a good number of them and they include the fact that the intercession of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is of eight (8) different types. So whoever wishes can refer back to that (the explanation of Ibn Abil-`Izz).”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [83]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from that which the people of the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah hold as creed and belief, is what is mentioned in authentic reports from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, from the affairs of the Resurrection and whatever will occur on the Day of Resurrection, from affairs. So, from that is: <em>Al-<u>H</u>aw<u>d</u></em> (الحوض<em> – </em>the great Lake or body of water), since the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed us that there will be for him a <em><u>H</u></em><em>aw<u>d</u></em> (Lake)[1] on the Day of Resurrection at the gathering place (<em>al-Ma<u>hsh</u>ar</em> – المحشر), to which his followers will come – those who had <em>eemaan</em> (truly believed) in him and who followed him. So, they will drink from it and when they have taken a single drink from it, they will never again become thirsty afterwards. And this is because the Day of Resurrection is a day which is severe and difficult and a day of severe heat; so it will result in severe thirst.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, Allaah has made this <em><u>H</u></em><em>aw<u>d</u></em> (great Lake) as a source of relief from thirst for the nation of Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>; and by it, He will bring relief from thirst for them. And as is known, the <em><u>gh</u></em><em>ay<u>th</u></em> (غيث –rainfall) which Allaah sends down from the skies, brings about life for the earth, and it brings about life for the souls. Then likewise, the <em><u>H</u></em><em>aw<u>d</u></em> (Lake) will be a <em><u>gh</u></em><em>iyaa<u>th</u></em> (source of relief from thirst) by which Allaah will relieve the thirst of the servants when they are in the direst need of water.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And ‘<em>A</em><em>l-<u>H</u>aw<u>d</u>’</em> is a place where water is gathered. And he <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam,</em> described it as being a tremendous lake; and that its length is the length of a month’s journey and its width is the width of a month’s journey; and that its drinking vessels would be as numerous as the stars in the sky; and that whoever drinks a single drink from it, then after that he will never ever become thirsty again; and that its water is whiter than milk and sweeter than honey.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he, <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam,</em> informed that some people would come to it, but then they will be pushed away and prevented from drinking from it. So the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> will say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O my Lord, my nation, my nation!”</strong> So then Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic will say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“You do not know what things they innovated after you.”</strong> So then he, `alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam, will say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Be away, far away, those who changed and altered!”</strong> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the people of innovations (<em>Ahlul-Bid`ah</em>) which take people astray will be prevented from coming to it to drink: those who are disobedient to Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, those who disbelieved and turned back upon their heels, those who abandoned the Sunnah, those who went off with their own desires and opinions taking deviated positions – they are the ones who will be prevented from the lake (<em><u>H</u></em><em>aw<u>d</u></em>) of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>because they altered and changed away from the way of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.</em> So no one will go to it to drink except one who was a follower of the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in his sayings and his actions and his creed and belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And some of the people of knowledge, they hold that <em>Al-Kaw<u>th</u>ar</em> (الكوثر – the plentiful river) which is mentioned in His saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We have certainly granted you <em>Al-Kaw<u>th</u>ar</em> (abundant good and a great river)</strong></span><br />
(Sooratul-Kaw<u>th</u>ar (108), <em>aayah </em>1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Some of the scholars hold that this <em>Kaw<u>th</u>ar</em> mentioned in this <em>aayah</em>) is the <em><u>H</u></em><em>aw<u>d</u></em>, whereas some of the people of knowledge, they hold that the meaning of the <em>Kaw<u>th</u>ar</em> is: abundant good. And there is no doubt that the <em><u>H</u></em><em>aw<u>d</u></em> (great Lake) enters within the ‘abundant good’ because this <em><u>H</u></em><em>aw<u>d</u></em> (Lake) is indeed something good for this nation.[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the <em><u>H</u>aw<u>d</u></em> (Lake) of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>; so it is obligatory to have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) in it and to hold it as creed and belief, and that the person adheres to the Sunnah so that he can go on drink from the <em><u>H</u>aw<u>d</u></em> (great Lake) and not be repelled from it on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> End of explanation of point [83][5]<sup>,[6]</sup></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] From Anas ibn Maalik <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu, </em>that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The width of my lake will be like the distance between Aylah and <u>S</u>an`aa· in Yemen and it will have as many drinking cups as the number of the stars in the sky.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree as <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 6580, and by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s Side Point: They mention that Aylah is a little town on the coast, at the top of the Red Sea – the lowest tip where Palestine is.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] From `Abdillaah ibn `Amr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>, who said, “The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘My lake is a wide as a month’s journey, its water is whiter than milk and its smell is better than musk, and its drinking vessels are like the stars in the sky; whoever drinks from it will never ever become thirsty.’”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree as <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 6579, and by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s Side Point:</strong> In [the explanation of] Al-`Aqeedah Al-Wasa<u>t</u>iyyah, we had the point that Shaykh Al-`U<u>th</u>aymeen <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> made about this <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>: there is another <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> where the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> mentioned that the drinking vessels around the <em><u>H</u>aw<u>d</u></em> (Lake), their number would be like the number of stars in the sky. As for this wording here, there is an addition: that the drinking vessels would be ‘like’ the stars in the sky. This shows an additional point &#8211; not only would they be as many as the stars in the sky, but also they will be brilliant like the stars in the sky.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree as <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 6582, 6584 and 7051, and also reported by Muslim. It is from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Anas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] From Sa`eed ibn Jubayr from Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>, that he said about the <em>Kaw<u>th</u>ar,</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“It is the great good which Allaah will give to him.” (The narrator) Aboo Bi<u>sh</u>r said, “So I said to Sa`eed ibn Jubayr: Then, there are some people who claim that it is a river in Paradise.” So Sa`eed said, “The river which is in Paradise is from the good which Allaah will give to him.” </em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><u>H</u>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree as <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 4966 and 6578.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from Anas ibn Maalik <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu </em>who said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“Whilst Allaah’s Messenger <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam was amongst us one day he dozed off briefly, then he raised his head and he was smiling. So we said, ‘What has caused you to laugh, O Messenger of Allaah?’ So he said, ‘Just now a soorah has been sent down to me.’ and he recited sooratul-Kaw<u>th</u>ar.”</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narration in Muslim mentions that he said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Then he said, “Do you know what Al-Kaw<u>th</u>ar is?” So we said, “Allaah and His Messenger know best.” So he said, </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“Then it is a river which my Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, has promised me. Upon it there is abundant good and it is a Lake to which my Ummah will come to drink on the Day of Resurrection.”</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Muslim in the Book of the Prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) made a small point connected to this. He said, “And the <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> which mention the <em><u>H</u></em><em>aw<u>d</u></em> (Lake) are very many, so many that they reach the level of being <em>mutawaatir</em> as was clearly stated by a group of the scholars. These narrations are reported by thirty and odd Companions and Al-<u>H</u>aafi<u>z</u> Ibn Ka<u>th</u>eer he brings their chains of narration in detail in his book: Al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah, at the end of his history (at the end of the book – that which will occur on <em>Yawmul-Qiyaamah</em>). And also, Al-<u>H</u>aafi<u>z</u> Ibn Abee `Aa<u>s</u>im in his Kitaab As-Sunnah, he brings seven whole chapters (chapters 155-161) and <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> numbers: 697-776 (79 <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>) and at the end of them he mentions that they are <em>mutawaatir</em> (reported by a huge number of people at every stage of narration) and he said, ‘The narrations which we have mentioned about the <em><u>H</u>aw<u>d</u></em> (Lake) of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> necessitate certain knowledge.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Translator’s Side Point: Ibn Abil-`Izz, mentions in his explanation about exactly where the <em><u>H</u></em><em>aw<u>d</u></em> would be. He makes it clear that it would be before crossing over the Bridge over Hellfire – the place where the people would be gathered (the <em>Ma<u>hsh</u>ar</em>); that is where the <em><u>H</u></em><em>aw<u>d</u></em> would be. The question may arise: How is that connected to the <em>Kaw<u>th</u>ar</em> (the river in Paradise)? He answers it, and likewise <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-`U<u>th</u>aymeen <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> answers the same point in the explanation of Al-Wasa<u>t</u>iyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-`U<u>th</u>aymeen <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, mentioned nine points that we need to know about the <em><u>H</u>aw<u>d</u></em>, the second of them was that he said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This <em><u>H</u>aw<u>d</u></em> (great Lake) will have water pouring into it through two channels which flow from <em>Al-Kaw<u>th</u>ar</em> (the river in Paradise). The <em>Kaw<u>th</u>ar</em> is the great, tremendous river which the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> will be granted in Paradise. So these two channels of water will flow down into the <em><u>H</u>aw<u>d</u></em> (Lake).</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The evidence for this is two <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Muslim; one from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo <u>Dh</u>arr and one from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of <u>Th</u>awbaan  <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As part of a longer <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>, the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo <u>Dh</u>arr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh </em>contains the wording that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> mentioned about the <em><u>H</u>aw<u>d</u></em> (Lake) and he said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“Two channels of water will flow into it from Paradise.”</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of <u>Th</u>awbaan, it contains the wording:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“One of these channels will be of gold and the other one will be of silver.”</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Both reported by Muslim.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [86][1]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This speech and that which follows it from the speech of the <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>, <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah, </em>all of it refers to the topic of <em>Al-Qa<u>d</u>aa· wal-Qadr</em> (القضاء والقدر – Ordainment and Pre-decree).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in Ordainment and Pre-decree is one of the six pillars of <em>eemaan</em>, just as he, <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Eemaan (true faith) is that you truly believe in Allaah and in His angels and in His Books and in His Messengers and in the Last Day, and that you truly believe in the Pre-decree – the good of it and the bad of it.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the Qur·aan there occurs the saying of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We have created everything with a pre-decreed measure </strong></span><br />
(Sooratul-Qamar (54), <em>aayah </em>49)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">He (Allaah) created everything and gave it a pre-decreed measure</span></strong><br />
(Sooratul-Furqaan (25), <em>aayah </em>2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, there is nothing without a pre-decreed measure, or nothing which randomly occurs, or nothing that just happens unexpectedly; rather, everything which happens, does so in accordance with a pre-decreed measure and having been written.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in <em>Al-Qa<u>d</u>aa· wal-Qadr</em> (Pre-ordainment and Pre-decree) includes four (4) levels and we will abridge them as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Level</strong>: To have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in Allaah’s comprehensive Knowledge (<em>Al-`Ilm</em> &#8211; العلم) which covers everything, and that Allaah has known all things, always. He knew whatever happened and whatever was going to happen and whatever was not going to happen and if it had happened, how it would have been. Nothing whatsoever is hidden from His Knowledge, He, the One free of all imperfections and the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second Level</strong>: (<em>Al-Kitaabah</em>) That Allaah the Majestic and the Most High, He wrote in <em>Al-Law<u>h</u> Al-Ma<u>h</u>foo<u>z</u></em> (The Preserved Tablet) the pre-decreed measures of every created thing, after having known them, He the Perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is the Universal and all-inclusive Writing which covers everything. And there occurs in a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u> </em>(that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>said),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The first thing that Allaah created was the Pen. He said, ‘Write!’ It said, ‘What shall I write?’ He said, ‘Write down whatever will occur until the Day of Resurrection.’” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Pen wrote down whatever was going to happen until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Third Level</strong>: The level of <em>Al-Ma<u>sh</u>ee·ah</em> (Allaah’s Wish and Will). So nothing occurs in this creation except by the Will and Wish of Allaah from that which is in the Preserved Tablet (<em>Al-Law<u>h</u> Al-Ma<u>h</u>foo<u>z</u></em>) and what is within His Knowledge, He the Perfect and Most High. Nothing happens without His Will and nothing occurs within His Sovereignty unless He wills it (if He doesn’t will it, it doesn’t occur), He the Perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah does whatever He wills.</span></strong><br />
(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ajj (22), <em>aayah </em>14)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Likewise, Allaah does whatever He wishes.</span></strong><br />
(Soorah Aal-`Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, everything which occurs in this creation, whether life or death, whether someone being rich or someone being poor, whether someone having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) or being an unbeliever; all of that was in accordance with Allaah’s Wish and Will. He wished the good and He wished the evil. He wished true faith (<em>eemaan</em>) and He wished unbelief (<em>kufr</em>). So, everything enters into His <em>Al-Ma<u>sh</u>ee·ah</em> (His Universal Wish); whatever He wished to occur, occurred; and whatever He did not wish, did not occur.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fourth Level</strong>: The level of creating and bringing into existence (<em>al-<u>kh</u>alq wal-eejaad</em> &#8211; الخلق والإيجاد). So whatever things He wished and willed, then He brought it into existence and created it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah is the Creator of everything and He is a Guardian and Disposer of Affairs over everything.</strong></span><br />
(Sooratuz-Zumar (39), <em>aayah </em>62)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Creating and the Command are His</strong></span><br />
(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> No calamity strikes upon the earth nor in your selves, except that it is written down in a Book before We created it.</strong></span> (Sooratul-<u>H</u>adeed (57), <em>aayah </em>22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proofs of (Allaah’s) Knowledge are very many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from that which Allaah has described Himself with, is <em>Al-`Ilm</em> (العلم &#8211; Knowledge). So He, the One free of all imperfections and the Most High, He knows the number of people who will enter into Paradise and those who will enter into the Fire, and that is in His Eternal Knowledge (He has always known that).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that whatever Allaah, the Most High had decreed, that will not be added to nor will it be decreased. And from that, is that He knows the inhabitants of Paradise and the inhabitants of the Fire, and He knows what they were going to do. We have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in that and we apply ourselves to action. We do not debate concerning Ordainment and Pre-decree, saying “how?” and “why?” and “how can a person be taken to account for something which Allaah pre-decreed?” to the rest of the foolish talk and wastage of time, and raising objections against Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is obligatory upon you, is rather, to perform the acts of obedience and to avoid the sins. It is not the business of a slave to try and investigate the Secret of Allaah, the Mighty and the Majestic, and to dispute with the Lord, the Majestic and Most High. Rather, his business is to act. So therefore, when the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>informed his Companions that there is no one from them except that his place is written down – whether it be in Paradise or it be in the Fire, they said, “O Messenger of Allaah, shall we not then depend upon what is written down for us and leave off actions?” So he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“No, act, for everyone will have that which he was created for, made easy for him.”</strong> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Your deeds are diverse. So whoever spends in Allaah’s cause and fears and is dutiful to Him, and believes in Allaah’s reward, then We will make easy for him, acts which are pleasing to Allaah.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Layl (92), <em>aayaat </em>4-7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the reason here, is from the servant himself (why Allaah will make good deeds easy for the person) – either he is a person who is fortunate or a person who is wretched.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever is miserly, withholding from spending in Allaah’s cause, and thinks himself self-sufficient and does not act in obedience to Allaah, and denies Allaah’s reward, then We will make actions which Allaah hates, easy for him.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Layl (92), <em>aayaat </em>8-10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is required from us, is performing righteous and correct actions and leaving off evil actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for using Pre-ordainment and Pre-decree as an argument, then it is not an excuse because Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, has made the good clear to us, and the evil; so therefore there is no excuse. And the people fall into problems because of their entering into affairs which they are not qualified for. So he says, “If Allaah has written for me that I will enter into Paradise, then I will enter it and if He has written for me that I will enter the Fire then I am going to enter it,” and he doesn’t perform any actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then it is to be said to him: You, yourself don’t apply this saying upon yourself. Do you just sit in your house and leave off seeking provision? And do you say, “If Allaah has written down provision for me, He will make it easy for me.” Or is it that you go out and you strive and you seek for your provision? Even the animals and the birds don’t just sit in their homes; rather, they go out and they seek for their provision. And there occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>, the saying of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“If you truly had reliance upon Allaah, then He would provide for you just as He provides for the birds. They go out hungry and they return with full bellies.”</strong> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah created them (the birds and animals) upon the inborn nature of seeking for provision and of using the necessary means; and they are animals and you are a man will intellect!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also, if someone stole something from you, would you say, “This was just something pre-decreed and ordained,” or would you make a complaint against him? Rather, indeed you would make a complaint against him and you would seek it and you would argue your case; you would not use as an argument Pre-ordainment and Pre-decree!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Footnotes:</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s Side Point: The author, <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, moves on to a few points connected to <em>Qadr</em> (Pre-decree) and we already had something with regard to Pre-decree in the book, that being points number 28-37 where the author, <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He created the creation whilst having full Knowledge (of them). And He decreed fixed limits for them. And He laid down fixed time-spans for them. And nothing was hidden from Him before He created them. And He knew whatever they were going to do, before He created them. And He commanded them to obey Him and He forbade them from disobeying Him. And everything occurs in accordance with His Pre-decree. And His Will is enacted, not the will of the servants except what He wills for them. So whatever He willed for them occurs, and whatever He did not will for them does not occur. He guides whomever He wishes, and protects and keeps safe as a favor upon them; and He misguides whomever He wishes and humiliates and puts to trial from (His) Justice. All of them vary within His Will, between His Favor and His Justice.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] <em><u>H</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree (no. 50) and by Muslim in his Book of <em>Eemaan</em> (no. 10) as the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] This <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> is reported by Aboo Ya`laa from the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and it was declared <em><u>S</u></em><em>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (Authentic) by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee in A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah (no. 133). Also reported by Al-Bayhaqee in his book As-Sunan Al-Kubraa as being <em>mawqoof</em> from (the statement of the Companion) Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>. Also reported by Aboo Daawood and At-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ee from the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Ubaadah ibn A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>aamit <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em> and declared <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (Authentic) by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] <em><u>H</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree (no. 6605) and likewise by Muslim. It is from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Alee <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Reported by A<u>h</u>mad in his Musnad, and by `Abd ibn <u>H</u>umayd, and by At-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ee and Ibn Maajah, and At-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ee said it is <em><u>H</u>asan-<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em>. And it was declared authentic by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> A<u>h</u>mad <u>Sh</u>aakir in his checking of the Musnad. Likewise, it was declared <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah.</em> It is from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s Side Point: This is a <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> that sometimes the Sufis beggars try and use to say that they are not begging but they are depending and relying upon Allaah. But as the scholars say, they are just begging from the people and they try to use this <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> as it mentions, “If only you had reliance upon Allaah, then He would provide for you just as He provides for the birds.” The scholars and explainers say that the last part of this hadeeth is a refutation of them because it mentions that the birds “go out hungry and they return with full bellies.” So, they go out and look for food and when they’ve found it, they come back with their bellies full.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) said regarding this point: “The author <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> is indicating the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Abdullaah ibn `Amr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em> who said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Allaah’s Messenger <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam came out to us and in his hand he had two books and he said, “Do you know what these two books are?” So we said, “No, O Messenger of Allaah, not unless you inform us.”  So he said about the book in his right hand, “This is a book from the Lord of the whole of the creation. It contains the names of the inhabitants of Paradise and the names of their fathers and their tribes, and then their total number is mentioned; it will not be added to and it will not be taken away from, ever.” Then he said about the book in his left hand, “This is a book from the Lord of the whole of the creation, containing the names of the inhabitants of the Fire and the names of their fathers and their tribes, and then He mentioned their total number; so it will not be added to, nor will it be decreased, ever.” So his Companions said, “Then on what basis is there to be any action if the affair has been finished?” So he said, “Strive to act correctly and to be justly balanced because the person of Paradise will have his actions sealed for him with the actions of the people of Paradise, no matter what he may have done; and the person of the Fire will have his actions sealed for him with the actions of the people of the Fire, no matter what he may have done.” Then Allaah’s Messenger <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said motioning with his hands and he threw them (the two books) away. Then he said, “Your Lord has finished with regards to the servants,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>A group in Paradise and another group in the Fire.</strong></span><br />
(Sooratu<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>7)”’</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> was reported by At-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ee and he declared it authentic, and others as well. And I have researched it in my book A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah as <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> no. 848.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, in his checking of At-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ee, <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee declared it <em><u>H</u>asan</em> (good).</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Points discussed in this excerpt include:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in Ordainment and Pre-decree (القضاء والقدر) is one of the six pillars of <em>eemaan</em></li>
<li>There is nothing without a pre-decreed measure, or which randomly occurs, or that just happens unexpectedly</li>
<li>The four (4) levels of <em>eemaan</em> in <em>Al-Qadaa</em><em> wal-Qadr: Al-`Ilm, Al-Kitaabah, Al-Mashee</em><em>·</em><em>ah </em>and <em>Al-<u>Kh</u>alq</em></li>
<li>Obligation upon a person to perform acts of obedience and avoid sins</li>
<li>Pre-ordainment and Pre-decree is not to be used as an argument/excuse</li>
<li>Allaah knows those who will enter the Paradise and the Fire, their total number and their deeds</li>
<li>Everyone will have what he was created for, made easy for him</li>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">            والعرشُ والكرسيُّ حقٌّ.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[Point 117] <strong><span style="color:#008000;">  And the Throne (<em>Al-`Ar<u>sh</u></em>) and the Footstool (<em>Al-Kursee</em>) are true.</span></strong></p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F330334335&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe><br />
—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [117]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, created the heavens and He created the earth, and He created the Footstool (<em>Kursee</em>) and He created the <em>`Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne), all of these are things created by Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. The heavens are above the earth, and above the heavens is <em>al-ba<u>h</u>r</em> (البحر &#8211; the ocean) and above the ocean is the Footstool, and above the Footstool is the <em>`Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne). So that is the highest of all of the created things; and that is as occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That the seven heavens compared to the Kursee (Footstool) are just like seven dirhams (small silver coins) thrown in a shield. [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: the seven heavens and their greatness, and whatever is within them, compared to the Kursee (Footstool) are just like seven dirhams (small silver coins) thrown in the like of a large circle of metal which the fighter uses as a shield. So what are seven dirhams compared to the large circular shield? In comparison, they are very little. In that regard, there is His saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">His (Allaah’s) <em>Kursee</em> (Footstool) extends over the heavens and the earth.</span><br />
</strong> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah 2</em>55)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne) is even greater than the <em>Kursee</em> (Footstool). So the <em>Kursee</em> (Footstool) compared to the <em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne) is just like a ring thrown in a desert, as occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>. So if you were to throw a little ring into a broad, expansive piece of land, what would the size of the ring be compared to the size of that whole desert? Nothing!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These created things are tremendous and extremely vast, (so vast) as is known to none except Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the <em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne) is the highest of all the created things. And Allaah, the Perfect, is High and Exalted above His <em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne), above His creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, the <em>Kursee </em>(Footstool) is beneath the<em> `</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne). And there occurs in a narration that it (the <em>Kursee &#8211; </em>Footstool) is the place of the two Feet.[2] So, the <em>Kursee </em>(Footstool) is something created and it does not mean <em>al-`Ilm</em> (العلم &#8211; Knowledge) as has been attributed to Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>, that he said with regard to the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>His <em>Kursee</em> extends over …</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That he (Ibn `Abbaas) said it means: “His Knowledge;”[3] meaning that His Knowledge extends over the heavens and the earth. This meaning is correct; however, that is not what is meant by the <em>aayah</em>. So, the <em>Kursee </em>(Footstool) is something created whereas <em>al-`Ilm</em> (Allaah’s Knowledge) is an Attribute from the Attributes of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic; it is not from that which He has created. So therefore, it is obligatory to have <em>eemaan </em>(truly believe) in the <em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne) and in the<em> Kursee </em>(Footstool); this being something true upon its true reality. And the <em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne) is not as the <em>A<u>sh</u>`arees</em> say, and whoever proceeds along their way, that the <em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne) means <em>Al-Mulk</em> (الملك &#8211; Kingship or Sovereignty). So they say, with regard to His saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allaah) ascended over the Throne</span><br />
</strong> (Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They (the <em>A<u>sh</u>`arees</em>) say it means: “He gained control over Sovereignty or Kingship.” And this is misguidance. So the Throne (<em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em>) is something created.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And His Throne was above the water</span><br />
</strong> (Soorah-Hood (11), <em>aayah </em>7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, beneath the Throne (<em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em>) is the <em>Kursee </em>(Footstool), and beneath the <em>Kursee </em>(Footstool) is the heavens, and the earth is beneath the heavens. And there occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> (the saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>),</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So if you ask Allaah for Paradise (Jannah), then ask Him for the highest Firdaws because it is the middle part of Paradise and the highest part of Paradise, and above it is the Throne (`Ar<u>sh</u>) of the Most Merciful.” [4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, <em>Al-Firdaws</em> is the highest of the Gardens of Paradise and above it is the Throne (<em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em>) of the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, His Throne (<em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em>) is something created and it has carriers/bearers (حملة – <em><u>h</u>amalah</em>) and they are groups from the Angels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And on that Day (the Day of Resurrection), eight carriers will carry the Throne of your Lord</span> </strong> (Sooratul-<u>H</u>aaqqah (69), <em>aayah </em>17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So before the Day of Resurrection, it will be carried by four (Angels) but when the Day of Resurrection comes they will be doubled and they will become eight. And each one of the Angels (who will carry the Throne) is such that his created form, his tremendous size and his strength cannot be imagined.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And could it be said: if someone says that the Throne means ‘Sovereignty’, could it be said that Sovereignty will be carried by the Angels?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [117][5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Footnotes:</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s Note: Reported as a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> by Ibn Jareer At-Tabaree in his Tafseer, and by others; and verifiers make it clear that its chain of narrations is weak – it is not authentic. Its chain of narrations contains a weak narrator called `Abdur-Ra<u>h</u>maan ibn Zayd ibn Aslam; and its chain of narration is also broken after that. This is pointed out by the verifiers of Kitaab At-Taw<u>h</u>eed such as <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Jaasim ad-Dawsaree in his book An-Nahaj As-Sadeed (النهج السديد) his checking of Kitaab At-Taw<u>h</u>eed. And this point is also made by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> in Silsilah Al-A<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u> A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah (سلسلة الأحاديث الصحيحة) no. 109. So this <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> with this wording is not authentic. An authentic wording will follow <em>in<u>sh</u>aa· Allaah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s Side Point: As for this narration, then it is declared <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (Authentic) by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee and others as a saying of Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa </em>with an authentic chain of narration reported by Al-<u>H</u>aakim and Ibn Abee <u>Sh</u>aybah in his book and <u>S</u>ifatul-Jannah (صفة الجنة) that Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em> stated this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Translator’s Side Point: The verifiers, amongst them <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Muqbil <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, in his checking of Ibn Ka<u>th</u>eer, and other verifiers as well, they make clear that this report from Ibn `Abbaas is not authentic. The reason being, that the narrator from Ibn `Abbaas is quoted as being his student Sa`eed ibn Jubayr, and the narrator from Sa`eed ibn Jubayr is Ja`far ibn Abil-Mu<u>gh</u>eerah, and the verifiers such as Ibn Mandah, they mention this narrator (Ja`far ibn Abil-Mu<u>gh</u>eerah) is weak in his narrations from Sa`eed ibn Jubayr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] This <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> is reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree as <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 2790 and 7423; and it is from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, he said in his notes:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Know that the <em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne) is a very great creation as is proven in the <em>aayaat</em> of the Qur·aan and in the <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.</em> And this is why He, the Most High, attributed it to Himself in His saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah described Himself as being “<strong>the Possessor or the Owner of the Throne</strong>”, and you will find other <em>aayaat</em> (about the Throne) in the explanation (of Ibn Abil-`Izz).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the language, it (<em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em>) means: the throne (seat) of the king. And from its characteristics mentioned in the Qur·aan is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And eight (Angels) will bear the Throne of your Lord on the Day of Resurrection</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>aaqqah (69), <em>aayah </em>17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that it is upon the water. And in the <em>Sunnah</em> there is mentioned that from the Angels who bear the Throne, there is one Angel who, from his earlobe to his shoulder is a distance of seven hundred (700) years (he authenticates it in A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah (no. 151) – a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo Daawood from Jaabir <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em>). And also that it (the <em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em>) has supports, and also that it is the ceiling of <em>Jannatul-Firdaws</em>. That occurs in authentic <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> which are mentioned in the explanation (of Ibn Abil-`Izz). And all of this nullifies the false interpretation that the <em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> means <em>Al-Mulk</em> (Kingship) and extensive Sovereignty!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the <em>Kursee </em>(Footstool) then regarding that is His saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">His Footstool extends over the heavens and the earth</span><br />
</strong> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>255)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>Kursee </em>(Footstool) is in front of the Throne, and it is authentic from Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>, as his saying, that he said, “The <em>Kursee </em>(Footstool) is the place of the two Feet, and the Throne – no one knows its size except Allaah, the Most High.” (Reported by Al-<u>H</u>aakim and Ibn Abee <u>Sh</u>aybah in his book <u>S</u>ifatul-Jannah, and <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee said that it is authentic.)”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee then mentions that he has verified this narration in his book Mu<u>kh</u>ta<u>s</u>ar Al-`Uloo of A<u>dh</u>&#8211;<u>Dh</u>ahabee (مختصر العلو للذهبي), and he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There is nothing authentic from the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> as his saying, except for his saying <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>, (with regard to the <em>Kursee </em>(Footstool)),</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The seven heavens compared to the Footstool are just like a ring thrown into a desert, and the size of the `Ar<u>sh</u> compared to the Footstool is like the size of that desert compared to the size of that ring.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So that nullifies also, the misinterpretation of the Footstool to mean <em>al-`Ilm</em> (Knowledge) and this interpretation is not authentic from Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa, </em>as I have verified in my book A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah (no. 109).”</p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [15]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is from the amazing affairs of His ability, that He causes the creation to die and causes them to pass away so that they are destroyed and become dust and remains – such that an ignorant person would say, ‘It is not possible for these to be restored’. However Allaah the Mighty and Majestic will resurrect them again, and He will restore their creation anew. And He will have no difficulty in doing this, as He the Perfect and Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">The creation of you all, and the resurrection of you all is just like that of a single soul.</span></em> (Soorah Luqmaan (31), <em>aayah </em>28)[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And He (Allaah) it is One who creates initially, and then He repeats it (the creation); and that is even easier for Him.  And for Him is the Highest Description in the heavens and in the earth.  And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.</span></em> (Sooratur-Room (30), <em>aayah </em>27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the people of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>, they denied the resurrection, holding it to be something far-fetched, just as Allaah said about them, (that the unbelieving man would say)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Who will give life to these bones when they are crumbled away?&#8221;</em></span> (Soorah YaaSeen (36), <em>aayah </em>78)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Perfect and Most High, said in response,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em><span style="color:#008000;">Say: “He will give life to them Who created them for the first time!”</span> </em> </strong>(Soorah YaaSeen (36), <em>aayah </em>79)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first time they did not exist at all, so He brought them into existance from nothing, He the Perfect and Most High. So, the One who created them from non-existence, is He not able even more so to bring them back into existence? This is correct in accordance with the people’s intellect but otherwise, analogy cannot be made between Allaah, the Perfect, and His creation.  So this is just stated as a similitude,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And for Him is the Highest Description</span></em> (Sooratur-Room (30), <em>aayah </em>27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this a refutation of the denier, Allaah the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And he forgets his (own) creation</span></em> (Soorah YaaSeen (36), <em>aayah </em>78)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: he forgets that in the beginning he was nothing; he did not exist at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Has there come upon man a time when he was nothing mentioned? </span></em>(Sooratul-Insaan (76), <em>aayah </em>1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: this man, he forgets that Allaah produced him from non-existence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah will indeed gather together these separated bones, shredded flesh, disintigrated dust and these scattered hairs, and He will restore them as they once were:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And from His (Allaah’s) Signs is that the heaven and the earth are established by His Command.  Then, when He calls you with a single call, you will come out from the earth.</em></span> (Sooratur-Room (30), <em>aayah </em>25)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And then the Horn will be blown, and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is upon the earth will faint and die, except whomever Allaah wishes.  And then it will be blown again and they will be standing up, looking on.</span></em> (Sooratuz-Zumar (39), <em>aayah </em>68)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second blowing is the blowing for the resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the first blowing of the horn, it is the blowing for the people to faint and die.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And the Horn will be blown and then the people will come out from their graves going quickly to their Lord.  They (the unbeliever) will say: &#8220;Woe to us! Who has taken us out from our place of sleep?&#8221; (The believer will respond) &#8220;This is what the Most Merciful promised, and the Messengers spoke the truth!&#8221; </span></em>(Soorah YaaSeen (36), <em>aayaat </em>51-52)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah indeed has Power and Ability over everything and this contains a refutation of the unbelievers, those who say that Allaah is unable to give life to the dead and to return them to life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Does man think that We will not gather his bones together? Indeed, We are fully able even to put his fingertips together. </span></em>(Sooratul-Qiyaamah (75), <em>aayaat </em>3-4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">On that Day (the Day of Resurrection) they will come out from the graves, hurrying as if they are racing to a finishing post. </span></em>(Sooratul-Ma`aarij (70), <em>aayah </em>43)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the Power of Allaah, and His Will and His Wish.  Nothing makes Him incapable.  However, it is just that some of the creation, they draw analogy between Allaah and His creation and so therefore they hold that it is far-fetched that there will be any resurrection; because the person thinks in his view, that’s something impossible and he doesn’t look to the Power of Allaah and he doesn’t judge Allaah’s Power as He deserves; and this is a case of ignorance with regard to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [10]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is like the wording which has already preceded: <strong>“<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/05/06/there-is-nothing-like-him-allaah/">And there is nothing like Him</a>.”[1]</strong> And the meaning of <em>al-anaam </em>(الأنام) is ‘the creation’.  So Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, is free of any resemblance to the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/05/17/there-is-nothing-like-unto-him-and-he-is-the-all-hearing-the-all-seeing/"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>There is nothing like Him and He is the All-Hearing the All-Seeing</em></span></a>.</strong> (Sooratu<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And there is no equal for Him</strong>.</span></em> (Sooratul-I<u>kh</u>laa<u>s</u> (112), <em>aayah </em>4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He, the Perfect, is free from resembling His creation.  And even though He has Names and Attributes which correspond to names and attributes of the creation in their wording and in their meaning, however, in their reality and in how they are, there is no resemblance between the two.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [10][2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Point [3] &#8211; Listen @ <a title="Permanent Link to There is nothing like Him (Allaah) – Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|En]" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/05/06/there-is-nothing-like-him-allaah/" rel="bookmark">There is nothing like Him (Allaah) </a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s side point: Ibn Abil-`Izz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, in his explanation, said on this point:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Nu`aym ibn <u>H</u>ammaad</strong> said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">“Whoever declares that Allaah is like anything from his creation then he has committed unbelief, and whoever denies anything from that which Allaah has described Himself with, then he has committed unbelief, and there is not in the attributes which Allaah has mentioned for Himself nor in the attributes which His Messenger mentioned for Him, any resemblance.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, <strong>Is<u>h</u>aaq ibn Raahawayh</strong> said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">“Whoever describes Allaah and declares that His Attributes are like the attributes of anyone from Allaah’s creation then he is a <strong><em>kaafir</em> </strong>(disbeliever) in Allaah, the Tremendous One.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">“The sign of Jahm and his companions is their claim against the people of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> and the lies which they had instigated, that they say, ‘The people of the Sunnah are <em>mu<u>sh</u>abbihah</em> (that they declare Allaah to be like His creation).’ But rather, it is just that they are <em>mu`a<u>tt</u>ilah</em> (deniers of the attributes).”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this was the saying of a great number of the imaams of the <em>Salaf – </em>the sign of the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> is that they call the people of the Sunnah <em>Mu<u>sh</u>abbihah.  </em>Because there are none from the deniers of the Names and Attributes, except that he calls the one who affirms them a <em>Mu<u>sh</u>abbih</em> (one who makes Allaah like the creation).  So whoever denies Allaah’s Names altogether, then they are from the extreme apostates – like the <em>Qaraami<u>t</u>ah</em> (القرامطة) and the philosophers.  And whoever says that it cannot be said about Allaah that He is has knowledge and (it cannot be said, they say, about Allaah) that He has power, claiming that whoever calls Allaah that is a <em>Mu<u>sh</u>abbih.  </em>They say His Names are just metaphorical, like the extreme <em>Jahmiyyah</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [9]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah the One free of all imperfections and the Most High, cannot be encompassed; so Allaah is greater than everything, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">He (Allaah) knows whatever is in front of them and whatever is behind them and they do not comprehend Him with knowledge</span></em> (Soorah <u>T</u>aaHaa (20), <em>aayah </em>110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah the One free of all imperfections, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He is known; however, He is not comprehended and encompassed by that (their knowledge)</strong></span>.  So, Allaah is greater than everything, so thoughts cannot imagine Him and it is not permissible for a person to say about Allaah except what He the Perfect said about Himself or what His Messenger <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> said about Him.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">[27]  {There is nothing like unto Him and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.}</span> </strong><br />
(a<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42) <em>aayah</em> 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F323059041&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe><br />
—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [27]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a negation of <em>tashbeeh</em> &#8211; there being anything like Allaah, the One free of all imperfections. And the <em>kaaf</em> (in <u>ك</u>مثله) is to emphasize the negation, like (as occurs in a different <em>aayah</em>):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">وَكَفَىٰ بِاللَّهِ عَلِيمًا</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em><span style="color:#008000;">…and Allaah is Sufficient as a Knower. </span></em></strong> (Sooratun-Nisaa. (4), <em>aayah </em>70)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In origin (it would usually be said): وكفى الله عليماً but the (extra) <em>baa’</em> (in <u>ب</u>الله) is for emphasis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And nothing whatsoever resembles Him – not the angels, and not the Prophets, and not the Messengers, and not the beloved servants of Allaah, nor any created being.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ البَصِيرُ</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em><span style="color:#008000;">…and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</span></em></strong> (Sooratu<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He called Himself <strong><em>As-Samee’</em> </strong>(the All-Hearing One) <strong><em>Al-Ba<u>s</u>eer</em></strong> (the All-Seeing One).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the beginning of the <em>aayah </em>[1] contains a refutation of the <strong><em>Mu<u>sh</u>abbihah</em> </strong>(those who liken Allaah to the Creation) and the end of it contains a refutation of the <strong><em>Mu`a<u>tt</u>ilah</em></strong> (those who deny Allaah’s Attributes). And it indicates that affirming His Names and Attributes does not necessitate resemblance to the created beings. So the hearing and seeing of the created beings does not resemble the Hearing and Seeing of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/how-a-common-person-from-the-people-of-tawheed-defeated-the-scholar-from-grave-worshippers" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/JJkuhC</a><br />
—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [24]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there is nothing than can possibly do without or be independent of Allaah – no angel, nor any heaven nor any earth, nor anyone from the <em>jinn</em> nor anyone from mankind, nor any inanimate object, whether mountains or oceans; everything is dependent upon Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>O mankind! You are the ones who are needy and dependent upon Allaah.  And Allaah, He is the One who is Independent – the One deserving of all praise.</em></span> (Sooratul-Faa<u>t</u>ir (35), <em>aayah </em>15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So everything is dependent upon Him and not upon the <em>awliyaa</em>.  (beloved servants of Allaah) and not upon the heavens.  And whoever says that the <em>awliyaa</em>.  (beloved servants of Allaah) have power and ability which is different to human power and ability, and whoever says that they have some control over the creation and that they benefit and harm, besides Allaah; then this is the saying of the unbelievers and the <em>mu<u>sh</u>riks</em>.  So the <em>awliyaa</em>.  (beloved servants of Allaah), and the Messengers and the angels, have no independence from Allaah and they cannot do anything without Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this nullifies the worship of everything besides Allaah, whether idols or other things.  How can you worship things that are themselves dependent (upon Allaah) and forget the One in whose Hand is the Ownership and the Mastery of everything?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And for this reason one of the scholars from the grave-worshippers, he said to a common person from the people of <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, “You people say that the <em>awliyaa</em>.  (beloved servants of Allaah), they can’t benefit and they can’t bring harm.” So he said, “Yes, we say that they don’t bring benefit and they don’t bring harm.” So he (the grave-worshipper) said, “Does not Allaah, the Most High, say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Do not consider those who are killed in Allaah’s cause as being dead.  Rather, they are alive, with their Lord, being given provision.”</span></em> (Soorah Aal-`Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>169)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So (this man who is only just a regular person) he responded to him and said, “Did Allaah say <strong><em>yurzaqoon</em> </strong>(يُرْزَقون – they are given provision) or did He say <strong><em>yarzuqoon</em> </strong>(يَرْزُقون – they give provision)?” So the man said, “Rather He said, <strong><em>yurzaqoon</em> </strong>(يُرْزَقون – they are given provision) with a <em><u>d</u>ammah</em> on the <em>yaa’</em>” So (the man who is a common person), he said, “In that case I will ask the One who Provides for them and I will not ask them.” So that person of knowledge was defeated in argument by the evidence of this common person who was upon the correct natural disposition.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>[16]     He has always had His Attributes, before His act of creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F322401664&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/allah-has-always-had-his-attributes-before-his-act-of-creation-sh-fawzan-dawud-burbank" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://goo.gl/GGu3zw</a><br />
—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [16]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying of the author, <strong>“<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/04/24/he-is-the-ancient-one-without-any-beginning-the-one-who-persists-without-any-ending/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ancient One without any beginning</a>”</strong>[1] has already preceded.  So, there was nothing before Him, He the Perfect and Most High.  And the meaning of that is that He has the Attributes of Perfection and His Attributes of Perfection are eternal; they have always existed and they always will.  So just as He is the First without any beginning, then likewise, His Attributes (are the same) since they are along with Him, He the One free of all imperfections.  So, they were always existing, just as Allaah the Perfect and Most High has always existed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not the case that He existed before without any Attributes and then Attributes came about for Him afterwards as the people of misguidance say; those who say, “He did not always have Attributes and then afterwards He came to have them.” They say so in order not to necessitate there being multiple lords deserving worship, as they claim, or multiple divinities in existence who are eternal, such that the Names and Attributes would be partners with Allaah in His Eternity.  So we say, “How free is Allaah of all deficiencies, <em>Sub<u>h</u>aanAllaah!</em>  This (saying) would necessitate that Allaah was deficient &#8211; High and Exalted is Allaah – that He was deficient for a period and then He came to have Attributes and so, became Perfect through those Attributes; High and Exalted is Allaah above what they say.  And the fact that His Attributes are eternal does not necessitate that there are other eternal lords.  Because the attributes are not something other than and outside the one who has those attributes.  Rather, they are meanings found in the one who has the attributes.  And an attribute is not something independent of the one who has the attribute. So if you say for example, “such and such person hears and he sees and he has knowledge of <em>fiqh</em> (he is a jurist) and he is a scholar of the language and he is a scholar of grammar” does it mean that this person has become many people? So having multiple attributes does not necessitate that the ones having the attributes are multiple as the people of misguidance have said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah, the One free of all imperfections and the Most High, His Attributes had no beginning just as His Self (<em><u>Dh</u>aat</em>) had no beginning.  So Allaah has the Attribute of being the Creator <em>(Al-<u>Kh</u>aaliq</em><em>)</em> always and forever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the actions of (Allaah) the Perfect, then they are eternal with regard to their type, newly occurring with regard to actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, He was ‘the One who speaks’ before He actually spoke and He was ‘the Creator’ before He actually created anything and as for His speaking and His creating, then these are actions which newly occur and so on, to the rest of the actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">[17] لم يزدد بكونهم شيئًا، لم يكن قبلهم من صفته.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">[17]  He (Allaah) was not increased in any Attribute which He did not have before, by the creation of the creation.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: His creating the creation.  We do not say that He did not become a Creator except after He created the people.  Rather, Allaah has been the Creator always, forever, without any beginning to that.  And as for His act of creating, then that is an action which occurs newly again and again.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [17] <strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">[18] وكما كان بصفاته أزليًا، كذلك لا يزال عليها أبديًا.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">[18] And just as He has always possessed His Attributes, then likewise, He will always possess them forever.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as He has always has His Attributes forever, meaning: there was no beginning to that; then likewise, His Attributes will remain with Him, He the Perfect, in the future.  So He is Eternal, along with His Attributes; He has no end.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">أنت الآخر فلا بعدك شيء</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“You are the Last One, so there is nothing after You.” </em></span>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the Last One with Your Names and Attributes.  So it is not to be said that these attributes will cease to be with Him in the future; rather, they will always be with Him, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [18] <strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">[19] ليس بعد خلق الخلق استفاد اسم ‏(‏الخالق‏)‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">[19]     He did not acquire the Name ‘The Creator’ after the creation of the creation.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a clarification and a repetition of what has preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> End of explanation of point [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[20] ولا بإحداث البرية استفاد اسم ‏(‏الباري‏)‏.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[20] Nor did He acquire the Name ‘<em>Al-Baaree’</em> (The Maker) after giving existence to the beings.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from the Names of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic is الباري (<em>Al-Baaree</em> – The Maker); meaning: The Creator.  برأ الخلق (<em>bara.a al-khalq</em>) means: He made them.  So, Allaah is <em>Al-Baaree</em> (The Maker of the creation).  And this Name goes along with Allaah’s Self &#8211; it has no beginning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [20]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[21] له معنى الربوبية ولا مربوب، ومعنى الخالق ولا مخلوق‏.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[21] He possessed the meaning of Lordship and Nurturing when there were no slaves, and He had the meaning of being the Creator without there being any creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So likewise, He was the <em>Rabb</em> (Lord and Nurturer) before anything existed for Him to be the Owner and the Master of.  And the meaning of <em>Ar-Rabb</em> (The Lord and Nurturer) is: The Owner and the One who Controls and the One who Rectifies and the Master; and these Attributes are always with His Self – without any beginning and without any end, even before the existence of those things that He is the Lord and Master of, and even after those things which He is the Lord and Master of, pass away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[22] وكما أنه محيي الموتى بعدما أحيا، استحق هذا الاسم قبل إحيائهم، كذلك استحق اسم الخالق قبل إنشائهم‏.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[22] And just as He is the One who is ‘The Giver of life to the dead’ after He gives them life, then He deserves this Name even before He gave life to them; and likewise, He deserves the Name ‘The Creator’ before He created and produced them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So just as He, the Perfect has always possessed the Attribute of being the One who gives life to the dead, and that He gives life and gives death, and this Attribute was never absent (from Him) until He actually gave life to the dead. Rather, it was always His and it always will be His forever.  And as for the action of giving life to the dead, then this is something which occurs newly and repeatedly; Allaah gave life to some and He gives life to some, He the Perfect, whenever He Wishes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[23] ذلك بأنه على كل شيء قدير‏.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[23] That is because He has full Power and Ability over everything.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an eternal Attribute.  It cannot be said that He did not acquire the Attribute of Power and Ability until He created and produced the creation.  Rather, <em>Al-Qudrah</em> (Power and Ability) is an eternal Attribute of His.  Rather, His having produced the creation, this is an effect produced by His being the One who has full Power and Ability.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah is the One who described Himself as being the One who has full Power and Ability over everything – over the things that exist and over the things that do not exist.  And He did not restrict His Power to anything in particular.  Rather, nothing renders Him incapable and it is not permissible to restrict and say that He only has Power over such and such.  And it is not to be said, “Allaah has power over whatever He Wishes.”[3] Because, this saying is particular and restricted to gathering the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And from His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and all the creatures that He spread throughout them.  And He has full Power to gather them when He Wishes.</em></span> (Sooratu<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this was a particular case.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [23][4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Point [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Listen @ the Link : <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/04/24/he-is-the-ancient-one-without-any-beginning-the-one-who-persists-without-any-ending/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://wp.me/p1VJ3-bCO</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] From a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> in Saheeh Muslim where the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, addressing Allaah in a <em>du`aa</em>., <strong><em>“You are the Last One, so there is nothing after You.”</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] This came previously under Point [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Translator’s side point: As a correction of this point, Shay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah, </em>then he criticised this saying here, the saying that you can’t say about Allaah that He has power over what He wishes. Sh al-Albaanee criticised that in his Silsilah &#8230; [break in recording] <strong>“&#8230; <em>Lord of the Creation.  So Allaah will reply, “I am not mocking you but rather I have full ability over whatever I Wish.”</em> ” </strong><em><u>H</u>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Muslim in the book of <em>Eemaan</em>. [187].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After he brought this <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>, Shay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee said: So the saying of Allaah the Most High, at the end of this <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>, <strong><em>“But rather I have full power over whatever I Wish,”</em></strong> this shows the mistake of the one who wrote notes to Al-`Aqeedah A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>ha</u>awiyyah quoting some noble person that, “some people say, ‘Allaah has full power over whatever He Wishes’ and that this saying is not correct.”  I (Shay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee )say: Rather, it is exactly what is correct after its being established in this <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>, especially when it is witnessed to by the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And He (Allaah) has full Power to gather them when He Wishes.</em></span> (Sooratu<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this does not deny that His Wish and His Power and Ability, He the Most High, are general to everything as someone seems to have thought; and Allaah knows best.  [as-Saheehah 6/195, <em><u>H</u>adee<u>th</u> </em>#2601]</p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> The Explanation – Point [42]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are from his attributes <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>خاتم الأنبياء </strong>– <strong>“The last (or seal) of the Prophets.”</strong>  The meaning of “<em><u>kh</u>aatam</em>” (خاتم &#8211; seal) is the one whom no Prophet will come after.  And the <em><u>kh</u>itaam</em> (ختام – seal) of anything is that which is placed upon it as a seal upon it so that nothing can be added to that thing and nothing can be taken away from it.  So Allaah sealed the Messengership with Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.  He the Majestic, in His Highness, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And Mu<u>h</u>ammad is not the father of any of your men; but rather, he is the Messenger of Allaah and the seal (last) of the Prophets.</span></em> (Sooratul-A<u>h</u>zaab (33), <em>aayah </em>40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there is no need for the coming of any Prophet after him because the Qur.aan is present and the Prophetic Sunnah is present and the <em>`ulamaa. ar-rabbaaniyoon</em> (wise scholars who cultivate the people upon the correct way) are present – calling the people to Allaah and giving clarity to the people.  So therefore, the religion of Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> will remain until the establishment of the Last Hour.  It will not be changed, and it will not be abrogated, and it will not be altered because Allaah, the One free from all imperfections, has made it suitable and fitting for every time and every place.  And as for the revealed laws of the previous Prophets, then they were temporary for their nations in particular times and then Allaah abrogated those legislated laws from before, with other legislated laws suitable for other nations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">For every people from you, we made a set of revealed laws and a clear way to proceed upon.</span></em> (Sooratul-Maa.idah (5), <em>aayah </em>48)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>For every revealed Book there is a set time period</em></span> (Sooratur-Ra`d (13), <em>aayah </em>38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, each Book (from the previous Books) has a set time period.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the religion of Islaam is complete.  It does not need any Messenger after Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.  And the scholars are the inheritors of the Prophets.  So whoever holds the belief that there will come after Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> any Prophet, then he is a disbeliever in Allaah, outside the fold of the religion.  And the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed that there were going to come liars, falsely claiming Prophethood after him.  He <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">سيأتي بعدي كذابون ثلاثون، كلهم يدعي أنه نبي، وأنا خاتم الأنبياء لا نبي بعدي</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“There will come after me thirty great liars, each one of them claiming that he is a prophet and I am the last of the Prophets; there is no Prophet after me.”</span></em> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever claims Prophethood, or has Prophethood claimed on his behalf, or whoever follows them, then all of them are unbelievers (<em>kuffaar</em>).  And the Muslims have fought against them and have declared them to be unbelievers.  And the last of those whose followers claimed that he was a Prophet in this present time was that <em>Qaadiyaanee</em>.  And these people (the <em>Qaadiyaanee</em>) are called the <em>A<u>h</u>madees</em> as an ascription to his name because his name was A<u>h</u>mad <em>Al-Qaadiyaanee</em> (أحمد القادياني) and the scholars declared him to be an unbeliever (<em>kaafir</em>) and they repelled him from the lands of Islaam and the declared his followers to be unbelievers since this is a denial of Allaah and of His Messenger.  And their being unbelievers is by consensus of the Muslims; no one disagrees about this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is essential that the Muslim believes that he <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> is the last of the Prophets and Messengers and he is the leader of those having <em>taqwaa</em> (those dutiful to Allaah); meaning, that he is the single example to be followed for those who are obedient and dutiful to Allaah, the Mighty and  Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">There is indeed a fine example for you in Allaah’s Messenger for whoever has hope in Allaah and in the Last Day</span></em>. (Sooratul-A<u>h</u>zaab (33), <em>aayah </em>21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for others besides the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, he is only to be followed if he himself is following the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.  And as for a person who contradicts the Messenger <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> then it is not permissible to follow him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “If you truly love Allaah then follow me, then Allaah will love you and forgive you your sins.” </span></em>(Soorah Aal-`Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there is no way towards Allaah except by following the Messenger <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> and proceeding upon his way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the term: <strong>وسيد المرسلين</strong> – <strong>“And he is the noblest of the Messengers;” </strong>that is him, <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>; he is the noblest of the sons of Aadam just as he <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> said about himself,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏أنا سيد ولد آدم ولا فخر</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“I am the noblest of the sons of Aadam, and that is not boasting.”</span></em> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By the statement, <strong><em>“I am the noblest of the sons of Aadam, and this is not a boast,”</em></strong> he informed his nation of that as part of giving thanks to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and also so that the <em>Ummah</em> (Nation) should give thanks to their Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, for this favour – that He made its Messenger the noblest of the Messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the word “<em>sayyid</em>” (سيد – the noblest) means <em>al-muqaddim</em> (المقدم – the foremost one) and <em>al-imaam</em> (الإمام – the leader).  So he is the best of the Messengers `<em>alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> and he is their <em>imaam</em> (leader) and he is at the head of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the term: <strong>حبيب رب العالمين</strong> – <strong>“the beloved one of the Lord of the whole of creation,”</strong> the term ‘<em><u>h</u>abeeb’</em> (حبيب) is a term which has a point of criticism against it because it is not sufficient to say (that the Messenger `<em>alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> is) ‘<em><u>h</u>abeeb’</em> (the beloved one).  Rather, he is the ‘<em><u>kh</u>aleel</em>’ – the ‘especially close beloved one’ of the Lord of the creation (خليل رب العالمين).  And <em><u>kh</u>ullah</em> (خلة) is more excellent than just <em>ma<u>h</u>abbah</em> (محبة &#8211; love) because <em>al-ma<u>h</u>abbah</em> (love) is of levels and the highest of its levels is <em>al-<u>kh</u>ullah</em> which is the purest love. And no one attained this level except for two men from the creation: Ibraaheem `<em>alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam,</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And Allaah took Ibraaheem as a <u>kh</u>aleel (especially close beloved one)</span></em> (Sooratun-Nisaa.  (4), <em>aayah </em>125)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, our Prophet `<em>alayhi<u>s</u> <u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>, because he himself informed about that saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إن الله اتخذني خليلًا كما اتخذ إبراهيم خليلًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“Allaah took me as an especially close beloved one just as He took Ibraaheem as a <u>kh</u>aleel (an especially close beloved one).” </em></span>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it should not be said about him that he is <em><u>H</u>abeebullaah</em> – a beloved one of Allaah, because this term is suitable for every believer and there is nothing special for the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in it.  But as for being <em><u>kh</u>ullah</em> (an especially beloved one), then no one (from this Ummah) shares with him in that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [42][4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[43] وكل دعوى النبوة بعده فغي وهوى‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[43]     Every claim to Prophethood after him is erroneous and baseless desires.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [43]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This has preceded in the meaning of his being ‘the seal and last of the Prophets’.  So therefore, every claim to Prophethood after him is futile and is unbelief since there will not come any Prophet after our Prophet `<em>alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>.  And as for `Eesaa `<em>alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>, when he descends at the end of time, then it will not be upon the basis that he is a Prophet and a Messenger, nor upon the basis that he is coming with a new revealed Law.  Rather, he will come upon the basis that he is a <em>Mujaddid</em> (مجدد – Reviver) for the religion of the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, </em>on the basis that he is one following the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and he will judge with the Islaamic <em><u>Sh</u>aree</em>`<em>ah</em> (Laws).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] The <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u> </em>is reported by Muslim and is a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Abdillaah ibn Mas`ood <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em>, that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏لو كنت متخذًا من أهل الأرض خليلًا لاتخذت ابن أبي قحافة خليلًا، ولكن صاحبكم خليل الله</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Translator’s Side Point: There is a narration that <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee points out is weak in his notes to A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>h</u>aawiyyah.  It is a <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u> </em>of Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em> and in it is quoted that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> himself said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ألا وأنا حبيب الله ولا فخر</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“I am the <u>H</u>abeeb (beloved one) of Allaah and that’s not boasting.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> mentions that this narration is <em><u>d</u>a`eef</em> (weak), not authentic.  It is weak because it has the narrator Zam`ah ibn <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> and also the narrator Salamah ibn Wahraam.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[118]    </strong><strong>وهُوَ مُسْتَغْنٍ عَنِ العرشِ وما دُونَه.‏‏‏‏</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[118]       And He (Allaah) has no need of the Throne and whatever is beneath it.</strong></p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [118]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not imagine that the meaning of His saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em><span style="color:#339966;"> And then He (Allaah) ascended upon the Throne</span> </em></span> (Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…is that He has need of the Throne just as someone from the creation would mount something from the creation. Rather, Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic ascended upon the Throne and He has no need of the Throne, nor of whatever is beneath the Throne.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of the created beings are in total need of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Allaah holds the heavens and the earth so that they do not fall away from their places; and if they moved away, then none besides Him could hold them. </em></span>(Soorah Faa<u>t</u>ir (35), <em>aayah </em>41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, He (Allaah) holds and supports the Throne and He holds and supports the heavens and He holds and supports the earth and all the created beings by His Power and His Might. So, they are in need of Him and He has no need of them, He the One free of all imperfections and the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the fact that something is above something else does not necessitate that the thing which is higher has need of the thing which is beneath. So the heavens are above the earth, and they are not in need of the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>End of explanation of point [118][1] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[1] Translator’s Side Point:</strong> From <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, he said in his small notes,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The explainer (Ibn Abil-`Izz) <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaahu ta`aalaa</em> said, ‘The <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> (A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>h</u>aawee) <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah,</em> mentioned this speech here having already mentioned the `<em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne) and the <em>Kursee</em> (Footstool); so then afterwards he mentions that He, the Perfect, has no need of the Throne and whatever is beneath the Throne, to make clear that His creating the Throne to ascend over it is not because He had any need of it; rather, for a great wisdom which was necessitated. And the fact that something above is above the thing which is beneath, does not necessitate that the lower thing contains or encompasses or carries the higher thing; nor does it mean that that thing which is higher is in need of that which is lower. So look at the heaven how it is above the earth and yet it is not in need of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Lord, the Most High is far greater and more tremendous than His ‘Highness’ should necessitate this. Rather, Allaah’s being High (His ‘Highness’) results in qualities particular to Him and in His bearing and carrying whatever is beneath, by His Power. And it necessitates the total need of the lower things for Him and the fact that He, the Perfect, has no need whatsoever of what is beneath Him. And it necessitates His encompassing everything, He the Mighty and Majestic. So He is above the Throne and He, by His Power, supports the Throne and its carriers and He has no need of the Throne. And the Throne is in need of Him and He encompasses the Throne and the Throne does not encompass Him; and He confines the Throne and it does not confine Him; and all of these things are not possible for the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And those people who deny <em>al-`uluww</em> (Allaah’s Highness) – the people who deny His Attributes, if they only accepted this detailed explanation, then they would be guided to the correct path, and they would know that intellect is in accordance with the texts and they would be proceeding behind the proof. However, they depart from the proof so they go astray from the correct way. And the affair in that regard is just as Imaam Maalik <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said when he was asked about the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And then He (Allaah) ascended over the Throne</span> </em>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…and other things, (someone asked him), “How did He ascend?’ So Imaam Maalik replied, “<em>Istiwaa</em> (ascending) is known and how is unknown.”’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s Side Point:</strong> Likewise, <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah in Dar· at-Ta`aaru<u>d</u> al-`Aql wan-Naql (درء تعارض العقل والنقل) makes the same point – that it is from Allaah’s tremendous Power that He supports the Throne and whoever is carrying the Throne, and they only support the Throne because of power given to them by Allaah.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[13] خالق بلا حاجة، رازق بلا مؤنة</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[13]    He is the Creator without any need, Provider without any difficulty.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [13]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is the One who created the creation and He has no need of them.  Rather, He created them just so that they should worship Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And I did not create jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me alone. </span></em>(Sooratu<u>dh</u>&#8211;<u>Dh</u>aariyaat (51), <em>aayah</em> 56)[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, He created them not because He had any need of them – that they should aid Him or assist Him or help Him, He the One free from all imperfections, or that they should defend Him.  He only created them so that they should worship Him.  And they (the people) are the ones who need that worship in order to connect themselves to Allaah and to attach themselves to their Lord.  So `<em>ibaadah</em> (worship) is the connection between the person and his Lord.  So it draws him closer to Allaah, and through it he attains reward from Allaah, and recompense.  So, `<em>ibaadah</em> (worship) is a need of the creation and it is not a need of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>If you (people) disbelieve (in Allaah), you and everybody upon the earth, then Allaah is the Independent One who has no need, the One deserving of all praise. </em></span>(Soorah Ibraaheem (14), <em>aayah </em>8)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">If you (people) disbelieve (in Allaah), then Allaah has no need of you. </span></em>(Sooratuz-Zumar (39), <em>aayah </em>7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his (the author’s) saying, <strong>“Allaah is the Provider without any difficulty”</strong>[2] meaning, He is the One who provides all the provision for His servants and that does not diminish what He has with Him.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s side point: Ibn Abil-`Izz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, quotes the next two <em>aayaat</em> which come after this one in Sooratu<u>dh</u>&#8211;<u>Dh</u>aariyaat, <em>aayaat</em> 57 and 58:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">I do not want from them any provision and I do not want that they should feed Me.  Indeed Allaah, He is the great Provider, the One possessing Power, the Strong.</span></em></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Side point: Ibn Abil-`Izz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, quotes from the following <u>h</u>adee<u>th</u> qudsee:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong> The Explanation – Point [89]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And deeds will be in accordance with conclusions</strong>: So a person should not allow himself to be fooled by his own deeds, even if he is the most righteous of the righteous people. Rather, he should fear that he may have an evil end (conclusion). And judgment is not passed upon anyone that he is from the people of the Fire based upon his actions because the person does not know what he will be given as is concluding deeds. And this is clarified by a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Ibn Mas`ood (<em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em>, that the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إن أحدكم يجمع خلقه في بطن أمه أربعين يوماً نطفةً، ثم يكون علقة مثل ذلك، ثم يكون مضغةً مثل ذلك، ثم يرسل إليه الملك، فينفخ فيه الروح، ويؤمر بأربع كلمات‏:‏ بكتب رزقه، وأجله، وعمله، وشقي أو سعيد‏.‏ وإن أحدكم ليعمل بعمل أهل الجنة حتى ما يكون بينه وبينها إلا ذراع، فيسبق عليه الكتاب، فيعمل بعمل أهل النار فيدخلها، وإن أحدكم ليعمل بعلم أهل النار حتى ما يكون بينه وبينها إلا ذراع، فيعمل بعمل أهل الجنة فيدخلها‏</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“The creation of each one of you is brought together in his mother’s womb for forty days as a drop of fluid; then he becomes a clot for a similar period; then a piece of flesh for a similar period; and then the angel is sent to him and the soul is breathed into him.  And he (the angel) is commanded to write four things: to write his provision and his life span and his actions and whether he would be a wretched person (a person of the Hellfire) or a fortunate person (a person of Paradise). And one of you performs the actions of the people of Paradise until there is nothing between him and it except a cubit and then the writing overcomes him and he acts with the actions of the people of the Hellfire and so he enters it.  And one of you may act with the actions of the people of the Fire until there is nothing between him and it except for a cubit (a forearm’s span) and then he acts with the actions of the people of Paradise, and so he enters it.”</span></em> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, therefore, a person fears having an evil end (conclusion). And judgment of having an evil conclusion is not passed upon someone since the person does not know the conclusion that will be given to him, because <em>tawbah</em> (repentance) wipes away whatever came before it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Say to the unbelievers, “If they desist (from their unbelief), then whatever came before will be forgiven for them.”</span></em> (Sooratul-Anfaal (8), <em>aayah </em>38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, actions are in accordance with their conclusions (that which is final from them).  However, from the subtle kindness of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, towards His servants, is that <strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">whoever lives upon good, then He gives him a good conclusion; and whoever lives upon evil, then He gives him an evil conclusion</span></strong>. So therefore, a person should act and apply the necessary means and should have good thoughts concerning Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And some people say, “<strong>I will repent before I die</strong>.” Then we say to him, “<strong>And do you know when you are going to die?</strong>” It is possible that you could die in a sudden moment such that you are not able to repent; and also, you do not know whether your repentance will be acceptable or not because repentance has conditions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) said in his notes to A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>h</u>aawiyyah with regard to this point: “This phrase is part of a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Sahl ibn Sa`ad as-Saa`idee, reported by A<u>h</u>mad and Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree.” He mentions that he has verified it in his checking of the book As-Sunnah of Ibn Abee `Aa<u>s</u>im. The wording of this <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> in Bu<u>kh</u>aaree (no. 6493) is part of a longer <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>; and the relevant wording here is that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إِنَّ الْعَبْدَ لَيَعْمَلُ فِيمَا يَرَى النَّاسُ عَمَلَ أَهْل الْجَنَّةِ، وَإِنَّهُ لَمِنْ أَهْلِ النَّارِ، وَيَعْمَلُ فِيمَا يَرَى النَّاسُ عَمَلَ أَهْل النَّارِ وَهْوَ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، وَإِنَّمَا الأَعْمَالُ بِخَوَاتِيمِهَا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“A servant may act with regard to what the people see with the actions of the people of Paradise, but in reality he is from the people of the Fire; and he may act with regard to what the people see with the actions of the people of the Fire, when he is actually from the people of Paradise. And indeed, actions are in accordance with their conclusions.”</span></em></p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [3]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is taken from the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>There is nothing like Him (Allaah)</em></span> (Sooratu<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also, the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And there is none equal or comparable to Him (Allaah) </em></span>(Sooratul-I<u>kh</u>laa<u>s</u> (112), <em>aayah </em>4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>So do not set up any rivals for Allaah</em></span> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: those who are alike or similar to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Do you know of any namesake for Him (Allaah)?</span> </em>[1] (Soorah Maryam (19), <em>aayah </em>65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: anyone like Him – one who can share His Name, He the Perfect and Most High. So <em>at-tam<u>th</u>eel</em> (التمثيل &#8211; there being anyone like Him) and <em>at-ta<u>sh</u>beeh</em> (التشبيه &#8211; there being anyone resembling Him), both of these are negated for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, no one from His creation resembles Him. So this is what is obligatory – that we affirm whatever Allaah has affirmed for Himself and we hold that as our creed. However, we do not hold that He resembles anyone from His creation nor do we hold that He is like his creation, He, the Perfect and Most High. So this contains a refutation of the <em>mu<u>sh</u>abbihah</em> &#8211; who believe that Allaah is like His creation and (they) do not differentiate between the Creator and the creation; and this is a false and futile position.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And opposite to this position, is the position of the <em>mu`a<u>tt</u>ilah</em> (المعطلة &#8211; those who negate/deny Allaah’s attributes) – those who go beyond limits in declaring Allaah free to such an extent that they deny for Allaah that which He has affirmed for Himself with regards to Names and Attributes. Doing so, as they claim, to flee away from declaring Him to be like His creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, both of these two groups go beyond the limits. The <em>mu`a<u>tt</u>ilah</em> (those who deny His attributes) go beyond limits in <em>tanzeeh</em> (تنزيه &#8211; declaring Him free) and denying any likeness. Whereas, the <em>mu<u>sh</u>abbihah</em> (المشبهة &#8211; those who declare Allaah’s Attributes to be like those of the creation) go beyond the limit in affirmation. Whereas, the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah</em> take the moderate and middle position. So, they affirm for Allaah whatever He affirms for Himself in accordance with what befits His Majesty, without <em>ta<u>sh</u>beeh</em> (declaring His attributes to be like the attributes of the creation) and without <em>ta`<u>t</u>eel</em> (تعطيل &#8211; denying His attributes), doing so in accordance with the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. </span></em>(Sooratu<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying, “<strong>There is nothing like Him</strong>” negates and denies any <em>ta<u>sh</u>beeh</em> (resemblance with the creation) and His saying, “<strong>And He (Allaah) is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing</strong>” is a negation of <em>ta`<u>t</u>eel</em> (denying His attributes). So this is the position which the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> proceed upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, it is said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">الْمُعَطِّلُ يَعْبُدُ عَدَمًا، وَالْمُشَبِّهُ يَعْبُدُ صَنَمًا، وَالْمُوَحِّدُ يَعْبُدُ إِلَـٰهًا وَاحِدًا فَرْدًا صَمَدًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>mu`a<u>tt</u>il</em> (one who negates Allaah’s attributes) worships something which does not exist;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>mu<u>sh</u>abbih</em> (one who declares Allaah’s attributes to be like those of the creation) worships an idol;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>muwa<u>hh</u>id</em> (person upon true <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>) worships the sole One who deserves worship, the One who is Single, the Independent Lord and Master.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>End of explanation of point [3][3]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s side point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> `Abdur-Ra<u>h</u>maan ibn Naa<u>s</u>ir As-Sa`dee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said in the <em>tafseer</em> of this <em>aayah</em> that the <em>aayah</em> is in the form of a question and what is meant is a denial i.e. there is no namesake for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> says regarding this point: “<strong>And there is nothing like Him</strong>”: This is one of the fundamentals from the fundamental principles of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed;</em> which is, that with regard to Allaah the Most High: <strong>there is nothing like Him</strong> – neither in His Self, His Attributes and His Actions. However, the innovators and the people of <em>ta.weel</em> (تأويل &#8211; those who twist Allaah’s Attributes) take it as a principle by which they deny many of Allaah’s Attributes, He, the Exalted and Most High. So whenever their hearts are too constricted to believe in one of His Attributes, He, the Mighty and Majestic, then they perform <em>ta.weel</em> (twist that Attribute) and try and destroy it and deny it. So they deny an Attribute and they use as an evidence for what they are doing His saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him …</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Pretending to be ignorant of the end of the <em>aayah:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">… and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. </span></em>(Sooratu<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this <em>aayah</em> gathers between declaring Him free, along with affirming His Attributes. So whoever wishes to be safe and sound in his creed then he should declare Allaah, the Most High, to be free from any resemblance to the creation, without explaining His Attributes away, and without denying His Attributes. Rather, he should affirm for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, with regard to Attributes, everything which He has affirmed for Himself in His Book or in a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of His Prophet, without declaring that the Creator resembles the creation. This is the position of the <em>Salaf;</em> and the author <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, was upon it following on from Abu <u>H</u>aneefah and the rest of <em>imaams</em>.

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>[1] Translator’s Side Point:</strong></span> <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> says regarding the last phrase “<strong>having no partner</strong>” &#8211; denial of any partner for Allaah the Most High will not be complete except by negating/denying three types of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Firstly</strong></span>: By denying <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> in Allaah’s Lordship; which is to believe that there is another creator along with Allaah, He the Perfect and Most High, as is the belief of the Magians – those who say that evil has a creator besides Allaah the Perfect. And this type of <em><u>sh</u>irk </em>is something very rare in this Ummah and all praise is for Allaah, even though the saying of the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> is very close to it – their saying that evil is the creation of the person; and this fact is indicated by the saying of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">القدرية مجوس هذه الأمة</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>The <em>Qadariyyah</em> are the Magians of this Ummah</strong>…” the <u>h</u>adee<u>th</u>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Secondly</strong></span>: It is <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> with regard to worship; which is, that a person worships someone along with Allaah – someone from the prophets or the righteous such as calling upon them for relief and calling upon them at times of hardship and so on. And this, regretfully, is present a great deal in this Ummah. And the major part of responsibility for it is borne by those <u>sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>s who support this type of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> by giving it the name of <em>tawassul</em> (drawing closer to Allaah) calling it by other than its name!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Thirdly</strong></span>: <em><u>Sh</u>irk</em> with regard to Allaah’s Attributes; which is, that a person describes someone from the creation of Allaah the Most High, with some of the attributes which are particular to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. Such as, claiming that people have knowledge of the hidden and unseen for example; and this type is widespread amongst many of the <u>S</u>oofees and those who are influenced by them.  For example, those who praise the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> with exaggerated praise like the one who said about him in a line of poetry: “From your generosity came about the whole world and whatever it contains and from your knowledge is the knowledge of the Preserved Tablet and the knowledge of everything the Pen has written.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from this has come the misguidance of those <em>dajjaals</em> – those who claim that the see the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> today whilst they are awake and that they ask him about things which are hidden – things about the secrets of the souls of people they associate with. Whereas, the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> did not know such things even when he was alive; rather, he was told to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>If I knew the hidden and unseen then I could have increased greatly in good and harm would not have touched me.</em></span><strong> </strong>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>188)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how could he know that after his death and after he passed on to the highest company of angels?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these three types of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>, whoever negates/denies them from Allaah in his <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of Him and he singles out Allaah in His Self and His worship and His Attributes, then that person is the <em>muwa<u>hh</u>id</em> (the person of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>) who is covered by the virtues particular to the people of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed.</em> And whoever commits something from that <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> then to him is directed the like of the saying of Allaah the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>If you commit shirk then (all of) your deeds will be rendered null and void and you will from the losers.</em></span><strong> </strong>(Sooratuz-Zumar (39), <em>aayah </em>65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So preserve this point because it is the most important thing in `<em>aqeedah</em>. So, there is no surprise in the fact that the author began with it. And whoever wishes to see further details then let him refer back to the explanation of this book and the books of the <u>Sh</u>uyoo<u>kh</u>ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibnul-Qayyim and Ibn `Abdil -Wahhaab and others, and those who followed upon their way.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>[Point #11] <span style="color:#993300;">   He (Allaah) is the Living One who does not die.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F321080818&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [11]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His Life is a complete and perfect life which does not suffer from any deficiency nor any sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah, none has the right to be worshipped except Him, the Ever-Living One, the Independent Sustainer of all.  Neither sleep nor slumber takes hold of Him.</span></em> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>255)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And place reliance upon the Ever-Living One Who does not die.</span></em> (Sooratul-Furqaan (25), <em>aayah </em>58)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, He negates for Himself <em>as-sinah</em> (السِنة – slumber) and that means light sleep and (He negates for Himself) <em>an-nawm</em> (النوم) which is deep sleep.[1] And He negated for Himself <em>al-mawt</em> (الموت – death) because of the completeness and perfection of His Life, He the Perfect and Most High.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And sleep and slumber and death, these are deficiencies in life and these are attributes to be found in the creation; and the life of the creation is deficient because he sleeps and he dies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So sleeping is a part of completeness with regard to the creation but it is a deficiency with regard to the Creator; because a person who cannot sleep they have an affliction affecting their health.  So this shows the difference and the distinction between the Attributes of the Creator and the attributes of the creation.  And as for the two Names: الحي (<em>Al-<u>H</u>ayy</em> &#8211; The Ever-living) and القيوم (<em>Al-Qayyoom</em> –and the independent Sustainer of all), then these are two attributes taken from the statement of Allaah the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah, none has the right to be worshipped except Him, He is the Ever-living, the independent Sustainer of all </span></em>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>255)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>Al-<u>H</u>ayy</em>, the Ever-living means the One who has complete and perfect life and <em>Al-Qayyoom</em> is a word in intensive form.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] From Aboo Moosaa <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh </em>who said: Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> stood amongst us with five sayings; so he said, <strong><em>“Allaah the Mighty and Majestic does not sleep and it is not befitting for Him that He should sleep&#8230;”</em></strong> the hadeeth.  Reported by Muslim in the book of <em>Eemaan.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] From Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa </em>that the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> used to say,</p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [85]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>mee<u>th</u>aaq</em> (ميثاق – covenant) which Allaah, the Most High, took from Aadam and his descendants, that they would worship Him and not associate anything in worship along with Him, this is true. Just as occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed us, that Allaah extracted the descendants of Aadam from his back, and they were like tiny red ants, and He caused them to bear witness upon themselves to His Unity. And He took their <em>mee<u>th</u>aaq</em> (covenant) that they would worship Him, and not associate anything in worship along with Him.[1] So we have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in this. However, this agreement and covenant is not sufficient (in itself). Rather, it was essential along with it, to send the Messengers. So therefore, Allaah sent the Messengers. And if this had been sufficient alone, then Allaah would not have sent the Messengers. However, He sent the Messengers in order to remind by means of them, and to call the people to what is contained in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for His saying, He, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <em><span style="color:#008000;">And remember when your Lord took out from the descendants of Aadam, their offspring.</span></em><br />
(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>172)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the people of <em>Tafseer</em> (explainers of the Qur·aan), they hold that this refers to the agreement and the covenant which Allaah took from the descendants of Aadam; but that is not the case. Rather, it is something else. And Allaah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“From their backs”</strong> and He did not say, “…from the back of Aadam”. And the completion of the <em>aayah</em> is,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And He caused them to witness upon themselves, “Am I not your Lord?” So they said, “Yes indeed!”</span></em><br />
(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>172)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And some of the scholars say the meaning of this is: the <em>fi<u>t</u>rah</em> (الفطرة – the inborn nature) which Allaah created them upon, and the signs within the creation which Allaah set up; so that from them, they should know and be aware of their Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah, the Perfect, created them upon the nature of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and upon Islaam.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And set your face straight upon the Religion, turning away from <u>sh</u>irk, which is the inborn way upon which Allaah created all of the people.</span></em> (Sooratur-Room (30), <em>aayah </em>30)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that (natural inborn way upon which Allaah created the people) is the religion of Islaam and the religion of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed. </em>So, Islaam means: the <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> which the Messengers came with. And that means: worshipping Allaah alone, and associating no partner with Him; and that is the straight and true Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet, along with this, He set up evidences proving His Lordship, from that which they witness in themselves with regard to the amazing way in which they have been created and in the amazing signs which are a proof for the Creator, He the Perfect and Most High. And likewise, He set up for them, in front of them, in the heavens and the earth and in the created beings, that which is a proof for the Creator. For indeed these created things must have a Creator; they could not have just appeared or come about without a Creator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Is it that they were created by nothing, or are they the ones who created? Or did they create the heavens and the earth? No, they do not have certainty.</span></em> (Sooratu<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>oor (52), <em>aayaat </em>35-36)[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">                فيا عجبًا كيف يعصى الإله             أم كيف يجحده الجاحد</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">                وفي كل شيء له آيـــة                     تدل على أنه واحـــد</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">So how amazing – how can the One deserving of all worship be disobeyed</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">                                    Or how can the obstinate denier deny Him</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">                        When every single thing contains an evidence for Him</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Proving that He is One!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So everything in front of you proves the Unity of Allaah and bears witness that He is alone in having created all these created things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Those things which you call upon besides Allaah could never create a fly, even if they gathered together to do it.</span></em> (Sooratul-<u>H</u>ajj (22), <em>aayah </em>73)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Creator is Allaah, the Perfect. No one creates along with Him. So therefore, how can something else besides Him be worshipped, from those things which do not create and do not provide provision, and do not possess the ability to bring benefit for themselves nor harm?! So the meaning of the <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">وَإِذْ أَخَذَ رَبُّكَ</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> (Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>172)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ‘witnessing’ of this <em>aayah</em> refers to the witness of the correct inborn nature, and the witness of the created beings to the Unity of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. And there is no possibility for anyone to have an excuse on the Day of Resurrection, and therefore say,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>We were unaware of this</em></span><br />
(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>172)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, using blind-following of others is not correct in the face of decisive proofs and clear evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [85][4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] From Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa,</em> from the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam,</em> that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“Allaah took the covenant (mee<u>th</u>aaq) from the back of Aadam `alayhis-salaam at Na`maan – meaning `Arafah – so He took out from his backbone every one of his descendants whom He was going to produce, and spread them out in front of Him, then He spoke to them and said, ‘Am I not your Lord?’ So they said, ‘Yes, indeed we bear witness…’ the aayaat until ‘…those who call upon other than Allaah’.”</em></strong> (Sooratul-`Araaf (7), 172-173).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> This <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> is reported by A<u>h</u>mad and Al-<u>H</u>aakim and he declared it authentic, and A<u>dh</u>&#8211;<u>Dh</u>ahabee agreed and Al-Hay<u>th</u>amee said, “Its narrators are those of the <u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>” and its chain of narration was declared authentic by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> A<u>h</u>mad <u>Sh</u>aakir in his checking of the Musnad, and the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> was declared authentic by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee in A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah, no. 1623.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] From Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em>, who said, “The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is no child who is born except that he is born upon the <em>fi<u>t</u>rah</em> (natural way of Islaam). And then his parents turn him into a Jew or a Christian or a Magian. It is just like when an animal gives birth to a baby animal &#8211; do you find it mutilated?’” Then Aboo Hurayrah recited the <em>aayah</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>The natural way upon which Allaah created the people. </em></span><strong><br />
</strong>(Sooratur-Room (30), aayah 30)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> is reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree as <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 1358.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Translator’s Side Point: Regarding these <em>aayaat</em>, the great <em>Mufassir</em>, <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> `Abdur-Ra<u>h</u>maan ibn Naa<u>s</u>ir As-Sa`dee, points out the way in which these <em>aayaat</em> are an evidence (in his <em>Tafseer</em>) and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is evidence upon them, using an affair which does not enable them (those who deny Allaah) to do anything except to submit to the truth, or to depart from what is necessitated by the intellect and the Religion. An explanation of that is to say that those people who deny Allaah’s sole right to worship, and who deny His Messenger, that this necessitates their denying that Allaah created them. And it is confirmed in the intellect, along with the Legislation, that the affair cannot escape one of three affairs: either they were created by nothing, meaning that they have no Creator who created them; rather, they came about not having been brought into existence, and having nothing that brought them into existence; this is something impossible. Or, they are the creators of themselves, and this is also impossible because it cannot be imagined that something has produced itself. So, when these two affairs are nullified and are clearly impossible, then the third matter becomes certain &#8211; that it is Allaah who created them. And when that becomes certain, then it becomes known that Allaah, the Most High, He is therefore, the One alone who deserves to be worshipped and that He is the One for whom worship is right and befitting, and it is not right or befitting for anyone besides Him, He the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Fawzaan <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> takes the view of those who explain the <em>aayah</em> (<strong>And He caused them to witness upon themselves, “Am I not your Lord?” So they said, “Yes indeed!”</strong> – Al-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah</em> 172) to refer to the inborn nature that Allaah has placed in the people, and that it doesn’t refer to the taking out of the souls of the descendants of Aadam from him and their being verbally asked to bear witness. As he indicated, there are some people who held that (view). In that regard, <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah,</em> was one of those who held the other view – that the <em>aayah</em> from Sooratul-A`raaf and the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> and this <em>mee<u>th</u>aaq</em> is one and the same thing. <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee refutes those who disagree with that, and you will find it in A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah, Volume 4, pages 161-162 thereabouts, under <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 1623. Part of what he mentions, is that he says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Al-Anbaaree said, “The position of the people of <em><u>H</u>adee<u>th</u></em> and the major ones from the people of knowledge, hold that this <em>aayah</em> means that Allaah took out the descendants of Aadam from his back and then from the backs of his descendants. And they were in the form of little ants and then He took from them the covenant (<em>mee<u>th</u>aaq</em>) that He is their Creator and that they are created beings. So they bore witness to that and accepted it, and this was after intellect had been given to them which enabled them to understand what was presented to them – just as happened to the mountain when it was addressed – intellect was given to it, and the camel when it prostrated, and the palm tree when it was heard.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as he (Ibn Al-Anbaaree) quoted from Is<u>h</u>aaq ibn Raahawayh, that he said, “The people of knowledge agreed that Allaah created the souls before the bodies and that He caused them to speak and bear witness.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee goes on to explain that there is no contradiction between this <em>aayah</em> from Sooratul-A`raaf and between the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa, </em>and there is no reason that we should take it to be anything except what is apparent from it – that it refers to Allaah extracting the descendants of Aadam from his back and causing them to bear witness to this covenant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, there is also mention by Al-<u>H</u>aafi<u>z</u> Al-<u>H</u>akamee in Ma`aarij Al-Qabool (معارج القبول). He mentioned the same thing as well – that there is no contradiction between these two. And Al-<u>H</u>aafi<u>z</u> Al-<u>H</u>akamee mentioned that the covenants are actually three (3) covenants. The first covenant is when the people were taken from the back of Aadam and they bore witness to His Unity, and to the fact that none has the right to be worshipped besides Him. Then the second covenant that he mentions, is the <em>fi<u>t</u>rah</em> – as was referred to in the <em>aayah</em> from Sooratur-Room. And the third covenant is what the Messengers came with – that Allaah sent the Messengers ordering the people and commanding the people to worship Allaah alone; and that third one is what establishes Allaah’s proof upon the creation. Then Al-<u>H</u>aafi<u>z</u> Al-<u>H</u>akamee said, “So there is no contraction between any of these; rather, they are all confirmed by the Book and the Sunnah.” And he mentioned, “And as for the saying that this <em>aayah</em> from Sooratul-A`raaf refers to the covenant, and that the descendants of Aadam were taken from his back and bore witness, then that was the saying of the great majority of the people of <em>Tafseer</em> (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahumullaah</em>).” Wallaahu A`lam.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F320515358&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe><br />
—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">The Explanation – Point [12]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So the word) <strong>القيوم (<em>Al-Qayyoom</em></strong> – The Independent Sustainer of everything) is: the One who independently exists by Himself and the One who sustains everything; the One who independently exists and has no need of anything; the One who is independent of everything and the One who sustains everything else.  Everything else is in a state of poverty and need of Him and needs to be sustained by Him, He the Perfect and Most High.  So if it were not that Allaah sustains the heavens and the earth and all of the creation then they would all be destroyed and pass away.  But however, Allaah sustains them and guards them and provides for them – giving them whatever would benefit them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the whole of the creation is in need of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Indeed Allaah holds the heavens and the earth so that they do not move away from their places, and if they were to move away from their places, there is no one that could hold them after Him.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sooratul-Faa<u>t</u>ir (35), <em>aayah </em>41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> End of explanation of point [12][1]  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[1] Translator’s side point:</strong> From the explanation of Ibn Abil-`Izz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, he says with regards to these two Names &#8211; <strong><em>Al-<u>H</u>ayy</em></strong> (that Allaah is Ever-living) and <strong><em>Al-Qayyoom</em></strong> (that Allaah is the Independent One who sustains everything):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these two Names, all of the rest of Allaah’s Perfect Names return back and pivot around these two.  And all the meanings of the other Names refer back to these two.  Because the first, <strong><em>Al-<u>H</u>ayaat</em></strong> – the attribute of life, it necessitates for Him all the attributes of perfection; so no attribute will be missing from His attribute of life except due to weakness in that life.  So since the Life of Allaah, the Most High, is the most perfect and complete life, then affirming it means affirmation of every attribute of perfection for Him.  As for the name <em><strong>Al-Qayyoom</strong>,</em> then this includes the perfection of Allaah’s Independence and the perfection of His Power since He is the One who independently exists and has no need of anyone else in any sense; and He is the one Who supports and sustains everything else; and there is no establishment for anything except if He establishes it.  So these two Names gather completely the rest of the Names.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [58] (continued from Lesson 16)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one denies <em>ar-ru.yah</em> (seeing Allaah) except the people of innovation such as the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> and the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> – those who negate the <em>ru.yah</em> (that Allaah will be seen by the believers). They say: This (affirming seeing Allaah) would necessitate that Allaah is in a direction (جهة &#8211; <em>jihah</em>). And it is their view that Allaah is not in a direction; and in their view He is not within the creation, nor is He outside it, nor is He above, nor is He below, nor is He to the right, nor is He to the justify; He is not in any direction. And the meaning of this is that He does not exist, High and Exalted is Allaah above what they say.  So, they deny seeing Allaah because of this futile opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <em>A<u>sh</u>aa`irah</em>, when they were not able to deny the proofs from the Book and the Sunnah then they affirmed seeing Allaah, but they said: He will be seen, but not in any direction. And this is an amazing contradiction! Because, there is nothing that is seen which is not in a direction; and therefore the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> refuted them for this because it is something impossible. Whereas the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em> (the people of the Sunnah), they say: He the Perfect and Most High will be seen and He is in the direction of <em>al-`uloo</em> (العلو – being elevated) and above them. Because the term ‘<em>al-jihah</em>’ (الجهة – direction), if what is meant by it is a direction within the creation, then in that sense Allaah is not in any such direction because Allaah is not incarnate within His creation, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if what is meant by it, is that He is Exalted and above all of the creation then this is something confirmed for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. So, Allaah is indeed Exalted and High above the heavens. So the term ‘<em>al-jihah</em>’ (direction) is neither affirmed nor denied directly in text. However, it can be spoken of with the previous details.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the meaning of <strong>“…without their encompassing Him and without saying how”</strong>: They cannot encompass Allaah the Mighty and Majestic; they will see Him, He the Perfect, but not encompass Him. And Allaah is <em>A<u>z</u>eem</em> (عظيم – Tremendous); it is not possible that He can be encompassed. He the Perfect said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And they do not encompass Him in Knowledge</em></span> (Soorah <u>T</u>aaHaa (20), <em>aayah </em>110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Majestic and Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Sight cannot grasp Him</span></em> (Sooratul-An`aam (6), <em>aayah </em>103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: sight cannot encompass Him; it doesn’t mean that He cannot be seen, because Allaah the Perfect and Most High did not say, “Sight will not see Him (لا تراه الأبصار).” Rather, He said, “<strong>Sight will not grasp Him</strong>.” So, reaching and grasping is something and <em>ar-ru.yah</em> (seeing) is something else. So sight will see Him, He the Perfect, but not encompass Him. So this contains a refutation of those who seek to use this <em>aayah</em> as a proof to deny <em>ar-ru.yah</em> (that Allaah will be seen) – those who say that seeing Allaah is not possible, saying: because Allaah said, “<strong>Sight will not encompass Him.</strong>” So we say to them: You do not know the meaning of:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Sight does not encompass Him; rather, He encompasses all Sight </span></em> (Sooratul-An`aam (6), <em>aayah </em>103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the <em>aayah,</em> “<strong>Sight does not encompass Him; rather, He encompasses all Sight,</strong>” its meaning is: He will not be encompassed by that. It doesn’t mean that He won’t be seen; and He the Perfect did not say: “Sight will not see Him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they also use as evidence, saying: Moosaa <em>`alayhis-salaam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“O my Lord, show me Yourself, let me look upon You.” So He said, “You will not see Me.”</span></em><br />
(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>143)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(They say) this is a proof negating <em>ar-ru&#8217;yah</em> (seeing Allaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we say to them: This refers to this world because Moosaa asked for that in this world and no one will see Allaah in this world – neither any Prophet nor anyone else. But as for in the Hereafter, then the believers will certainly see their Lord. And the conditions in the world are not the same as the conditions in the Hereafter. So the people in this world are weak in their bodies and weak in their senses; they are not able to see Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. But as for in the Hereafter, then Allaah will give them the ability by which they will be able to see their Lord, the Majestic and Most High, (He would give this) as an honour for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, when Moosaa asked his Lord in this <em>aayah</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">He said, “You will not see Me; however, look at the mountain and if it remains in its place then you shall see Me.” So when his Lord manifested Himself to the mountain, He caused it to shatter to dust. </span></em>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>143)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The mountain shattered and turned to dust; and the mountain is inanimate and solid, so how about the created being who is composed of flesh and blood and bones? He is not able to see Allaah in the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this question that Moosaa asked, to see Allaah, is a proof that it is permissible to see Him and possible (to see Him); because Moosaa would not ask his Lord for anything which is not permissible. Rather, he asked Him for something which is permissible; but, it would not occur in this world. So therefore, Allaah the Perfect said, “<strong>You will not see Me,</strong>” and He did not say “I cannot be seen.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah will indeed be seen in the Hereafter,[2] and those who have the most right to this seeing (<em>ar-ru.yah</em>) are the Prophets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, “<strong>And we do not say how this will be</strong>” meaning: it is not to be said, “How will they see Allaah?” because this is just like the rest of the Attributes of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic – we do not know how they are. So, we have <em>eemaan</em> in them (we believe in them) and we know their meaning and we affirm them. However, the <em>kayfiyyah</em> (كيفية– how they are) is unknown; we do not know it. So Allaah knows better about that, He the Perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> End of explanation of point [58] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>[59]     Just as is stated by the Book of our Lord: “On that Day some faces will be radiant, shining, looking at their Lord.” (Sooratul-Qiyaamah (75) <em>aayaat</em> 22-3).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This clearly states that it is looking upon Allaah with sight since the term for ‘looking’ is used with <em>ilaa</em> (إلى – the particle ‘towards’). So its meaning is ‘looking with sight’. Whereas the <em>Mu`tazilah</em>, they say: ﭽ ﭝ  ﭞﭼ <em>‘ilaa’</em> (إلى) here is a plural and it means ‘blessings’; so (they say) it means: ‘they will be looking at the Blessings of their Lord’ and this is foolish delusion which people of intellect would laugh at since a particle doesn’t become plural.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[60] وتَفْسيرُهُ عَلى ما أرادَهُ اللهُ تَعالَى وَعَلِمَه‏‏‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[60]     And its explanation is as Allaah the Most High, wanted and knew.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, the explanation of:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Looking upon their Lord </span></em>(Sooratul-Qiyaamah (75), <em>aayah </em>23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: (its explanation) is just as Allaah the Mighty and Majestic wanted, and that is that it means ‘seeing with sight’. Its explanation is not as the innovators want.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[61] وكلُّ ما جاءَ في ذَلِكَ مِنَ الحديثِ الصَّحيحِ عَنِ الرسولِ صلَّى الله عليه وآله وسلَّم فهو كما قال‏‏‏‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[61]     And every authentic <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> reported from the Messenger, <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa aalihi wa sallam</em> (may Allaah extol him and his true followers and grant him perfect peace and security), then it is just as he said.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: everything reported from the Messenger <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> affirming that Allaah will be seen, then it is true upon its reality – just the same as what occurs in the Qur.aan. It is obligatory that we have <em>eemaan</em> in it because it is the speech of the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>which is <em>wa<u>h</u>y</em> (revelation) from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And he (the Messenger <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) does not speak from his own desires; it is just revelation inspired. </span></em>(Sooratun-Najm (53), <em>aayaat </em>3-4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it (the Sunnah of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) is called ‘the second Revelation’. And the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>informed in many <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> which are <em>mutawaatir</em> (reported by huge numbers of people) that the believers would see their Lord on the Day of Resurrection. So therefore, it is obligatory to have <em>eemaan</em> in that, without <em>ta<u>h</u>reef </em>(تحريف – altering the meaning) and without <em>ta`<u>t</u>eel</em> (تعطيل – negating) and without <em>tam<u>th</u>eel</em> (تمثيل<em> – </em>likening Him to His creation) and without <em>takyeef</em> (تكييف<em> – </em>saying ‘how’).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[62] وَمَعناهُ على ما أرادَ‏‏‏‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[62]     And its meaning is as He intended.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: as the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> intended (when he said it), not as those innovators and deviants intended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> End of explanation of point [62][3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s Side Point: In Shaykh Al-`U<u>th</u>aymeen’s abridgement of Al-<u>H</u>amawiyyah, Talqees Al-<u>H</u>amawiyyah (تلخيص الحموية) of <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah, he mentioned a point right near the beginning, which was: that the people of the Sunnah in affirming Allaah’s Attributes, (first principle:)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">we affirm for Allaah whatever He affirmed for Himself or whatever His Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> affirmed for Him, (second principle:) and we deny/negate for Allaah whatever He negated for Himself or the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>negated for Him. Thirdly, where there is something that is not denied in text, nor is it affirmed in text, from those things which the people disagree about, such as the term ‘a body’ (جسم – <em>j</em><em>ism</em>) or ‘<em>al-<u>h</u>eez</em>’ (being in a place) and ‘<em>al-jihah’</em> (being in a direction) and the like of that, then their way (the people of the Sunnah) is <em>at-tawaqquf</em> – to stop and withhold with regard to its wording. So they don’t affirm its wording and they don’t deny it since it is not reported. And as for its meaning, then we ask for the detail of what is meant by it, and if we find that what is meant by it is something futile and false – something which Allaah is declared free of, then we reject it; and if what is meant by it is something true – something which is not prohibited for Allaah, then we accept it. This is their way and this is the obligatory way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Later on in the book (page 45) he actually goes into detail about <em>al-jihah. </em>He mentioned that the later people brought this term up (<em>al-jihah</em> – direction) and he deals with it in this way i.e. if what they mean is a direction within the creation then we deny that for Allaah and if what they mean by that is that Allaah is above the heavens, then we affirm that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] On the authority of Aboo Moosaa Al-A<u>sh</u>`aree <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em> who said: Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">جَنَّتَانِ مِنْ فِضَّةٍ آنِيَتُهُمَا وَمَا فِيهِمَا وَجَنَّتَانِ مِنْ ذَهَبٍ آنِيَتُهُمَا وَمَا فِيهِمَا وَمَا بَيْنَ الْقَوْمِ وَبَيْنَ أَنْ يَنْظُرُوا إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ إِلَّا رِدَاءُ الْكِبْرِ عَلَى وَجْهِهِ فِي جَنَّةِ عَدْنٍ‏</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;"><em>“There will be two gardens containing silver – their utensils and whatever they contain, and two gardens of gold &#8211; their utensils and whatever they contain, and nothing will be between the people in the eternal garden and their looking upon their Lord, except the cloak of rightful pride upon His Face.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree in the Book of <em>Tafseer</em>, <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 4878 and 4880 and reported by Muslim in the Book of <em>Eemaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> made a fairly small point on this point here. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should know that the <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> reported affirming the believers seeing their Lord on the Day of Resurrection are very many – to the extent that they reach the level of being <em>mutawaatir</em> as has been clearly stated by a group of the <em>imaams</em>. From them, the explainer (Ibn Abil-`Izz), and he mentioned some of them and then he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> about the <em>ru.yah</em> (seeing Allaah) are reported by around thirty companions and whoever acquired comprehensive knowledge of them will state with certainty that the Messenger (<em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) definitely said it and if I had not put it upon myself to write this book in abridged form, then I would quote more of the <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u> </em>here.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said, “The declaration that seeing Allaah the Most High will be like seeing the Sun and the Moon is not <em>ta<u>sh</u>beeh</em> (تشبيه) of Allaah (causing Allaah to resemble His creation). Rather, it is a statement that the ‘act’ of seeing is like ‘that’ act of seeing – not that the One seen is like the thing which is seen. However, it does contain an evidence that Allaah is above His creation; since, can any seeing be comprehended without facing? And as for those people who say, ‘He will be seen, but not in a direction,’ then this person should look back and check his own intellect because either he is opposing obstinately his correct intellect or his intellect has got something wrong with it. Or otherwise a person saying, ‘He will be seen but He will not be in front, He will not be behind, He will not be to the right, He will not be to the justify, He will not be above and He will not be below;’ (then this is not correct) anyone who hears this, whose nature is sound, then he will reject it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say: And as for His, He the Most High, being seen in this world, then the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said in the authentic <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> that none of us will see Him until he dies. <em><u>H</u>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Muslim. And as for him <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>, then there is nothing reported to affirm that he even saw his Lord. Indeed, there is something authentic from him which indicates a denial of this because when he was asked about this he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">نور، أنى أراه</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Meaning:  <span style="color:#339966;"> “Light, how could I see Him”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And along with this, the noble lady `Aa.ishah (<em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhaa</em>) clearly denied this (that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> saw his Lord) as occurs in the two <u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>’s; and that is the basic principle which we cling to.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [58][1]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Ar-ru&#8217;yah</em> (الرؤية – the seeing) means: the believers seeing their Lord, the Perfect and Most High; because the believers will see their Lord, the Perfect and Most High, in the Hereafter. They will see Him openly – with their eyes, just as they see the moon on the night when it is full and just as they see the sun bright and clear when there is no cloud-cover to hide it; just as the chosen Prophet (Al-Mu<u>st</u>afaa) <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed about in the authentic <em>mutawaatir</em> <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> from him, <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>.[2] So therefore, the author said, “The seeing (<em>ar-ru.yah</em>) is true” meaning: it is affirmed by the Book and the Sunnah and the <em>ijmaa`</em> (consensus) of the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> from the <em>Salaf</em> (predecessors) and from the <em><u>Kh</u>alaf</em> (later peoples). Nobody disagrees about that except for the <em>mubtadi`ah</em> (innovators) and the people of the deviant ways.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the believers will see their Lord, the Perfect and Most High, just as He the Perfect said,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">On that Day (the Day of Resurrection) some faces would be radiant, looking at their Lord.<br />
</span></em>(Sooratul-Qiyaamah (75), <em>aayaat </em>22-23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are the faces of the believers. As for (the word in the first <em>aayah</em>) <em>‘naa<u>d</u>irah’</em> (ناضرة &#8211; radiant), meaning: from <em>an-na<u>d</u>rah</em> (النضرة) which means brilliance and beauty.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">You will recognize upon their faces the radiance of bliss.</span></em><br />
(Sooratul-Mu<u>t</u>affifeen (83), <em>aayah </em>24)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for (the second <em>aayah</em>) <em>‘na<u>z</u>irah’</em> (ناظرة) then it means looking with the eyes. You say: <em>“na<u>z</u>artu ilaa ka<u>dh</u>aa”</em> (نظرت إلى كذا) – “I looked upon such and such” when you mean: “I saw it” (أبصرته) – <em>ab<u>s</u>artuh</em>. The term <em>‘an-na<u>z</u>ar’</em> (النظر) has different usages in the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. (Firstly), if it is used with the term ‘<em>ilaa’ </em>(إلى) meaning ‘towards’ or ‘to’ then it means: seeing with the eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Will they not look upon the camels at how they have been created and at the sky and how it has been raised?</span></em>  (Sooratul-<u>Gh</u>aa<u>sh</u>iyah (88), <em>aayaat </em>17-18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Will they not look with their eyes at these amazing parts of the creation which prove the Power and Ability of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. And in this <em>aayah</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Looking at their Lord</span> </em>(Sooratul-Qiyaamah (75), <em>aayaat </em>23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Using the term ‘<em>ilaa’</em> (إلى).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when <em>‘an-na<u>z</u>ar’</em> (النظر) is used on its own without any intermediate particle, then it means: halting and waiting.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">On the Day when the male and female hypocrites will say to those who believe, “Wait for us so that we can acquire some of your light.”</span></em> (Sooratul-<u>H</u>adeed (57), <em>aayah </em>13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Wait for us so we can derive some light from your light; because the hypocrites, their lights will be extinguished, and Allaah’s Refuge is sought; so they will remain in darkness. So therefore, they will seek from the believers to wait for them until they can take some light from their light. And His Saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Do they but await that Allaah should come to them?</span></em> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>210)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: They do not await except the coming of the Lord on the Day of Resurrection, to carry out judgment between His slaves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when <em>‘an-na<u>z</u>ar’</em> (النظر) – ‘looking’ is used with the particle ‘<em>fee’</em> (في) – ‘into’, then it carries the meaning of ‘reflecting and considering’, just as Allaah the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Will they not reflect upon the Dominion of the heavens and the earth.</span></em> (Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>185)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: reflect upon those things created by Allaah in the heavens and upon the earth and take this as a proof for the Power and Ability of Allaah, the Creator, He the Perfect and Most High; and of His being deserving of all worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in summary, <em>‘an-na<u>z</u>ar’</em> (النظر) here is used with the particle ‘<em>ilaa’</em> (إلى) – ‘at’ and its meaning is: (‘looking at’) seeing and seeing with the eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Perfect and Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">For those who did well in the world, there will be the finest reward and an increase.</span> </em>(Soorah Yoonus (10), <em>aayah </em>26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> himself, explained the term <em>‘al-<u>h</u>usnaa’</em> (الحسنى – the finest) to mean Paradise; and he explained <em>‘az-ziyaadah’</em> (الزيادة – the increase) to mean looking at the Honorable Face of Allaah. And this occurs in <u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> Muslim.[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Those who are dutiful to Allaah will have whatever they wished in Paradise and we have something extra for them.</span></em> (Soorah Qaaf (50), <em>aayah </em>35)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<em>Al-mazeed</em>’ (المزيد – something extra): it is looking at the Honorable Face of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said about the unbelievers,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">But no! On that Day the unbelievers will be blocked and screened away from their Lord.</span></em><br />
(Sooratul-Mu<u>t</u>affifeen (83), <em>aayah </em>15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the unbelievers are screened away from Allaah, not seeing Him because they disbelieved in this world, so then they will be screened and prevented from looking upon Him on the Day of Resurrection. And this is the greatest deprivation and the greatest punishment; and Allaah’s Refuge is sought. So the <em>aayah</em> proves that the believers would not be blocked and screened away from Allaah on the Day of Resurrection and that they will indeed look upon Him in the Hereafter; because they believed in Him in this world, not having seen Him. Rather, they took as proof for Him, He the Perfect, His Signs and His Messages (sent to His Messengers). So therefore, Allaah will honour them with looking upon Him on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And looking upon the Face of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, is the greatest bliss in Paradise. This is the position of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah</em> and these are some of their proofs from the Qur.aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for their proofs from the Sunnah then they are very many; indeed they reach the level of <em>mutwaatir</em> (being reported by a very large number of people at every stage of transmission – from the Companions, <em>Taabi`een</em> and every level thereon), as was said by the great scholar Ibnul-Qayyim in his valuable book <em><u>H</u>aadiyul-Arwaa<u>h</u> ilaa Bilaadil-Afraa<u>h</u></em> (حادي الأرواح إلى بلاد الأفراح) and he quoted the <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> reported about seeing Allaah (by the believers on the Day of Resurrection) and that they reach the level of being <em>mutawaatir</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them is his saying <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إنكم سترون ربكم يوم القيامة، كما ترون القمر ليلة البدر، وكما ترون الشمس صحوًا ليس دونـها سحاب، لا تُضامون في رؤيته – أو:‏ لا تَضامُّون في رؤيته</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008080;">“You will certainly see your Lord on the Day of Resurrection, just as you see the Moon on the night when it is full and just as you see the Sun – bright and clear, not being covered over by clouds; and you will not be put to trouble in seeing Him – or you will not have to rush and crowd together to see Him.”</span></em> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: You will not have to scramble and crowd to see Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, because every single one will see the Lord, each person remaining at his place without any crowding or scrambling, just as the people see the Sun and the Moon without having to scramble and crowd. Usually if there is something upon the earth which is hidden, then the people have to scramble to get to see it. However, if it is something raised up like the Sun and the Moon, then they do not have to crowd and scramble to see it; everyone can see it while he still remains at his place. And if this is the case with regard to something created, the Sun and the Moon, then how about the Creator, the Perfect and Most High?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Point [58] to be continued <em>inshaa. Allaah</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s Side Point: In the larger explanation of Ibn Abil-`Izz, Ibn Abil-`Izz said with regard to this point, “This matter is one of the noblest matters from the principles of the religion and from the most tremendous of them. And it is the limit which those people who strive, strive for, and those people who vie, vie for. And those will be deprived, those who are screened away from their Lord; they will be truly deprived – those who are turned away from His Door.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] (One of these <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>) from Jareer ibn `Abdillaah al-Bajalee <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em> who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">كُنَّا عِنْدَ النَّبِيِّ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ فَنَظَرَ إِلَى الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَة يَعْنِي الْبَدْرَ فَقَالَ إِنَّكُمْ سَتَرَوْنَ رَبَّكُمْ كَمَا تَرَوْنَ هَذَا الْقَمَرَ لَا تُضَامُّونَ فِي رُؤْيَتِهِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008080;"><em>“We were the Prophet <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and he looked at the Moon on the night when it was full and he said, ‘You will certainly see your Lord, just as you see this Moon; you will not be put to trouble in seeing Him’.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><u>H</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree as <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 554 and by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s Side Point: Some of the explainers make the point that this <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> affirms seeing Allaah truly and really, just as we truly and really see the Moon and the Sun.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Translator’s Side Point: Ibn Abil-`Izz mentions who they are. He said, “The ones who disagree and differ about seeing, they are the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> and the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> and those who follow them from the <em><u>Kh</u>awaarij</em> and the <em>Imaamiyyah</em> (the <em><u>Sh</u>ee`ah</em>). And their saying is false and futile and it is rejected by the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Muslim reports it as <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 181, in the Book of <em>Eemaan</em> in <u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> Muslim, and also reported by At-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] <em><u>H</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree from a <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em><em>,</em> as <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u> </em>554, 806 and 7434, and also by Muslim who reports it with the wording: تضارون (you will not cause harm to anyone to see Him.)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">[45] وأن القرآن كلام الله‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">[45]    And that the Qur.aan is the Speech of Allaah. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [45]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After you have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) in Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and you have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) in His Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam,</em> then, you have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) that the Qur.aan is the Speech of Allaah; because this is what the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> came with, and Allaah sent down the Qur.aan to him.  And this Qur.aan is not from the speech of Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> nor is it from the speech of Jibreel; rather, it is just the Speech of Allaah, the Mighty and the Majestic.  Allaah spoke with it, and Jibreel took it from Allaah, and the Prophet <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> took it from Jibreel <em>`alahis-salaam</em>, and the Ummah (this nation) took it from the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is the Speech of Allaah; it originated from Him, He the One free of all imperfections.  Jibreel did not take it from <em>Al-Law<u>h</u> Al-Ma<u>h</u>foo<u>z</u></em> (اللوح المحفوظ<em> – </em>the Preserved Tablet) as the people of misguidance say.  And it is not from the speech of Jibreel nor Mu<u>h</u>ammad; rather, it is from the Speech of the Lord of the whole of creation.  And as for Jibreel and Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em>`alayhima<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>, then those two were Messengers who conveyed from Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.  For speech is said by, and attributed to, the one who initially spoke it; not the one who said it only as one conveying and transmitting it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, those who say that Jibreel took it from the Preserved Tablet or who say that Allaah created it within something and then Jibreel took it from that thing, then whoever says this is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) in Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, who has disbelieved with <em>kufr</em> which takes them out of the Religion, as is the saying of the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> and the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> and those who follow their way.  So it (the Qur.aan) is the Speech of Allaah – its letters and its meanings; Allaah spoke with it as He wished.  So, we describe Allaah with the Attribute of His having spoken; and <em>Al-Kalaam</em> (Speech) is from Allaah’s Attributes which are actions (<em><u>s</u>ifaatihil-fi`liyyah</em>).  And the ‘how’ (<em>kayfiyyah</em>) or the manner in which He spoke with it, then in that regard we say, “Allaah knows best about that.” So, this is just like the rest of His Attributes, we have <em>eemaan</em> in them but we do not know how they are.  So the meaning is known but as for ‘how’, then that is unknown to us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>End of explanation of point [45]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">[46] منه بدأ بلا كيفية قولًا، وأنزله على رسوله وحيًا‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">[46]    It originated from Him as something spoken without us knowing how; and He sent it down to His Messenger as revelation.  </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [46]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: that the Qur.aan descended from Allaah; Allaah spoke with it and sent it down.  It did not descend from someone else besides Him, and it did not originate from someone other than Him.  It is not as they say, that it originated from Jibreel or from the Preserved Tablet or from somewhere in mid-air.  Rather, it began from Allaah and Jibreel heard it and he conveyed it to the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> as <em>wa<u>h</u>y</em> (revelation) and the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, he conveyed it to the people.  And if this Qur.aan had been from the speech of humans then someone from the people would have been able to bring a <em>soorah</em> the like of it.  So, since they are unable to do this, then this shows that it is indeed the Speech of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.  He the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And if you are in any doubt about that which We sent down to Our slave (Mu<u>h</u>ammad <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam), then bring a soorah like it and call your witnesses besides Allaah upon that, if you are truthful.  </em></span>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the One free from all imperfections and the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Or do they say, “He forged it”?  Say, “Then bring ten soorahs which are forged like it.” </span></em>(Soorah Hood (11), <em>aayah </em>13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah rendered them incapable of doing that, even though they were Arabs and eloquent in the language.  And the Qur.aan is in the language of the Arabs and is in the letters which they spoke with, and they were eager to oppose the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam;</em> and if it was within their ability to resist and oppose this Qur.aan, they would not have saved any efforts to do so.  So when they were unable to do that, then this shows that it is indeed the Speech of Allaah, which is not approached by falsehood from in front nor from behind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>End of explanation of point [46]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">[47] وصدّقه المؤمنون على ذلك حقًا‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">[47]    And the believers attest to it as being the Truth upon that basis. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [47]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So those who have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) in Allaah and His Messenger, they believe that the Qur.aan is the Speech of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was just one who conveyed (the Message) from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the saying of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed, it is the Speech brought by an honourable Messenger (Jibreel `alayhis-salaam) possessing the strength to do whatever duty he is given; high in status with the Lord of the Tremendous Throne. </span></em>(Sooratut-Takweer (81), <em>aayaat </em>19-20)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is meant by its being ascribed to Jibreel, is from the aspect of conveying<em>;</em> since it is not possible that this Qur.aan is from the Speech of Allaah <em>and</em> from the speech of Jibreel.  Speech does not come except from one; so it is not possible to describe it as being the Speech of more than one.  And its being ascribed to Allaah is <em><u>h</u>aqeeqiyyah</em> (true and real) and as for its being ascribed to Jibreel, then (it is) from the aspect of conveying it (<em>tablee<u>gh</u></em> &#8211; تبليغ).  And in another <em>aayah</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed it is Speech conveyed by an honourable Messenger and it is not the speech of a poet; little it is that you believe.</span> </em>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>aaqqah (69), <em>aayaat </em>40-41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.  So its being ascribed to him is an ascription of conveying (<em>tablee<u>gh</u></em>).  So He, the One free of all imperfections, sometimes ascribes it to Himself, and sometimes to Jibreel and sometimes to Mu<u>h</u>ammad (<em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>).  And one and the same speech cannot have been spoken by more than one.  So therefore, its being ascribed to Allaah is an ascription with regard to its origin and that it is His Speech, and its being ascribed to Jibreel and Mu<u>h</u>ammad is an ascription of conveying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [47] [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[1] Translator’s Side Point:</strong> In his larger explanation, Ibn Abil-`Izz goes into great detail in explaining these points and if you want to see the beauty of the saying of the people of Truth about the Qur.aan being the Speech of Allaah: that it originated from Him, He spoke with it and its Letters and Meanings are from His Speech; then if you read the explanation and his inclusion of eight (8) sayings of the people of deviation, then you will further see the beauty of this speech.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Points discussed in this excerpt include:</strong></span></p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>The Qur.aan is the Speech of Allaah and it originated from Him; it is not created.</li>
<li>One who says that Jibreel took it from the Preserved Tablet has disbelieved with <em>kufr</em> which takes him out of the religion.</li>
<li>It originated from Allaah as something spoken without us knowing how; and He sent it down to His Messenger as revelation.</li>
<li>If the Qur.aan was from the speech of humans then someone would have been able to bring a <em>soorah</em> the like of it. But they cannot; so this shows that it is indeed the Speech of Allaah.</li>
<li>Jibreel and Mu<u>h</u>ammad `<em>alayhimas-salaam</em> were just Messengers who conveyed the Message (Qur.aan) from Allaah.</li>
<li>The same speech cannot have been spoken by more than one.</li>
<li>When Allaah mentions: <strong>“…Speech brought by an honorable Messenger” </strong>and<strong> “…Speech conveyed by an honorable Messenger”</strong>, this ascription to Jibreel and Mu<u>h</u>ammad `<em>alayhimas-salaam</em> is an ascription of conveying and not of having originally spoken with the Speech.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Aqeedah Tahaawiyyah : Point # 8: </strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>[8]</strong> <strong>ولا يكون إلا ما يريد‏.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[8] <span style="color:#000000;"><strong> And nothing occurs except what He (Allaah) wills.</strong></span></p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F319065738&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe><br />
—</p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [8]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This contains an affirmation of <em>al-Qadr </em>(القدر &#8211; pre-decree) and an affirmation of <em>al-Iraadah</em> (الإرادة &#8211; Allaah’s Will).  So nothing exists within His kingdom and nothing occurs within His creation whether events or things except that Allaah willed it to occur, He the Perfect and Most High – willing it with His <em>Iraadah al-Kawniyyah</em> (Universal Will):</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And His Affair, when He wills something, is just that He says to it, &#8220;Be!&#8221; and it is!</span></em><br />
(Soorah YaaSeen (36), <em>aayah </em>82)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, every good and every evil occurs by Allaah’s Universal Will; so nothing escapes from His Will.  And this contains a refutation of the <em>Qadariyyah</em> – those who deny <em>al-Qadr</em> (pre-decree) and who claim that the person himself, he is the one who creates his own actions and produces his own actions; and Highly Exalted is Allaah above that which they say.  Because this (saying of theirs) is a declaration of Allaah’s being unable and (it is a statement) that there are things in His creation which He the Perfect and Most High does not Will.  So this is to describe Him with deficiency because everything which occurs within the creation – whether good or evil, then it occurs by His Will.  Rather, He creates good for a wise purpose and He creates that which is evil for a wise purpose.  So from the aspect of its creation, then it is not an evil because it is created for a tremendous wisdom and a tremendous goal which is to test and to try, and to distinguish that which is foul from that which is good, and in order to reward the people upon their righteous deeds and to recompense the people for their evil deeds.  And He was Wise in that, He, the Perfect and Most High; He did not create anything without purpose.</p>
<p>End of explanation of point [8][1]</p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s side point: Ibn Abil-`Izz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, in his famous explanation of A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>ha</u>awiyyah, says: “<strong>And nothing exists except what He (Allaah) wills</strong>.” This contains a refutation of the saying of the <em>Qadariyyah</em> and the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> because they say, “Allaah willed <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) from all of the people but the unbeliever is the one who willed unbelief for himself.” And this saying of theirs is corrupt and is rejected since it contrary to the Book and the Sunnah and to correct intellect and it is the well-known matter of <em>al-Qadr</em> (pre-decree) and something in explanation of that will follow <em>inshaa Allaahu ta`aalaa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they (these people who deny pre-decree) are called the <em>Qadariyyah</em> because they denied pre-decree; and likewise the <em>Jabariyyah</em> (who say that the people have no free will and are forced to do whatever they do) are also called the people of pre-decree (<em>Qadariyyah</em>).  This name (<em>al-Qadariyyah</em>) is mostly used for the first group (those who deny the pre-decree).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the people of the Sunnah, then they say that even though Allaah willed that sins would occur, however, He does not love them and He is not pleased with them and He did not command them.  Rather, He hates them and is angry with them and He forbade them.  This is the saying of all of the <em>Salaf</em> – those who say, “Whatever Allaah willed occurs and whatever He did not will, does not occur.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[…]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the verifiers from the people of the Sunnah say, “‘Will’ in the Book of Allaah is of two types: Allaah’s Will referring to His pre-decree (His Universal Will – الإرادة الكونية) and His Legislational Will (الإرادة الشرعية) which comprises His Love and His Pleasure.</p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] <strong>Translator’s (Dawud Burbank) Side Point</strong>: As for the lineage of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, he was:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Mu<u>h</u>ammad</strong> (محمد) <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> ibn `<strong>Abdillaah</strong> (عبد الله) ibn `<strong>Abdil-Mu<u>tt</u>alib</strong> (عبد المطلب) [this was a title and his name was <u>Sh</u>aybatul-<u>H</u>amd (شيبة الحمد)] ibn <strong>Haa<u>sh</u>im</strong> (هاشم) [this was a title and his name was `Amr (عمرو)] ibn <strong>`Abd Manaaf</strong> (عبد مناف) ibn <strong>Qu<u>s</u>ay</strong> (قصي) [this was a title and his name was Zayd (زيد)] ibn <strong>Kilaab</strong> (كلاب)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ibn <strong>Murrah</strong> (مرة) ibn <strong>Ka`ab</strong> (كعب) ibn <strong>Lu.ay</strong> (لؤي) ibn <strong><u>Gh</u>aalib</strong> (غالب) ibn <strong>Fihr</strong> (فهر) ibn <strong>Maalik</strong> (مالك) ibn <strong>An-Na<u>d</u>r</strong> (النضر) ibn <strong>Kinaanah</strong> (كنانة) ibn <strong><u>Kh</u>uzaymah</strong> (خزيمة) ibn <strong>Mudrikah</strong> (مدركة) [this was a title and his name was `Amr (عمرو)] ibn <strong>Ilyaas</strong> (إلياس) ibn <strong>Mu<u>d</u>ar</strong> (مضر) ibn <strong>Nizaar</strong> (نزار) ibn <strong>Ma`ad</strong> (معد) ibn <strong>`Adnaan</strong> (عدنان)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This list is taken from the Abridged Seerah of Ibn Ka<u>th</u>eer: <em> </em>الفصول في سيرة الرسول صلى لله عليه وسلم<em>.  </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam An-Nawawee said in Tah<u>dh</u>eeb al-Asmaa. wal-Lu<u>gh</u>aat (تهذيب الأسماء واللغات), “This lineage here, there is consensus of the Ummah of these names here.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree in a chapter heading of his book brings the lineage of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>with these same names here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is by consensus; the lineage of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is preserved, back to `Adnaan.  With regard to the lineage after `Adnaan then there are different sayings.  Some of the scholars withhold and say that they don’t know the lineage in detail any further than that.  Others mention different names with different numbers of names in the list and the verifiers from the scholars say that after `Adnaan, the lineage is not authentic.  All that we know after `Adnaan, is that `Adnaan was a descendent of the Messenger of Allaah, Ismaa.eel <em>`alayhis-salaam,</em> who was the son of the Messenger of Allaah, Ibraaheem <em>`alayhis-salaam,</em> who was the son of Aazar.  And beyond that we don’t know; except that Ibraaheem <em>`alayhis-salaam</em> was a descendent of the Messenger of Allaah, Noo<u>h</u> <em>`alayhis-salaam</em> and that Noo<u>h</u> <em>`alayhis-salaam</em> was a descendent of Aadam <em>`alayhis-salaam.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Aqeedah Tahaawiyyah : Point # 44: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[44]</strong> <strong>وهو المبعوث إلى عامة الجن وكافة الورى بالحق والهدى، وبالنور والضياء‏.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[44]    And he (sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) is the one sent to the whole of the jinn and to all of mankind with the truth and the guidance and with light and radiance.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F319409016&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe><br />
—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [44]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, this is what it is obligatory to hold as our creed and belief with regard to the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.  </em>It is not sufficient that we merely believe that he is Allaah’s Messenger.  Rather, that he is a Messenger to all of mankind; indeed to the jinn and mankind.  He the Most Perfect said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And We have not sent you (as a Messenger) except to the whole of mankind, as a bringer of glad tidings and as a warner </em></span>(Soorah Saba.  (34), <em>aayah </em>28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He also said to him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “O mankind! I am the Messenger of Allaah to all of you.”</span></em> (Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>158)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his Messengership was to all of mankind and this was something particular to him <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>.  So he was a Messenger to all of mankind and obedience to him is obligatory upon the whole of the creation – their Arabs and their non-Arabs, the black of them and the white of them, mankind of them and the jinn of them.  So, everyone whom the call of the Messenger <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> reaches, then it is obligatory upon him to obey him and to follow him.  So whoever agrees that he (Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) is the Messenger of Allaah to the Arabs in particular, as is said by a group of the Christians who say that he was indeed the Messenger of Allaah, but to the Arabs in particular, and they deny that he was a Prophet to anyone else; then this is <em>kufr</em> (disbelieving) in Allaah, the Might and Majestic, and it is a denial of what Allaah the Mighty and Majestic said and a denial of His Messenger.  So, Allaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And We have not sent you except to the whole of mankind, as a bringer of glad tidings and as a warner</span> </em>(Soorah Saba.  (34), <em>aayah </em>28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the One free of all imperfections, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Blessed is the One Who sent down the Criterion (the Qur.aan) upon His slave (Mu<u>h</u>ammad <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) so that he should be a warner to the whole of mankind and jinn</span></em> (Sooratul-Furqaan (25), <em>aayah </em>1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his Messengership is universal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he, <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“A Prophet used to be sent to his own people in particular, whereas I have been sent to the whole of mankind.”</em> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> wrote letters to the kings of the different lands, calling them to Islaam; so this shows that he was a Messenger sent to the whole of the people of the earth.  And he was commanded with fighting <em>jihaad</em> until the people entered into Islaam; so this shows that his Messengership <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> was universal.  So it is obligatory to believe that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory with regard to him (<em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>), to hold these beliefs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: That he (<em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) is the slave of Allaah and His Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: That he is the last of the Prophets; there is no Prophet after him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>: That his Messengership was universal, covering all of mankind and jinn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof that his Messengership was universal to mankind is the <em>aayaat</em> which have preceded[2].  And also the fact that the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>wrote the letters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for his Messengership being universal to the whole of the jinn, then in accordance with the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And (remember) when We sent a group of the jinn to you who listened to the Qur.aan.  So when they attended it, they said (to each other), “Be silent in order to listen!” So when he (<u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) finished reciting, they (the jinn) went back to their people as warners (of Allaah’s punishment upon those who disbelieve).  They said, “O our people! We have heard a Book sent down after (the Book of) Moosaa, confirming the Books which came before it.  It guides to the truth and to the Straight Path.  “O our people, respond to the Messenger of Allaah who calls you to obedience to Allaah.</span></em> (Sooratul-A<u>h</u>qaaf (46), <em>aayaat </em>29-31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “It has been revealed to me that a group of the jinn listened and said, ‘We have heard an amazing Qur.aan; it guides to Right Guidance, so we have believed in it.’” </span></em>(Sooratul-Jinn (72), <em>aayaat </em>1-2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this proves that his Messengership covered the jinn.  So the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was sent to all of the people of the earth – mankind of them and the jinn of them.  So whoever truly believes (has <em>eemaan</em>) in him, then he will enter Paradise and whoever does not truly believe in him will enter the Fire, whether it be from mankind or from the jinn.  And his saying, <strong>“(that he was sent) with light and with radiance;” </strong>these two words (<em>an-noor</em> and <em>a<u>d</u>&#8211;<u>d</u>iyaa</em>.) have the same meaning and the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>was sent with each of these (light and radiance).  Allaah the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">O Prophet! We have sent you as a witness, and as a bringer of good tidings, and as a warner, and as a caller to Allaah by His Permission, and as a shining lamp. </span></em>(Sooratul-A<u>h</u>zaab (33), <em>aayaat </em>45-46)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Points discussed in this excerpt include:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">It does not suffice for us to believe that the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was merely Allaah’s Messenger. Rather, He is a Messenger to all mankind and jinn.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Obedience to him <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>is obligatory upon the whole of the creation as his Messengership is universal.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">It is <em>kufr</em> (disbelief) to believe that he <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>was a Messenger sent only to the Arabs.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory to believe that: (1) he is the slave of Allaah and His Messenger, (2) he is the last of the Prophets and there is no Prophet after him and (3) his Messengership was universal to all mankind and jinn.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Whoever truly believes in him will enter Paradise, and whoever does not, will enter the Fire.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Aqeedah Tahaawiyyah : Point # 7: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> <strong>لا يفنى ولا يبيد‏.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>He does not perish nor (does He) pass away. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F319064019&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [7]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-fanaa. </em>(الفناء &#8211; perishing) and <em>al-beed</em> (البيد &#8211; passing away) have one and the same meaning.[1]  So Allaah, the One free of all imperfections and the Most High has as His Attribute: continual and everlasting life.  Allaah, the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And place reliance upon the Ever-Living One Who does not die.</em></span><br />
(Sooratul-Furqaan (25), <em>aayah </em>58)</p>
<p>So, Allaah never perishes (passes away).  He, the Perfect and Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Everything will perish except for His Face.</em></span><br />
(Sooratul-Qa<u>s</u>a<u>s</u> (28), <em>aayah </em>88)</p>
<p>And He, the Perfect and Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Everyone upon (the earth) will perish (die).  But the Majestic and Noble Face of your Lord will remain forever. </span></em>(Sooratur-Ra<u>h</u>maan (55), <em>aayaat </em>26-27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So for Him, the Perfect and Most High, is <em>Al-Baqaa. </em>(البقاء – persisting and remaining forever) whereas the creation will die and then they will be resurrected.  And initially, they, the creation, were non-existent and then Allaah created them and then they will die and then Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic will raise them in the resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah the One free of all imperfections and the Most High had no beginning and He has no end.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s side point: Ibn Abil-`Izz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, in his explanation of A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>ha</u>awiyyah, makes the point that the second one (<em>al-beed</em> – passing away) is an emphasis of the first one (<em>al-fanaa</em>. – perishing).</p>

<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s Side Point: Ibn Al-Qayyim rahimahullaah in his book Jalaa.ul-Afhaam (جلاء الأفهام) made an important point that with regard to the names of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, that just as we have a principle with regard to the Names of Allaah the Most High, that all of Allaah’s Names have along with them an Attribute (contrary to what some of the Mu`tazilah and the Jahmiyyah and their like say); the same point applies to the names of the Prophet Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam – his names are not just merely names; all his names are also characteristics found in him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s Side Point: Some of the names of the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam are as follows:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>Muhammad</strong> (محمد) sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam – the praiseworthy one and also the one who praises abundantly. Amongst the evidences is the aayah,</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Muhammad is but a Messenger and many Messengers have passed away before him</span></em><br />
(Soorah Aal-`Imraan (3), aayah 144)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise the aayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Muhammad is not the father of any of your men</span></em><br />
(Sooratul-Ahzaab (33), aayah 40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, in Soorah Muhammad (47), aayah 2 and Sooratul-Fath (48), aayah 29 the name Muhammad is mentioned for the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and in many, many ahaadeeth.</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;" start="2">
<li><strong>Ahmad</strong> (أحمد) – the most praiseworthy one. An evidence for that is one aayah in the Qur.aan, in the saying of `Eesaa `alayhis-salaam when he foretold of the coming of a Prophet that would come after him,</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">a Messenger bringing glad tidings, who will come after me; his name will be Ahmad</span></em><br />
(Sooratus-Saff (61), aayah 6)</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;" start="3">
<li><strong>Al-Maahee</strong> (الماحي) – the one who eliminates or wipes away; meaning, the one through whom Allaah wipes away unbelief. The evidence for this name is the hadeeth of Jubayr ibn Mut`im radiyAllaahu `anh.</li>
<li><strong>Al-Haashir</strong> (الحاشر) – the first one to be resurrected and the one after whom the rest of the people would be resurrected. The evidence is the same hadeeth of Jubayr ibn Mut`im radiyAllaahu `anh reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim.</li>
<li><strong>Al-`Aaqib</strong> (العاقب) – the last Prophet. The proof being the same hadeeth.</li>
<li><strong>Al-Muqaffaa</strong> (المقفى) or <strong>Al-Muqaffee</strong> (المقفي) – the one who follows on from the previous Messengers and is the final one of them. The evidence for that is the hadeeth of Aboo Moosaa Al-Ash`aree radiyAllaahu `anh, reported by Muslim.</li>
<li><strong>Nabeeut-Tawbah</strong> (نبي التوبة) – the Prophet of repentance; the one through whom Allaah opened the gate of repentance to His servants. The proof being the same hadeeth of Aboo Moosaa Al-Ash`aree radiyAllaahu `anh.</li>
<li><strong>Nabeeur-Rahmah</strong> (نبي الرحمة) – the Prophet of mercy; the one whom Allaah sent as a mercy to the creation. The evidence is the hadeeth of Aboo Moosaa Al-Ash`aree radiyAllaahu `anh.</li>
<li><strong>Nabeeul-Malhamah</strong> (نبي الملحمة) – the Prophet of slaughter or wars; the one sent to fight against the enemies of Allaah. The evidence of this is the hadeeth of Hudhayfah radiyAllaahu `anh reported by Tirmidhee in his Shil.</li>
<li><strong>An-Nabeeul-Mustafaa</strong> (النبي المصطفى) – the chosen Prophet. The evidence being a hadeeth of `Awf ibn Maalik Al-Ashjaa`ee radiyAllaahu `anh.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Along with these names, some of the scholars mention that Allaah has described the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam with a number of attributes and titles in the Qur.aan.  Amongst the titles given to the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam in the Qur.aan are:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>`Abdullaah</strong> (عبد الله) – the slave of Allaah</li>
<li><strong>`abd</strong> (عبد) – a slave</li>
<li><strong>rasool</strong> (رسول) – a Messenger</li>
<li><strong>nabee</strong> (نبي) – a Prophet</li>
<li><strong>ummee</strong> (أمي) – unlettered</li>
<li><strong>shaahid</strong> (شاهد) – a witness,</li>
<li><strong>mubashshir</strong> (مبشر) – a bringer of glad tidings</li>
<li><strong>nadheer</strong> (نذير) – a warner and a caller to Allaah by His Permission</li>
<li><strong>siraajan muneeraa</strong> (سراجا منيرا) – a shining lamp</li>
<li><strong>ra&#8217;oofan raheemaa</strong> (رؤوفا، رحيما) – compassionate and merciful</li>
<li><strong>mudhakkiran</strong> (مذكّرا) – one who reminded the people of their Lord</li>
<li><strong>rahmah</strong> (رحمة) – a mercy</li>
<li><strong>ni`mah</strong> (نعمة) – a favor</li>
<li><strong>haadee</strong> (هادي) – a guide</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are titles and attributes mentioned in the Qur.aan with regard to the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and other scholars mention many others besides these.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>With regard to the ahaadeeth that were evidences for the names, they are:</strong></span></p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>The hadeeth of Jubayr ibn Mut`im radiyAllaahu `anh who said, “Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said,</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">لي خمسة أسماء: أنا محمد، وأحمد، وأنا الماحي الذي يمحو الله بي الكفر، وأنا الحاشر الذي يحشر الناس على قدمي، وأنا العاقب</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I have five names: I am Muhammad and Ahmad and I am Al-Maahee &#8211; the one through whom Allaah wipes away unbelief, and I am Al-Haashir – the one whom the people will be resurrected after me, and I am Al-`Aaqib – the last Prophet.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Reported by Al-Bukhaaree as hadeeth 3532 and also by Muslim.</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;" start="2">
<li>The hadeeth of Aboo Moosaa Al-Ash`aree radiyAllaahu `anh who said,</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يسمي لنا نفسه أسماء.  فقال: &#8220;أنا محمد، وأحمد، والمقفي، والحاشر، ونبي التوبة، ونبي الرحمة&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam used to call himself different names to us.  So he said, ‘I am Muhammad and Ahmad and Al-Muqaffee (the one who came at the end of all the Prophets before) and Al-Haashir (the first one to be resurrected) and Nabeeut-tawbah (the Prophet of repentance) and Nabeeur-rahmah (the Prophet of mercy).’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Muslim.</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;" start="3">
<li>The hadeeth of Hudhayfah radiyAllaahu `anh who said, “I met the Prophet sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam on one of the paths of Al-Madeenah; so he said,</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">أنا محمد وأنا أحمد وأنا نبي الرحمة ونبي التوبة وأنا المقفي وأنا الحاشر ونبي الملاحم</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I am Muhammad and I am Ahmad and I am the Prophet of mercy and the Prophet of repentance and I am the one who comes last after the other Prophets and I am the one who will be resurrected first and the Prophet of wars or slaughter.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Tirmidhee in his Shamaa.il and declared Hasan (Good) by Shaykh Al-Albaanee.</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;" start="4">
<li>The evidence for the last name, “An-Nabee Al-Mustafaa” (the chosen Prophet) is a slightly longer hadeeth. It is an incident which happened in Al-Madeenah.  Shaykh Al-Albaanee declared the hadeeth authentic (Saheeh) in his checking of Ibn Katheer’s Seerah.  The hadeeth is reported by Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad from `Awf ibn Maalik Al-Ashjaa`ee radiyAllaahu `anh who said,</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam went off one day and I was with him until we entered a church (synagogue) of the Jews in Al-Madeenah on a festival day of theirs and they disliked that we should enter upon them.  So he, sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, said to them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O company of Jews, show me twelve men who bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and then Allaah will remove the anger that He has upon them from every Jew beneath the sky.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they were silent, none of them answered him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he repeated it to them but none of them answered him. So he said, ‘You have refused.  So by Allaah, I am certainly Al-Haashir (the one who will be resurrected first) and I am Al-`Aaqib (the last Prophet), and I am An-Nabeeul-Mustafaa (the chosen Prophet) whether you believe or whether you reject me’.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The companion said, “Then he departed and I was with him until we had almost gone out (of the church of the Jews) when a man said from behind us, ‘Remain where you are O Muhammad.’ So that man said, ‘O company of Jews, what sort of person do you know me to be amongst you?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said, ‘By Allaah, we do not know there to have been any man amongst us who knew the Book of Allaah better than you do, nor anyone having more religious knowledge than you do, nor than your father before you, nor than your grandfather before your father.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, ‘Then I testify in his favor that By Allaah! He is the Prophet of Allaah who you find mentioned in the Tawraat.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then they said, ‘You have lied’ and they rebutted his saying and spoke evil of him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said, ‘You people have lied; your speech will never be accepted.  You have just been praising him as you have done with good, but when he believed then you declared him to be a liar and you said about him what you said.  So you speech will never be accepted.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The companion said, “So the three of us went out – Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, myself and `Abdullaah ibn Salaam (the Jew who just entered into Islaam). No one else from the Jews believed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Most High sent down concerning him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Say, “Do you see, if it is indeed from Allaah and you disbelieve in it, when a witness from Banoo Israa.eel witnesses to the like of it and he believes in it, but you people reject haughtily.&#8221; Then Allaah does not guide an unbelieving, wrongdoing people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sooratul-Ahqaaf (46), aayah 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Al-Albaanee said the hadeeth is Saheeh (authentic).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Aqeedah Tahawiyyah : Point # 6 </strong></span></p>
<p><strong>قديم بلا ابتداء، دائم بلا انتهاء‏.</strong></p>
<p>[6]<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>  He is the Ancient One without any beginning, the One who Persists without any ending.</strong></span></p>
<iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F319057196&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe>
<p><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [6]</strong></span></p>
<p>As is indicated by saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">He (Allaah) is the First and the Last</span></em><br />
(Sooratul-<u>H</u>adeed (57), <em>aayah </em>3)</p>
<p>And his saying <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">‏أَنْتَ الْأَوَّلُ فَلَيْسَ قَبْلَكَ شَيْء، وَأَنْتَ الْآخِرُ فَلَيْسَ بَعْدَكَ شَيْء</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">“<em>You are the First One and there was nothing before You, and You are the Last One and there is nothing after You.</em>”</span>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the word <em>qadeem</em> (قديم – the ancient one) is not applied to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, except in the sense of informing about Him.  As for calling Him with that name, then there is not from His Names “<em>al-qadeem”</em> (the ancient one).  Rather, from His Names is: “<em>Al-Awwal”</em> (الأول &#8211; The First); and the term <em>Al-Awwal</em> (The First) is not the same as saying <em>al-qadeem</em> (the ancient one) because the term <em>al-qadeem</em> (the ancient one) may have someone before Him.  As for the term “<em>Al-Awwal”</em> (The First) then there is nothing before him (one who is first).  As the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">أَنْتَ الْأَوَّلُ فَلَيْسَ قَبْلَكَ شَيْء</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“You are the First One and there was nothing before You.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the author <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah,</em> made a precaution here and he said, <strong>“The Ancient One without any beginning,”</strong> and if he had just said “<strong>The Ancient One</strong>” and remained silent then that would not be correct in meaning.  [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Reported by Muslim in the Book of <em><u>Dh</u>ikr</em> and <em>Du`aa</em>. and <em>Tawbah</em> and <em>Isti<u>gh</u>faar</em>.  It is a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> would recite this <em>du`aa</em>. when he would go to bed (as part of a longer supplication).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s side point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> `Abdul-`Azeez Ibn Baaz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> says about this same point, <strong>“The Ancient One without any beginning”</strong>: The wording <em>qadeem </em>does not occur amongst the Perfect Names of Allaah as the explainer (Ibn Abil-`Izz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) and others explained.  But many of the people of theological rhetoric mention that phrase about Allaah, that He is <em>Qadeem, </em>to affirm that His existence came before everything.  However, the Names of Allaah are <em>tawqeefiyyah – </em>they can only be affirmed with a text from the Noble Book or the authentic Sunnah. It is not permissible to affirm anything from His Names based upon opinion as the <em>imaams</em> of the <em>Salafu<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>aali<u>h</u></em> have stated.  And the word ‘<em>al-qadeem</em>’ (the ancient one), does not indicate the meaning which the people of theological rhetoric intended because the wording ‘<em>al-qadeem</em>’ (that which is ancient) in the Arabic language means that which preceded something else even though it itself did not exist at one time, such as occurs in the saying of Allaah, the Perfect,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Until it returned like the old ancient date stalk<br />
</strong>(Soorah YaaSeen (36), <em>aayah </em>39)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, the correct meaning is only indicated by the addition which the author mentioned, “<strong>The Ancient One without any beginning”</strong> but it is not befitting to count that amongst the Perfect Names of Allaah since it is not established in texts and we are sufficed in that regard by His Name, He the Perfect, <em>‘Al-Awwal’</em> (The First One),</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>He (Allaah) is the First and the Last</strong><br />
(Sooratul-<u>H</u>adeed (57), <em>aayah </em>3)</p>
<p>And Allaah is the One who grants success.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Aqeedah Tahaawiyyah : Point # 5: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> <strong> </strong> <strong>ولا إله غيره‏.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]  <strong>And none besides Him (Allaah) has the right to be worshipped.</strong></p>
<iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F319052606&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong> The Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed al-Uloohiyyah</em> (<em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of Worship).  The phrase ‘<strong><em>Laa ilaaha</em></strong>’ means: <strong>none has the right to be worshipped in truth besides Him</strong>.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for if you were to say (that it means), “<strong>nothing is worshipped except Him (Allaah)</strong>” or “<strong>there is nothing worshipped other than Him (Allaah)</strong>;” then this is <em>baa<u>t</u>il</em> (false and futile) because there are many things which are worshipped beside Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.  So if you say, “<strong>there is nothing worshipped besides Allaah</strong>” then you have made every object which is worshipped to be Allaah.  And this is the position of the people of <strong><em>wa<u>h</u>datul-wujood</em> (وحدة الوجود</strong> &#8211; unity of existence: the people who say that Creator and the creation are one and the same thing).  So the person who says this, if he actually believes that then he is from the people of <em>wa<u>h</u>datul-wujood</em> (unity of existence).  As for if he doesn’t actually believe that, but he only says it, blindly following other people, or he just heard it from someone, then this is an error and it must be corrected.  And some people say this as an opening supplication in the prayer; so one of them says, “<strong>Nothing is worshipped besides You</strong>,” whereas the reality is that Allaah is truly and rightfully worshipped, whereas everything as beside Him is worshipped falsely and without right.  He, the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">That is because Allaah – He is the One Who is worshipped in Truth and whatever they call upon besides Him, is baa<u>t</u>il (false and futile).  And Allaah, He is the Most High, the Most Great.</span></em><br />
(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ajj (22), <em>aayah </em>62)</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [36]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the One free from all imperfections, guides whomever He wishes and He misguides whomever He wishes; and this is by the <em>Qa<u>d</u>aa</em>.  (القضاء – Ordainment) and <em>Qadr</em> (قدر – Pre-decree) of Allaah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>However, He guides those whom He knows are fitting to receive guidance and He guides those who eagerly seek out guidance and who devote themselves to it; then Allaah makes good easy for him.  And He misguides whomever He wishes by reason of that person’s turning away from seeking guidance and good; then Allaah misguides him as a punishment for him for turning away and for his lack of desire for good.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is made clear by His, the Most High, saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>As for the one who gives in charity and is dutiful to Allaah and attests to what is true, then we make easy for him acting in obedience to Allaah. </em></span>(Sooratul-Layl (92), <em>aayaat </em>5-7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the cause is found with the servant, and the Pre-decree is from Allaah, the Perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And as for the one who miserly and thinks himself self-sufficient and denies that which is true, then We make easy for him the path to evil. </em></span>(Sooratul-Layl (92), <em>aayaat </em>8-10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the cause is found with the person, and the Pre-decree is from Allaah, the Mighty and the Majestic.  However, Allaah decreed that for him as a punishment for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah decreed guidance as a favour from Allaah, the Mighty and the Majestic, and He bestowed honour upon the person who wishes and desires guidance and desires good.  Then for him, Allaah makes the good easy and easy for him to perform it.  And this is for the person’s benefit; it is not for the benefit of Allaah, the Mighty and the Majestic.  And as for misguiding of the misguided people, then that is justice from Him, He the Perfect and Most High, and as a recompense for them for their turning away and for their and not turning to good and to obedience to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.  He does not wrong them whatsoever.  And therefore we find in the <em>aayaat</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And Allaah does not guide the people who are transgressors</span></em> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>258)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And Allaah does not guide the unbelieving people</span></em> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>264)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And Allaah does not guide the wicked evil-doers</span></em> (Sooratul-Maa.idah (5), <em>aayah </em>108)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He made wrongdoing and unbelief and wickedness reasons for the absence of guidance.  And these things are actions of the people for which He recompenses them as justice from Him, He the Perfect and Most High, not as injustice or oppression.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And Allaah did not oppress them but rather they wronged their own souls. </span></em>(Sooratun-Na<u>h</u>l (16), <em>aayah </em>33)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not befitting for Him, He the Perfect, that He should bestow honour upon one with those characteristics.  And likewise, it is not befitting upon Him, He the Perfect and Most High, that He should cause the deeds of those who act, to be lost.  He, the One free of all imperfections said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Do those people who commit sins think that they will be made just the same as those who truly believe and perform righteous deeds, in their present lives and after death? Evil is the judgement that they make. </em></span>(Sooratul-Jaa<u>th</u>iyah (45), <em>aayah </em>21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And Allaah created the heavens and the earth in Truth so that He should recompense every soul in accordance with what it earned; and they will not be oppressed.</span></em> (Sooratul-Jaa<u>th</u>iyah (45), <em>aayah </em>22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Shall we make the Muslims just like the criminals? What is it with you – how do you judge?</span></em> (Sooratul-Qalam (68), <em>aayaat </em>35-36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This would be oppression, which Allah is free of.  He, the Perfect and Most High says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Shall we make those who truly believe and work righteous and correct actions, (shall we make them just the same) as those who cause corruption upon the earth, or shall we make those who are dutiful to Allaah just like the wicked folk?</em></span> (Soorah <u>S</u>aad (38), <em>aayah </em>28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah, the Perfect and Most High does not lose the reward of one who works a righteous and correct action, and He does not punish anyone for something which he did not do and for something which he did not earn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>You will not be recompensed except for that which you used to do. </em></span>(Sooratu<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>aaffaat (37), <em>aayah </em>39)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the actions, all of them, whether good or bad, are from the person; and the recompense is from Allaah out of His Favour and Justice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [36][1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Footnotes</span> :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s (Dawud Burbank) side point: Ibn Abil-`Izz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, in his longer explanation, commenting about this point, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This contains a refutation of the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> with regard to their saying that it is obligatory upon Allaah that He must always do what is most beneficial for the person; and this is a question of guidance and misguidance.  So the <em>Mu`tazilah</em>, they say, “Guidance is from Allaah and it means explaining the correct way” and they say, “Misguidance is just calling a person ‘misguided’ and that He, the Most High, judges the person to be upon misguidance when the servant himself creates misguidance for himself.” And this is built upon their false and futile principle – that the actions of the people are created by them.  And the proof for what we have stated is the proof of Allaah, the Most High (addressing the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>You do not guide those whom you love should be guided, but rather Allaah guides whomever He wishes </em></span>(Sooratul-Qa<u>s</u>a<u>s</u> (28), <em>aayah </em>56)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if guidance was just explaining the correct way, it would not be correct for guidance to be denied for the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in this <em>aayah</em> because he showed the correct way to those whom he loved and those whom he hated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And if We wished We would have given every soul its right guidance</em></span><strong> </strong>(Sooratul-Sajdah (32), <em>aayah </em>13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah misguides whomever He wishes and He guides whomever He wishes</span></em><strong> </strong>(Sooratul-Muda<u>thth</u>ir (74), <em>aayah </em>31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if guidance from Allaah just meant showing the correct way, which is general to every soul, it would not be correct to restrict that by His Will.  And likewise, He the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And if it were not for the Favour of my Lord I would have been one of those brought to the Hellfire</span></em><strong> </strong>(Sooratu<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>aaffaat (37), <em>aayah </em>57)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Whomever Allaah wishes, He misguides him, and whomever He wishes, He places him upon a straight path</em></span> </strong>(Sooratul-An`aam (6), <em>aayah </em>39)</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Read the Text (Posted from above PDF):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great scholar, Hujjatul- Islaam, Aboo Ja’far al- Waraaq at-Tahaawee, in Egypt, may Allaah have mercy upon him, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>1. This is a mention of an explanation of the ‘Aqeedah (Creed and Belief), of the Ahul-Sunnah walJamaa’ah upon the way of the jurists of the Religion: Aboo Haneefah an-Nu’maan ibn Thaabit al-Koofee, and Aboo Yoosuf Ya’qoob ibn Ibraaheem al-Ansaaree, and Aboo ‘Abdillaah Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ash-Shaybaanee- may Allaah be pleased withthem all, and what they held as their Creed from the fundamentals of the Religion and what they held asReligion in obedience to the Lord of the creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>2. We say with regard to Tawheed of Allaah, holding as our Creed and Belief- due to the guidance to correctness granted by Allaah: that Allaah is One, having no partner.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>3. And there is nothing like Him.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>4. And nothing renders Him incapable;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>5. And nothing besides Him has the right to be worshipped.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>6. Ancient without any beginning, remaining forever without any end.*</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>7. He does not perish, nor pass away.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>8. Nothing occurs except what He wills.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>9. He is not reached by people’s conjecture nor can He be grasped by their understanding.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>10. He does not resemble the creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>11. Ever-Living, He does not die.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>12. The Independent Sustainer of everything Who does not sleep.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>13. Creator without any need. Provider without anydifficulty.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>14. Giver of death without any fear.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>15. The One who resurrects without any exertion.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>16. He has always had His attributes from before His act of creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>17. He was not increased in anything by their being brought into existence which was not already His attribute.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>18. And just as He has always possessed His attributes,then likewise He will always possess them forever.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>19. He did not acquire the name ‘al-Khaaliq’ (TheCreator) after the creation of the creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>20. Nor did He acquire the name ‘al-Baaree’ (TheOriginator and Maker) after bringing forth the beings.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>21. He possessed the meaning of ‘ruboobiyyah’(Lordship and Nurturing) even when there were no slaves under His Lordship, and the meaning of being the Creator even when there was no creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>22. And just as He is the One who is the Giver of life to the dead – after He gives them life, then He deservedthis name before He gave life to them; likewise He deserved the name ‘The Creator’ (al- Khaaliq) before He created and produced them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>23. This is because He has full power and ability overeverything.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>24. And everything is totally dependent upon Him.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>25. And every affair is easy for Him.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>26. He has no need of anything.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>27.[Meaning: There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All- Hearing, the All- Seeing.]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>28. He created the creation whilst having full Knowledge (of them).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>29. And He decreed fixed limits for them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>30. And He laid down fixed time-spans for them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>31. And nothing was hidden from Him before He created them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>32. And He knew whatever they were going to do, before He created them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>33. And He commanded them to obey Him, and He forbade them from disobeying Him.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>34. And everything occurs in accordance with His pre- decree.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>35. And His Will is enacted, not the will of His servants-except what He wills for them, so whatever He willed for them occurs, and whatever he did not will for them does not occur.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>36. He guides whoever He wishes, and protects and keeps safe as a favour (fadl) upon them; and He misguides whoever He wishes, and humiliates,1 and puts to trial from (His) Justice (‘adl).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>37. All of them vary within His Will (Mashee.ah), between His Favour and His Justice.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>38. He is Supreme and Exalted – High above having any opposites or rivals.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>39. None can repel His Decree and none can delay His Judgement and none can overcome His commands.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>40. We have Eemaan in all of that, and we are certain that everything comes from Him.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>41. And that Muhammad ( صلى الله عليه وسلم) is His chosen slave, His selected Prophet and HisMessenger with whom He is pleased.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>42. He is the last of the Prophets; the Imaam (leader) of those who have taqwaa (those who are dutiful toAllaah); the chief of the Messengers; and thebeloved one of the Lord of the whole creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>43. And every claim to Prophethood after him is erroneous, and is baseless futile desires.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>44. He is the one sent to the whole of the jinn and to allof mankind; with the Truth and the Guidance, and with light and radiance.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>45. And that the Qur.aan is the Speech of Allaah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>46. It originated from Him as something spoken, without us knowing how; and He sent it down to His Messenger as Revelation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>47. And the Believers attest to it as being the truth upon that basis.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>48. They have certainty that it is the Speech of Allaah – the Most High – in reality.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>49. It is not something created such as the speech of mankind.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>50. So whoever hears it and claims it is the speech of a human, then he has committed Unbelief.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>51. So Allaah has blamed and criticised such a person and has threatened him with Hell-Fire.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>52. So since Allaah has threatened with Hell those who say :[Meaning: This is nothing but the word of a human being]: then we know and we have full certainty that it is the Speech of the Creator of mankind.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>53. And it does not resemble the speech of humans.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>54. And whoever describes Allaah with any human characteristic, then he has disbelieved.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>55. So whoever comprehends this, will take it as a lesson. 56. And will be prevented from the like of the saying of the Unbelievers.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>57. And he will know that He &#8211; with His attributes is not like mankind.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>58. And Seeing (Allaah) by the people of Paradise istrue, without their encompassing Him and without us knowing how it will be.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>59. Just as is stated by the Book of our Lord,[Meaning: Some faces on that day will be radiant, looking at their Lord.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>60. And its explanation is as Allaah- the Most High-wanted and knew.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>61. And every authentic hadeeth reported from the Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) then it is just as he said.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>62. And its meaning is as he intended.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>63. We do not enter into that, interpreting it in accordance with our opinions, nor forming ideas based upon our desires.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>64. For no one will be safe in his Religion except one who submits to Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic – and to His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>65. And who refers whatever is unclear to him back to one who knows it.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>66. And Islam will not be firmly established except upon the basis of unrestricted submission and surrender.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>67. So whoever seeks after that which his knowledge hasbeen prevented from, and who is not satisfied regarding his understanding with submission, thenhis seeking will block him from pure and sincereTawheed and from clear awareness and from correct Eemaan.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>68. So he will waver between Unbelief and Eemaan, and believing and denying, and affirmation and rejection.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>69. He will be a person suffering from whisperings, lost, doubting, neither being a true Believer upon Eemaan, nor an outright rejecter and denier.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>70. And Eemaan (true Faith) in (ar-Ru.yah) the fact that the people of the Abode of Peace and Security will see Allaah &#8211; will not be correct from those of them who takes it to be in accordance with his own mistaken idea, or who misinterprets it with his own understanding.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>71. Since the correct interpretation of the seeing, and the correct interpretation of every meaning ascribed to Lordship is to leave interpreting it, and to adhere to submission.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>72. And upon this rests the Religion of Islaam.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>73. And whoever does not guard himself against negating and against likening the Creator to thecreation, then he will slip and go astray and will not attain the correct declaration of Allaah being free of imperfections.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>74. Since our Lord &#8211; the Majestic and Most High &#8211; hasthe attributes of Unity and Oneness.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>75. Having the attributes of Uniqueness, with no one from the creation sharing in the meaning of that.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>76. And He is highly Exalted above limits and goals, and having parts and limbs and appendages.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>77. He is not contained by the six directions, contrary to all of the living things.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>78. The ‘Mi’raaj’ (the Ascent through the Heavens) is true and the Prophet &#8211; may Allaah extol him and his followers and grant him peace and security-wastaken on the Night- Journey (al-Israa.).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>79. And he was taken bodily, whilst awake, up to the heavens.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>80. Then to whatever higher places Allaah wished, and Allaah bestowed honour upon him with whatever He wished.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>81. And He revealed to him what He revealed to him. [Meaning: The heart did not lie about what it saw.]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>82. So may Allaah extol him and grant him peace and security in the Hereafter and in this life.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>83. And the Lake (al-Hawd) with which Allaah – the Most High will honour him, as a relief from thirst for his Ummah – is true.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>84. And Intercession (ash-Shafaa’ah), which has been stored up for them, is true, as is related in the narrations.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>85. And the Covenant (al-Meethaaq) which Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; took from Aadam and his descendants is true.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>86. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; has always known the number of those who will enter Paradise, and the number of those who will enter the Fire, altogether.So that the number will not be increased, nor will itbe decreased.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>87. And the same applies to their deeds; He knew whatever they would do.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>88. Everyone will have what he was created for made easy for him.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>89. Deeds will be in accordance with their conclusions.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>90. And the fortunate person is the one who is fortunate by the decree of Allaah; and the wretched person is the one who is wretched by the decree of Allaah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>91. And Pre-decree (al-Qadr) is fundamentally the secret of Allaah – the Most High – within His creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>92. Knowledge of it is not acquired by any Angel drawn near, nor any Prophet sent.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>93. Delving deeply into it and looking into that leads to frustration and disappointment and is a ladder to deprivation, and is the level of arrogance.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>94. So beware of that: beware of looking into it, thinking about it, and entertaining whispered ideas about it.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>95. Since Allaah – the Most High – concealed the knowledge of Pre-Decree (al-Qadr) from His creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>96. And He forbade them from striving to attain it.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>97. Just as He &#8211; the Most High said in His Book: Meaning: He can not be questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned.]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>98. So whoever asks: why did He do (such and such) then he has rejected the Judgement of the Book.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>99. And whoever rejects the Judgement of the Book is one of the Unbelievers.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>100. So this is in summary what is required by one whose heart is enlightened, from the beloved servants (Awliyaa.) of Allaah – the Most High.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>101. And it is the level of those firmly grounded in knowledge.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>102. Because knowledge (al-‘Ilm) is of two kinds: knowledge which is present within the creation, and knowledge which is absent from the creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>103. So denying the knowledge which is present is Unbelief, and claiming to have the knowledge which is absent is Unbelief.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>104. And Eemaan (true Faith) is not established except through acceptance of the knowledge which is present, and leaving aside seeking the knowledge which is absent.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>105. And we have Eemaan in the Preserved Tablet (al- Lawh), and in the Pen (al-Qalam), and in everything which has been inscribed in it.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>106. So if the whole of the creation were to gather together regarding something which Allaah – theMost High – had written in it [i.e. in the PreservedTablet] that it was going to occur, and they tried to stop it from happening, then they would not be able to do that. And if they all gathered together concerning something which Allaah – the Most High – did not write in it, to try to make it happen – then they would not be able to do that.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>107. The Pen has run dry having written down whatever will occur until the Day of Resurrection. Andwhatever the servant misses out on then it was never going to come to him, and whatever befalls him, then it was never going to miss him.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>108. And it is upon the servant to know that Allaah had prior knowledge of everything that was going to occur in His creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>109. So He decreed that precisely and firmly.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>110. There is nothing to cancel it out; and there is no one from His creation- in His heavens or on His earth-who can rebut it, remove it, change it, reduce it oradd to it.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>111. And that is from the essential fundamentals of Eemaan, and the fundamental principals ofknowledge and awareness (of Allaah).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>112. And it is from the affirmation of the Tawheed of Allaah- the Most High- and His Lordship just as He- the Most Highsaid in His Book [Meaning: He created everything and gave it a predecreed measure.] And He the Most High said: [Meaning: And the Command of Allaah is a Decree determined.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>113. So woe to the one who becomes an adversary to Allaah- the Most High- regarding Pre-Decree.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>114. And who presents a diseased heart to delve into it.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>115. In his attempt to uncover the Hidden and Unseen (al- Ghayb) he has attempted to uncover a secret which issecure.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>116. And what he has said about it causes him to become a sinful and great liar.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>117. And the Throne (al-’Arsh) and the Foot-stool (al- Kursee) are true.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>118. And He has no need of the Throne or of whatever is beneath it.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>119. He encompasses everything and is above it.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>120. And He has rendered His creation incapable of encompassing (everything).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>121. And we say with Eemaan (true Faith) testifying to the truth and with full submission, that Allaah took Ibraaheem as an especially beloved one (Khaleel), and Allaah spoke directly to Moosaa.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>122. And we have Eemaan (true Faith) in the Angels and the Prophets.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>123. And in the Books which were sent down to the Messengers, and we bear witness that they were upon the clear truth.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>124. And we call those who pray towards our ‘Qiblah’ (direction of Prayer): Muslims and Believers (Mu.minoon).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>125. As long as they acknowledge that which the Prophet came with, and as long as they believe him in whatever he said and informed of.*</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>126. And we do not enter into vain speech concerning Allaah, nor do we dispute regarding Allaah’s Religion.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>127. And we do not dispute concerning the Qur.aan; and we bear witness that it is the Speech of the Lord of the whole of creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>128. The ‘Trustworthy Spirit’ (ar-Roohul-Ameen) [i.e. Jibreel] descended with it and he taught it to the chief of the Messengers- may Allaah extol him and grant him peace and security, and his true followers.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>129. And it is the Speech of Allaah the -Most High- nothing from the speech of the created beings equals it.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>130. And we do not say that it is created, and we do not oppose the united body of the Muslims.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>131. And we do not declare anyone from the people of the Qiblah to be Unbelievers because of a sin – as long as the person does not consider the sin to be lawful.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>132. And we do not say: ‘When a person has Eemaan then it will not be harmed by any sin which he commits.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>133. And we have hope for the doers of good from amongst the Believers that He will pardon them and enter them into Paradise by His Mercy: but we do not feel certain about their being safe, nor do we bear witness of Paradise for them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>134. And we seek forgiveness for their evil-doers, and we fear for them, but we do not cause them to despair.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>135. And feeling totally secure and totally despairing-both of these take a person outside the Religion of Islaam.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>136. And the true path for the people of the Qiblah lies between these two.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>137. And the servant does not exit from Eemaan except by denying that which entered him into it.*</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>138. And Eemaan (true Faith) is to affirm with the tongue,and to believe with the heart. **</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>139. Everything which is authentically from the Messenger (( صلى الله عليه وسلم) from the Legislation and the clear explanation is all true.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>140. Eemaan is one entity, and its people regarding it are the same. **</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>141. And variation in excellence between them is by fear and dutifulness, and by opposing desires, and by adhering to what has most right.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>142. And all of the Believers are ‘Awliyaa.’ of (Servants loved by) the Most Merciful; and those having themost honour with Allaah are the ones who are the most obedient, and those who most closely followthe Qur.aan.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>143. And Eemaan is (to truly believe) inAllaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers and the Last Day, and in Pre- Decree (al-Qadr): that which is sweet from it and what is bitter, that is from Allaah the Most High.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>144. and we are Believers in all of that.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>145. We do not differentiate between any of His Messengers, and we believe all of them regarding what they came with.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>146. And those guilty of major sins (Ahlul-Kabaa.ir) [from the Ummah of Muhammad { صلى الله عليه وسلم] will not remain forever in the Fire, if they die as people upon Tawheed;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>147. Even if they did not repent- as long as they meet Allaah upon awareness, (as true Believers) &#8211; then they will be under His Wish and Will (Mashee.ah), and His Judgement: if He wishes He will forgive them and pardon them, by His Favour, just as He- the Mightyand Majestic &#8211; said in His Book:[Meaning: And He forgives whatever islesser than that for whomever He wishes], and if He wishes He will punish them in the Fire, by His Justice.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>148. Then He will bring them out of it through His Mercy and through the Intercession of those who will intercede- from those who were obedient to Him.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>149. Then He will send them to His Paradise.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>150. And that is because Allaah- the Most High &#8211; is the Guardian of those who have awareness (ma’rifah) of Him, and He does not treat them in the two abodes like those who deny Him: those who fail to receive His Guidance, and do not attain His Guardianship.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>151. Allaah! O Guardian of Islaam and its people! Make us firm upon Islaam until we meet You with it.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>152. And we hold praying the Prayer behind everyrighteous or sinful person from the people of theQiblah, and upon whoever dies from them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>153. And we do not declare about anyone from them that he is going to be in the Paradise or that he is going to be in the Fire.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>154. Nor do we accuse them of Kufr (Unbelief), Shirk or Nifaaq (Hypocrisy) as long as nothing from that appears from them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>155. And we leave their hidden secrets to Allaah – theMost High.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>156. And we do not hold using the sword against anyone from the Ummah of Muhammad ( صلى الله عليه وسلم), except upon those whom it becomes obligatory to use it upon.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>157. And we do not hold rebelling against our rulers and those in authority over our affairs.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>158. Even if they oppress.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>159. And we do not make supplication against them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>160. And we do not take our hand away from obedience to them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>161. And we hold that obedience to them is a part of obedience to Allaah-the Mighty and Majestic-and an obligation, as long as they do not command with something sinful.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>162. And we make supplication for them that they be rectified and kept secure.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>163. And we follow the Sunnah and the ‘Jamaa’ah’ (the united body upon the truth), and we avoid separation, disputation and splitting.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>164. And we love the people of justice and trustworthiness, and we have hatred for the people of injustice and treachery.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>165. And we say: ‘Allaah knows best’ regarding whatever is unclear to us.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>166. And we hold wiping (al-mash) upon leather socks -on journeys or in residence, as occurs in the narrations.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>167. And the Hajj and Jihaad continue along with those in authority over the Muslims: those (leaders) who are righteous and those who are sinners, until the establishment of the Hour; nothing abolishes it or cancels it.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>168. And we have Eemaan in the (Angels who are) noble scribes (al-Kiraamul-Kaatibeen), since Allaah has appointed them as guardians over us.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>169. And we have Eemaan in the Angel of death(Malakul- Mawt), who is entrusted with taking the souls of the people.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>170. And in the punishment of the grave for those who are deserving of it; and in Munkar and Nakeer questioning each person in his grave about his Lord, his Religion, and his Prophet &#8211; as occurs in the narrations from Allaah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and from the Companions &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>171. And the grave will either be a garden from the gardens of Paradise, or a pit from the pits of the Fire.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>172. And we have Eemaan in the Resurrection (al-Ba’th), and in the recompensing for deeds on the Day ofResurrection; and in the presentation of deeds and in the Reckoning, and in the reading of the records; and in the reward and punishment; and in theBridge (as-Siraat) and in the Balance (al-Meezaan).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>173. And the Paradise and the Fire are both already created; they will never finish or pass away.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>174. And that Allaah- the Most High- created Paradise and the Fire before the rest of creation, and He created inhabitants for both of them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>175. So whoever He wishes from them will go toParadise, through His Favour (Fadl); and whoever He wishes from them will go to the Fire, from HisJustice (‘Adl).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>176. And everyone will act in accordance with what has been decreed for him and is going towards the destination he was created for.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>177. And good and evil are predecreed for the servants.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>178. And the ability which is necessary for an action to be carried out with regard to the like of ‘tawfeeq’ (Allaah’s guiding to it and granting it), which is such that it is not permissible to ascribe it to the created being – then this comes along with the action. As for the capability from the aspect of health, capacity, power, and soundness of limbs, then this is present before the action and the address (in the Legislation) relates to this, and it is just as He – the Most High- said: [Meaning: Allaah does not burden a soul except with what it can bear.]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>179. And the actions of the servants are created by Allaah, and earned by the servants.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>180. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High- did not burden them except with what they are capable of.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>181. And they are only capable of doing what they have been enjoined with.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>182. And this is the explanation of ‘Laa hawla wa laaquwwata illaa billaah’ (There is no change and no power except with Allaah’s aid).We say: there is no manoeuvring for anyone, and no movement for anyone, and no moving away from disobedience to Allaah – except with the aid ofAllaah; and there is no power for anyone to establish obedience to Allaah, and to remain firm upon it,except by Allaah’s tawfeeq (His granting successful attainment ofthat).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>183. And everything occurs with the Will (Mashee.ah) of Allaah &#8211; the Most High and His Knowledge, and His Ordainment and Pre-Decree.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>184. His Will overcomes all wills.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>185. And His Pre-Decree overcomes all efforts.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>186. He does whatever He wishes and He is never unjust, [He is Pure and free of every evil and tribulation, and He is free and far removed from every deficiency and blemish.]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>187. [Meaning]: He is not to be questioned about what He does, but rather they will be questioned.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>188. And there is benefit for those who are dead in the living making supplication and their giving in charity.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>189. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High-responds to supplications and fulfils their needs.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>190. He owns and has mastery over everything, and nothing owns and has mastery over Him.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>191. There is no independence from Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; even for the blink of an eye.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>192. And whoever thinks that he can do without Allaah for the blink of an eye has committed Unbelief, and has become from the people of destruction.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>193. And Allaah becomes angry, and becomes pleased, but not like anyone from the creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>194. And we love the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>195. And we do not go beyond the due limits in love of any one of them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>196. And we do not disown and free ourselves from anyone of them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>197. And we hate whoever hates them,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>198. And (we hate) whoever mentions them with other than good; and we do not mention them except with good.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>199. And love of them is Religion (Deen), true-Faith(Eemaan), and goodness (Ihsaan); and hatred of them is Unbelief (Kufr), Hypocrisy (Nifaaq) and Transgression (Tughyaan).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>200. And we affirm the Caliphate after Allaah’s Messenger ( صلى الله عليه وسلم): firstly for Aboo Bakr as-Siddeeq-radiyallaahu `anhu-, affirming his excellence and precedence over the whole of the Ummah; then for `Umar ibn al-Khattaabradiyallaahu `anhu-; then for `Uthmaan-radiyallaahu`anhu-; then for `Alee ibn Abee Taalib-radiyallaahu `anhu-; and they are the rightly guided Caliphs (al-Khulafaa. ur- Raashideen), and the rightly guided Imaams.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>201. And the ten whom Allaah’s Messenger ( صلى الله عليه وسلم) named and to whom he gave glad tidings of Paradise–we bear witness that they will be in Paradise, just as Allaah’s Messenger ( صلى الله عليه وسلم) bore witness, and his word is the truth; and they are: Aboo Bakr, `Umar, `Uthmaan, `Alee, Talhah, az-Zubayr, Sa`d, Sa`eed, ` Abdur-Rahmaan ibn `Awf, and Aboo `Ubaydah ibnal- Jarraah – and he is the eminently trustworthy one of thisUmmah – radiyallaahu `anhum ajma`een- (mayAllaah be pleased with them all.)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>202. And whoever speaks well of the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger ( صلى الله عليه وسلم), and his wives who were pure and free of having any stain upon their honour, and his offspring who were untainted and free of every impurity, then he is free of Hypocrisy.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>203. And the early scholars from the Salaf (the earlypredecessors), and the Taabi`een (successors) who came after them: the people upon good and the narrations, and the people of Fiqh and discernment; are not to be mentioned except with fine words; and whoever speaks ill of them then he is not upon the correct path.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>204. And we do not declare any of the ‘Awliyaa.’ (the beloved and obedient servants of Allaah) to be superior to any of the Prophets- `alaihimus-Salaam- and we say: a single Prophet is superior to all of the `Awliyaa.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>205. And we believe in what is reported from their miracles (karaamaat), and in the narrations about them which are authentically related by the reliable narrators.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>206. And we have Eemaan in the Signs of the Hour: such as the emergence of the Dajjaal,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>207. And the descent of `Eesaa ibn Maryam- `alaihis-Salaamfrom heaven.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>208. And we have Eemaan in the rising of the sun from where it sets.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>209. And in the emergence of the beast of the earth (Daabbatul- Ard) from its place.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>210. And we do not accept as true the saying of a fortune teller (kaahin) or a diviner (‘arraaf).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>211. Nor anyone who claims anything which goes against the Book, the Sunnah, and the consensus (ijmaa`) of the Ummah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>212. And we hold that the united body upon the truth (al- Jamaa’ah) is what is true and correct, and that separation is deviation and punishment.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>213. And the Religion of Allaah upon the earth and in the heavens is one, and it is the Religion of Islaam.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>214. He &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: [Meaning: The Religion with Allaah is Islaam], and He &#8211; the Most High- said :[Meaning: And I am pleased for you with Islaam asyourReligion].</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>215. And it lies between extremism and falling short,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>216. And between ‘tashbeeh’ (likening the creation to the Creator) and ‘ta`teel’ (negating Allaah’s attributes)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>217. And between fatalism (al-jabr) and denying Pre-Decree.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>218. And between feeling secure and despairing.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>219. So this is our Religion and our creed and belief,outwardly and inwardly; and we free ourselves before Allaah of everyone who opposes what we have mentioned and made clear.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>220. And we ask Allaah- the Most High &#8211; to make us firm upon Eemaan (true Faith) &#8211; and to conclude our lives with it.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>221. And that He keeps us safe from the variant heretic ideas and the opinions which cause separation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>222. And the corrupt sects</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>223. like the Mushabbihah,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>224. and the Mu’tazilah,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>225. And the Jahmiyyah and the Jabariyyah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>226. And theQadariyyah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>227. And from those who go against the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah and ally themselves with misguidance.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>228. And we are free of them, and we hold them to be misguided and corrupt, and preservation and guidance to what is correct is granted by Allaah.</strong></span></p>
