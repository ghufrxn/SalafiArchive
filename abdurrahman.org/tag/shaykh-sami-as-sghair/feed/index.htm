<p><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Read the Article Below:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Times When it is Forbidden to Pray</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are five times when it is forbidden to pray; three of them are severe, and two are less severe. The five times are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) From after the fajr prayer until the sun has risen<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000;">2) From sunrise until the sun has risen to the height of a spear (approximately one meter) above the horizon</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000;"> 3) From when the sun is at midday, until it passes the meridian</span><br />
4) From after salaat al-asr until the sun reaches the height of a spear above the horizon<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000;">5) From the time the sun has reached the height of a spear from its setting till sunset.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <strong>severe times</strong> when it is forbidden to pray are those which are short (namely the second, third, and fifth cases mentioned above). <span style="line-height:1.5;">Also, it is </span><strong style="line-height:1.5;">forbidden to bury the dead during these times</strong><span style="line-height:1.5;"> as in the hadith of Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir (radhi Allaahu anhu) in Saheeh Muslim where the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) mentioned it was not permissible to bury the dead during these three times. If we take our deceased to the cemetery and the sun has just risen, then it is not allowed to bury that person until the sun has risen the height of a spear. After that, we can bury the dead, and similarly with respect to the other times.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Exception to the Prohibition for a Fard Salaah</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In general, the salaah is forbidden during these times; however, there are exceptions. The first exception is the missed prayers. For instance, if a man has missed a fard prayer, he can pray it during a forbidden time, even if that time is severe in terms of forbiddance. This is in accordance with the hadith of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Whoever forgets a prayer or sleeps and misses it, let him pray it when he remembers it, for there is no other expiation for it than that.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by al-Bukhari (hadith no. 572) and Muslim (hadith no. 1564)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The statement of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) <strong>“let him pray it when he remembers it”</strong> is general and has no exception. Since this is an asserted fareedah(obligation), the prayer in this case should not be delayed after the person remembers it or awakes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Exception to the Prohibition for a Salaah with a Cause</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second type of salaah that is excluded from this prohibition, according to the preponderating opinion, is those that have a cause for it; these can be prayed in the forbidden times. This is a narration from Imam Ahmad (rahimahullaah) and the choice of Shaykh al-Islam ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah). An example of this is repeating the jama’ah; for instance, if a person prays fajr in congregation and goes to another mosque finding the people in prayer there, then in this case, it is permissible for him to pray with them, without sin. The evidence for this is that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) when he was in Mina prayed fajr; after salaah, he saw two men who did not pray with him so he inquired as to why they did that. The men responded that they had already prayed in their residence. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“If you do so and you come to a mosque where there is congregation prayer, then pray with them, and it will be naafil for you.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example is when a person makes tawaaf, it is Sunnah to pray two rakat behind the station of Ibrahim (‘alayhis sallam). As such, if a person makes tawaaf after fajr, it is permissible for him to make these two rakat. The evidence is in the saying of the Prophet to Bani &#8216;Abd Manaf,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“O Bani &#8216;Abd Manaf, do not prevent anyone who makes tawaaf around this house or prays therein (i.e. in the masjid) any hour he wishes from the day or the night.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the ‘ulama considered this hadith as evidence to perform the two rakat following the tawaaf, even if it was during one of the forbidden times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, from this exception is on the<strong> day of juma’ah</strong>, if the imam is giving the khutbah (sermon), then the person may offer the tahiyyat al-masjid even at the time when the sun is at its meridian. This is because once when the Prophet was delivering the khutbah, a man came into the masjid and sat down. The Prophet asked him if he had prayed, and the man replied in the negative. To this, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said, “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Stand up and offer two rakat and make them light</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth instance from the second type of exception is the <strong>entrance to the masjid</strong>. For example, if a person enters the masjid after the fajr prayer or salaat al-asr, then he should not sit until he offers two rakat. This is because this salaat has a cause, namely the entrance to the masjid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fifth, upon the <strong>eclipse of the sun</strong>, it is permissible to pray the associated prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sixth type of salaah that is permitted during a forbidden time is the <strong>two rakat after the wudhu</strong>. This is because this salaat has a legal cause, namely the wudhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Seventh, it is permissible to make <strong>salaat al-istikharaah</strong> during the forbidden times. Salaat al-istikharaah is when a person makes two rakat and then asks Allah to guide him when he is uncertain about a certain matter. Suppose there arises a situation where someone needs to make this salaat, but this occurred during a time when it is forbidden to pray. In this case, it is permissible for him to pray these two rakat because of the associated cause.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the hadith that there is no salaat after fajr or asr is general, particularized in cases where the person offers a salaat that has a cause; in such a situation, it is not forbidden. This is one narration from Imam Ahmad and the choice of Shaykh al-Islam ibn Taymiyyah. It is also the madhab of Imam ash-Shafa’i (rahimahullaah), and it is the correct opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Most High, Knows Best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, and the noble companions and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Umdat al-Ahkaam – Hadeeth No.63</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the <em>salaah</em> and <em>salaam</em> be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions, and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abi Sa’eed al-Khudri (<em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu</em>) reported that the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">إِذَا سَمِعْتُمُ النِّدَاءَ فَقُولُوا مِثْلَ ما يَقُولُ الْمُؤَذِّنُ ‏</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">“<span style="color:#008000;">Whenever you hear the adhaan, say what the Mu&#8217;adhdhin is saying</span>.” [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit: Ruling Concerning Following the Statements of the <em>Mu’adhdhin</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>mu’adhdhin</em> (caller) makes the <em>adhaan</em> for the five prescribed prayers and also on the day of <em>jumu’ah</em>; when he calls, he does so aloud making it inevitable that one must hear his voice in order to respond.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this hadeeth, the instruction of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) “<strong>say what the <em>Mu&#8217;adhdhin</em> is saying</strong>” implies that every statement made by the <em>mu’adhdhin</em> should be repeated verbatim by those that hear it. This covers the entire <em>adhaan</em> excluding two statements, specifically the <em>hayyalatan</em> (i.e. “<em>hayya ‘ala’-salaah</em>” – come for salaah and “<em>hayya ‘ala’-falaah</em>” – come for success), for which the responder says “<em>Laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa billaah</em>” (There is no power or strength except with Allaah); this is the instruction of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) as recorded by Muslim in his Saheeh.[02] Therefore, for all other statements made by the <em>mu’adhdhin</em>, the responder repeats them exactly word for word.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, the responder must make all statements following the <em>mu’adhdhin</em> with his tongue; doing so with one’s heart is insufficient since the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) directed the responder to “<strong>say</strong>”, which in general entails utterance by the tongue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit: Types of Saying</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Saying” is of four types.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) <strong>In the heart</strong> – There are no rulings from <em>sharee’ah</em> that depends on this. That is why there is no effect legally if someone recites the Qur’aan with his heart since it is not a saying. Similarly, if someone says in his heart that his wife is divorced, then this statement is not implemented as it has no effect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, if someone makes an oath not to speak to a specific person and says in his heart “<em>In shaa Allaah</em>”, then this exception is of no benefit to him, and if he talks to that person in the future, then he breaks his oath, which makes the expiation binding upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) <strong>To utter by one’s tongue and moving the lips</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3) <strong>To make one’s self hear</strong> &#8211; There is a difference between the second and the third types of saying since a person may move his tongue without making himself hear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4) <strong>To make others hear him</strong> – This is known as <em>al-jahr</em> (loudness)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a person makes <em>salaah</em> without moving his lips, then this <em>salaah</em> is invalid since he did not actually “say” <em>takbeeratul-ihraam</em>, al-Fatiha, and the rest of the Qur’aan that he recites. However, it is not a condition that he makes himself hear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit: Following the <em>Mu’adhdhin</em> if you can See but not Hear Him</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you see the <em>mu’adhdhin</em> but you are unable to hear him, then you do not repeat after him as the condition is hearing him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit: General Principles When Following the Mu’adhdin</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth indicates that you follow the <em>mu’adhdhin</em> even if there is more than one caller. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said, “<strong>Whenever you hear the <em>adhaan</em></strong>.” Thus, if you hear multiple callers, then you follow them as this is remembrance. The scholars said that this is applicable as long as the person is not in <em>salaah</em> since the praying individual is not called. Similarly, if the person has already prayed, then the generality of the hadeeth implies that it is still applicable to him, making it appropriate that he responds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit: Wisdom of Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a person is responding to the <em>adhaan</em>, he is getting a share of the reward; therefore, Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) gives him a reward even if he is not establishing the worship. Therefore, Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) has enabled the believer to share in rewards through related matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) Although a person may not be making hajj, he is still able to attain specific rewards during that prescribed period. When the hujjaj (pilgrims) make the sacrifice, a person who is not performing hajj may also make a sacrifice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) It is known that during hajj, the pilgrims stay away from certain prohibited things while in ihraam. Likewise, it is prescribed that those who are not doing hajj but still intend to make a sacrifice not cut their hair, nails, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3) In addition, it is legislated that those not performing hajj pray salaat al-‘Eid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Benefit: Accompanying the Adhaan</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The response must be said in a manner accompanying the adhaan</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Benefit: Prerecorded Adhaan</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A recording is simply relating and copying a voice. There is no legal effect to it so no response is required. However, if someone hears the adhaan being broadcast live, then he may follow it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Example: A recording of qur’aan is played from a tape or over the radio, and the reciter comes to a point where sujood at-tilaawah is legislated. The listener does not make sujood as he is not sharing with the reciter in time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Benefit: <em>Mu’adhdhin</em> Following Another <em>Mu’adhdhin</em></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a caller completes the <em>adhaan</em> and hears other <em>mu’adhdhineen</em> (pl. of <em>mu’adhdhin</em>) making <em>adhaan</em>, then he may follow them because he falls under the general wording of the hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Benefit: Following Multiple Callers</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">If someone hears a number of callers, then he follows whoever it is possible to follow, hear, and understand.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">If multiple <em>mu’adhdhineen</em> are the same in this rank, then he follows the one ahead of the others.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">If multiple <em>mu’adhdineen</em> are of the same rank and none is first, then he follows the caller at the masjid he intends to make <em>salaah</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit: Person in Salaah Following the Mu’adhdhin</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The famous saying regarding this is that repeating after the caller can distract the musallee (i.e. person in salaah). The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, the mind is occupied and busy with more important matters during the salaah.&#8221;</span> [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah</strong> (rahimahullaah) held another opinion; he maintained that the person in <em>salaah</em> may respond because this response is remembrance whose cause existed in <em>salaah</em>. Similarly, he said it is permissible to say “al-hamdullillaah” if you sneeze or return the salaam because the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) responded to that while in <em>salaah</em>. However, when it comes to following the <em>mu’adhdhin</em>, consideration is required because the response to the <em>adhaan</em> is prolonged and is far longer than returning the salaam, which is simply responded to with the hand, finger, or head. Thus, it is precautionary not to respond.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit: Responding While Answering the Call of Nature</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Excluded from responding is the one that it is answering the call of nature. This is based on the hadeeth of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">I do not like to remember Allaah except in a state of purity</span>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit: Mu’adhdhin Responding to Himself</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the mu’adhdhin repeating after himself, there are two opinions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) He responds to himself in order to combine the reward of adhaan with the reward of responding.<br />
2) What is apparent in the hadeeth is that there must be a hearer and someone else that is heard. As such, the mu’adhdhin would not respond to himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Benefit: Following the Iqaamah</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is apparent in this hadeeth is the following of the adhaan only. However, another opinion holds that the iqaamah is also referred to as an adhaan as in the hadeeth that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">Between the adhaanayn (i.e. two adhaan), there is salaah</span>” [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some scholars have contended that since the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) referred to the iqaamah as adhaan, it is permissible to repeat after the muqeem (the one that performs the iqaamah). In addition, they took as evidence the hadeeth in Sunan Abu Dawood that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) commanded the people to also follow the iqaamah, but this hadeeth has weakness. However, following the muqeem could cause the person to delay making takbeeratul-ihraam and entering the salaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit: Volume of the Response</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The response in this hadeeth is in principle. There are no indications of a link between the essence of the remembrance and the description of the sound (loud or silent). Moreover, there is no benefit in being loud in the response.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Benefit: Missing Following Mu’adhdhin Due to a Legal Excuse</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When someone has a legal excuse for being unable to follow the <em>mu’adhdhin</em> (e.g. answering the call of nature), then he may make up what he missed. Similarly, if someone first hears the <em>mu’adhdhin</em> during the middle of the <em>adhaan</em>, then he starts following from the beginning and completes the following with the <em>mu’adhdhin</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Example: Someone first hears the <em>mu’adhdhin</em> at “<em>hayya ‘ala’-salaah</em>.” The person should start from the beginning at “<em>Allaahu Akbar</em>” until he catches up with the <em>mu’adhdhin</em> and then continue to follow him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Benefit: Adhaan of a Child</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With respect to the child that has reached the age of distinction, Shaykh al-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) held the opinion that the adhaan which is collective duty is permissible from him but not the adhaan which is in individual duty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah to make this a benefit for myself and for all those that read it and/or convey it. All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
