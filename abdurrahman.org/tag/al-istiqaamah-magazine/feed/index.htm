<p style="text-align:center;">Source: <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/translations/al-istiqaamah/"><strong>Al-Istiqaamah Magazine</strong></a> , Issue No.5 – Ramadân 1417H / January 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -The Most High &#8211; said: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The month of Ramaḍaan in which the Qurʾaan was revealed, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance of the Criterion between right and wrong. So whosoever of you sights the crescent for the month of Ramaḍaan, he must fast that month</strong></span>.&#8221; [Soorah al-Baqarah, 2:185].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (ṣallallaahu ʿalayhi wa-sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">Islaam is built upon five: Testifying that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and the Muḥammad is the Messenger of Allaah, establishing the Prayer, giving the Zakaah performing Ḥajj to the House, and fasting in Ramaḍaan</span>.&#8221;</strong> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (ṣallallaahu ʿalayhi wa-sallam) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">There has come to you Ramaḍaan, a blessed month, in which Allaah has made it obligatory to fast. During it the gates of Paradise are opened and the gates of Hellfire are closed, and the rebellious devils are chained. In it is a night (Laylat al-Qadr) which is better than a thousand months. He who is deprived of its good has truly been deprived.</span>&#8220;</strong>[2]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>From the many important lessons to be learnt from fasting are:</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[1]: GAINING TAQWAA</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fasting has been legislated in order that we may gain taqwaa as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: &#8220;O you who believe! fasting is prescribed for you, as it was prescribed upon those before you in order that you may attain taqwaa.&#8221; [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:183].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Talq ibn Habeeb (d.100H) &#8211; raḥimahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When fitnah (trial and tribulation) appears then extinguish it with taqwaa.&#8221; So he was asked as to what taqwaa was, so he replied: &#8220;Taqwaa is to act in obedience to Allaah, upon a light (i.e. eemaan, faith) from Allaah, hoping in the Mercy of Allaah. And taqwaa is leaving acts of disobedience to Allaah, upon a light from Allaah, due to the fear of Allaah.&#8221;[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This is one of the best definitions of taqwaa. For every action must have both a starting point and a goal. And an action will not be considered as an act of obedience, or nearness to Allaah unless it stems from pure eemaan (faith in Allaah). Thus, it is pure eemaan &#8211; and not habits, desires, nor seeking praise or fame &#8211; that should be what initiates an action. And the preparation showed, to earn the reward of Allaah and to seek His good pleasure.&#8221;[4] So Fasting is a means of attaining taqwaa, since it helps prevent a person from many sins that one is prone to. Due to this, the Prophet (ṣallallaahu ʿalayhi wa-sallam) said: &#8220;Fasting is a shield with which the servant protects himself from the Fire.&#8221;[5] So we should ask ourselves, after each day of fasting: Has this lasting made us more fearful and obedient to Allaah? Has it aided us in distancing ourselves from sins and disobedience?</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[2]: SEEKING NEARNESS TO ALLAAH</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (ṣallallaahu ʿalayhi wa-sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah said: Whosoever shows enmity to a friend of Mine, I shall be at war with him. My servant does not draw near to me with anything more beloved to me than the obligatory duties that I have placed upon him. My servant continues to draw nearer to Me with optional deeds so that I shall love him.&#8221;[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (ṣallallaahu ʿalayhi wa-sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Whosoever reaches the month of </strong><strong>Ramaḍaan not have his sins forgiven, and so enters the Fire, then may Allaah distance him.&#8221;</strong>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So drawing closer to Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; in this blessed month, can be achieved by fulfilling one&#8217;s obligatory duties; and also reciting the Qurʾaan and reflecting upon its meanings, increasing in kindness and in giving charity, in making du‘aa (supplication) to Allaah, attending the Taraaweeḥ Prayer, seeking out Laylat al-Qadr (the Night of Power and Pre-Decree), a night which is better than a thousand months, attending gatherings of knowledge, and striving in those actions that will cause the heart to draw closer to its Lord and to gain His forgiveness. Our level of striving in this blessed month should be greater than our striving to worship Allaah in any other month, due to the excellence and rewards that Allaah has placed in it. Likewise from the great means of seeking nearness to Allaah in this month is making I‘tikaaf (seclusion in the mosque in order to worship Allaah) &#8211; for whoever is able.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim (d.751H) &#8211; raḥimahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah also prescribed iʿtikaaf for them, the objective being that the heart becomes fully preoccupied with Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; concentrated upon Him alone, and cut-off from being preoccupied with the creation. Rather, the heart is only engrossed with Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; such that loving Him, remembering Him, and turning to Him takes the place of all the heart&#8217;s anxieties and worries, so that he is able to overcome them. Thus, all his concerns are for Allaah, and his thoughts are all directed towards remembering Him and thinking of how to attain His Pleasure and what will cause nearness to Him which leads him to feel content with Allaah instead of people. This, in turn, prepares him for being at peace with Allaah alone, on the day of loneliness in the grave, when there will be no one else to give comfort, nor anyone to grant solace, except Him. So this is the greater goal of I‘tikaaf.&#8221; [8]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[3]: ACQUIRING PATIENCE</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Aḥmad (d.241H) &#8211; raḥimahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah has mentioned ṣabr (patience) in over ninety places in His Book.&#8221; [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (ṣallallaahu ʿalayhi wa-sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The month of Patience, and the three days of every month, are times for fasting.&#8221; [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ʿAbd al-Barr (d.464H) &#8211; raḥimahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;What is meant by the month of Patience is the month of Ramaḍaan &#8230; So fasting is called patience because it restrains the soul from eating, drinking, conjugal relations and sexual desires.&#8221; [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (ṣallallaahu ʿalayhi wa-sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O youth! Whoever amongst you is able to marry then let him do so; for it restrains the eyes and protects the private parts. But whoever is unable, then let him fast, because it will be a shield for him.&#8221;</strong> [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So fasting is a means of learning self-restraint and patience. With patience we are able to strengthen our resolve to worship Allaah alone, with sincerity, and also cope with life&#8217;s ups and downs. So &#8211; for example &#8211; with patience we are able to perform our Prayers calmly and correctly, without being hasty, and without merely pecking the ground several times! With patience we are able to restrain our souls from greed and stinginess and thus give part of our surplus wealth in Zakaah (obligatory charity). With patience we are able to subdue the soul&#8217;s ill temperament, and thus endure the ordeal and hardships of Ḥajj, without losing tempers and behaving badly. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O Prophet, urge the Believers to fight &#8230; So if there are one hundred who are patient, they shall overcome two hundred; and if there be one thousand, they shall overcome two thousand, by the permission of Allaah. And Allaah is with the patient ones.&#8221; [Soorah al-Anfaal, 8:65-66].</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, without knowledge and patience, nothing remains, except zeal and uncontrolled emotions, shouts and hollow slogans, speech that does not strengthen, but rather weakens, and actions that do not build, but rather destroy! So in this month, we should strive to develop a firm resolve for doing acts of obedience, and to adorn ourselves with patience &#8211; having certainty in the saying of our Messenger (ṣallallaahu ʿalayhi wa-sallam): &#8220;And know that victory comes with patience, relief with affliction, and case with hardship.&#8221; [13]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[4]: CULTIVATING GOOD MANNERS</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (ṣallallaahu ʿalayhi wa-sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Whosoever does not abandon falsehood in speech and action, then Allaah the Mighty and Majestic has no need that he should leave his food and drink.&#8221; [14]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (ṣallallaahu ʿalayhi wa-sallam) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Fasting is not merely abstaining from eating and drinking. Rather, it is also abstaining from ignorant and indecent speech. So if anyone abuses or behaves ignorantly with you, then say: I am fasting, I am fasting.&#8221; [15]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These narrations point towards the importance of truthfulness and good manners. Thus, this blessed month teaches us not only to abstain from food and drink, but to also abstain from such statements and actions that may be the cause of harming people and violating their rights &#8211; since the Messenger (ṣallallaahu ʿalayhi wa-sallam) said whilst descriibng the true Believer: &#8220;A Muslim is one from whom other Muslims are safe from his tongue and his hand.&#8221; [16] Thus it is upon us as individuals, to examine the shortcomings in our character, and to then seek to improve them &#8211; modeling ourselves upon the character of the last of the Prophets and Messengers, and their leader, Muḥammad (ṣallallaahu ʿalayhi wa-sallam) &#8211; aspiring also for the excellence which he mentioned in his saying: &#8220;I am a guarantor for a house on the outskirts of Paradise (or whosoever leaves off arguing, even if he is right; and a house in the centre of Paradise (or whosoever abandons falsehood, even when joking; and a house in the upper-most part of Paradise for whosoever makes his character good.&#8221;[17] So by shunning oppression, shamelessness, harbouring hatred towards Muslims, back-biting, slandering, tale-carrying, and other types of falsehood, we can be saved from nullifying the rewards of our fasting &#8211; as Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (ṣallallaahu ʿalayhi wa-sallam) said: &#8220;It may be that a fasting person, receives nothing from his fast, except hunger and thirst.&#8221; [18]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[5]: SENSING MUSLIM UNITY</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (ṣallallaahu ʿalayhi wa-sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Fast when they </strong>fast,<strong> and break your fast when they break their fast, and sacrifice the day they sacrifice.&#8221; [19]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam at-Tirmidthee (d.275H) &#8211; raḥimahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Some of the People of Knowledge explained this ḥadeeth by saying: Its meaning is to fast and break the fast along with the Jamaaʿah and the majority of people.&#8221; [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, in this blessed month we can sense an increased feeling of unity and of being a single Ummah due to our fasting and breaking our fast collectively. We also feel an increased awareness about the state of affairs of the Muslims and of the hardships that they endure, because: &#8220;During the fast a Muslim feels and experiences what his needy and hungry brothers and sisters feel, who are forced to go without food and drink for many days &#8211; as occurs today to many of the Muslims in Africa.&#8221; [21] Indeed, the unity of the Muslims &#8211; and their aiding and assisting one another &#8211; is one of the great fundamentals upon which the Religion of Islaam is built, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High -said: <strong>&#8220;And hold fast altogether to the rope of Allaah and do not be divided.&#8221; [Soorah aal-‘ʿImraan 3:103]. Allaah &#8211; the Most High </strong><strong>&#8211; also said: &#8220;The Believers &#8211; men and women &#8211; and friends and protectors to one another.&#8221; [Soorah al-Tawbah 9:44].</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyyah (d.728) &#8211; raḥimahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The welfare of people will not be complete &#8211; neither in this world, nor in the Hereafter &#8211; except with ijtimaa‘ (collectiveness) ,  ta‘aawun (mutual cooperation), and tanaasur (mutual help); mutual cooperation in order to secure benefits, and mutual help in order to ward off harm. It is for this reason that man is said to be social and civil by nature.&#8221; [22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, we see that Islaam lays great importance in bringing hearts together and encouraging ijtimaa‘ (collectiveness). This is not only reflected in the month of Ramaḍaan, but also in the other acts of worship as well. So, for example, we have been ordered by the Prophet (ṣallallaahu ʿalayhi wa-sallam) to pray the five daily Prayers in congregation, and that it has been made twenty-seven times more rewarding than praying it individually. [23] Likewise, this similar collective spirit is demonstrated in the act of Ḥajj (Pilgrimage). Even in learning knowledge and studying it, blessings have been placed in collectiveness, as Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (ṣallallaahu ʿalayhi wa-sallam) said: &#8220;No people gather together in a house from the houses of Allaah, reciting the Book of Allaah and studying it amongst themselves, except that tranquility descends upon them, mercy envelops them, the angels surround them, and Allaah mentions them to those that are with Him.&#8221; [24] Likewise, even in our everyday actions such as eating, Islaam teaches us collectiveness. Thus, when some of the Companions of the Prophet (ṣallallaahu ʿalayhi wa-sallam) said to him: O Messenger of Allaah, we eat but do not become satisfied. He replied: &#8220;Perhaps you eat individually?&#8221; They replied, Yes! So he said: &#8220;Eat collectively and mention the name of Allaah. There will then be blessings for you in it.&#8221; [25] Indeed, even in the etiquette of sitting the spirit of collectiveness is demonstrated. So, one day the Prophet (ṣallallaahu ʿalayhi wa-sallam) came across the Companions who were sitting in separate circles, so he said to them: <strong>&#8220;Why do I see you sitting separately!&#8221;</strong> [26] Similarly, Aboo Tha‘labah al-Khushanee (raḍee Allaahu &#8216;anhu) said: Whenever the people used to encamp, they used to split-up into the mountain passes and valleys. So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (ṣallallaahu ʿalayhi wa-sallam) said: <strong>&#8220;Indeed your being split-up in these mountain passes and valleys </strong>is<strong> from Shayṭaan.&#8221;</strong> Thereafter, whenever they used to encamp, they used to keep very close together, to such an extent that it was said: If a cloth were to be spread over them, it would cover them all. [27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, Ramaḍaan is a time to increase our sense of unity and brotherhood, and our commitment to Allaah and His Religion. And there is no doubt that this sense of unity necessitates that: &#8220;We all work together as required by Islaam as sincere brothers &#8211; not due to ḥizbiyyah (bigoted party spirit), nor sectarianism &#8211; in order to realize that which is of benefit to the Islamic Ummah and to establish the Islamic society that every Muslim aspires for so that the Sharee‘ah (Prescribed Law) of Allaah is applied upon His earth&#8221; [28] So we must examine ourselves during the month of Ramaḍaan and ask: What is my role? &#8211; and each of us has a role &#8211; in helping this precious Ummah to regain its honour, and return to the Ummah its comprehensive unity and strength, and victory that has been promised to it? Likewise, we should reflect upon our own character and actions and ask: Are they aiding the process of unity and brotherhood, or are they a harm and a hindrance to it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we ask Allaah to grant us the ability to change ourselves for the better, during this blessed month, and not to be of those who are prevented from His Mercy and forgiveness. Indeed He is the One who Hears and He is the One to Respond.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Answered by the Noble Scholar and Muftee<br />
Shaykh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin ‘Abdullaah bin Baaz<br />
From <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/translations/al-istiqaamah/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Al-Istiqaamah</strong></a> Magazine, Issue No. 1, Dhul-Hijjah 1416H / May 1996CE.</p>
<h3 id="h1-q1-wearing-clothes-made-from-animal-skin" style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q1: Wearing clothes made from animal skin</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[Q]: An argument arose between myself and some brothers concerning clothes that are made from animal skin. Some of the brothers were of the opinion that such clothing were normally made from the skin of pigs. If this is the case, then what is your opinion about such items of clothing? Are such items of clothing permitted for us to wear? In some books &#8211; such as <em>Al-Halal wa&#8217;l-Haram</em> of Al-Qardawi, and also <em>Ad-Din &#8216;ala Madhahibu&#8217;l-Arba&#8217;ah</em> &#8211; this particular issue has been discussed and the various differing opinions stated, but such books did not however clarify the issue.</span> <span style="color:#808080;"> [Question and answer taken from <em>Al-Fatawa</em> (1/222) of <em>Shaykh</em> Ibn Baz]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: It is established from the Prophet <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> that he said: <span class="hadith">&#8220;<strong>If the skin is tanned, then it is purified</strong>.&#8221;</span> [Related by Muslim (1/191) from Ibn &#8216;Abbas <em>radhiallahu &#8216;anhu</em>].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Scholars have differed concerning this: Does this <em>hadith </em>cover all types of tanned skins, or is it particular to the tanned skin of those animals whose slaughtered meat is lawful? There is no doubt that the tanned skin of those animals whose slaughtered meat is lawful, such as the skin of camels, cows and sheep, are <em>tahir</em> (pure) and are <em>ja&#8217;iz</em> (permissible) to use for all types of clothing &#8211; according to the most correct saying from the People of Knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, as for the skin of pigs, dogs and their like &#8211; whose slaughtered meat is not lawful &#8211; then the People of Knowledge have differed as to whether tanning purifies their skin or not. So cautiousness dictates avoiding their usage &#8211; acting upon the saying of the Prophet <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>: <span class="hadith">&#8220;<strong>Whosoever avoids the doubtful matters safeguards his Religion and his honour</strong>.&#8221;</span> [Related by Al-Bukhari (1/126) and Muslim (no. 1599) from An-Nu&#8217;man ibn Bashir <em>radhiallahu &#8216;anhu</em>.] And also his <em>&#8216;alayhis-salatu was-salam</em>&#8216;s saying: <span class="hadith">&#8220;<strong>Leave that which makes you doubt, for that which does not make you doubt</strong>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Sahih</em>: Related by Ahmad (1/200), An-Nasa&#8217;i (8/327-328) and At-Tirmidhi (no. 2637), who authenticated it, from the narration of Al-Hasan ibn &#8216;Ali <em>radhiallahu &#8216;anhuma</em>.]</p>
<h3 id="h2-q2-revealing-the-awrah-during-prayer" style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q2: Revealing the <em>awrah</em> during prayer</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[Q]: Sometimes whilst praying &#8211; especially during <em>ruku&#8217;</em> (bowing) and <em>sujud</em> (prostration) &#8211; part of the <em>awrah</em> (private parts) of a person becomes exposed due to his wearing trousers. So what is the ruling concerning the wearing of trousers whilst praying?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: If the man&#8217;s trousers cover what is between his navel and his knees and are loose fitting, wide and baggy, then it fulfills the condition for the correctness of the Prayer. However, what is more preferable is to wear a <em>qamis</em> (long shirt) &#8211; which reaches half-way down to the shins, or just above the anklebone &#8211; over the trousers. This is a more complete form of covering the <em>awrah</em>. Likewise, Prayer in an <em>izar</em> (a loose lower garment) is more preferable than Prayer in a pair of trousers without a long shirt &#8211; since the <em>izar</em> far better covers the <em>awrah</em> than a pair of trousers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<em>Al-Fatawa</em> (1/68-69)]</p>
<h3 id="h3-q3-poor-treatment-of-one-s-spouse" style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q3: Poor treatment of one&#8217;s spouse</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[Q]: Even though my husband &#8211; <em>may Allah forgive him</em> &#8211; is a person of good character and fears Allah, yet he does not treat me with kindness. He is always moody, frowning and troubled at heart &#8211; and he often says that I am the cause of this. However, Allah knows &#8211; <em>and all praise is for Allah</em> &#8211; that I do fulfill his rights and try to bring to him tranquility and peace of mind and I try to stay clear of all that which displeases him, whilst patiently bearing his excesses against me. Every time I ask him about something, or speak about a particular matter, he becomes angry and says that my speech is stupidity &#8211; even though I know that he is perfectly happy in the company of his friends and associates. However, when it concerns me, then he does not treat me in the same manner, nor with the same feeling. This causes me great hurt and anger and I have often considered leaving the house. I have &#8211; <em>and all praise is for Allah</em> &#8211; been educated to a good level and fulfill that which Allah has obligated me with. O noble <em>Shaykh</em>! If I leave the house with my children, try to educate them and live my own life, will I be sinful in doing so? Or should I continue to live in my present circumstance, abstain from speaking and continue patiently bearing these difficulties? Please advise me as to what I should do &#8211; <em>and may Allah reward you with goodness</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: There is no doubt that it is obligatory for the husband and wife to live together in a kind and sociable manner. There should be good manners and treatment between them, along with affection and pleasant behaviour &#8211; <em>as Allah the Mighty and Majestic</em> &#8211; says: <span class="quran">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And live with them in honour and in kindness</strong></span>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 4:19]. And His &#8211; <em>the Most Perfect</em>&#8216;s &#8211; saying: <span class="quran">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the wives have rights over the husbands &#8211; similar to those of the husbands over them &#8211; in that which is reasonable. But men have a degree over them</strong></span>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 2:228].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> said: <span class="hadith">&#8220;<strong>Righteousness is good character.</strong>&#8220;</span> [Related by Muslim (4/1980) from An-Nawwas ibn Sam&#8217;an <em>radhiallahu &#8216;anhu]</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>&#8216;alayhis-salatu wa&#8217;s-salam</em> said: <span class="hadith">&#8220;<strong>Do not consider any good action as insignificant &#8211; even if it is meeting your brother with a cheerful face</strong>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Sahih</em>: Related by Ahmad (5/63) and it was authenticated by Al-Albani in <em>As-Sahihah</em> (no. 1352)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>also said: <span class="hadith">&#8220;<strong>The most perfect of Believers in &#8216;iman (faith) is the one with the best character. And the best of you are those that are best to their womenfolk, and I am the best amonqst you to my family.</strong>&#8220;</span>[Related by At-Tirmidhi (1/217-218) who said: &#8220;The <em>hadith</em> is <em>Hasan Sahih</em>.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are besides these many other <em>ahadith</em> which are a general proof for the encouragement of good character, cheerful meeting and good companionship between Muslims. If this is the general case between Muslims, then good treatment between husband and wife and relatives is even more important.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have done well in patiently persevering and bearing the ill treatment and bad character from your husband. However, I advise you to have even greater patience and not to leave the house, and if Allah &#8211; <em>the Most High</em> &#8211; wills, there will be a great deal of good in this and a praiseworthy end for You. Allah &#8211; <em>the Most Perfect</em> &#8211; said: <span class="quran">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Patiently persevere! Indeed Allah is with those who patiently persevere</span></strong>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 6:46]. And His &#8211; <em>the Mighty and Majestic</em>&#8216;s &#8211; saying: <span class="quran">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Indeed whosoever fears Allah, obeys Him, turns away from disobedience and patiently perseveres, then Allah does not cause the rewards of the doers of good to be lost</strong></span>.&#8221;</span>[<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 12:90]. And His &#8211; <em>the Mighty and Majestic</em>&#8216;s &#8211; saying: <span class="quran">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Only those who patiently persevere shall receive their reward in full without reckoning</strong></span>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 39:10]. And His &#8211; <em>the Most Perfect</em>&#8216;s &#8211; saying, <span class="quran">&#8220;S<strong><span style="color:#008000;">o patiently persevere! Indeed, the end will be good for those who are pious</span></strong>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 11:49].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, this does not prevent you from speaking to your husband with such words, and behaving with him in such a manner, that will soften his heart &#8211; and lead to him being pleased with you and fulfilling your rights of companionship. And as long as he is fulfilling the main and important obligations towards you, then try not to ask him for any worldly need, until his heart is opened and his chest is expanded in accepting your request and fulfilling your needs; in this way &#8211; if Allah wills your ending will be a praiseworthy one. May Allah grant you increase in all that is good, and that the condition of your husband improves, and that he is guided to good character, kindness in companionship and to fulfilling the rights that are due upon him. Indeed Allah is the best of those who are asked, and only He guides to the path that is straight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<em>Al-Fatawa</em> (1/193-194)]</p>
<h3 id="h4-q4-using-a-newspaper-as-a-dining-spread" style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q4: Using a newspaper as a dining spread</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[Q]: Is it permissible to use a newspaper as a dining spread to eat upon it. If it is not permissible, then what should be done after reading it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: It is not permissible to use a newspaper which contains Qur&#8217;anic verses, or the remembrance of Allah, as a dining spread. Nor is it permissible to make envelopes out of such material, nor to utilize it in any other manner which is disrespectful and insulting to it. If the situation is as we have mentioned, then such papers containing Qur&#8217;anic material should either be stored away in an appropriate place, or burnt, or buried in clean ground.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[<em>Al-Fatawa</em> (1/242)]</span></p>
<h3 id="h5-q5-sincere-repentance" style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q5: Sincere repentance</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[Q]: I am a young man, nineteen years of age, and have involved myself in a great deal of sin. Even to the extent that I do not pray most of my Prayers in the mosque, and I have never completely fasted the month of Ramadhan in my entire life. Besides these, I have committed other sins as well. I have vowed to repent many times before, however, after doing so I lapse back into these same sins. The youths of my area are just as bad, as are the friends that I associate with. And Allah knows that I have transgressed against myself and that whenever I repent, I return back to the same sins. I hope that you may direct me to a path that will bring me closer to my Lord and distance ms from these evil actions of mine.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: Allah &#8211; <em>the Mighty and Majestic</em> &#8211; says: <span class="quran">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say O My Slaves who have transgressed against their own souls! Do not despair of Allah&#8217;s mercy. Indeed Allah forgives all sins. Truly He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful</strong></span>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 39:53]. There is a consensus from the Scholars that this noble <em>ayah</em> (verse) was revealed for the <em>ta&#8217;ibin</em> (those who repent). So whoever sincerely repents from his sins, then Allah will forgive him all his sins, as occurs in the saying of Allah &#8211; <em>the Most Perfect</em>: <span class="quran">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who Believe! Turn to Allah in sincere repentance. Perhaps your Lord may remove from you your sins and admit you into Paradise beneath which rivers flow</strong></span>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 66:8]. So in this <em>ayah</em> (verse), Allah has made the removal of sins and entry into Paradise dependent upon sincere repentance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And sincere repentance is conditional upon:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">[i] abandoning the sin and keeping away from it,</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">[ii] having regret and remorse for committing the sin,</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">[iii] truly intending not to commit the sin again,</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">[iv] remembering the greatness of Allah and hoping for His reward, whilst fearing His punishment.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Another condition for sincere repentance is that if due to transgression, the wealth or property of someone has been stolen or usurped, then it must be returned, or forgiveness must be sought from the one whose wealth, blood or honour has been taken. However, if the honour of a person has been violated and the situation is such that it is not possible to seek that person&#8217;s forgiveness, then plenty of <em>du&#8217;a</em> (supplication) should be made for his welfare and he should be spoken good of in those places where he had previously been backbitten, since good deeds wipe away bad ones.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah &#8211; <em>the Most Perfect</em> &#8211; said: <span class="quran">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Turn you all in repentance to Allah, O Believers, in order that you may be successful</strong></span>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 24:31]. So in this <em>ayah </em>(verse) Allah &#8211; <em>the Mighty and Majestic</em> &#8211; linked success with <em>tawbah</em> (repentance) and points to the fact that the repentant person will reach success and happiness, and if such a person were to follow up this repentance with <em>&#8216;iman</em> (faith) and doing righteous actions, then Allah would efface his evil actions and change them to good actions, as Allah &#8211; <em>the Most Perfect</em> &#8211; says, after mentioning the sins of <em>Shirk</em> (directing worship that is due only for Allah, to other than Allah), taking a life without just cause and fornication and adultery: <span class="quran">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever does this, will receive the punishment. The punishment will be doubled for him on the Day of Judgement and he will live therein in disgrace. Except for those who repent, have <em>&#8216;iman</em> (faith) and do righteous actions. For them Allah will change their evil deeds into good ones, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful</span></strong>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 25:68-70]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the causes of <em>tawbah</em> (repentance) are humility and submissiveness to Allah &#8211; <em>the Most Perfect</em> &#8211; and imploring Him for guidance &#8211; realising that acceptance of one&#8217;s repentance is indeed another favour from Allah. Thus, Allah &#8211; <em>the Most Perfect</em> &#8211; said: <span class="quran">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Call upon Me and I will respond to your supplication</strong></span>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 40:60]. And He &#8211; <em>the Mighty and Majestic</em> &#8211; said: <span class="quran">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And when My servant asks you concerning Me, say to them that I am indeed near. And I respond to the supplication of the one who supplicates to Me</span></strong>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 2:186].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, from the causes of <em>tawbah</em> is choosing good companionship and friendship, and following them in righteous conduct, whilst staying clear of bad companionship. It is authentically related from Allah&#8217;s Messenger <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> that he said: <span class="hadith">&#8220;<strong>A person is upon the religion of his friend, so let one of you look to whom he keeps as a friend</strong>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Hasan</em>: Related by Abu Dawud (no. 4812) and others, from Abu Hurayrah <em>radhiallahu &#8216;anhu</em>. <em>Imam</em> An-Nawawi authenticated it in <em>Riyadh as-Salihin</em> (no. 174).]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> also said: <span class="hadith">&#8220;<strong>The example of good companion and a bad companion is like that of a seller of musk and the one who blows the blacksmith&#8217;s bellows. As for the seller of musk, then either he will grant you some, or you buy some from him, or at the very least you enjoy a pleasant smell from him. As for the one who blows the blacksmith&#8217;s bellows, then either he will burn your clothes, or you will get an offensive smell from him</strong>.&#8221;</span> [Related by Al-Bukhari (4/323) and Muslim (no. 2628), from Abu Musa al-Ash&#8217;ari <em>radhiallahu &#8216;anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<em>Al-Fatawa</em> (1/251-253).]</p>
<h3 id="h6-q6-splitting-into-groups-within-the-muslims" style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q6: Splitting into groups within the Muslims</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[Q]: What is the obligation upon the Muslim Scholars with regard to the large number of <em>jam&#8217;iyyat</em> (societies) and <em>jama&#8217;at</em> (groups) in many of the Islamic lands and elsewhere, and with regard to the differences that exist between them, to the point that each group declares the others to be misguided. Do you not hold that it is fitting to enter into explaining the like of this matter and to clarify the truth concerning their differences, for fear that these differences will increase and lead to evil consequences for the Muslims?.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: Our Prophet <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> made clear to us a single way which is obligatory upon the Muslims to follow and traverse, and that is Allah&#8217;s Straight Path and the methodology of His upright religion. Allah &#8211; <em>the Most High</em> &#8211; said: <span class="quran">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And this is My Straight Path, so follow it and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path. This has He ordained for you, that you may become pious.</strong></span>&#8220;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 6:153]. Just as the Lord of Might and Majesty warned the <em>Ummah</em> (nation) of Muhammad <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> against splitting and disunity, since that is one of the greatest causes of failure and of the enemy taking control, as occurs ill the saying of Allah &#8211; <em>the Mighty and Majestic</em>&#8216;s <span class="quran">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And hold fast altogether to the rope of Allah and do not be divided</span></strong>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 3:101]. And His &#8211; <em>the Most High</em>&#8216;s &#8211; saying: <span class="quran">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He has ordained for you the same religion which He ordained for Nuh, and that which We revealed to you, and that which We ordained for Ibrahim, Musa and &#8216;Isa <em>&#8216;alayhimus-salam</em>, saying: that you should establish the religion by doing that which you are ordered with, and make no divisions in it. Intolerable for the Pagans is that to which you call them</strong></span>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 42:13]. So this is a Divine call to unity and for hearts to be harmonized. And in any Islamic land, if there are many groups for the purpose of good, aid, co-operating in righteousness and piety between the Muslims &#8211; without their being differences between the desires of the companions and followers &#8211; then this is good, is a blessing, and produces great benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if each of them declare the others to be misguided and attack their actions, then this harm is very great and its evil consequences very serious. Then what is obligatory upon the Muslims is to clarify the true states of affairs and to discuss with each group and to sincerely advise all of them that they should proceed upon the way laid down by Allah for His servants, and upon that which our Prophet Muhammad <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> called to. Then those who ignore this, or continue in their stubbornness, due to personal benefit or goal &#8211; known only to Allah &#8211; then what is obligatory upon those who know the reality is to make this known about them and to warn against them, so that the people may avoid their path, and that those who do not know the reality of their affair may not fall into it and be led astray, and that they are not turned away from the Straight Path which Allah ordered that we follow, as occurs in His &#8211; <em>the Mighty and Majestic</em>&#8216;s &#8211; saving: <span class="quran">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And this is My Straight Path, so follow it and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path. This has He ordained for you, that you may become pious</strong></span>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 6:153]. And from that which there is no doubt about is that the multitude of sects and groups in the Islamic society is, firstly something desired by Shaytan, and secondly something desired by the enemies of Islam from amongst mankind. Since agreement and unification of the Muslims, and their being aware of the dangers which threaten them and their <em>&#8216;aqidah</em> (beliefs), will make them active in refuting and rebutting it, and acting in a unified manner for the benefit of the Muslims &#8211; thus repelling the danger from their religion, their lands and their brothers. And this is something which the enemies &#8211; from amongst mankind and jinn &#8211; are not pleased with. Therefore they are very eager to split-up the Muslims, destroy their unity and to sow the seeds of enmity and discord between them. We ask Allah that He unites the Muslims upon the truth and that He removes from their society every type of misguidance and every cause of discord. Indeed He is the One Who is able to do that, and He is the One having full power over it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><b>THE FOURTH LEGACY</b></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I advise you all to safeguard your time and to occupy yourselves in that which is beneficial. You should know that time is more precious than wealth, as Allaah – the Most Blessed, the Most High – said:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Until, when death comes to one of them, he says:&#8221;My Lord! Send me back, That I might do righteousness in that which I left behind.&#8221;</span></strong> [Surah Al-Mu&#8217;minoon: Aayahs 99-100]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Time is such that when it departs it does not return, whereas wealth, when it departs, then it is possible to replace it. So time is of the utmost importance. This is why I advise you to safeguard your time, and to occupy yourselves in that which benefits. Keep away from <i>qeela wa qaal</i> (gossiping) – that so and so said such and such about this and that person – because the Prophet <i>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i> said in an authentic narration: <i>“Indeed Allaah hates qeela wa qaal (gossip mongering), asking too many questions, and wasting one’s wealth.” </i>[4] Unfortunately, many of the youths – after returning to the correct path, and uniting their hearts and unifying their word – have become disunited and fragmented into many factions, and this is due to the whisperings of Shaytaan amongst them and the disuniting of their word. So I advise the brothers to utilise your time in beneficial matters, and to keep away from <i>qeela wa qaal</i>. Indeed, time is like a sword; either you strike it, or it will strike you!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE BALANCED APPROACH</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah – <i>rahimahullaah</i> – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“When dealing with the people of sin, one must not exceed the limits prescribed by the <i>Sharee’ah</i> – neither in hating, censuring, preventing, abandoning or chastising them. Rather, the one who does so should be told: Worry about your own self. No harm will come to you from those who are misled, if you are truly guided, as Allaah – the Mort High – said: <b>“And do not let your hatred of others swerve you away from doing justice. But be just! That is closer to taqwaa (piety).”</b> [Soorah al-Maa’idah 5:8]. And Allaah said: <b>“And fight in the way of Allaah those who fight you, but do not transgress the limits.”</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:190]. Indeed, many of those who command and forbid overstep the limits set by Allaah, either through <i>jahl</i> (ignorance) or <i>dhulm</i> (injustice). Thus, this issue (of justice) must be firmly maintained, whether it is in regards to censuring the unbelievers, the hypocrites, the sinners or the disobedient ones.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He further said: “The one commanding the good or forbidding the evil should do so in the way prescribed by the <i>Sharee’ah</i>; with knowledge, gentleness and patience, and with good intentions, and by following a balanced approach. All of this enters into Allaah’s saying: <b>“O you who believe! Beware of your own selves. No harm will come to you from those who are misled, if you are truly guided.”</b> [Soorah al-Maa’idah 5:105) … There is in this <i>Aayah</i> (Verse) another meaning as well, which is that a person must turn towards that which will be of benefit to him, both in knowledge and action, and he must avoid what does not concern him – as the conveyer of the <i>Sharee’ah</i> (i.e. the Prophet <i>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said:<i> “From the perfection of a person’s Islaam is to leave alone that which doer not concern him.” </i>[4] This especially applies to a person delving into that which doer not concern him regarding someone’s religious or worldly affairs. Thus, such a person may speak out of envy or desire for position; or act either with deliberate oppression, or foolish scorn and sarcasm. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>How often does Shaytaan make such an act appear to be an art of commanding the good or prohibiting the evil, or jihaad in the path of Allaah, whereas it is actually an act of injustice and transgression!”</strong></span> [5]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Allaahu Akbar<br />
</strong><strong>Allaah is Greater</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;That He will call you to account for what your hearts have earned.&#8221;</span> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:225].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The day when neither wealth nor children will be of any avail, except he who comes to Allaah with a dean and pure heart.&#8221;</span> [Soorah ash-Shu&#8217;araa 79:88-89].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Indeed, there is a piece of flesh in the body; if it is sound then all the body is sound. However, if it is diseased, then all the body is diseased Truly that is the heart.&#8221;</span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Rajab (d.795H) &#8211; rahimahullaah -said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">&#8220;So know that the world &#8211; and whatever is above it and below it in the water- will not be corrected except when the actions of its people are all for Allaah. The actions of the body follow on from the actions and intentions of the heart. So when the actions and intentions of the heart are purely for Allaah alone, then it is corrected, and likewise the actions of the body will also be correct. However, if the actions and intentions of the heart are for other than Allaah, then it is corrupted, and likewise the actions of the body will be corrupted in proportion to how much the heart is corrupted.&#8221; [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">And he said: &#8220;Hearts will not be corrected until the ma&#8217;rifah (knowledge and realisation) of Allaah &#8211; being in awe of His greatness, loving Him, fearing Him, hoping in Him, relying and trusting in Him &#8211; is not firmly implanted in them. This is the reality of Tawheed and the meaning of the saying: Laa ilaaha illallaah (that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah). Thus, hearts will not be corrected until Allaah is made the ilaah (deity) to be known, to be loved, feared and hoped in, and that He &#8211; along with this &#8211; becomes the only ilaah (deity) worthy of this, without associating any partner to Him in this.&#8221; [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, we may begin to appreciate the greatness of Allaah &#8211; the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; and being in awe of Him, by considering some narrations regarding what He &#8211; the Most High &#8211; has created.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Indeed I see what you do not see and hear what you do not hear. Heaven has groaned, and it has a right to do so. By Him in Whose Hand is my soul! There is not in the heaven a space equivalent to four fingers, except than an angel has prostrated his forehead to Allaah in it. By Allaah! If you knew what I know, you would laugh little and weep a lot, and you would not take delight in women in their beds, but rather would go to the wilderness and implore Allaah for help.&#8221;</span> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The seven Heavens compared to the Kursee (the Chair) is like a ring which is thrown into a desert. And such is the magnitude of the &#8216;Arsh (the Throne of Allaah) compared with the Kursee.&#8221;</span> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;I have been given permission to relate to you about the Angels of Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; that carry the &#8216;Arsh (Throne). Between one of the Angel&#8217;s ear and shoulder is a distance of seven hundred year journey.&#8221;</span> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Al-Baytul-Mamoor is in the seventh heaven [directly above the Ka &#8216;bah]. Each day seventy thousand angels enter it, and they will not return until the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;</span> [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So: &#8220;the need of the servants for this (type of) knowledge is greater then every other need; end it is the most necessary of all things for them, since there is no life for the hearts, nor any delight, nor any tranquility, except through knowing their Lord, the only One Who deserves to be worshipped, their Creator &#8211; with His Names, His Attributes and His Actions, and that He &#8211; along with all that &#8211; is more beloved to the person than anything else. So man&#8217;s striving is with regards to everything that will draw him nearer to Allaah, to the exclusion of the creation &#8230; So the people who know Allaah the best, are the ones who best follow the way to Him; and know best whet lies at the end of the way.&#8221; [8]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">This right is the greatest right of any of the creation. None of the creation have a right greater than the rights of Allah&#8217;s Messenger <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>. Allah &#8211; <em>the Most High</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="quran"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Indeed We have sent you as a witness rind a bringer of good-tidings and a warner, in order that mankind may believe in Allah and His Messenger, and that you may assist and honour the Messenger.&#8221;</span> </span>[<cite>Al-Qur&#8217;an</cite> 48:89]</p>
<div class="floatframe" style="text-align:justify;">
<div class="articleimage"></div>
<div class="articledescription">Therefore it is obligatory to love the Prophet <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> over and above any of mankind &#8211; even above one&#8217;s love for himself, his parents and his children. The Prophet <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> said: <span class="hadith" style="color:#008000;">&#8220;None of you will truly believes until he loves me more then his parents, his children and the whole of mankind.&#8221;</span> [<span id="qtip0" class="toggle">1]</span></div>
</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the rights that are due to the Prophet <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> are: that he should be honoured, loved and respected &#8211; but without any <em>ghulu</em> (exaggeration) or any falling short in the matter. Honouring the Prophet <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>during his lifetime implied honouring his <em>Sunnah</em> (guidance and example) and his noble character and conduct. As for honouring him after his death, then this implies honouring his <em>Sunnah</em> and the <em>Shari&#8217;ah</em> (the Prescribed Laws) that he was sent with. Whosoever reflects upon the lives of the <em>Sahabah</em> (Companions of the Prophet) will come to know how these great and virtuous people established the obligation of honouring the Messenger <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Urwah ibn Mas&#8217;ud said to the Quraysh: <span class="salaf">&#8220;O my people! I have seen kings. I have seen Caeser, Chouoes and Negus. But by Allah! I have never seen a king whose companions respect and honor him in the way that the Companions of Muhammad honour Muhammad <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>. By Allah! When he spits, the spittle would fall into the hands of one of them, who would then rub his face and skin with it; when he orders them with something, they promptly fulfill it; when he performs <em>wudhu&#8217;</em>(ablution), they vie with each other for the remains of the water; and when they speak in his presence, they lower their voices and do not look directly at his face, due to their respect and honour for him.&#8221; [</span><span id="qtip1" class="toggle">2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is how the Companions <em>radhiallahu &#8216;anhum</em> loved and honoured him, for Allah had endowed and blessed the Prophet<em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> with a generous and noble character and a mild and easy-going nature. Had he been harsh and hard-hearted, people would not have been able to gather around him and be with him as they did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from the rights that are due to the Prophet <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> is to believe in all that he informed as of with regards to the accounts of previous people and nations, to do that which he has commanded and leave that which he has prohibited, and to have <em>&#8216;iman</em> (faith) that his guidance and example is the best and most perfect guidance and example, and that the <em>Shari&#8217;ah</em>(Prescribed Laws) that he was sent with is perfect and complete &#8211; no human laws nor systems are to be given precedence or priority over his <em>Shari&#8217;ah</em>. Allah &#8211; <em>the Most High</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="quran"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;But no by your Lord! They will not truly be Believers, until they make the Prophet a judge in all their disputes, and then find in their souls no resistance against his decision, but rather accept it with the utmost submission.&#8221;</span> </span>[<cite>Al-Qur&#8217;an</cite> 4:65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="quran"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Say: If you do love Allah then follow the Prophet. Allah will then love you and forgive you your sins. Indeed Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most-Merciful.&#8221;</span> </span>[<cite>Al-Qur&#8217;an</cite> 3:31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the rights of the Prophet <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> is to defend his <em>Shari&#8217;ah</em> and his guidance with the strength and capacity at one&#8217;s disposal, and also in proportion to the attack that it is under. Thus, if the enemies are attacking it with false proofs and doubts, then his guidance and <em>Shari&#8217;ah</em> should be defended with sound knowledge which refutes such false arguments and clarifies the doubts. If, however, the attack is made by any other types of weapons, then the defence should be made in a similar manner. It is not possible for any Believer to hear of some attack upon the Prophet&#8217;s <em>Shari&#8217;ah</em> or his noble personality, and then to keep silent about it &#8211; especially when one has the power to counter such on attack.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah Issue Issue No.4 &#8211; Jumâdal-Awwal 1417H / November 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>CONCERNING MEN WEARING GOLD RINGS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: What is the ruling concerning a man wearing a gold ring, or what is known as a wedding-ring?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: Shaykh Ibn Baaz &#8211; <i>hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; answered:<br />
&#8220;It is not permissible for a man to wear gold rings. neither before or after marriage. This is due to the fact that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> prohibited gold, as occurs in the authentic narrations. So once when the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam </i>saw a man wearing a gold ring, he took it from him, threw it down and said: <i>&#8220;Does a person pick up a burning piece of coal and hold it in his hand.&#8221;</i> This was related by Muslim in his <i>Saheeh</i> (6/149). So in this is a proof that it is absolutely <i>haraam</i> (prohibited) for men to wear gold rings, even if it is a wedding ring.&#8221;2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE RULING CONCERNING WISHING FOR DEATH DUE TO ENCOUNTERING MANY HARDSHIPS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: I have faced so many hardships in my life that it has made me hate this life. Every time I turned to Allaah and pleaded to Him to take my life at the earliest possible moment. This continues to be my wish up until now, as I do not see any solutions to my problems except death; it is the only thing that can save me from this torment. Is this behaviour <i>haraam</i> (forbidden) for me?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: Shaykh Ibn al-&#8216;Uthaymeen &#8211; <i>hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;When a person wishes for death due to the hardships and afflictions that have befallen him, then he is doing something that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> prohibited, when he said: <i>&#8220;None of you should wish for death due to some harm that has come to him, rather, if he has such a wish then let him say: O Allaah! Give me life if You know that life is better for me. And give me death if You know that death is better for me.&#8221;</i>3 Therefore, it is not allowed for anyone to wish for death on account of some harm, hardship or difficulty that has come to him. In fact, he should have <i>sabr</i> (patience) and expect a reward from Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; due to his being patient, and he should wait for relief to come to him; just as the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;And know that victory comes with patience, relief with distress, and ease with hardship.&#8221;</i>4 So the one who is afflicted with any affliction should know that those afflictions are an expiation for some of the sins he has committed. Indeed, no Believer is afflicted with any kind of grief, pain or suffering except that Allaah expiates &#8211; due to that &#8211; some of his sins; even if it be the harm caused by a mere pricking of a thorn. So when a person has patience and hopes in a reward from Allaah, he reaches the level of being amongst the <i>saabiroon</i> (those who truly have patience), and this is a very lofty level. Allaah &#8211; the Most High said about its people:<b> &#8220;And give glad tidings to the apatient ones; those who, when afflicted by a calamity, say: Indeed we belong to Allaah, and to Him shall we truly return.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:155-156].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The woman in the question feels that there is no solution for her problems except death. I believe that this is a mistaken view.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Death does not solve any problems. In fact, sometimes it only increases the difficulties. How many people die whilst being afflicted with calamities, difficulties and suffering, but they had been wronging themselves by sinning, and did not give up their sins or repent to Allaah. So death, in this case, is just a quicker coming of punishment. Perhaps if such a person had remained alive, then Allaah would have guided him him to the doors of repentance, seeking forgiveness, patience, facing up to the problems and expecting relief. All of this would have been good for him. Therefore, it is upon you &#8211; the questioner &#8211; to be patient and expect relief from Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; just as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said in His Book:<b> &#8220;So indeed with hardship here is relief. Indeed with hardship there is relief.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Inshiraah 94:5-6]. And the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said in the authentic narration: <i>&#8220;Victory comes with patience; relief with affliction, and ease with hardship.&#8221;</i>5&#8243;6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>FORCING A YOUNG LADY TO MARRY A MAN THAT SHE DOES NOT WANT TO MARRY</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: Is it allowed for a father to force his daughter to marry a particular man that she does not want to marry?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: Shaykh Ibn Baaz &#8211; <i>hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; responded by saying:<br />
&#8220;Neither the father, or anyone other than the father, may force a woman who is under his guardianship to marry a man that she does not wish to marry. In fact her permission must be sought first. Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;A previously married women (without a husband) must not be married until she is consulted, and a virgin is not married until her permission is sought.&#8221;</i> They said: O Messenger of Allaah, how is her permission sought? So he said: <i>&#8220;By her being silent.&#8221;</i>7 Another narration states: <i>&#8220;Her silence is her permission.&#8221;</i>8 Yet a third narration states: <i>&#8220;A virgin&#8217;s father seeks her permission, and her permission is her remaining silent.&#8221;</i>9 So the father must seek her permission if she is nine years of age or above. Likewise, her other guardians may not marry her off except by her permission. This is obligatory upon them all. If a lady is married without her permission, then the marriage will not be correct. This is because one of the conditions of a marriage contract is that both partners accept the marriage freely. So if she is married without her permission, by threat or coercion, then the marriage is null and void&#8230; If the (apparent) husband knows that she does not want him, then he should not approach the woman, even if the father approves of it. He must fear Allaah and not approach any wife that does not want him, even if the father claims that he did not coerce her. The man must avoid what Allaah has forbidden him. This is because Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> ordered that her permission be sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also advise the woman to fear Allaah and to accept the man if her father finds that he suitable to marry her, as long as the prospective groom is good in his Religion and in his character. This is also the case if the one who is the guardian is not the girl&#8217;s father. We give this advice because there is a lot of good and a lot of benefit in marriage. Likewise, there are a lot of hazards in living as a maiden. So I advise all young ladies to accept those men who come to them for marriage, if they conform to the compatibility factors of marriage (i.e. good in Religion and character), they should not use studying, teaching, or anything else, as an excuse to get married.&#8221;10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>A RELIGIOUS YOUNG MAN PROPOSED TO ME BUT MY MOTHER REFUSED</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: I am seeking a solution to my problem. I am twenty-four years old. A young man proposed to me. He has finished college and is from a religious family. After my father agreed to him, he asked me to come and see him. I saw him and was pleased with him. [we saw each other] because our pure and noble Religion states that I should see him and that he should see me. However, when my mother came to realise that he was from a Religious family, she became harsh against him and my father. She swore that she would not allow such a marriage to take place. My father desperately tried to persuade her, but to no avail. Do I have the right to seek the [Islaamic] Law to intervene in this matter?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: Shaykh Ibn Baaz &#8211; <i>hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;If the matter is as you have stated in your question, then your mother has no right to object, to this matter Indeed it is actually <i>haraam</i> (forbidden) for her to object in this case. You are not obliged to obey your mother in this particular issue, since the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Indeed obedience is only in ma&#8217;roof (when it is good and right).&#8221;</i>11 And it is not from <i>ma&#8217;roof</i> to reject a suitable marriage proposal. In fact, it has been narrated from the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> that he said: <i>&#8220;lf there comes to you a person whose Religion and character are pleasing to you, then marry him (i.e. give the girl in marriage to him). If you do not do this, there will be Fitnah (trial and discord) and great fasad (corruption) upon the earth.&#8221;12 If you have need to take your case to an [Islaamic] court of law, then you would not be wrong in doing so.&#8221;</i>13</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah Issue No.7 &#8211; Rabî&#8217; ul-Awwal 1418H / July 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>IS CLINGING TO THE RELIGION A CAUSE OF AFFLICTION?</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: There was a person in our city who was very firm in practicing the Religion, and was later afflicted with an illness. Some of the people started saying to him that the cause of him being afflicted with this illness is because of his adhering to the Religion. Being affected with this type of talk, the person then shaved off his beard and he neglected his Prayers. So is it permissible to say that the cause of his affliction was due to him clinging to the commandments of the Religion? And the one who says such a thing, is he considered a <i>kaafir</i> (disbeliever) because of such a saying?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: &#8221;Clinging on to the Religion is not a cause for his illness. Rather, it is a cause for every good, both in this life and in the Hereafter. And it is not permissible for any Muslim, that when some foolish and ignorant people utter words such as this, to give them any weight. Nor is it permissible to shave one&#8217;s beard or shorten it, or to neglect guarding the five obligatory Prayers in congregation. Rather, it is obligatory for such a person to remain steadfast upon the truth, and to keep away from all that Allaah has prohibited, and to beware of all that which angers Allaah and incurs His punishment &#8211; by obeying Allaah and His Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects said: <b>&#8220;Whosoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger will be admitted into Gardens of Paradise, beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. That will be the greatest achievement. But whosoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger and oversteps His limits, Allaah will cast him in the Fire, to abide therein; and he shall have a humiliating punishment.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:13-14]. And Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Whosoever has taqwaa (piety, fear and obedience) of Allaah, He will make a way out for him. And He will provide for him from places he could never imagine.&#8221;</b> [Soorah at-Talaaq 65:2-3]. And He &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Whosoever has taqwaa of Allaah, He will make his affair easy for him,&#8221; </b>[Soorah at-Talaaq 65:4]. And the verses with this meaning are plentiful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the person who says that the cause for such affliction is due to being firm and steadfast upon the Religion &#8211; then such a person is ignorant. It is obligatory to censure such a person and to know that clinging to the Religion does not bring about anything except good. As for what occurs to a Muslim by way of a calamity that he dislikes, then this is a form of expiating his evil actions and a forgiveness for his sins. As regards to the issue of <i>takfeer</i> (declaring a Muslim to be a <i>kaafir</i>, a disbeliever) upon this person, then this requires detail, and is known from the chapters concerning the judgement upon a <i>murtad</i> (apostate) &#8211; which can be found in the books of Islaamic jurisprudence and understanding. And with Allaah is the power and ability.&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>CRYING DUE TO ILLNESS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: I am ill and I sometimes cry because of what happens to me after my illness. Is this considered an action which opposes Allaah and of not being pleased with what He has decreed? I do not do this action willfully. Likewise, does that ruling also include talking to my relatives about my illness?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: &#8220;There is no harm in crying, if it is simply tears coming from the eyes, without wailing. This is based upon the statement of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, when his son Ibraaheem passed away: <i>&#8220;The eye sheds tears and the heart grieves, yet we do not say anything except what is pleasing to our Lord. By your death &#8211; O Ibraaheem &#8211; we are indeed in grief.&#8221;</i>2 The <i>ahaadeeth</i> with this meaning are numerous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also no harm in you speaking about your illness to your relatives and friends, providing that you praise and thank Allaah, glorify Him and ask Him for sound health, following the permissible means. We advise you to patiently persevere and to hope in a reward from Allaah. I give you the glad tidings, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; has said: <b>&#8220;Only those who are patient shall recieve their reward in full, without reckoning.&#8221;</b> [Soorah az-Zumar 39:10]. The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> also said: <i>&#8220;A Muslim is not afflicted with fatigue, sorrow, disease or pain &#8211; even if it be the pricking of a thorn &#8211; except that due to it, Allaah will expiate some of his sins.&#8221;</i>3 Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> also said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever Allaah intends good for, He afflicts him with some calamity.&#8221;</i>4 So we ask Allaah to grant you a cure and sound health, as well as goodness of the heart and actions. Indeed He is the One who hears and the One who responds.&#8221;5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SAFEGUARDING THE PRAYERS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: A leaflet was sent to us and with it was a copy of a page which has been distributed amongst the people, and which included a hadeeth attributed to the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> which said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever misses the Prayer due to laziness, then Allaah will punish him with fifteen punishments &#8230;&#8221;</i> So what is the authenticity of this particular hadeeth?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: &#8220;This hadeeth is a lie upon the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and there is no basis at all for it being authentic &#8211; as has been explained by al-Haafidh adh-Dhahabee, <i>rahimahullaah</i>, in <i>al-Meezaan</i> and al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr in <i>Lisaanul-Meezaan</i>. So it is a must that whosoever comes across such a leaflet that he burns it and that he admonishes the one who produced it, in order to defend the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and to protect his Sunnah from the lies of the liars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what has been Recorded in the great Qur&#8217;aan and the authentic Sunnah of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> -with regards to the importance of the Prayer and warning against being lazy in performing it and a threat for whosoever does this &#8211; is more than sufficient against the lies of the liars. So Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Guard strictly your five daily Prayers and in particular the middle Prayer (i.e. the &#8216;Asr Prayer), and stand before Allaah with obedience.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:238]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: &#8220;And then there came after them a people who gave up their Prayer and followed their lusts. So they will be thrown into the Hellfire.&#8221; [Soorah Maryam 19:59]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;So woe be upon those who pray; those who delay their Prayer from the fixed stated times.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;oon 107:3-4]. And the verses with this meaning are plentiful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;The covenant between us and them is the Salaah (Prayer), so whosoever abandons it has committed an act of disbelief.&#8221;</i> Recorded by Imaam Ahmad and the compilers of the four Sunan with a Saheeh (authentic) <i>isnaad</i> (chain of narration).6 And also his <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> saying: <i>&#8220;Between a person and between al-Kufr (disbelief) and ash-Shirk (associating partners with Allaah in the worship of Allaah) is abandoning the Salaah (Prayer).&#8221; </i>Recorded by Muslim in his Saheeh (1/62). Also the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> mentions the Salaah (Prayer) to his Companions one day, saying: <i>&#8220;Whosoever safeguards them, then that will be a light, a proof and a means of salvation for him on the Day of Resurrection. But whosoever does not safeguard them, then he has no light, nor proof nor salvation and on the Day of Resurrection he will be gathered along with Fir&#8217;awn, Haamaan, Qaaroon and &#8216;Ubayy ibn Khalf.&#8221;</i> Recorded by Imaam Ahmad with a <i>Hasan isnaad</i>.7</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the Scholars have said, in explanation to the above hadeeth, that whosoever leaves the Prayer, the he will be raised up, on the Day of Judgement, along with those <i>kaafirs</i> (disbelievers). Thus, if the reason for his leaving the Prayer was due to leadership, then he has resembled Fir&#8217;awn in this, and would be raised along with him and sent to the Fire of the Day of Resurrection. If the reason for leaving the Prayer was due to his ministerial post or a similar occupation, then he has resembled Haamaan, the minister to Fir&#8217;awn, and he will be raised along with him on the Day of Resurrection and sent to the Fire. If the reason for leaving the Prayer was due to wealth and false desires, then he has resembled Qaaroon &#8211; upon whom Allaah bestowed great wealth, yet he became arrogant against the truth and followed his false desires, due to this wealth &#8211; and would be raised up along with him on the Day of Resurrection and sent to the Fire. If the reason for leaving the Prayer was business, or other such social transactions and work, then he has resembled &#8216;Ubayy ibn Khalf, the famous trader from the disbelievers of Makkah &#8211; so he will be raised up along with him on the Day of Resurrection and sent to the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah for forgiveness and protection from their condition and the likes of their condition.&#8221;8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>PRAYING DURING THE FRIDAY SERMON</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: There was a discussion that took place between some brothers and myself regarding praying two rak&#8217;ahs upon entering the mosque and the Imaam is delivering the Friday <i>khutbah</i> (sermon). I ask you &#8211; O noble Shaykh &#8211; to give us a ruling concerning this. Is it allowed or not? The brothers who generally come and pray in the mosque are upon the <i>madhhab</i> of Imaam Maalik.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: &#8220;The Sunnah upon entering the masjid (mosque) is to pray two <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> of <i>tahyatul masjid </i>(a Prayer far greeting the mosque), even if the Imaam is delivering the Friday khutbah, due to the sayings of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>: <i>&#8220;When anyone of you enters the masjid, then let him not sit until he prays two rak&#8217;ahs.&#8221;</i> Recorded by al-Bukhaaree (1/293) and Muslim (2/155). Likewise Muslim relates in his Saheeh (3/1415), from Jaabir <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i>, that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;When any of you comes on the day of Jumu&#8217;ah (Friday), and the Imaam is delivering the khutbah, then let him pray two rak&#8217;ahs and let him make them short.&#8221;</i> So this is a clear and authentic text concerning this issue. It is not permissible for anyone to oppose it. So perhaps this particular narration did not reach Imaam Maalik <i>rahimahullaah</i>, if it is established from him that he prohibited the praying of these two rak&#8217;ahs at the time of the khutbah. However, when the authentic Sunnah becomes clear, then it is not permissible to oppose it with the saying of anyone else &#8211; whosoever he may be.9 About this Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;O you who Believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger and those in authority amongst you. And if you differ in anything amongst yourselves then refer it to Allaah and His Messenger if you do believe in Allaah and the Last Day. That is better and most suitable for final determination.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:59]. And He &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And in whatever you differ, then the judgement belongs to Allaah,&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:10]. And it is known that the judgement of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> is from the judgement of Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; as Allaah said: <b>&#8220;Whosoever obeys the Messenger, has indeed obeyed Allaah.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:80]. And with Allaah rests the power and ability.&#8221;10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>BEING TOO SHY TO CENSURE EVIL</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: I am a young woman who hates <i>gheebah</i> (backbiting) and <i>nameemah</i> (tale carrying). Sometimes I am amongst a group of people who speak about others and the begin to backbite and spread tales. In my soul, I hate and despise what they are doing, but I am too shy and therefore do not have the ability to make them stop. Also, I have no other place to go to get away from them. Allaah knows that I wish they would start talking about something else. So am I sinful in sitting with them, and what is the obligation upon me in this case? May Allaah grant you what is best for Islaam and the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: &#8220;In this case you are sinful, unless you repel the evil. If they accept that from you, then all praises are due to Allaah. If they do not accept that from you, then you must leave them and not sit with them. This is because Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; stated: <b>&#8220;When you see those engaged in false conversation about Our Verses, by mocking at them, then keep away from them until they turn to another topic.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:68]. Likewise, the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever sees an evil then let him change it by his hand. if he is unable to do this, then let him change it with his tongue. If he is unable to do this, then let him change it with his heart &#8211; and that is the weakest of eemaan (faith).&#8221;</i> This was Recorded by Muslim in his Saheeh (no.49). And the verses and narrations with this meaning are plentiful.&#8221;11</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>RUNNING AWAY FROM THE QUR&#8217;AAN</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: What is your advice &#8211; O Shaykh &#8211; for those who go without reading the Qur&#8217;aan for a month, or even many months, and who have no excuse for such behaviors? However, you will find some of them reading those magazines that contain no benefit for them, and following them up closely!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: &#8220;It is recommended for every Believing man and woman to recite the Book of Allaah often, with due contemplation and understanding. This may be done by using a copy of the Qur&#8217;aan or from one&#8217;s memory. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;This is a Book which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, that you may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember.&#8221; </b>[Soorah Saad 38:29].And:<b> &#8220;Indeed those who recite the Book of Allaah and offer the Prayer perfectly and spend in charity out of what We have provided for them &#8211; secretly and openly &#8211; hope for a sure trade-gain that will never perish. That He may pay them their wages in full and give them even more out of His Grace. Indeed, He is Oft-Forgiving, ready to appreciate good deeds.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Faatir 35:29-30].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The aforementioned recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan includes both reciting and acting upon it. The recitation is to be done with contemplation and understanding of it. Sincerity to Allaah is a means of complying with and acting upon the Qur&#8217;aan, and its recitation contains a great reward &#8211; as the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Recite the Qur&#8217;aan. For on the Day of Resurrection, it shall come as an intercessor for its companion.&#8221;</i> This was recorded by Muslim in his Saheeh (no.804). The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> also said: &#8220;The best of you is he who learns the Qur&#8217;aan and teaches it.&#8221; This was Recorded by al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh (3/66). Another narration states: <i>&#8220;Whosoever reads one harf (letter) of the Qur&#8217;aan shall receive a good deed and ten good deeds similar to it. I do not say that Alif Laam Meem is a harf but Alif is a harf and Laam is a harf and Meem is a harf.&#8221;</i>12 The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said to &#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8220;Amr ibn al-&#8216;Aas: <i>&#8220;Complete the recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan once a month.&#8221;</i> He said: I am able to do more than that. So he said: <i>&#8220;Then complete its recital once in seven days.&#8221;</i>13 The Companions used to complete the entire Qur&#8217;aan once every seven days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advise all the readers of the Qur&#8217;aan to increase in their reading of it, with contemplation and understanding it, along with sincerity to Allaah in this &#8211; with the purpose of learning and benefiting from the Qur&#8217;aan. They should read the entire Qur&#8217;aan once a month. If, however, they are able to do more than this without any difficulty, then they should complete it in less than this time. However, it is best not to complete it in less than three days, since this is the least amount of time that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> mentioned to &#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8216;Amr ibn al-&#8216;Aas. This is because if it is read in less than three days, the person becomes hasty and lacks thought and concentration &#8230;&#8221;14</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: <span style="color:#993300;">There are some people here, who keep away from [attending] lessons on &#8216;aqeedah (creed/beliefs), and they say: &#8216;We are Muslims, we are not unbelievers or idol-worshippers such that we have to learn &#8216;aqeedah or attend lectures about it&#8217; So, O noble Shaykh, what is your view regarding this!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: Teaching the Muslims [the correct] &#8216;aqeedah does not mean that we have judged them to be unbelievers. Rather, we teach the Muslims about &#8216;aqeedah in order for them to know about it thoroughly, and know what matters nullify it and what matters are contrary to it. Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan, one of the distinguished Companions &#8211; radiallaahu &#8216;anhu &#8211; said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;People used to ask the Messenger about the good, but I used to ask him about the evil, for fear of falling into it.&#8221;</span> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise &#8216;Umar ibn al-Khattaab radiallaahu &#8216;anhu said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Soon the bonds of Islaam will be loosened bit by bit, because people will enter into Islaam but will be unaware of Jaahiliyyah (ignorant practices that Islaam opposes).&#8221;</span> [3] Thus, when we teach &#8216;aqeedoh, this does not imply that we have judged those whom we are teaching to be non-Muslims. Rather, what it means is that we desire that they should be thoroughly aware of the correct Islaamic &#8216;aqeedah; so as to cling to it, and to be aware of what opposes it; so as to keep far away from it. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said, whilst addressing His Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;So have knowledge about Laa ilaaha illallaah (i.e, have knowledge that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah), and seek forgiveness for your sins, and for the believing men and women.&#8221;</span> [Soorah Muhammad 47:19].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is essential that a person learns and that he does not content himself with merely saying: &#8216;I am a Muslim.&#8217; Yes indeed, you are a Muslim &#8211; and ail praise is for Allaah! However, if one of you were asked as to what Islaam means, or you were asked to explain what Islaam is, then many of you would not be able to correctly explain this. If one of you were to be asked to explain what are those factors which nullify Islaam, then many of you would not be able to explain this. Thus, if a person is ignorant [of such fundamentals], it is possible that he may fall into falsehood without realising it. If one of you were asked to explain the pillars of Islaam or eemaan (faith) that the Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam explained and taught, we would find that most people would be unable to do so. So how is it that a person [suffices with] saying: &#8216;l am a Muslim,&#8217; yet does not know these [basic] matters!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unfortunately, many of the daa&#8217;ees (callers to Islaam) are themselves unaware of [basic matters such as] what are the conditions for Prayer, or unaware of the rules and regulations concerning wudhoo (ablution) and those matters which</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">invalidate wudhoo. Some of them do not even know what matters form the arkaan (pillars) of the Prayer, or form its waajibaat (obligations), or those matters which invalidate the Prayer. So what Islaam are they calling to! Islaam is not merely a call, rather it is a reality to be learnt and practiced. So it is essential to acquire sound knowledge and understanding of the Religion. This is because a person who does not have sound knowledge, may fall into dangers without even realizing it; just like a person who walks down a path, but is ignorant of the fact that along this path there is a ditch, or a hole, or even an ambush. Yet [due to his ignorance] he ends up falling into the hole, or the ambush, without even realizing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus it is essential to learn about tawheed, since it is tawheed that is the basic foundation [of both the Religion and the correct Islaamic &#8216;aqeedah]. Indeed, no one abstains from learning about tawheed [and those matters it necessitates, as well as its limits, conditions, fundamentals, clear proofs, fruits and consequences, and those matters which increase and strengthen it, and those that decrease and weaken it, etc.] except one of two people: [i] an ignorant person &#8211; and the ignorant person&#8217;s [view] is not to be given any weight; or [ii] a bigoted deviant &#8211; one who desires to avert people from the &#8216;aqeedah of pure tawheed, and who wishes to conceal from the people his own false beliefs, and those other deviant beliefs that are [falsely] ascribed to Islaam. And this is possibly the Ease of many of those who abstain from learning about tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And it is not proper for all the Believers to go out together and fight. From every troop of them only a party of them should go forth, so that those who remain behind may gain understanding of the Religion so that they may [instruct and] warn their people when they return to them, in order that they may beware.&#8221;</span> [Soorah at-Tawbaa 9:122].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, the Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Whoever Allaah desires to show goodness to, He gives him the understanding of the Religion.&#8221;</span> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of this hadeeth is that whenever Allaah does not want to show goodness to a person, He does not give him the understanding of the Religion. So the one who says: &#8216;l do not need to learn &#8216;aqeedah.&#8217; It is as if he is saying: &#8216;l do not need to gain understanding of the Religion!&#8217; And this is said by either an ignorant person, or one who is misguided!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>kalimah</em> (word) <em>La ilahah ilallah</em> (that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah), if it said with truthfulness and sincerity from the heart, and acted upon in that which it necessitates &#8211; outwardly and inwardly &#8211; then its effect will indeed be praiseworthy upon both the individual and the society.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the most important of its effects are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <strong>Uniting the word of the Muslims</strong>: This will result in strengthening the Muslims and assisting them in defeating their enemies &#8211; as long as they continue to follow and practice the same single religion, and as long as they adhere to the same single <em>&#8216;aqidah</em>(belief). Allah &#8211; <em>the Most High</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p><span class="quran"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And hold fast altogether to the rope of Allah and do not be divided.&#8221;</span> </span>[<cite>Al-Qur&#8217;an</cite> 3:103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="quran"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;It is He Who has strengthened you with His help and with the Believers, and moreover, He has put love and affection between their hearts. If you were to spend all that is in the earth, then never could you have united their hearts, but Allah has united them. Indeed He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.&#8221;</span> </span>[<cite>Al-Qur&#8217;an</cite> 8:62-63]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And differing in matters of <em>&#8216;aqidah</em> (beliefs) is the cause for splitting, disunity and hostility, as Allah &#8211; <em>the Most High</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="quran"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Indeed those who split-up their religion and become sects, you have no part with them in the least.&#8221;</span> </span>[<cite>Al-Qur&#8217;an</cite> 6:159]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="quran"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;But people have cut-off their affair of unity between them and have become sects, each party rejoicing in that which is with itself.&#8221;</span>  </span>[<cite>Al-Qur&#8217;an</cite> 23:53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So people cannot truly be united except upon the correct concept of <em>&#8216;iman</em> (faith) and the correct <em>&#8216;aqidah</em> of <em>Tawhid</em>, which are both direct implications of <em>La ilahah ilallah</em>. One need only consider the condition of the Arabs before and after Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] <strong>Prevalence of safety and peace in a unified society</strong>, which believes in and abides by <em>La ilahah ilallah</em>. Since the individuals in such a society will take care in doing only that which Allah has made <em>halal</em> (lawful) and abandoning that which Allah has made<em>haram</em> (unlawful) &#8211; acting in accordance with what the <em>&#8216;aqidah</em> necessitates upon them. So this will prevent people from enmity, oppression and injustice, whilst directing them towards co-operation, love and deep brotherhood for the sake of Allah, acting upon His &#8211; <em>the Most High&#8217;s</em> &#8211; saying:</p>
<p><span class="quran"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Indeed the Believers are but brothers.&#8221;</span> </span>[<cite>Al-Qur&#8217;an</cite> 49:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is clearly reflected in the life of the Arabs before and after believing in <em>La ilahah ilallah</em>. Before Islam, they lived in hostility and insecurity, constantly fighting and killing each other. However, when they embraced Islam this all changed, and the same people lived with each other in peace and an atmosphere of love and brotherhood prevailed, as Allah &#8211; <em>the Most High</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="quran"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and those who are with him are strong and mighty against the unbelievers and merciful and kind amongst each other.&#8221;</span> </span>[<cite>Al-Qur&#8217;an</cite> 48:29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="quran"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And remember the favour of Allah upon you; for you were enemies and He joined your hearts in love, so that by His grace you became brothers.&#8221;</span> </span>[<cite>Al-Qur&#8217;an</cite> 3:103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] <strong>Achievement of happiness, attainment of the <em>khilafah</em> (succession of power and authority) in the earth</strong>, maintaining purity of the religion and being steadfastness against the onslaught of false beliefs and foreign ideologies. Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="quran"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Allah has promised to those amongst you who truly have <em>&#8216;iman</em> (true faith and belief) and act in obedience to Allah and His Messenger, that He will grant them rulership upon the earth, just as He granted it to those before them, and that He will establish their Religion for them and grant them the authority to practice their Religion which He chose and ordered them with. And He will certainly change their situation to one of security, after their fear. Providing that they worship and obey Me, not associating anything else in worship with Me. Then, whoever rejects this favour by disobedience to their Lord &#8211; then they are the rebellious transgressors.&#8221;</span> </span>[<cite>Al-Qur&#8217;an</cite> 24:55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allah &#8211; <em>the Most Perfect</em> &#8211; has made achievement of these lofty goals conditional upon worshipping and obeying Him and not associating any partners with Him. And this is the true meaning of <em>La ilahah ilallah</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>[Q]</b>: There was a discussion that took place between some brothers and myself regarding praying two rak’ahs upon entering the mosque and the Imaam is delivering the Friday <i>khutbah</i> (sermon). I ask you – O noble Shaykh – to give us a ruling concerning this. Is it allowed or not? The brothers who generally come and pray in the mosque are upon the <i>madhhab</i> of Imaam Maalik.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: “The Sunnah upon entering the masjid (mosque) is to pray two <i>rak’ahs</i> of <i>tahyatul masjid </i>(a Prayer far greeting the mosque), even if the Imaam is delivering the Friday khutbah, due to the sayings of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>“When anyone of you enters the masjid, then let him not sit until he prays two rak’ahs.”</i></span> Recorded by al-Bukhaaree (1/293) and Muslim (2/155).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise Muslim relates in his Saheeh (3/1415), from Jaabir <i>radiallaahu ‘anhu</i>, that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>“When any of you comes on the day of Jumu’ah (Friday), and the Imaam is delivering the khutbah, then let him pray two rak’ahs and let him make them short.”</i> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a clear and authentic text concerning this issue. It is not permissible for anyone to oppose it. So perhaps this particular narration did not reach Imaam Maalik <i>rahimahullaah</i>, if it is established from him that he prohibited the praying of these two rak’ahs at the time of the khutbah. However, when the authentic Sunnah becomes clear, then it is not permissible to oppose it with the saying of anyone else – whosoever he may be. [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">About this Allaah – the Mighty and Majestic – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“O you who Believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger and those in authority amongst you. And if you differ in anything amongst yourselves then refer it to Allaah and His Messenger if you do believe in Allaah and the Last Day. That is better and most suitable for final determination.”</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:59].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He – the Most Perfect – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“And in whatever you differ, then the judgement belongs to Allaah,”</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:10].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is known that the judgement of Allaah’s Messenger <i>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i> is from the judgement of Allaah – the Mighty and Majestic – as Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“Whosoever obeys the Messenger, has indeed obeyed Allaah.”</b>[Soorah an-Nisaa 4:80].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And with Allaah rests the power and ability.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<i>Al-Fataawaa</i> (1/53)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] Imaam an-Nawawee – <i>rahimahullaah</i> – said about the hadeeth in <i>Sharh Saheeh Muslim</i> (6/ 164): “I cannot imagine any Scholar who comes to knows about it and believes in the correctness of it, and would then oppose it.”</p>

<p><b>[Question]</b></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">Sometimes whilst praying – especially during <i>rukoo’</i> (bowing) and <i>sujood</i> (prostration) – part of the <i>awrah</i>(private parts) of a person becomes exposed due to his wearing trousers. So what is the ruling concerning the wearing of trousers whilst praying?</span></p>
<p><strong>[Answer] </strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> “If the man’s trousers cover what is between his navel and his knees and are loose fitting, wide and baggy, then it fulfills the condition for the correctness of the Prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, what is more preferable is to wear a <strong><i>qamees</i> </strong>(long shirt) – which reaches half-way down to the shins, or just above the anklebone – over the trousers. This is a more complete form of covering the <i>awrah</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, Prayer in an <i>izaar</i> (a loose lower garment) is more preferable than Prayer in a pair of trousers without a long shirt – since the <i>izaar</i> far better covers the <i>awrah</i> than a pair of trousers.”</p>

This continues to be my wish up until now, as I do not see any solutions to my problems except death; it is the only thing that can save me from this torment. Is this behaviour <i>haraam</i> (forbidden) for me?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: <strong>Shaykh Ibn al-‘Uthaymeen</strong> – <em>rahima</em><i>hullaah</i> – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“When a person wishes for death due to the hardships and afflictions that have befallen him, then he is doing something that Allaah’s Messenger <i>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i> prohibited, when he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>“None of you should wish for death due to some harm that has come to him, rather, if he has such a wish then let him say: O Allaah! Give me life if You know that life is better for me. And give me death if You know that death is better for me.” </i></span>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is not allowed for anyone to wish for death on account of some harm, hardship or difficulty that has come to him. In fact, he should have <i>sabr</i> (patience) and expect a reward from Allaah – the Most High – due to his being patient, and he should wait for relief to come to him; just as the Prophet <i>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>“And know that victory comes with patience, relief with distress, and ease with hardship.”</i></span>[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the one who is afflicted with any affliction should know that those afflictions are an expiation for some of the sins he has committed. Indeed, no Believer is afflicted with any kind of grief, pain or suffering except that Allaah expiates – due to that – some of his sins; even if it be the harm caused by a mere pricking of a thorn. So when a person has patience and hopes in a reward from Allaah, he reaches the level of being amongst the <i>saabiroon</i> (those who truly have patience), and this is a very lofty level. <span style="line-height:1.5;">Allaah – the Most High said about its people:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“And give glad tidings to the apatient ones; those who, when afflicted by a calamity, say: Indeed we belong to Allaah, and to Him shall we truly return.”</span></em> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:155-156].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The woman in the question feels that there is no solution for her problems except death. I believe that this is a mistaken view.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Death does not solve any problems. In fact, sometimes it only increases the difficulties. How many people die whilst being afflicted with calamities, difficulties and suffering, but they had been wronging themselves by sinning, and did not give up their sins or repent to Allaah. So death, in this case, is just a quicker coming of punishment.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps if such a person had remained alive, then Allaah would have guided him him to the doors of repentance, seeking forgiveness, patience, facing up to the problems and expecting relief. All of this would have been good for him. Therefore, it is upon you – the questioner – to be patient and expect relief from Allaah – the Mighty and Majestic – just as Allaah – the Most High – said in His Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“So indeed with hardship here is relief. Indeed with hardship there is relief.”</span> </em>[Soorah Inshiraah 94:5-6].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <i>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i> said in the authentic narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>“Victory comes with patience; relief with affliction, and ease with hardship.” </i></span>[5] [6]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;">Al-Istiqaamah Magazine &#8211; Issue No.7</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> Rabee&#8217; ul-Awwal 1418H / July 1997</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;">By Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Jameel Zaynoo</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Understand that judging by what Allaah revealed in His Book is incumbent upon the Muslim, and not doing so results an many calamities befalling the Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That there would always continue to be a group from this Ummah clinging to the truth and to the pure Tawheed of Allaah until the day of Judgment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Say: Allaah has power to send punishment upon you from above you, or from under your feet; or to cover you in confusion with party strife; and make you taste the inter-fighting and violence of one another. See how We variously explain the Aayaat (proofs and signs), so that they may understand.” [Sooratul-An’aam 6:65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, when this verse was revealed: “Say: Allaah has power to send punishment upon you from above you.” So he said: “I seek refuge in Your Face.” “Or from under your feet.” He said: “I seek refuge in Your Face.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Or to cover you in confusion with party strife, and make you taste the inter-fighting and violence of one another.” So Allaah’s Messenger (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said: “This is lighter or easier.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said: “Indeed Allaah gathered up the earth for me so that I saw its eastern and western parts, and indeed the dominion of my Ummah will reach what was gathered up for me from it. And I have been granted the two treasures of gold and silver. And indeed I asked my Lord for my Ummah that it should not be totally destroyed by a prevailing famine, nor to allow on enemy to totally conquer it, except from amongst themselves. So my Lord said: O Muhammad! When I decree a matter, then it is not reversed. I grant to you for your Ummah that it would not be totally destroyed by a prevailing famine, nor will it be totally conquered by on external enemy, even if all the notions were to rally against it However, a group from your Ummah will destroy one another and imprison one another.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) also said: “I asked my Lord for three things, I was granted two; but prevented from one: I asked my Lord that He should not destroy my Ummah with drought and famine, so He granted it to me. I asked my Lord that He should not destroy my Ummah with drowning, so he granted it to me. And I asked Him not to cause my Ummah to fight amongst themselves, but he refused that to me.” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this inter-fighting that has befallen the Muslims has been further emphasized in his (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) saying: “And when your leaders do not judge by the Book of Allaah, not seeking the good and welfare with Allaah has revealed, then Allaah would cause them to fight one another.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, in an addition to the second narration: “Indeed, what I fear for my Ummah are misguided leaders, and that when the sword is drown out against them, it will not be lifted from them until the Day of Judgement. And the Hour will not come, until sections of my Ummah will follow the mushrikeen (those who worship others along with Allaah), and until many sections of my Ummah will worship idols. And there will be in my Ummah thirty liars; all of whom will claim that he is a Prophet. But I am the last and the seal of the Prophets; there is no Prophet after me. And there will not cease to be a group from my Ummah being helped upon the truth, not being harmed by those who oppose them; until the commend of Allaah comes.” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">SOME BENEFITS FROM THE ABOVE AAYAH AND HADEETH:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]: It shows the great power of Allaah &#8211; the Most High – in sending punishment to the previous nations, from above them, and from beneath their feet, causing them to be annihilated and destroyed. Due to this, Allaah’s Messenger (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) sought refuge and protection in the Face of his Lord against his Ummah being punished in a similar manner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]: The first hadeeth (narration) affirms that Allaah – the Most High – has a wajh (Face), but in a manner that befits His Greatness and Majesty, there being any tashbeeh (resemblance) between Allaah and between that of His creation; as Allaah said: “There is none like Him; and He is the all-Hearing, the all-Seeing.” [Sooratush-Shooraa 42:11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]: It shows the great power of Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; in that whenever the Muslims abandon judging by the Sharee’ah (Divinely Prescribed Law) of Allaah; but rather take to manmade laws that oppose the Law of Allaah &#8211; which, with deep regret, is happening now &#8211; then Allaah causes the Ummah to split-up into sects and parties, and makes them fight one another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]: It Shows the might of Allaah in that He gathered-up the earth for His Messenger (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), so that he saw its eastern and western parts; and that the dominion of his Ummah would extend over all that which was gathered-up for him, from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]: It shows the mercy of Allaah to the Muslim Ummah, in His not sending against them a punishment that would totally destroy the entire Ummah; but it would only cause destruction to parts of the Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]: An-Nawawee (d.676H) &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said: “In this hadeeth is a clear and apparent miracle, all of which has come to pass &#8211; so all praise be to Allaah.” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]: It also shows the mercy of Allaah to the Muslim Ummah in that He has not allowed an external enemy to overpower them, such that they have complete control over them. Rather, Allaah has caused some parts of the Ummah to fight against others; and this is far easier than the former case.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]: It Shows the fear that Allaah’s Messenger (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) had for his Ummah with regards to the misguided leaders who would not take hold of the Book and the Sunnah; and how he warned against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]: That when the sword has been drawn out against this Ummah, then it would not be lifted from it until the Day of Judgement &#8211; as is happening at this very time now.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]: It proves that shirk would be present in the Ummah. And shirk is: Directing worship, or forms of worship, to other than Allaah, such as making du’aa (supplication) to other that Allaah, or judging by other than what Allaah has legislated and revealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]: We are informed about the existence of those who would claim that they are Prophets and that they are all liars in this claim; such as Musaylimah al-Kadhdhaab in earlier times, and in more recent times Ghulaam Ahmad Mirza, the Qaadiyaanee (whose followers are called Qaadiyaanees).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12]: That there would always continue to be a group from this Ummah clinging to the truth and to the pure Tawheed of Allaah until the day of Judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam an-Nawawee &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“As for this group, then Imaam al-Bukhaaree (d.256H) said: “They are the people of knowledge.” And Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (d.241H) said: “If they are not Ahlul-Hadeeth (the Scholars of Hadeeth), then I do not know who they can be.” Qaadee ’Iyaad said: “What Imaam Ahmad meant by that was Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah and whosoever holds the ’aqeedah (belief) of Ahlul-Hadeeth.” I say: It is possible that this group could be scattered amongst the various categories of Believers, from them:- the brave warriors, the Scholars of Hadeeth, the zuhhaad (those who abstain from the world in a praiseworthy manner), those that enjoin the good and forbid the evil, and other categories of people who do good.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibnul-Mubaarak (d.181H) &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said: “In my view they are Ashaabul-Hadeeth (the companions of Hadeeth).” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the preferred saying is that this Aided and Victorious Group are those that act in accordance with the authentic hadeeth, not giving precedence to the saying of anyone over and above the saying of Allaah and His Messenger (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah Magazine, Issue No.8 &#8211; Shawwal 1418H / February 1998</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Seek Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness for your sins, Indeed Allaah is Most-Forgiving, Most-Merciful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:106].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Whosoever does an evil action, or oppresses his ownself through sinning, then seeks Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness, will indeed find that Allaah is Most Forgiving, Most-Merciful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:110].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam as-Sa&#8217;dee (d.1376H)- rahimahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whosoever commits an act of disobedience and plunges himself into sin, but then sincerely does istighfaar (seeks Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness) for it &#8211; which involves:- [i] affirming that it is a sin, [ii] having regret for doing it, [iii] abstaining from it, and [iv] having a firm resolve not to do it again &#8211; then such is the person who has the promise of Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness and mercy &#8211; and indeed Allaah never breaks His Promise. So Allaah will forgive the sinner, purify him of his sin, and accept from him those righteous action that he had previously done [before committing the sin] &#8230;And know that [the term] &#8216;evil actions&#8217; include, in general, all acts of disobedience, whether minor or major. They are called &#8216;evil actions&#8217; because of the terrible punishments that they necessitate, and because of their evil effects upon the soul. Likewise [the term] &#8216;oppressing oneself through wrong-doing&#8217; includes the oppression of committing Shirk (directing worship, or any form of worship, to other than Allaah), as well as the [other forms of injustices] which are lesser than it. These two terms have also been explained in a way whereby one is inclusive of the other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Evil actions have also been explained here to mean evil actions against people with regards to their blood, property or honour. Oppressing oneself through wrong-doing has [also] been explained here to mean those sins and acts of disobedience that a person commits against Allaah. It is called oppressing oneself because the person&#8217;s soul or life is not actually his property so that he may do anything that he likes with it. Rather, this life, or soul, belongs to Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; Who has given it to the person as a trust, and commanded him to be just and to cling to the Straight Path, both in words and deeds, and has taught this soul what has been commanded for it and the actions that it is required to perform. So a person who does not cling to this [Straight] Path is actually oppressing his ownself, acting treacherously, and swerving from the path of justice and fairness; the opposite of which is injustice and oppression.&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: O son of Aadam, so long as you call upon Me and hove hope in Me, I shall forgive you for what you have done, and I shall not mind. O son of Aadam, were your sins to reach the clouds of the sky and were you then to ask forgiveness of Me, I would forgive you. O son of Aadam, were you to come to me with sins nearly as great as the earth and were you then to face Me, ascribing no partner to Me in the worship of Me, I would bring you forgiveness as great as it.&#8221;</i>2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Exalted &#8211; also said about istighfaar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allaah will not punish them whilst you (the Prophet &#8216;alayhis-salaam) are amongst them, nor will He punish them whilst they seek Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anfaal 8:33].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah informs us that there are two factors which are the cause of safety from the terrible punishment of Allaah, and would continue to be so as long as they are present in the Ummah: [i] the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam being amongst them, and [ii] their seeking Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbaas radiallaahu &#8216;anhu said:<br />
&#8220;There are two [causes] why the people remained safe, [i] the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam living amongst them, and [ii] their seeking Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness. The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam has now departed, so all that remains is seeking Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, the more negligent we become in seeking Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness, the more we open up the doors of Allaah&#8217;s punishment; both to ourselves as individuals and to the society as a whole. So &#8211; O Muslims &#8211; let us be mindful!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan &#8211; <i>hafidahullaah</i> &#8211; relates:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah &#8211; the Majestic, the Most High &#8211; orders us to verify any news that reaches us concerning a group or party from amongst the Muslims, when an evil news reaches us which necessitates fighting or opposing this group. Allaah &#8211; the Mighty, the Most High &#8211; orders us not be hasty and rush into this affair, until we have verified the matter. Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! When a wicked person comes to you with some news, ascertain and verify it, less you harm someone in ignorance and then afterwards regret for what you have done.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Hujuraat 49:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: If some news reaches you about a group or party from amongst the people, concerning an action that they have done and which deserves to be fought against, then do not be hasty about the matter, nor announce war against them, nor attack them &#8211; until you have verified the authenticity of the report.&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Muslim relates in his <i>Saheeh</i> (no.5):<br />
Abu Hurayrah <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> relates that the Prophet <i>sallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;It is enough to render a man a liar that he relates everything he hears.&#8221;</i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah Issue No.2 &#8211; Safar 1417H / July 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THE MASTER OF SUPPLICATIONS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The master of supplications for seeking Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness is when a servant says: <b> O Allaah! You are my Lord and none has the right to be worshipped except You. Indeed You created me and I am Your slave. I abide by my promise and covenant to You as best as I can. I seek refuge in You from the evils that I have done. I acknowledge Your favours upon me and I acknowledge my sin. So forgive me. Indeed none can forgive sin except You.</b> [<i>Allaahumma anta Rabbee, laa ilaaha illaa anta, khalaqtanee, wa anaa &#8216;abduka, wa anaa &#8216;alaa abdika wa wa&#8217;dika mastata&#8217;tu, a&#8217;oodhu bika min sharri maa sana&#8217;tu, aboo&#8217;u laka bi ni&#8217;matika &#8216;alayaa, wa aboo&#8217;u bi dhanbee, faghfirlee, fa innahu laa yaghfirudh-dhanooba illaa anta</i>] Whosoever enters upon the evening saying this, then dies that night, would enter Paradise. And whosoever enters upon the morning saying this, then dies that day, will enter Paradise.&#8221; [Related by al-Bukhaaree (11/97-98) and Ahmad (5/356), from the narration of Shaddaad ibn Aws and Buraydah ibn al-Haseeb <i> radiallaahu &#8216;anhumaa</i>.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>A POINT OF BENEFIT</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim (d.751H) &#8211; <i> rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said in al-Waabilus-Sayyib (pp.16-17):<br />
&#8220;Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) said: &#8220;Knowing the path to Allaah lies in recognising Allaah&#8217;s favours and considering the sins and shortcomings of one&#8217;s self.&#8221; This is the meaning of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> saying &#8211; as occurs in the authentic narration from Shaddaad and Buraydah <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhumaa</i> &#8211; that he said: <i>&#8220;The master of supplications in seeking the forgiveness of Allaah is when a savant says: O Allaah! You are my Lord&#8230; &#8220;</i> So recognition of Allaah&#8217;s favours and consideration of one&#8217;s own sins and shortcomings have both been collectively mentioned in the (above) supplication, since he <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;I acknowledge Your favours upon me and I acknowledge my sins.&#8221; </i> So recognition of Allaah&#8217;s Favours necessitates praising and thanking Him for His favours and bounties, which in turn necessitates love for Him. Whilst consideration of one&#8217;s own sins and shortcomings necessitates humility to Allaah and a feeling of lowliness and humbleness to Him. This in turn necessitates repenting to Allaah continuously, and that one considers himself as being poor and in need of Allaah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Spreading Mischief Through THE ART OF LYING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;Indeed truthfulness leads to piety and obedience and piety and obedience lead to Paradise. And a person continues to be truthful until he is recorded with Allaah as a truthful person. And indeed lying leads to wickedness and wickedness lead to the Fire. And a person continues to lie until he is recorded with Allaah as a liar.&#8221; </i>[Related by al-Bukhaaree (3/30) and Muslim (no.2607), from Ibn Mas&#8217;ood <i>radiallaabu &#8216;anhu</i>.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>DESTROYING COMPREHENSIVE BROTHERHOOD</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaanee &#8211; <i> hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; said in <i>Fiqhul-Waaqi&#8217;</i> (pp.13-14), whilst speaking about certain trials that have afflicted the Muslims, destroying their unity, weakening their resolve and splitting their ranks: &#8220;Part of this trial has struck at the root of the hearts of a great number of <i>daa&#8217;ees</i> (callers to Islaam) and students of knowledge, so that they have &#8211; regretfully &#8211; become divided between themselves. Some of them speaking ill of others, and the others criticising the remainder and refuting them. These rebuttals on their own, or these criticisms alone will neither harm the one refuting, nor the one refuted, since &#8211; with the people of justice &#8211; the truth is recognised by its light and its proofs, which is not the case with the people of blind-sectarianism and deviation. <b>However, what will harm them is speech without knowledge, talking without restraint and speaking falsely about the servants of Allaah!</b>&#8220;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">By Shaykh Muhammad ibn Abdil-Lateef (d.1376H) and Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem (d.1389H) [1] &#8211; Al-Istiqaamah Issue No.4 &#8211; Jumâdal-Awwal 1417H / November 1996</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O you who Believe! Have tawraa (fear and obedience) of Allaah as you should do, and do not die except that you are Muslims. And hold fast all together to the rope of Allaah and do not be divided. And remember the favour of Allaah upon you, for you were once enemies one to another, but He joined your hearts together, so that by His Grace, you became brothers. And you were on the brink of a pit of Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus does Allaah make His Signs clear to you, that you may become guided. Let there arise out of you a group of people inviting to all that is good, enjoining all that is good and forbidding all that is evil. They are the ones who are successful. And do not be like those who split up and differed amongst themselves, after the clear proofs had come to them. For them is a tremendous punishment. On the Day of Resurrection, some faces will be white and some faces will be black.&#8221; [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:102-105].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the Scholars of <i>tafseer</i> (Qur&#8217;aanic explanation) said: &#8220;The faces of the people of Sunnah and Unity will be white, whereas the faces of the people of Sectarianism and Differing will be black.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said: &#8220;So Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; ordered all of the Believers to cling to the Rope of Allaah collectively, and not to split-up. And clinging to this Rope of Allaah has been explained as meaning: Clinging to the Book of Allaah, to His Religion, to Islaam, to <i>ikhlaas</i> (purity of beliefs and actions to Allaah), to His Commands, to His Covenant, to His obedience and also to the Jamaa&#8217;ah. All of these explanations have been related from the Sahaabah (Companions) and also From those who followed them in righteousness &#8211; and all of it is correct. For the Qur&#8217;aan commands one with the Religion of Islaam; and that is Allaah&#8217;s Covenant, and His Command, and obedience to Him. It also entails clinging together collectively as a Jamaa&#8217;ah. And the Religion of Islaam &#8211; in its reality &#8211; is <i>ikhlaas</i> (purity and sincerity in beliefs and action) to and for Allaah alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> relates:<br />
The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Indeed Allaah is pleased with three things: That you worship Allaah alone without associating a partner along with Him; that you hold fast altogether to the Rope of Allaah and not to become divided; and that you give sincere advice to whomsoever Allaah puts in charge of your affairs.&#8221;</i>2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; has made oppressing the Muslims, both their living and their dead, <i>haraam</i> (forbidden). And he has made sacred their blood, their wealth and their honour. And it is established from the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> that he said during the farewell Hajj (Pilgrimage): <i>&#8220;Indeed your blood, your property and your honour is sacred to each other, just like this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this city of yours. Have I not conveyed the message. Those who are present must convey (my words) to those who are absent. Perhaps the one to whom it is conveyed understands it better than the one who directly hears it.&#8221;</i>3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Those who harm Believing men and women undeservingly, carry upon themselves the crime of slander and clear sin.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:58].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, whosoever harms any Believer, living or dead, not because of any sin sin which necessitates that &#8211; then he has entered into this <i>Aayah</i> (verse). And whosoever is a <i>mujtahid</i> (one who is sincerely striving to arrive at the truth), then there is no sin upon him. And if the <i>mujtahid</i> is harmed by someone, then he has harmed him undeservingly. And whosoever is sinful, but has repented from such sin, or he is forgiven due to some other reason; such that there is no punishment left for him &#8211; and then someone harms him, then he has harmed him undeservingly.&#8221;4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> relates:<br />
&#8220;Do not envy one another. Do not inflate prices upon one another. Do not hate one another. Do not forsake one another. Do not undercut one another. But be worshippers of Allaah and be brothers. The Muslim is the brother of another Muslim he neither oppresses him, nor humiliates him, nor lies to him, nor holds him in contempt. And piety is right here &#8211; and he pointed to his chest three times. It is enough evil for a person to hold his brother Muslim in contempt. The whole of a Muslim for another Muslim is sacred; his blood, his property and his honour&#8221;5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Umar <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhumaa</i> relates:<br />
The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;A Muslim is a brother to another Muslim. He neither oppresses him, nor humiliates him, nor forsakes him. Whosoever helps his brother, Allaah will help him. Whosoever removes one of the griefs of this world from a Muslim, then Allaah will remove one of his griefs on the Day of Resurrection. And whosoever hides a fault of any Muslim, then Allaah will hide one of his faults of the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;</i>6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> relates:<br />
The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;None of you will truly believe until you love for your brother what you loves for yourself.&#8221;</i>7</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <i>sallalaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<br />
<i>&#8220;The example of the Believers in their mutual love and mercy is like the example of a body, if one part of the body feels pain, then all the body suffers in sleeplessness and fever.&#8221;</i>8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alavhi wa sallam</i> said:<br />
<i>&#8220;The Believer to the Believer is like a solid structure, one part supporting the other.&#8221;</i> And he interlaced his fingers to demonstrate this.9</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what we have mentioned in this small treatise, and what we hold as part of our Religion and belief in front of Allaah. And in it is a sufficiency for whosoever desires right guidance and whosoever intends to seek the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah &#8211; both for us and our Muslim brothers and sisters &#8211; safety and protection from those things that bring about His wrath and anger and painful punishment. And we seek refuge in Allaah from the passing away of His blessings, and that His grant of the state of safety and well-being is changed into something else. And we seek Allaah&#8217;s refuge from His sudden retribution and from all that which angers Him. O Allaah! We seek refuge in You from the severe trials and from the place of lowest misery and despicability, and from the evil that has been decreed, and from the abuse of the enemies. And Allaah is sufficient for us and what an excellent Guardian. And may Allaah send the praises and blessings upon Muhammad and upon his Family, Companions and followers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/translations/al-istiqaamah/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Al-Istiqaamah</strong></a> Issue No.3 &#8211; Rabî&#8217;ul-Awwal 1417H / August 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>THE YEAR OF HIS NOBLE BIRTH</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the most correct opinion of the Scholars, the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was born in the city of Makkah in the year of the Elephant (in the year 570 or 571CE), in the month of Rabee&#8217;ul-Awwal. [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>THE DAY OF HIS NOBLE BIRTH</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is an agreement amongst the Scholars that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was born on a Monday, since he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was asked about fasting on a Monday, and he said: <i>&#8220;On that day I was born and on that day Revelation descended upon me.&#8221; </i>[2] However, as regards the exact date of his birth, then the Scholars have differed about this, although the majority of Scholars say that he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was born on the 12th of Rabee&#8217;ul-Awwal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam an-Nawawee (d.676H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i>&#8211; said: &#8220;There is on agreement that he was born on Monday in the month of Rabee&#8217;ul-Awwal. There is a difference of opinion whether this day was the 2nd, 8th, 10th or 12th day of the month &#8211; and these ore the four most well-known opinions concerning this.&#8221; [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>EVENTS AT THE TIME OF HIS BIRTH</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certain miraculous events are reported to have occurred at the time that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was born. However, most of them are not authentically related, rather they are <i>da&#8217;eef</i> (week) or <i>mawdoo&#8217;</i> (fabricated) and therefore cannot be relied upon as decisive proof; such as the narration which relates that some of the galleries of Kisraa&#8217;s palace broke-up and collapsed, that the sacred-fire of the Magians died-out and that some of the churches on Lake Saawah collapsed and sank down.[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, it is authentically related that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayi wa sallam</i> said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>I am a result of the supplication of my father Ibraaheem and the glad-tidings brought by &#8216;Eesaa <i>&#8216;alayhimus salaam</i>. And my mother &#8211; when she bore me &#8211; saw that a light shone out from her, which lit up the palaces in Syria &#8230;</strong> &#8221; [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>CELEBRATING THE DAY OF HIS NOBLE BIRTH</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Faakihaanee (d.734H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> -said: [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Celebrating his birthday has no basis in the Book nor the Sunnah, nor is this action recorded from any one of the Scholars of this Ummah; those who are taken as examples to be followed and who cling to the narrations. Rather it is a <em>bid&#8217;ah</em> (innovotion), which was introduced by the (deviated) <em>Battaaloon</em> sect.[7]&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards to the origins of this newly-invented celebration, then some of the research Scholars have stated that the first person to innovate this practice was &#8216;Umar ibn Muhammad al-Mulaa in the city of Mawsil in Iraaq, during the fourth century, as is mentioned by the Imaam Abu Shaamah (d.665H).[8] He was followed in this by the likes of Abul-Khattaab &#8216;Umar ibn Dihyaa: &#8220;who was employed in the west, then traveled to Syria, then he traveled to the city of Irbil in &#8216;Iraaq, during the fourth century, where he found its king Mudhaffarud-Deen ibn Zaynud-Deen showing a keen interest in the milaad (birthday) of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. So he composed a book for him called <i>at-Tanweer fi Mawlidis-Siraajil-Muneer</i>; so he recited this to the king who then rewarded him with one thousand deenaars.&#8221; [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Maalik (d.179H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Whosoever introduces into Islaam an innovation, and holds it to be something good, has indeed alleged that Muhammad <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> has betrayed his message. Read the saying of Allaah &#8211; the Most Blessed, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you and I have chosen for you Islaam as your religion.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:3].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So that which was not part of the religion at that time, cannot be part of the religion today. And the last part of this Ummah cannot be rectified, except by that which rectified its first part.&#8221; [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, had the practice of celebrating <i>milaadun-Nabee</i> (the birthday of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) been something praiseworthy then: &#8220;the <i>Salaf</i> (the Pious Predecessors) &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with them all &#8211; would have instituted it. For they were the ones having a greater love and honour for Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and a greater zeal for doing good. Indeed, the most perfect expression of love and honour for him is by following him, obeying him, carrying out his commands, upholding and reviving his Sunnah (guidance and example) &#8211; both inwardly and outwardly &#8211; and in spreading his message and striving in this, with the heart, the hand and the tongue. Such was the path of the Companions and those who followed them in goodness (i.e. beliefs and actions).&#8221; [11]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">By the Shaykh &#8211; the noble Scholar &#8211; &#8216;Abdul-Azeez bin Baaz [1]<br />
Al-Istiqaamah Issue No.3 &#8211; Rabî&#8217;ul-Awwal 1417H / August 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah and the blessing of Allaah and His peace be upon the Messenger, and upon his Family, his Companions and all those who follow his guidance. After that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible to celebrate <i>Milaadun-Nabee</i> (the birthday of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>), nor the birthday of anyone else, since this is from the acts of <i>bid&#8217;ah</i> (innovations) that have been newly-invented into the religion. 2 Neither did Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, nor the Rightly-Guided <i>Khaleefahs</i> (Successors), nor the Companions, may Allaah be please with them all, nor any of their followers from the first three excellent generations, celebrate this day &#8211; and they were the most knowledgeable of people concerning the <i>Sunnah</i> (the Prophetic guidance), and had the greatest love for Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and were the foremost in following his <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Prescribed Laws).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been authentically established from the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> that he said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever introduces into this affair of ours, that which is not part of it, will have it rejected.&#8221;</i> 3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another authentic narration, he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Hold fast to my Sunnah (guidance) and the way of the Rightly-Guided Khaleefahs after me, cling to it tightly. And beware of newly-invented matters, for every newly-invented matter is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance.&#8221;</i> 4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these two narrations contain a strong warning against innovations in the religion, and acting upon them. This is why Allaah &#8211; the One free of all defects &#8211; says in His Clear Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And whatever the Messenger gives you, take it. Whatever he forbids you from, then keep away from it.&#8221; </b>[Soorah al-Hadeed 59:7].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Let those beware who withstand the command of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, unless some trials and afflictions befall them, or unless they are afflicted with a painful punishment.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Noor 24:63].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And the first to embrace Islaam from the <i>Muhaajirs</i> and the <i>Ansaar</i>, and those who followed them in goodness, beliefs and actions. Allaah is well-pleased with them, and they are well-pleased with Him. He has prepared for them Gardens of Paradise, beneath which rivers flow, to live therein forever. That is the supreme achievement.&#8221;</b> [Soorah at-Tawbah 9:100].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen Islaam as your way of life.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:3].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The verses with this meaning are plenty. So to accept this celebration, or any other newly-invented act of worship, implies that Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; did not complete and perfect the religion for this Ummah, and that the Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> did not completely convey to his Ummah what was necessary regarding their duties, until the advent of those who came later and innovated in the religion of Allaah that for which they had no permission, claiming that they would draw closer to Allaah by such innovations. And this &#8211; without doubt &#8211; is a great danger and amounts to criticising Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; and His Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. For Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects &#8211; has indeed perfected this religion for His servants, and has completed His favour upon them. And the Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> has clearly conveyed the Message, not leaving any way that leads to Paradise, nor any way that distances a person from the Fire, except that he explained it to his Ummah. This has been established in an authentic narration, from &#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8216;Amr <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i>, in which Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Allaah did not send any Prophet except that it was his duty to inform his Ummah of the good that he knew, and to warn them about the evils that he knew.&#8221;</i> 5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is known that our Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> is the best of all the Prophets and the last of them and the most perfect of them with regards to conveying the Message and advising the people. So if celebrating his <i> milaad</i> (birthday) was a part of the religion that Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect chose, then the Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> would have most certainly explained it to his Ummah, or he would have celebrated it himself, or his noble Companions <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhum</i> would have celebrated it. However, since nothing like this happened, then we know that the celebration of <i> milaad</i> has nothing to do with Islaam whatsoever. Rather, it is from those innovations which the Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> warned his Ummah from, as has been shown in the preceding narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is another authentic narration similar in meaning to the two preceding ones, and it is his <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> saying in his <i> Jumu&#8217;ah khutbah</i> (Friday sermon):<i> &#8220;Indeed the best speech is the Book of Allaah, and the best guidance and example is that of Muhammad sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam. And the worst affairs are the newly-invented ones, and every newly-invented matter is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance.&#8221;</i> 6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this, a group of the Scholars rejected the practice of <i>milaad</i> and warned against it, acting upon the aforementioned proofs, and their like. However, some of the later Scholars differed, in that they have allowed such a practice, providing it does not entail any sinful and evil matters; such as exaggerating in the praise of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, or free-mixing between men and women, or the playing of musical instruments and singing, and other such matters which are rejected by the pure <i> Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Prescribed Law). They think that such a practice is a <i> bid&#8217;ah hasanah</i> (a good innovation in the religion). 7 However, the <i> Sharee&#8217;ah</i> principle is: whenever any dispute arises amongst the people, then the issue should be referred back to the Book of Allaah and to the Sunnah of His Messenger, Muhammad <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger and those in authority amongst you. If you differ in anything amongst yourselves, then refer it back for judgment to Allaah and His Messenger, if you do truly believe in Allaah and the Last Day. That is better and more befitting for final determination.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:59].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And in whatever you differ, the judgement is with Allaah.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:10].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if we refer this issue &#8211; about the validity of celebrating <i> milaad</i> &#8211; back to the Book of Allaah, we find that the Book (i.e. the Qur&#8217;aan) commands us to follow the Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> in that which he brought, and it warns us against that which he prohibited. It also informs us that Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; has perfected the religion of Islaam for this Ummah. Thus, from this angle, there is nothing in what the Messenger came with concerning this celebration, and therefore it cannot be part of the religion which Allaah perfected for us and ordered us to adhere to by following the Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then if we turn to the <i> Sunnah</i> of the Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> we do not find in it that he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> celebrated his own birthday, nor ordered its celebration, nor do we find any of the Companions <i> radiallaahu &#8216;anhum</i> celebrating it! Therefore, it will be absolutely clear to anyone who has the slightest insight and is desirous of truth and justice, that the practice of celebrating the <i> Milaadun-Nabee</i> (the birthday of the Prophet) is not part of t he religion, rather it is a <i> bid&#8217;ah</i> (innovation) which we have been warned against and ordered to abandon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also a form of blind imitation of the Jews and Christians in their festivals. Therefore, the sensible person should not be deceived by the large number of people, from the various lands, who practice this, since the truth is not known by mere numbers, but the truth is known by the <i> Sharee&#8217;ah</i> proofs. Allaah &#8211; the Most High said concerning the Jews and the Christians:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And they say: None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian! These are their own desires. Say to them: Bring your proof if you are indeed truthful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:111].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And if you were to obey most of those on earth, they would mislead you far away from Allaah&#8217;s path.&#8221; </b>[Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:116].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most of these <i>milaad</i> celebrations &#8211; as well as being an innovation &#8211; involve other types of evils as well; such as the free-mixing between men and women, singing and playing musical instruments, and the drinking and smoking of intoxicants. There are in such celebrations, something which is worse than all this, and it is the greater form of shirk (associating partners in the worship of Allaah), through exaggerating about Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, or the dead awliyaa (pious servants of Allaah), by supplicating to them, seeking their aid and help, or by believing that they have the knowledge of the <i> ghayb</i> (hidden Unseen), and other such matters of <i>kufr</i> (disbelief). Whereas it is authentically related from Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> that he said: <i> &#8220;Beware of ghuloo (exaggeration) in the religion. For indeed those who came before you were destroyed due to their exaggerating in the religion.&#8221;</i> 8 And he <i>&#8216;alayhis-salaatu was-salaam</i> also said:<i> &#8220;Do not over-elevate me as the Christians over-elevated Jesus, Son of Mary, but rather I am just a slave of Allaah. So call me the slave of Allaah and His Messenger.&#8221;</i> 9</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the strangest matters is that a great number of people who actively participate in this innovated celebration, and who defend it vigorously, do not take care of fulfilling those matters which Allaah has made obligatory upon them, such as praying the five daily Prayers, and this does not even bother many of them at all. Indeed many of them do not even think that they are committing a great sin! There is no doubt that this is due to their weak <i> eemaan</i> (faith) and their short sightedness and the Fact that their hearts are covered with the filth of sins and disobedience. We ask Allaah to protect and forgive us and all of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the strangest matters also is that some of them believe that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> is actually present at their <i> milaad</i> celebrations, so consequently the participants stand to greet and welcome him. However, this is from the greatest of lies and the worst form of ignorance, because the Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> shall neither come out of his grave before the Day of Judgement, nor will he meet anyone, nor attend their gatherings. Rather, he shall remain in his grave until the Day of Judgement, whilst his noble <i>rooh</i> (soul) resides in the highest of places with his Lord in the home of the exalted, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Then you shall surely die, then you shall be raised-up again on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Mu&#8217;minoon 23:15-16].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said: &#8220;I will be the leader of the children of Aadam on the Day of Resurrection, and I will be the first for whom the earth will split open, and will be the first to intercede and the first whose intercession will be accepted.&#8221; 10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this noble <i> aayah</i> (verse) and this noble <i> hadeeth</i> &#8211; and those verses and <i> ahaadeeth</i> with a similar meaning &#8211; prove that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and others that have also died, will only come out of their graves on the Day of Resurrection. And this is a matter about which there is an agreement amongst the Muslim Scholars, there being no difference between them. So it is a must upon every Muslim, to carefully consider these matters and to beware of those innovations and deviations that have been introduced by the ignorant ones and their like, for which Allaah has not sent down any authority. It is Allaah&#8217;s help that is sought, and He alone is relied upon, and there is no might, nor any power, except with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for sending the <i> salaah</i> and the <i> salaam</i> (invoking praises and blessings of peace) upon Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, then this is from one of the best ways of drawing closer to Allaah and from those actions which are righteous. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed Allaah sends His <i>salaah</i> upon the Prophet (i.e. Allaah praises the Prophet to the angels), as do the angels (by supplicating for forgiveness for him) O you who Believe! Send your <i> salaah</i> upon him and invoke the best <i> salaam</i> (blessings of peace) for him.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:56].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said</i>: &#8220;Whosoever sends a single blessing upon me, then Allaah will send upon him ten blessings.&#8221; 11 So this is prescribed at all times, particularly at the end of every Prayer. Rather, a group from the people of Knowledge actually consider it obligatory in the final sitting of every Prayer, and consider it highly recommended at other times, such as after the <i> adhaan</i> (call to Prayer), and after mentioning the Prophet, <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> name, and also on the day of <i>Jumu&#8217;ah</i> (Friday), as is proven by the various authentic narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah help us and all the Muslims to attain a sound understanding of the religion, and that He favours us all by causing us to cling to the <i> Sunnah</i> and causing us to beware of <i>bid&#8217;ah</i> (innovations in the religion). Indeed He is the Most Generous, the Most Kind. And may the <i>salaah</i> and <i> salaam</i> (Allaah&#8217;s praises and blessings of peace) be upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his Family, his Companions and his followers.</p>

But be upon the Straight Path and upon the Sunnah of your Prophet sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam and that which his Companions were upon and beware of these innovations because they cause hatred and enmity amongst you. But stick to the original state of affairs which was there before they divided.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Answered by the Noble Scholar and Muftee<br />
Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin &#8216;Abdullaah bin Baaz [1]<br />
Al-Istiqaamah Issue Issue No.2 &#8211; Safar 1417H / July 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>INCREASING EEMAAN (FAITH)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[Q]</i></b>: <span style="color:#ff0000;"><i>Firstly</i></span>: I begin my question by seeking your advice that I may benefit from you with regards to how I may increase my <i> eemaan</i> (faith)?<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000;"><i>Secondly</i></span>: I wish to learn about the religion, however Islaamic books are very rare in my country (Algeria), except some books which are with some brothers &#8211; may Allaah reward them with goodness.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000;"><i>Thirdly</i></span>: I work as a builder and the people that I work with do not really have sound faith and their speech is nothing more than gossip and obscenities.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000;"><i>Fourthly</i></span>: I keep company with a brother whose beliefs are corrupt and who constantly speaks ill of the righteous and believing brothers and I feel very distraught about this. So I hope that you will direct me to a cure for this disease.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[A]</i></b>: <span style="color:#993300;"><strong><i>Firstly</i></strong></span>: We advise you to recite the Qur&#8217;aan frequently and that you increase in your hearing of it and in your recitation of it. Reflect and consider its meaning to the best of your ability and what you do not understand of it, then ask the people of knowledge of your country about it, or write to those outside of your country from the Scholars of Sunnah (Prophetic guidance).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also advise you to increase in the <i> dhikr</i> (remembrance) of Allaah with such remembrances and supplications that are authentically related, such as saying <i>laa ilahaa ilallaah</i> (that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah), or saying <i>subhaanallaah</i> <i>wal-hamdulillaah wa laa ilaha ilallaahu wallaahu akbar</i> (declaring Allaah free from all imperfections, praising Him and declaring that none has the right to be worshipped except Him and that He is greater), and their like. For this purpose, we urge you to refer to books such as al <i>Kalimut-Tayyib</i> of Ibn Taymiyyah, al <i>Waabilus-Sayyib</i> of Ibn al-Qayyim, <i>Riyaadhus-Saaliheen</i> and <i> al-Adhkaar</i> both by Imaam an-Nawawee, and their like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because the remembrance of Allaah increases <i> eemaan</i> (faith) and causes hearts to attain tranquility, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;Indeed in the remembrance of Allaah do hearts find tranquility.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ar-Ra&#8217;dd 13:28].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also preserve your five daily Prayers, your Fasting and the rest of your obligations &#8211; along with hoping in Allaah&#8217;s mercy and forgiveness and relying upon Him in all your affairs. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;The Believers ate only those who, when Allaah is mentioned, feel a fear in the hearts, and when His Verses are recited to them, it increases their <i>eemaan</i> (faith), and they put their trust and rely upon Allaah alone. They are those who perform the Prayer and spend out of that which We have given them, they are Believers in truth. For them ate grades of dignity and nobility with their Lord, and also forgiveness and generous provisions.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anfaal 8:2-4].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><i>Secondly</i></strong></span>: Islaamic books are easily found in every Muslim country, especially in public libraries and bookshops. So the one who seeks after them will find them. We advise you to refer to the people of knowledge of the <i> Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Prescribed Law of Allaah) so that they may direct you to suitable books for you to read, borrow or buy. If there are any problems regarding this, then it is not fitting for us to stop answering your questions from the Pure Revelation &#8211; and We ask Allaah that He makes us firm in that, and only His help is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;"><i>Thirdly</i>, <i>Fourthly</i>:</span> </strong>It is upon you to keep good company and to sit in righteous gatherings in order to benefit from them and their manners and their knowledge and that they may assist you in cultivating obedience to Allaah. So be careful and beware of bad companionship, and evil gathering. Beware, so that they may not influence you, adversely affecting your morals and manners, such that you fall into ill-repute, or that they weaken your resolve and determination in fulfilling your religious obligations and the obligations to your family. Indeed, the Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> advised the Ummah to sit in good gatherings, and he warned them from the evil and foul gatherings, and he gave a noble example about this, when he said: <i>&#8220;The example of a good companion and a bad companion is like that of a seller of musk, and the one who blows the blacksmith&#8217;s bellows. As for the seller of musk then either he will grant you some, or you buy some from him, or at the very least you enjoy a pleasant smell from him. As for the one who blows the blacksmith&#8217;s bellows, then either he will burn your clothes, or you will get an offensive smell from him.&#8221;</i> This was related by al-Bukhaaree (4/323), from Abu Moosaa al-Ash&#8217;aree <i> radiallaahu &#8216;anhu.</i> 1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>CONCERNING A WOMAN&#8217;S <i>MAHR</i> (DOWRY)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[Q]</i></b>: I and many others have observed that many people are very excessive when it comes to the matter of the <i> mahr</i> (wedding dowry that is paid to the bride), and that they seek great amounts of <i> mahr</i> when it comes to the marriage of their daughters, and they stipulate as a condition the giving of other gifts to them, along with the <i> mahr</i>. This wealth that people demand in such cases, is it <i> halaal</i> (lawful) or <i> haraam</i> (unlawful)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: What is prescribed in the <i> Sharee&#8217;ah</i> is that the <i> mahr</i> should be a small amount and that people should not compete with each other in this regard, acting in accordance with the many <i> ahaadeeth</i> which are related about this. They should also help facilitate marriages and be keen in preserving the modesty and decency of the young Muslim men and women. And it is not permissible for the <i>awliyaa</i> (guardians of the brides-to-be) to demand and stipulate gifts for themselves, since they have no right at all in this matter. Rather the right belongs to the woman, and in some particular cases to the father. He may stipulate a condition as long as it does not harm the daughter, nor lead to the delaying of the marriage. However, if the father forgoes such a right then this is better and more preferable. Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects &#8211; says:<b> &#8220;And marry those amongst you who are single and also marry the pious of your male and female slaves. If they be poor, Allaah will enrich them out of His Bounty.&#8221; </b>[Soorah an-Noor 24:32].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the <i> hadeeth</i> of &#8216;Uqbah ibn &#8216;Aamir <i> radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i>, the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> &#8220;The best dowry is that which is easy.&#8221;</i> This was narrated by Abu Daawood and al-Haakim who authenticated it. And once a woman offered herself to the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> for marriage. However, one of his Companions desired to marry her, so the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said [regarding the <i>mahr</i>]: <i>&#8220;Bring something, even if it be an iron ring.&#8221;</i> So when he could not find even this, the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> married them for the dowry that the man would teach whatever of the Qur&#8217;aan he knew to her. 2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the dowry of the Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> wives was five-hundred dirhams, which is equivalent to one-hundred and thirty riyaals today. And his daughters were married for the <i> mahr</i> of four-hundred dinaars, which is equivalent to one-hundred riyaals today. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a most beautiful example to follow.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:21].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whenever the difficulties relating to marriage are lightened, then preserving the modesty and decency of young men and women becomes easier, shameful and evil deeds decrease, and the Ummah &#8211; as a result &#8211; will increase in number. However if this matter is made difficult, and people continue competing with each other with regards to the <i> mahr</i> (dowry), then the number of marriages will decrease, fornication will become more widespread and more young men and women will remain unmarried &#8211; except those whom Allaah saves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So my sincere advice to all the Muslims, wherever they may be, is to facilitate the marriage process and to cooperate in this and make it easy. They should turn away from demanding excessive <i> mahr</i> and avoid unnecessary hardships and difficulties in the <i>waleemah</i> (wedding-feast). Rather, they should content themselves with a <i> waleemah</i> that is according to the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i>, in which the burdens and difficulties for the husband and wife are minimal. May Allaah improve and rectify all the affairs of the Muslims and may He give them the guidance and ability to cling to the <i> Sunnah</i> (Prophetic guidance) in all matters. 3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>IMPURITIES UPON ONE&#8217;S CLOTHING WHILST PRAYING</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[Q]</i></b>: If a person finds some impurity upon his clothes after he has finished praying in it, does the Prayer have to be prayed again?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[A]</i></b>: Whosoever prays, and is unaware that there are impurities upon his body or his clothes during the Prayer, but only realises after he has completed it, then his Prayer will be deemed as correct, according to the most correct position of the Scholars. Similarly, if he was aware of such impurities before the Prayer, but then forgot about this at the time of praying and did not remember except after the Prayer, then his Prayer likewise will be correct. Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic said: <b> &#8220;Our Lord! Do not take us to task if we forget or fall into error.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:286]. It has been authentically related about Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, that one day he <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> led the people in Prayer, wearing his shoes. Then the angel Jibreel came to him during the Prayer and informed him that there was some dirt on his shoes. So the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> removed them and continued with his Prayer and he did not repeat the Prayer.4 This is part of the ease which Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects &#8211; has given to His servants out of His Mercy for them. However, if a person forgets that he had passed wind, then prays in that state, he must &#8211; by <i> ijmaa&#8217;</i> (consensus) of the Scholars &#8211; repeat his prayer again, when he remembers. This is due to the saying of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>: <i> &#8220;The Prayer will not be accepted without purification nor will charity be accepted from wealth that is unlawful.&#8221;</i> This has been related by Muslim in his <i> Saheeh</i> (1/140) and the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> saying: <i> &#8220;The Prayer of any one of you who has released wind will not be accepted, until he makes wudhoo (ablution).&#8221;</i> Related by al-Bukhaaree and Muslim. 5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SLAUGHTERING FOR OTHER THAN ALLAAH</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[Q]</i></b>: The slaughtering of sheep and other such animals at the graves of the pious people, for their sake and in order to please and draw closer to them, is a custom amongst my family. I have tried to prevent them from doing so, but it has only made them more resolute in doing so. I have said to them that this is shirk (associating partners in the worship) of Allaah. But they respond by saying: We only worship Allaah the way He deserves to be worshipped. However, we visit the graves of the <i>awliyaa</i> (the pious friends of Allaah) and supplicate to Allaah, through the right of the pious people, so that harm and difficulties may be averted from us. I have said to them that this is not from the religion, but they just tell me to leave them alone upon what they are doing. So what do you suggest should be the cure for such people, and what do you suggest I do to counter act this <i> bid&#8217;ah</i> (innovation)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i></i></b><b><i>[A]</i></b>: It is known from the evidences related in the Qur&#8217;aan and the <i> Sunnah</i> that sacrificing for other than Allaah, in order to draw close to other than Allaah &#8211; whether sacrificing for the <i>jinns</i>, <i>awliyaa</i>, idols or other than that from the creation &#8211; is an act of shirk and is an act of <i>jaahiliyyah</i> (pre-Islaamic ignorance) that was practiced by the <i>mushriks</i> (those who worshipped the pious men, <i>jinns</i>, angels, stones, statues, etc, along with worshipping Allaah). Allaah- the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;Say: Indeed my Prayer, my sacrifce, my living and my dying are all for Allaah Lord of the worlds. No partner do I setup with Him in this, and this is what I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:162]. So Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; clearly explains in this verse that sacrificing to other than Allaah is like praying to other than Him. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;Indeed We have granted to the Prophet sallallaabu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam the Kawthar (a river in Paradise whose banks are lined with tents made from hollow pearls). Therefore turn in Prayer to your Lord and sacrifice to Him alone.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Kawthar 108:1-2]. So Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects &#8211; commanded His Prophet in these noble verses that he should pray only to His Lord and that he should sacrifice to only Him, which was opposite of what the <i>mushriks</i> did, in that they used to prostrate to other than Allaah and to sacrifice to other than Him. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And your Lord has commanded that you worship none but Him.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Israa 17:23]. And He &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;And they have not been commanded except to worship Allaah alone making the religion purely and sincerely for Him.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Bayyinah 98:5]. And there are many other verses with the same meaning. So, since sacrificing is one of the acts of <i> &#8216;ibaadah</i> (worship), then it is obligatory to make this action purely and sincerely for Allaah alone, without directing it to other than Him. Also &#8216;Alee ibn Abee Taalib <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> said that the Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<i> &#8220;May Allaah curse the one who sacrifices to other than Allaah.&#8221;</i> This has been related by Muslim in his Saheeh (no.765).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for supplicating to Allaah and asking Him by the right of the <i> awliyaa</i> or by the right of His Messenger, or by the status of His Messenger &#8211; then this does not constitute shirk, but rather it is a <i> bid&#8217;ah</i> (innovation) which leads to shirk, in the opinion of the majority of Scholars. This is because <i>du&#8217;aa</i> (supplication) is an act of worship, and how it is to be done can only be known from the Revelation. And there is nothing authentically established from our Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> to show the permissibility or validity of this type of <i> tawassul</i> (seeking the means of nearness to Allaah by invoking an intermediary) in which Allaah is asked through the right of His Prophet or the right of the <i> awliyaa</i> or any of His creation. So it is not permissible for any Muslim to innovate new forms of <i> tawassul</i> which has not been prescribed by Allaah, as He &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:<b> &#8220;Or do they have partners with Allaah who prescribe for them a religion which Allaah has not prescribed.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:21]. And the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> &#8220;Whosoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it, will be rejected&#8221;</i>, and in another authentic narration: <i> &#8220;Whosoever does an action that I have not commanded, it will be rejected.&#8221;</i> 7 And the meaning of this is that such innovated actions will be rejected and not accepted from its doer. Thus it is obligatory for the Muslims to restrict themselves to only what Allaah has prescribed and to beware of what people have innovated into the religion. As regards the prescribed forms of <i>tawassul</i> then they are: <i>tawassul</i> (seeking the means of nearness to Allaah) through His Names and His Attributes and by righteous actions, and by one&#8217;s <i>eemaan</i> (faith) in Allaah and His Messenger, and other righteous and prescribed actions similar to this. 9</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&#8216;Uthaymeen<br />
Sharh Usoolul-Eemaan (pp.4-7)<br />
Al-Istiqaamah magazine , Issue No.1 &#8211; Dhul-Hijjah 1416H / May 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh said in <i>Sharh Usoolul-Eemaan</i> (pp.4-7):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <b>The deen (religion) of Islaam</b>: It is the way of life that Allaah sent the Prophet Muhammad <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> with. By it, Allaah terminated the validity of all other religions, perfected this religion for His worshippers, completed His favour upon them and has chosen only this religion for them &#8211; no other religion will be accepted by Him from anyone. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Muhammad is not the father of any man amongst you. Rather he is the Messenger of Allaah and the khaatim (last and final) of the Prophets.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:40].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islaam as your religion.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:3].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed the religion with Allaah is Islaam.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:19].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Whosoever seeks a religion other than Islaam, never will it be accepted from him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:85].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; obligated all of mankind to take Islaam as their religion. So Allaah said, whilst addressing His Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Say: O Mankind! Indeed I have been sent to you all as the Messenger of Allaah; to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. None has the right to be worshipped except Him; it is He who gives life and cause death. So believe in Allaah and His Messenger &#8211; the Prophet who can neither read nor write &#8211; who believes in Allaah and His Words. So follow the Messenger of Allaah so that you may be rightly-guided.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-A&#8217;raaf 7:158].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in <i>Saheeh Muslim</i> (1/93), from Abu Hurayrah <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;By Him in whose Hand is the life of Muhammad! There is no one from this nation, be he a Jew or a Christian, who hears of me and dies whilst not having eemaan (faith) in what I have been sent with, except that he will be one of the companions of the Hellfire.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <i>eemaan</i> (faith) in the Prophet implies: affirming that which he was sent with, along with acceptance of it and submission to it. Without these two matters, mere affirmation is not sufficient. This is why even though Abu Taalib (the Prophet&#8217;s uncle) affirmed what was sent to the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and that Islaam was the best of religions, yet he did not accept his message nor submit to it; and thus he did not have <i>eemaan</i> in the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] <b>The religion of Islaam</b> contains all that was beneficial from the previous religions. It is suitable for implementation in any age, any where and by any nation. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said, whilst addressing His Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And We have sent down to you the Book in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it, testifying to the truth contained therein whilst exposing the falsehood that has been added therein.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:48].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That Islaam is suitable for implementation in any age, any where and by any nation does not mean that it becomes submissive to nations &#8211; being altered and changed by them &#8211; as some people falsely think. But rather it means that whenever it is truly adhered to then it brings benefit and goodness to that nation, as well as reforming and correcting it &#8211; in whatever age or place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] <b>The religion of Islaam</b> is the religion of truth. It is the way of life that Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; guaranteed His help and victory to those who truly adhere to it, and that He would make it dominant over all other religions. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;It is He who has sent His Messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth, that it may prevail over all other religions, even if the pagans detest it.&#8221;</b> [Soorah at-Tawbah 9:33].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allaah has promised to those amongst you who truly have <i>eemaan</i> (true faith and belief) and act in obedience to Allaah and His Messenger, that He will grant them ruler ship upon the earth, just as He granted it to those before them, and that He will establish their Religion for them and grant them the authority to practice their Religion which He chose and ordered them with. And He will certainly change their situation to one of security, after their fear. Providing that they worship and obey Me, not associating anything else in worship with Me. Then, whoever rejects this favour by disobedience to their Lord &#8211; then they are the rebellious transgressors.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Noor 24:55].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] The religion of Islaam is a complete religion comprising both <i>&#8216;aqeedah</i> (beliefs) and <i>sharee&#8217;ah</i> (laws).</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>It commands them with <i>tawheed</i> (to single out Allaah alone for worship) and prohibits them from shirk (associating partners with Allaah, in that which is particular to Him).</li>
<li>It commands them with being truthful and prohibits them from lying.</li>
<li>It commands them with <i>&#8216;adl</i> (justice) and prohibits them from injustice and oppression.</li>
<li>It commands them with fulfilling trusts and prohibits them from acting treacherously.</li>
<li>It commands them keeping promises and prohibits them from breaking them.</li>
<li>It commands them with kindness and good treatment of parents and prohibits them from disobedience to them in that which is not sinful.</li>
<li>It commands them with joining the ties of relations and prohibits them from severing them.</li>
<li>It commands them with good treatment of neighbours and prohibits the causing of harm to them.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In short, Islaam orders alls that is good, from manners and morals, and prohibits all that is evil from it. Likewise, it orders all actions which are righteous and good and prohibits all actions that are evil and harmful. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed Allaah enjoins upon you justice, kindness and the giving of good to relatives and near ones. And He prohibits you from all shameful and evil deeds, oppression and transgression. Thus He admonishes you, that you may take heed and be reminded.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nahl 16:90].</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam ash-Shanqiti [1] , Adwaa&#8217;ul-Bayaan (10/21-23)<br />
Al-Istiqaamah Magazine , Issue No.8 &#8211; Shawwal 1418H / February 1998</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And do not say about those who are killed fighting in the Path of Allaah that they are dead. Rather, they are alive!&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:154].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse is an apparent proof that the martyrs [those who are killed in the Path of Allaah] are not dead. Yet in another verse Allaah says, whilst addressing the Prophet Muhammad sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam; who is better than any and every martyr :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed you will die, and they will die.&#8221;</b> [Soorah az-Zumar 39:30].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reply to this [apparent contradiction] is: That the martyrs are dead from a worldly point of view, this is why they can be inherited from, and why their wives can remarry again &#8211; a point about which the Scholars have ijmaa&#8217; (consensus) upon. It is this death, the worldly death, that Allaah informed would occur to the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam. This is why Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq radiallaahu &#8216;anhu said, when the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam passed away: &#8220;May my mother and father be sacrificed for you O Prophet of Allaah! By Allaah! Allaah will never combine two deaths for you. You have died the death that Allaah decreed for you &#8230; Whosoever worships Muhammad, let him know that Muhammad is dead.&#8221; Then he deduced this by reciting the [above] verse, and the Companions of the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam accepted this.2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the life that Allaah affirmed in the Qur&#8217;aan for the martyrs, and the life that has been affirmed for the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam in which he is able to return the greetings of salaam to whosoever sends it upon him, then both of them refer to the life of the barzakh (a state of existence between the present life and the Hereafter); an existence which cannot be truly comprehended by the people of this world. So with regards to the martyrs there is a reference to this in Allaah &#8211; the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;Rather, they are alive, but you do not perceive it.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:154]. The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam explained this verse by saying: <i>&#8220;Their souls ore in the bellies of green birds, which hove lanterns suspended for them from Allaah&#8217;s Throne. They roam around in Paradise wherever they desire, then return to these lanterns &#8230;&#8221;</i>3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for [the life affirmed for] the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, then he said: &#8220;There is no one who sends the greetings of salaam upon me, except that Allaah returns my soul hock until I reply to their greeting.&#8221;4 And: &#8220;Indeed Allaah&#8217;s Angels roam around the earth conveying to me the greetings of salaams from my Ummah.&#8221;5 So this life also cannot truly be comprehended by the intellects of the people of this world. Since, along with this [fact], his sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s blessed soul resides in the loftiest part of Paradise with the companionship of the highest company; a company higher than the souls of the martyrs. Yet the reality of how his pure soul links itself to his noble body &#8216;alayhis-salaam &#8211; a body which the earth cannot consume &#8211; is a reality which no one knows, except Allaah alone. Thus, if this type of life was like the life that is understood by the people of this world, then why did Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq radiallaahu &#8216;anhu say that the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam was dead, and why was it permitted to bury him? [And if he sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam did not die] then why was there a need to appoint a khaleefah (succesor) after him. Also, those events; such as the [tragic] killing of &#8216;Uthmaan radiollaahu &#8216;anhu, or the differences which arose between the Companions, or that which occurred with &#8216;Aaishah radiallaahu &#8216;anhaa need not have happened if he sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam were still alive! Since if that were the case, they could have referred judgement back to him concerning those issues in which they differed [if he sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam were still alive and could fulfill such needs].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, just as the Qur&#8217;aan is explicitly clear that the martyrs are actually living; due to Allaah &#8211; the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;Rather, they are alive.&#8221;</b> Then likewise, the Qur&#8217;aan is just as explicitly clear that this state of living is one whose reality cannot be truly understood by the people of this world; due to Allaah&#8217;s saying: <b>&#8220;But you do not perceive it.&#8221;</b> Similarly, just as it is established that the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam is living in the grave; replying to the greetings of salaam, yet even though his Companions actually buried him, they were still unable to perceive this state of living. Thus, we know that this state of living is likewise a reality which cannot be truly understood by the people of this world. However, what could make this more clear is by considering the example of someone who is</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">asleep. The state of one who is asleep differs from that of one who is awake in many ways, including the fact that the one who sleeps experiences dreams which can be understood. And Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim (d.751H)- rahimahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;It is known by necessity that the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s body is intact and has not decayed. The Companions asked him: How are we to send greetings of salaam upon you when your body has decayed! So he sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi we sallam replied: <i>&#8220;Indeed Allaah has prohibited the earth from consuming the bodies of the Prophets.&#8221; </i>So if his body was not in his grave, then why would he respond to this question! And it has been authentically established from him that he said: <i>&#8220;Indeed Allaah&#8217;s Angels roam around the earth conveying to me the greetings of salaams from my Ummah.&#8221;</i>7 It is authentic from him that he once came with Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar [into the mosque] and said: &#8220;We shall be raised up like this on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;8 It is also established that he sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam saw the Prophet Moosaa praying in his grave on the night of his Israa (Heavenly Ascension), and he also saw him [on that same night] in the sixth or seventh Heaven.9 So the soul is in one place and is connected to the body, which resides in the grave. Similarly, the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam is in his grave; replying to the greetings of salaam sent to him, along with the fact that his soul resides in the loftiest part of Paradise along with the highest companionship. So there is no contradiction between these two matters; since the affairs of the souls is one thing, whilst that of the bodies is another.&#8221;10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in these words is a proof that the life of the barzakh, that was previously mentioned, is a life whose reality is not known to the people of this world. About this Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Rather, they are alive, but you do not perceive it.&#8221;</b> And complete and perfect knowledge is only with Allaah.</p>

Al-Istiqaamah Magazine, Issue No.6 &#8211; Dhul-Qa&#8217;dah 1417H / March 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed Allaah will help those who help Him. Indeed Allaah is Exalted in Might, All-Powerful.&#8221; [Soorah Hajj 22:40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shanqeetee (d.1393H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; explains in this noble <i>Aayah</i> that He has sworn to help and give victory to those who help Him. It is known that the help and victory of Allaah comes by following what He has prescribed, obeying His commend, avoiding His prohibitions, by helping His Messengers and their followers, aiding His Religion and fighting against His enemies and overpowering them &#8211; until the word of Allaah is made uppermost, whilst the word of His enemies is debased and mode low. Then Allaah &#8211; the Most High, the Most Magnificent &#8211; explains the charecteristics of those whom He has promised would receive His help and victory, distinguishing them from others. So He said &#8211; explaining those to whom He swore He would aid and give victory to &#8211; because He is the one to aid and give victory:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Those who, if We establish them in the earth, establish the prayer, give the Zakaat, enjoin the good and forbid the evil.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Hajj 22:41].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that which this noble <i>aayah</i> indicates is that whosoever aids Allaah, then Allaah will aid Him. This is clearly explained in other than this place, such as His &#8211; the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; sayings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;O you who Believe. If you help Allaah, Allaah will help you; and establish your feet firmly. But those who disbelieve, for them is destruction and Allaah will make their deeds vain.&#8221; </b>[Soorah Muhammad 47:7].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed, Our Word has gone forth of old for our slaves, the Messengers, that they will certainly be victorious; and that Our forces will certainly be triumphant.&#8221;</b> [Soorah as-Saafaat 37:171-173].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allaah has Decreed: It is My Messenger and I who will prevail.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Mujaadalah 58:21].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allaah has promised to those amongst you who believe and do righteous actions that He will grant you the khilaafah in the land.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Noor 24:55].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in His &#8211; the Most High &#8216;s &#8211; saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Those who, if We establish them in the earth, establish the prayer, give the Zakaat, enjoin the good and forbid the evil.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Hajj 22:41].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In it is a proof that there is no promise from Allaah of His help, except by establishing the Prayer, paying the Zakaah, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil. So it is these whom Allaah will establish upon the earth and will strengthen His Word through them. However, those who do not establish the salaah, nor pay the Zakaah, nor enjoin the good nor forbid the evil, then there is no promise for them from Allaah that He will aid and grant them victory. They are not from His party, nor are they his friends -those who have the promise of His help and victory. Rather, they are the party of Shaytaan and his friends. So if they were to expect the help of Allaah and the fulfillment of His promise upon them, then their example is like that of a hired worker who refuses to do the labour that he was hired for, yet he expects to be rewarded. So whosoever is like this, then he has no intellect!&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the help that we so desperately await, and the victory that we so strongly desire will only come about by: &#8220;The Muslims returning and repenting to their Lord, correcting their &#8216;aqeedoh (beliefs) and cultivating themselves and their families upon the pure and correct Islaam; putting into effect Allaah &#8211; the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Never will Allaah change the condition of a people, until they change themselves.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ar-Ra&#8217;d 13:11].&#8221;2</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh bin Baz , Majmoo&#8217; Fataawaa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi&#8217;ah (3/438-446)<br />
Al-Istiqaamah Magazine , Issue No.8 &#8211; Shawwal 1418H / February 1998</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q1]: What, in your opinion, is the definition of al-ghazwa al-fikree (the ideological attack)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A1]: Ideological warfare is a modern term which refers to a set of efforts in which a nation engages in order to conquer or influence another nation, so that [the attacked nation] takes a particular course of direction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is far more serious than military warfare, since it aims at secrecy, seeking to achieve subtle objectives initially; so that the attacked nation does not perceive it, nor prepare to halt it, nor stand in its way &#8211; thereby falling victim to [such an attack]. The eventual result of this onslaught is that this nation becomes sick in mind and sense; loving what the enemy wants it to love and hating what they want it to hate. It is a chronic disease which attacks and destroys nations, doing away with its personality, removing such meanings as foundations and strength. The nation which is struck by this [ideological attack] does not even feel what has hit it, or what it even is! That is why curing it becomes somewhat difficult, and making [the attacked nation] understand the ways of righteousness becomes a struggle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This war takes place by means of school curriculums, general education, media, small and large size publications, and other such channels [that influence the thoughts of its people]. Through this the enemy hopes to deviate the nation from its beliefs; becoming attached to what the enemy throws at it. We ask Allaah for safety and protection from this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q2]: Are the Arabs generally subject to this type of warfare, in particular the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A2]: Yes, the Muslims in general, including the Arabs, the Kingdom, and other than them, are all subject to a great ideological warfare from the nations of kufr (unbelief); from both the east and the west. The severest and most serious of these [ideological] onslaughts is:- [1] <b>The war of the christian crusaders.</b> [2] <b>The zionist war.</b> [3] <b>The communist and atheistic war.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[THE CHRISTIAN CRUSADERS]</b> The war of the christian crusaders is today at its most intense. Since Salaahud-Deen al-Ayyoobee achieved victory over the christians crusading in the Muslim lands with their strength and weapons, the christians realised that even though they had achieved [some] victories, these victories</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">were temporary ones that did not last. That is why they started thinking about the most destructive alternatives. After numerous case studies and assemblies they arrived at [something] that was far more dangerous and destructive than military warfare; which was that the christian nations, both individually and collectively, should launch an ideological attack on those Muslims who were just beginning to grow and develop. This is because conquering the hearts and thoughts [of people] is far more permanent than conquering their lands! The Muslim whose mind has not been corrupted cannot bear to see the unbelievers wielding authority, and ordering and prohibiting in his own country. Therefore such a Muslim strives his utmost to expel and distance them &#8211; even if he has to sacrifice his own life, or or his most cherished possession, for this cause. And this is what happened after the major conquest of the crusaders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Muslim who is exposed to the [effects] of this filthy war, he becomes ill in thought and desensitised to this disease. He does not see any danger with the presence of christians in the lands of the Muslims. Indeed, he may even think that their presence is a source of goodness which aids and advances civilisation. So the christians have sufficed themselves with this ideological warfare, as opposed to the military one, because it is more effective and more permanent. What need do they have of deploying troops or spending huge sums of money, when there exists amongst the children of the Muslims those who can actually fulfill their wishes &#8211; intentionally or unintentionally, with a price or without one! This is why they do not resort to openly fighting the Muslims with weapons and arms, except in rare cases when necessity dictates this. They resort to this in situations where speed is sought; such as what happened in Uganda and Pakistan; or when there is a need to stabilise the advancement, or establish centres, or to establish bases which engage in destructive ideological warfare; such as what happened in Egypt, Syria, Iraaq, and other countries, before their expulsion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[THE ZIONIST JEWS]</b> The zionist war is just the same. The jews strive their utmost to corrupt the beliefs, morals and manners of the Muslims. The jews scheme and crave after possessing the Muslim lands, as well as the lands of others. They have fulfilled some of their plans and continue striving hard to implement the rest of them. Even though they they do engage the Muslims in warfare involving strength and arms and have occupied some of their lands, they also fight them through spreading</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and aiding the spread of] destructive thoughts, beliefs and ideologies; such as Freemasonry, Qadiaanisim, Bahaaism, Teejaanism, and others &#8211; seeking the support of the christians, and others, in order to fulfill their objects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>THE COMMUNISTS AND ATHEISTS</strong>] As for the communist/atheist war, then presently it is spreading like wildfire across the Muslim lands.2 This happens as a consequence of their being an emptiness [with regards beliefs], weak eemaan (certainty of faith) in most people, wide spread ignorance, and the lack of a correct and healthy [Islaamic] cultivation and development. The communist parties from Russia and China, as well as others, have managed to ensnare [into this false ideology] every spiteful, malicious person; driven by those weak in faith, or having no faith at all! They selected these types of people as being their puppets and plants in that country; spreading through [such puppets] their filthy atheistic and communistic ideologies. They lured them with promises of high positions of power and status. Through them they tore apart the Muslim Ummah and they were made [to act as] the troops of Shaytaan. They were aided in this by the christians and the jews, who sometimes assisted in their preparation, whilst at other times they aided and supported them. Thus, even though they do have differences between them, yet they become a single hand against the Muslims. They view the Muslims as their worst enemy, that is why we see them co-operating with each other, as allies, against the Muslims. And Allaah&#8217;s aid is sought, and He suffices us and is the best of guardians.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q3]: What are the means which the west uses in order to spread their ideas and thoughts?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A3]: The means that the west employs in order to spread their thoughts and ideas are many, from them:-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: The attempt to conquer the minds of the Muslim children. They do this by infusing in them western values and concepts so that they then believe that the best way to adopt in any matter is that of the west &#8211; whether it is with regards to what religion or sect they believe, or with regards to the languages that they speak, or the manners, customs and values with which they clothe themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: Custody of a large group of the children of the Muslims in every country, concern for them and bringing them up, so that when they absorb western thoughts, they return to their countries with a halo of praise and compliment, until they acquire position and authority in their countries by which they circulate western ideologies and establish learning centres conforming to western curricula or are directly influenced by them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>: Their active drive towards promoting the learning of western languages in the Muslim lands, making them compete with the Muslims&#8217; languages, especially the Arabic language, which is language of the Qur&#8217;aan &#8211; by which this Book was sent and by which the Muslims worship their Lord;in their Salaah (Prayer), their rites of Hajj (Pilgrimage), their forms of remembrances and glorifications, etc. From this is the encouragement of destructive propaganda that fights against [the usage and learning] of [pure and classical] Arabic Language and attempt to weaken the conformity to it in the Muslim lands. They do this by calling to using colloquialism, and by arranging numerous studies that intend to &#8216;develop&#8217; grammar in order to corrupt it; as well as formalising folk literature and and matters of national heritage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourthly</strong>: Development of western universities and missionary schools in Muslim countries and also initiating the role of kindergarten and playschools, hospitals and clinics which they make as dens and nests for their evil aims. They encourage the higher classes to study in them (western and missionary schools and universities) and after them help in acquire leadership posts and great position until they become an aid for their masters in following their plots in the Muslim lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifthly</strong>: The attempt to control education curricula in Muslim lands and drawing out their politics, either directly; as occurred in some Muslim countries when the priest Dunlop undertook that task there, or by indirect methods. When the task was undertaken, most of the successful students who studied in Dunlop&#8217;s schools and graduated in them, arose as a destructive pickaxe in their country, or as one of the enemies most lethal weapons. [Such students] strive hard to influence the educational curriculum and steer it towards secularism &#8211; an ideology which does not centre around having eemaan (faith) in Allaah and His Messenger; but rather steers in the direction of atheism, or towards immorality and corruption.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sixthly</strong>: The large number of individuals amongst the jews and christians who have undertaken the study of Islam, Arabic Language, compiling books, and taking positions of teaching in universities; until they created an ideological turmoil and confusion amongst the educated Muslims, which they hurl at those that they are teaching, or with which they fill their books &#8211; until some of those books became sources which writers and researchers refer to in matters of ideology or history. Many people who were responsible for creating some of these fitnahs (trials and turmoil) in the Muslim countries, were actually Muslims who graduated at the hands of the people. The praise and awe which surrounded such graduates helped them to achieve this, as well as achieve their post and positions; such as important posts in teaching and leadership. So they completed what their teachers had initiated [of corruption and destruction] and fulfilled what they couldn&#8217;t achieve, because they were of Muslim offspring and from the same skin, ascribing themselves to them and speaking their tongue &#8211; so we ask and seek Allaah&#8217;s help.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Seventhly</strong>: A large number of missionary workers calling to christianity have proceeded between the Muslims that they have performed their work on. [This missionary activity is done upon] well studied principles, and upon a large scale; employing hundreds of thousands of men and women. Huge financial budgets are put aside for this task, and [they are aided in such a way that] their task is made easier for them and obstacles are removed for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;They want to extinguish the Light (i.e, the Religion) of Allaah with their mouths, but Allaah will bring His Light to perfection and completion, even though the disbelievers hate it.&#8221;</b> [Soorah as-Saff 61:8].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as the efforts of the missionaries are set up and aimed mostly at the common levels; then the efforts of the orientalist are directed to the educated &#8211; as I previously mentioned. The missionaries take on huge hardships in their work in the African Countries, and in the remote villages of the far extreme Muslim lands; in eastern Asia. After that, every so often, they hold conferences in order to review their accounts and their plans; then they analyse, adjust and implement. They met in Cairo in 1906, in Edinburgh in 1910, in Lucknow (India) in 1911, and in Jerusalem in 1935, and they continue to hold such assemblies, seminars and conferences &#8211; so glory be to the One in Whose Hand is the sole sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and to Him return all affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Eighthly</strong>: Spreading corruption in the Muslim societies; belittling the [status of women] with regards to their role in life, making her transgress the limits set by Allaah for her, creating in her a satisfaction in abstaining from the [correct] Path. They do this by spreading propaganda amongst the Muslims in various ways and manners, so that women freely mix with men, and so that women work in the places of men. By this, they aim to corrupt the Muslim society, and to put an end to the chastity and purity which is found therein. Additionally, by bringing up imaginary issues and false propaganda &#8211; [claiming] that Islaam oppresses women, and that Muslim women have very little rights &#8211; they want to take her out of her home, and put her wherever they may want; even though the limits that Allaah has set [in the Qur&#8217;aan] are clear; as are His commands [concerning these matters], and as is the Sunnah (Guidance) of His Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the Believing women to draw their jilbaabs (cloaks) over their entire body. That will be better, that they should be known (as free and respectable women), so as not to be harassed, And Allaah is Ever-Forgiving, Most-Merciful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:59].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And &#8211; the Most High &#8211; says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And let the Believing women draw their khimaars (head-scarves) over their faces, necks and chests, and not to display their beauty, except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband&#8217;s fathers, or their sons, or their husband&#8217;s sons &#8230;&#8221; </b>[Soorah an-Noor 24:31].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And when you ask them for something, ask them from behind a screen; that is purer for your hearts and their hearts.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:53].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And stay in your houses, and do not display yourselves like that of the times of jaahiliyyah (pre-lslaamic ignorance).&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:33].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said:<br />
<i>&#8220;Beware of entering into the company of women.&#8221;</i> A man from the Ansaar said: O Messenger of Allaah, what about the husband&#8217;s brothers and relatives! He replied: <i>&#8220;The husband&#8217;s brothers and relatives are death!&#8221;</i>3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam also said:<br />
<i>&#8220;A man must not be alone in the company of a women, for indeed the third of them is shaytaan.&#8221;</i>4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ninthly</strong>: The Building of churches and temples in the Muslim lands and spending great amounts of wealth on them; beautifying them, making them very conspicuous and noticeable, and building them in the largest and best of places.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tenthly</strong>: Radio stations set up solely for the purpose of calling to christianity and communism, spreading their [false] objectives. They intend to misguide, through such false ideas, the children of the innocent and naive Muslims &#8211; who neither understand, nor did they receive a sufficient Islaamic education. This is the case, in particular, in Africa where the Bible is published and distributed in plenty of hotels, etc. [They also] send missionary publications and false preaching to many of the Muslim children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are some of the means utilised by the enemies of Islaam today &#8211; from east and the west &#8211; in waging war against the Muslim&#8217;s thought, [intending by this ideological attack] to put an end to correct righteous thought, so that they are replaced by [false and] foreign ideas; whether eastern or western. And &#8211; O noble reader &#8211; as you can see, these means involve tremendous efforts, enormous amounts of money and a multitude of soldiers. All of this is done in order to take the Muslims away from Islaam, even if they do not actually embrace christianity, judaism or marxism. Since their primary goal in doing this is to take the Muslims away from Islaam, so that when this stage is achieved, then whatever [misguidance] follows becomes far easier to implement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, despite all this we say: that Allaah will frustrate them in their hopes, and will nullify their plans &#8211; but only if the Muslims are sincere in their fight against them, cautious and alert to their plans, and obedient and upright upon their Religion; as Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;But if you remain patient and become pious and obedient to Allaah, their plots will not harm you in the least. Indeed, Allah encompasses all that they do.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-lmraan 3:120].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since they are spreaders of corruption, Allaah Will not give total facilitation to their actions. Rather Allaah &#8211; the Most High- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;They plot and plan, and Allaah plans, and indeed Allaah is the best of planners.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anfaal 8:30].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed they are planning a plan, but I am planning a plan, but give a respite to the disbelievers; deal gently with them for a while.&#8221;</b> [Soorah at-Taariq 86:15-17].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;O you who Believe! If you help Allaah [by acting upon that which He has commanded you to do], He will help you against your enemies, and make your foothold firm.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Muhammad 47:7].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And indeed Allaah will help those who help His Cause. Truly, Allaah is Most-Powerful, Most-Mighty. Those who, if We give them power and authority in the land, establish the Salaah (Prayer), give the Zakaah, command the good and forbid the evil. And with Allaah rests the end of all affairs.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Hajj 22:40-41].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are many verses carrying this same meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, without a doubt, the matter requires the Muslims to have some common sense and some contemplation, some study about the course of action that should be taken, about the most suitable stance they should take, and that they should be heedful and have some awareness which will make them capable of understanding the schemes of their enemies, and active upon rendering them futile and false. This shall not be accomplished for them except by adhering to Allaah, adherence to His guidance, returning to Him, repenting to Him and seeking His aid. Additionally, by bearing in mind His guidance in everything, especially with regard to the relation of the believers with the unbelievers, and by understanding Soorah <b>&#8220;Say, O Disbelievers&#8221;</b> and what Allaah the Most High &#8211; mentions in His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Never will the jews and the christians be pleased with you until you follow their religion and way of life.&#8221; </b>[Soorah al-Baqarah 2:120].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also [what He mentions in] His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And they will not stop fighting you, until they turn you back from your Religion; if they are able.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al- Baqarah 2:217]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; that He grants right guidance to this Ummah, with regards to their affairs, and that He grants protection to it from the plots of its enemies, and that He grants it firmness and obedience, both in speech and action &#8211; so that there can be for them might, strength and honour; as Allaah desires for them. Indeed He is the only One Who has the power to do so. And may Allaah extol, and send the blessings of peace upon our Prophet Muhammad, and upon his Family, his Companions, and followers.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [Q]:</strong> ‘Allaah says: ‘‘<strong>And your Lord says: Call upon Me and I will, respond to your supplication.</strong>’’ [Soorah Ghaafir 40:60] So why is it that a person’s <em>du’aa</em> (supplication) is sometimes unanswered?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [A]:</strong> ‘‘All praise is due to Allaah, Lord of the worlds. May the Prayers and Peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad, and upon his Family and his Companions.  I ask Allaah for the ability to be correct in belief, speech and actions, for myself and for my brothers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<strong>And your Lord says: Call upon Me and I will respond to your supplication. Verily those who are too arrogant to worship Me will, enter Hell in humiliation.</strong>’’ [Soorah Ghaafir 40:60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The questioner stated that he did indeed make <em>du’aa</em> (supplication) to Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; but it was not answered by Allaah. So he is in doubt with respect to this noble <em>aayah</em> (verse), in which Allaah promises to answer the one who supplicates to Him, and indeed Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; never breaks His promise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the clarification of this is that there are certain conditions that need to be fulfilled in order for a supplication to be answered.  These conditions are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Firstly:</strong> Sincerity to Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic. That is to say, one must be sincere in his <em>du’aa</em> (supplication), so he turns to Allaah &#8211; the One free from all imperfections with an attentive heart, being truthful in his turning to Him, knowing that Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect, the Most High &#8211; is capable of answering his <em>du’aa</em> (supplication) and hoping that the <em>du’aa</em> will be answered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Secondly:</strong> During <em>du’aa</em>, the caller should feel that he is in need of Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect, the Most High – in fact in dire need; and that only Allaah alone answers the supplication of the one in distress and the One who removes evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Thirdly:</strong> That the one making <em>du’aa</em> should refrain from <em>haraam</em> (unlawful) matters, as this acts as a barrier between the person and his <em>du’aa</em> (supplication) being answered &#8211; as has been established in the authentic <em>hadeeth</em>, from the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) who said: ‘‘Indeed Allaah &#8211; the Most High -is good and accepts only that which is good. Allaah has ordered the Believers to do that which He commanded the Messengers. Allaah &#8211; the Most High -has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<strong>O you Messengers! Eat of the good things and do righteous actions.</strong>’’ [Sooratul-Mu‘minoon 3:51 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> ‘‘O you who Believe! Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you.</strong> ’’ [Sooratul-Baqarah 2:172]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he mentioned (the case of) a man who, having journeyed far is dishevelled and dusty and who spreads out his bands to the sky (saying): ‘O Lord! O Lord,’ whilst his food is unlawful, his drink unlawful and he is nourished unlawfully. So how can he be answered!’ [2] So the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) explained the un-likelihood that this person’s <em>du’aa </em>would be answered, even after fulfilling the apparent factors which aid the <em>du’aa </em>being answered. The apparent factors being:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[i]: Raising ones’ hands towards the sky, meaning towards Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; since Allaah is above the heavens, above His <em>’Arsh</em> (Throne). Extending the hands out towards Allaah -the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; is amongst the causes of <em>du’aa</em> being responded to, as is shown in the narration from the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) that he said: ‘‘Indeed your Lord is Alive, Most generous. He feels shy that when his servant raises his bands towards Him, calling upon Him, that He should return him empty, having nothing.’’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ii]: This man called upon Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; using the name <em>Rabb</em> (Lord).  Seeking <em>tawassul </em>(the means of nearness to Allaah) with this name is also regarded as one of the causes for <em>du’aa</em> to be responded to, since the <em>Rabb</em> is the Creator, the Owner, the Governor of all affairs &#8211; and the reigns of the Heavens and the earth are in His Hands.  Due to this, you will find that most of the supplications made in the Noble <em>Qur‘aan</em> are by this name:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<strong>Our Lord! We have heard the call of one calling us to faith: ‘Believe you in the Lord,’ and we have believed. Our Lord! Forgive us our sins, and remit from us our evil deeds, and take to Yourself our souls in the company of the righteous. Our Lord! Grant us what You did promise unto us through Your Messengers, and do not disgrace us on the Day of judgement, for You never break Your promise. And their Lord has accepted of them, and answered them: Never will I suffer to be lost the work of any of you, whether male or female.</strong>’’ [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:193-195]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>tawassul</em> (seeking the means of nearness to Allaah) by this name is one of the causes for the <em>du’aa</em> to be responded to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[iii]: This man was a traveller, and journeying is often a cause for <em>du’aa</em> to be responded to, because a person feels more in need of Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; when travelling, than when a person is resident with his family. He was dusty and dishevelled, seeming very insignificant in himself, as if the most important thing to him was to implore Allaah and to call upon Him &#8211; in any condition he may be &#8211; whether dusty and dishevelled, or in ease and oppulance. Being dusty and dishevelled is also instrumental, like in the <em>hadeeth</em> attributed to the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) in which he said: Indeed Allaah boasts to the people of the Heaven about the people standing at ’Arafah, saying: ‘‘Look at My servants who have come to Me dusty and dishevelled.’’ [4] However, these factors did not bring about anything, because his food, his nourishment and his clothing were all <em>haraam </em>(unlawful). So the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) remarked: ‘‘So how can he be answered!’’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, if these conditions are not satisfied, then the question concerning the <em>du’aa</em> (supplication) being answered will seem distant. However, if the conditions are satisfied and the one supplicating is still not answered, then this is due to a wisdom which Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; knows, and the one supplicating does not know what this wisdom is; and maybe that you like a thing and it is bad for you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when these conditions are fulfilled and the one supplicating is not answered, then either he has been protected from an evil which is greater than what he has asked for, or Allaah stores it for him until the Day of Resurrection, and he then gets a greater reward. This is so, because the one who makes <em>du’aa</em> &#8211; calling upon Allaah alone, fulfilling the conditions and not being answered, but rather being saved from a greater evil &#8211; is in the position of having carried out the causes yet has been prevented from being answered, and therefore has a two-fold reward. One reward for making <em>du’aa </em>(supplication), and another reward for bearing the trial of not being answered. So that which is greater and more complete is stored for him with Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also of importance is that the one supplicating should not express dissatisfaction if his <em>du’aa </em>is apparently not being answered, for this action in itself is a reason for the <em>du’aa</em> not being answered &#8211; as the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: ‘‘A servants <em>du’aa</em> continues to be answered as long as be does not ask for anything sinful or breaking the ties of relations, and as long as be does not become impatient.’’ It was said: How does one become impatient O Messenger of Allaah? He said: ‘‘He says: I have supplicated, I have supplicated, yet it has not been answered.’’ [5] He therefore becomes dispondant and abandons supplicating. So it is not befitting that the one supplicating should become impatient about being answered, then become disappointed and dispondant, and thereby abandon making <em>du’aa</em>. Rather, one should call upon Allaah, since every <em>du’aa</em> you make to Allaah is an act of worship, which brings you closer to Him and increases your reward.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So my brother, you should take to making <em>du’aa</em> (supplication) in all affairs, be it general or specific, in difficulty or in ease. And if it was that supplication was only a means of worshipping Allaah &#8211; the One free from all imperfections, the Most High &#8211; then that would be sufficient. So it is more befitting that a person strives in this &#8211; and with Allaah lies the success and the ability.’’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Nâsir ud-Dîn al-Albânî [1]<br />
<strong>Al-Istiqaamah Magazine</strong>, Issue No.4 &#8211; Jumâdal-Awwal 1417H / November 1996<br />
Taken from al-Asaalah magazine (11/84-87).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: What are the foundations that will enable the Islaamic world to arise again anew?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: That which I believe, is what has been reported in the authentic hadeeth &#8211; which is a clear answer to this question, and to those questions similar to it which are asked in our present time &#8211; and that is the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> saying: <i>&#8220;When you deal in &#8216;eenah (a transaction involving usury), take hold of the tails of cows, become content with agriculture and abandon jihaad in the path of Allaah, then Allaah will permit your humiliation and He will not remove it from you, until you return to your Religion.&#8221;</i>2 Thus the foundation is to return to Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This very fact has been pointed out by Imaam Maalik (d.179H), <i>rahimahullaah</i>, in a statement transmitted from him, which is worthy of being written in gold ink: and that is his saying: &#8220;Whosoever introduces into Islaam an innovation, and holds it to be something good, has indeed alleged that Muharnrnad <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> has betrayed his message. Read the saying of Allaah &#8211; the Most Blessed &#8211; the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you and I have chosen for you Islaam as your religion.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:3].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So that which was not part of the religion at that time, cannot be part of the religion today. And the last part of this Ummah cannot be rectified, except by that which rectified its first part.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last sentence is the essential part with regards to the answer to this question, since he said: &#8220;And the last part of this Ummah cannot be rectified, except by that which rectified its first part.&#8221; So, just as the affair of the Arabs in <i>jaahillyyah</i> (pre-Islaamic ignorance) was not rectified, except by the advent of the Prophet Muhammad <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> via Divine Revelation &#8211; which brought them happiness in this world and will bring them salvation in the Hereafter &#8211; then likewise, re-establishing a happy and successful Islaamic life cannot be based upon anything other than returning to the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah (the Prophetic guidance).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, this matter is in need of some clarification, due to the presence of a multitude of Islaamic groups and parties in our midst today, each of them claiming to have set out the correct <i>manhaj</i> (methodology) which will bring about the Islaamic society and the rule of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We know from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> that the path to be taken in order to realise this objective (of bringing about the Islaamic society and the rule of Islaam) is a single path, and that is the one which Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; mentions in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed this is My Straight Path, so follow it, and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path.&#8221; </b>[Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:152].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> explained this to his Companions, since: <i>One day he drew a straight line for them on the ground and then drew many short lines on both sides of it. He then recited the previous aayah (verse) whilst he was moving his noble finger over the straight line, and he said: &#8220;This is Allaah &#8216;s Path.&#8221; He then pointed to the other lines and said: &#8220;These are other paths, and at the head of each one their is a devil calling towards it.&#8221;</i>4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Lord &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; emphasised in another <i>aayah</i> this very same point which was mentioned in the previous <i>aayah</i>; along with the explanation of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallullaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> in the hadeeth. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And whosoever opposes the Messenger, even after the guidance has been clearly conveyed to him, and follows a path other than that of the Believers, we shall leave him in the path he has chosen and land him in Hell, what an evil destination.&#8221; </b>[Soorah an-Nisaa 4:115].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <i>aayah</i> (verse) contains a great wisdom, since He &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; placed the path of the Believers in conjunction with that which the Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> brought. And the fine point of this wisdom was also indicated by the Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> in the hadeeth of al-lftiraaq (the</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">authentic narration concerning the splitting-up of this Ummah into seventy-three sects), when he was asked about the Saved-Sect, so he replied: <i>&#8220;It is that which I and my Companions are upon today.&#8221;</i>5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is the wisdom in Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; mentioning the path of the Believers in the previous <i>aayah&#8217;</i> And what is the underlying point of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> mentioning his Companions straight after mentioning himself, in the previous hadeeth?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer to this is: that these noble Companions are the very people who received the two Revelations (the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah) from Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, who explained it to them directly &#8211; without an intermediary &#8211; and this is contrary to all those who came after them. And there is no doubt that the affair is as Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam </i>said: &#8220;Indeed, the one present sees that which the absent one does not.&#8221;6 This is why the <i>eemaan</i> (faith) of the Companions was greater than those who came after them, and this is what has been clearly indicated by the Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> in the authentic hadeeth: <i>&#8220;The best of mankind is my generation, then those who follow them, then those who follow them.&#8221;</i>7 <b>Therefore, it is not possible for any Muslim to independently understand the Book and the Sunnah. Rather one must seek aid in understanding them by returning to the understanding of the noble Companions, who took their understanding from the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>; via his statements, his actions and his tacit approvals.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, along with calling to the Book and the Sunnah, it is absolutely essential to attach to this the understanding and the practice of the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> (the Pious Predecessors: the first three generations of Muslims whose excellence has been testified to in the above hadeeth); acting upon the preceding verses and hadeeth, which order clinging to the path of the Believers, which has been explained to be the path upon which the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, his Companions and those who followed them in beliefs and actions, were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And here, a very important question arises, which many of the Islaamic groups and parties neglect; and that is: How does one obtain knowledge of the understanding and the practical application of the Sunnah that the Companions adhered to?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer to this is: that there is no way in obtaining this knowledge, except by returning to <i>&#8216;ilmul-hadeeth</i> (the knowledge of hadeeth); <i>&#8216;ilm mustalahul-hadeeth</i> (the science of hadeeth) and the science of <i>al-jarh wat-ta&#8217;deel</i> (the science of verifying the condition of the narrators) &#8211; applying its principles and its terms such that the Scholars are able to distinguish that which is authentic from the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, from that which is not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in ending the answer to the question, we say in the the dearest possible manner, to those who desire to bring back to Islaam its honour, strength, supremacy and rule, that you must actualise two matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Firstly: to bring back to the minds of the Muslims the knowledge of the Sharee&#8217;ah (Laws) of Islaam; purified from all the innovations that have entered into it, which was not part of it on the day when Allaah &#8211; the Most Blessed, the Most High &#8211; revealed His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you and I have chosen for you Islaam as your religion.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:3].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accomplishing this matter requires a huge and tremendous effort on the part of the Muslim Scholars in all parts of the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly: It is a must that this purified knowledge is coupled with constant and steadfast action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, the day the Muslims return to understanding their religion as the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> understood it; and then act upon this purified Islaam in the correct manner, in all aspects of life, then that will be the day that the Muslims will rejoice at the help of Allaah and His victory. So this is what I am able to write in this short time. I ask Allaah that He grants us and all the Muslims the correct understanding of Islaam &#8211; in light of the Book, the authentic Sunnah (guidance) of His Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and that which the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> (Pious Predecessors) were upon &#8211; and that He grants us the ability to act in accordance with it. Indeed Allaah is the One who hears and responds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah Magazine, Issue No.6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE BASIS OF RIGHT GUIDANCE</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; <i>rahimahallaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Religion of the Muslims is built upon following the Book of Allaah, the Sunnah of His Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, and that which the Ummah has agreed upon. So these are the three infallible <i>usool</i> (fundamentals). So whatever the Ummah differs in, then it is referred back to Allaah and His Messenger. Thus, it is not for anyone to set-up a person for the Ummah, and to call to his way, and form <i>walaa</i> (love, loyalty and allegiance) and <i>&#8216;adaa</i> (enmity and hatred) based upon that, except for the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. Nor is any speech set-up for them based upon which they form <i>walaa</i> and <i>&#8216;adaa</i>, except for the speech of Allaah, and that of His Messenger, and that which the Ummah has agreed upon. Rather, this is the practice of the people of Innovation, who set-up a person, or a saying, with which they cause splits in the Ummah; forming <i>walaa</i> or<i> &#8216;adaa</i> based upon that saying or ascription.&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; also said:<br />
&#8220;It is not for anyone to ascribe himself to a particular Shaykh and to have <i>walaa</i> with those who follow him, or to have <i>&#8216;adaa</i> based upon that. Rather, he should have <i>walaa</i> for everyone who is from the people of <i>eemaan</i> (i.e. is a Muslim) and is known to have <i>taqwaa</i> (piety and obedience to Allaah in that which He has ordered and prohibited), from the Shaykhs, or from others. No one should be particularised with an increase in <i>walaa</i> except if he sees from him greater <i>eemaan</i> and <i>taqwaa</i>. So precedence and excellence is given to whomsoever Allaah and His Messenger have given them to. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;O mankind! Indeed We created you from a man and a woman, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Indeed the most noblest of you with Allaah are those that have the most <i>taqwaa</i> (piety).&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Hujuraat 49:13].&#8221;2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SECTARIANISM AND MISPLACED LOYALTIES</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah said:<br />
&#8220;Indeed the people of the truth and the Sunnah do not follow anyone (unconditionally) other than Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>; who does not speak from his desires, rather it is nothing less than Revelation sent down to him. So it is obligatory to affirm all that he informs, and to obey all that he commands. This status is not given to anyone else from this Ummah. Rather, every person&#8217;s saying can be taken or left, except that of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. So whoever sets up an individual other than Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, such that the one who loves and agrees with him is reckoned to be from <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah</i>, and the one that differs with him is reckoned to be from the people of innovations and sectarianism &#8211; as happens with those groups who follow certain Imaams of <i>kalaam</i> (theology and rhetorical speech) &#8211; then the person doing so is from the people of innovation, deviation and sectarianism.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; further said:<br />
&#8220;Indeed many &#8211; from the people who say such sayings &#8211; follow their desires in this, in order to elevate their egos, or to gain leadership; or whatever is connected to it. Their intention is not to make the word of Allaah uppermost, nor is it to make the Religion purely for Allaah. Indeed, they have hatred for those who oppose them &#8211; even if it is a <i>mujtahid</i> (a Scholar striving his utmost to arrive at the truth) who is excused, and whom Allaah is not angry with. Likewise, they are pleased with those who agree with them &#8211; even if it is an ignorant person with evil intentions, who neither has any knowledge, nor good intent. This leads them to praise those whom Allaah and His Messenger have not praised, and to censure those whom Allaah and His Messenger have not censured. It also causes them to have <i>walaa</i> (love and allegiance) and <i>&#8216;adaa</i> (enmity and hatred) based upon their own self-desires, not upon the Religion of Allaah and His Messenger &#8230; So whosoever does this will only bring about <i>fitan</i> (trials and discord) between the people.&#8221;4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>PRESERVING THE LOVE AND UNITY</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin Baaz &#8211; <i>hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Religion of Allaah orders to judge (with justice) in all matters, and not to have <i>walaa</i> (love, loyalty and allegiance) with your brother merely because he agrees with you, or to have <i>&#8216;adaa</i> (enmity and being distant) from him merely because he disagrees with you on a certain opinion or issue. This is not from justice at all! The Companions &#8211; <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhum</i> &#8211; differed in various issues, yet this did not affect the happiness and sincerity between them, nor their <i>walaa</i> and love for each other &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with them all. So the Believer acts upon the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Prescribed and Divine Islaamic Law) of Allaah, follows the truth, gives priority to the evidences before anyone &#8211; yet in doing so, he does not oppress his brother, nor negate doing justice to him when he differs regarding any issue of <i>ijtihaad</i> in which the evidences are not so apparent. Likewise is the case for those issues in which differences occur due to a different interpretation of the text. So, in such instances he is excused, and it is upon you to sincerely advice him, and to love only the good for him, and not to split-up, nor to have enmity and hatred between you and your brother &#8211; and there is no might, nor any power, except with Allaah. &#8220;5</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah Magazine, Issue No.4 &#8211; Jumâdal-Awwal 1417H / November 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>KNOWING THE STRAIGHT PATH</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullaah ibn Mas&#8217;ood <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> said:<br />
<i>The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam drew a line for us and said. &#8220;This is Allaah&#8217;s Straight Path.&#8221; Then he drew lines to its right and left and then said. &#8220;These ore other paths. Upon every one of them there is a devil calling towards it.&#8221; Then he recited:</i> <b>&#8220;Indeed this is My Straight Path, so follow it, and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:153].&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, that which is necessary for the Muslims &#8211; both individuals and groups in order to prepare for the mighty task and to achieve the lofty goal, is to truly know the Straight Path, its People, their <i>&#8216;aqeedah</i> (belief) and their <i>manhaj</i> (methodology), knowing also the innovations and evils which cause one to separate from this way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wisdom in learning about the evil is taken from the hadeeth of Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan radiallaahu &#8216;anhu where he said. &#8220;The people used to ask the Messenger of Allaah <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> about the good, but I used to ask him about the evil for fear that it would overtake me &#8230;&#8221;2 And may Allaah have mercy upon the one who said in poetic wisdom:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I learnt what was evil, not for itself, but to avoid it. He who does not know evil from good, falls into it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>CLINGING TO THE ORIGINAL STATE OF AFFAIRS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul-&#8216;Aaliyah (d.90H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; who said:<br />
&#8220;Learn Islaam. Then when you have learnt Islaam, do not turn away from it to the right nor the left. But be upon the Straight Path and upon the Sunnah of your Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and that which his Companions were upon &#8230; and beware of these innovations because they cause enmity and hatred amongst you. But stick to the original state of affairs which was there before they divided.&#8221; So &#8216;Aasim said: I related this to al-Hasan al-Basree so he said. &#8220;He has given you sincere advice and has told you the truth.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is known that this original state of affairs, had as its pure and sweet spring, the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, built upon the understanding of the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> (the Pious Predecessors) &#8211; the Companions, the <i>Taabi&#8217;een</i> and those that followed them &#8211; about whom the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said. <i>&#8220;The best of mankind is my generation, then those who follow them, then those who follow them.&#8221;</i>4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Aaishah <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhaa</i> said:<br />
A man come to the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and said. Who is the most excellent of mankind? So the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;The generation of those that I am in, then the second, then the third.&#8221;</i>5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this principle &#8211; the obligation of adhering to the Qur&#8217;aan and the authentic Sunnah upon the understanding of the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> &#8211; is the cornerstone principle of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Abu Haneefah (d.150H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;Stick to the narrations and the way of the Salaf and beware of newly invented matters, for all of it is innovation.&#8221;6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Awzaa&#8217;ee (d.157H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said.<br />
&#8220;Patiently restrict yourself to the Sunnah and pause where the people paused, say what they said and avoid what they avoided. Take to the path of your Salafus-Saalih, for indeed, what was sufficient for them, is sufficient for you.&#8221;7</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal (d.241H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;The fundamentals of the Sunnah with us are: Clinging to that which the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> were upon, taking them as our examples to be followed; avoiding innovations, for every innovation is misguidance.&#8221;8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abdul-Haadee (d.748H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;It is not permissible to invent on interpretation about a verse or a Sunnah which was not there in the time of the Salaf (the Pious Predecessors), nor did they have any knowledge concerning it, nor explain it to the Ummah. Since this would imply that the Salaf were ignorant of the truth in this matter and failed to reach it. Whereas the late-coming opponent is somehow guided to the truth!&#8221;9</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim (d.751H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;Inventing on explanation with regards to the Book of Allaah &#8211; which the Salaf and the Scholars are in opposition to &#8211; necessitates one of two things: Either the explanation itself is a mistake. Or that the sayings of the Salaf &#8211; which differs with such a saying &#8211; are in error! And no one who possess even an ounce of intellect would doubt that the one whose saying is in opposition to that of the Salaf, then he is the one who is in error.&#8221;10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SOFTENING THE HEARTS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Along with seeking to understand the correct Islaamic <i>&#8216;aqeedah</i> (beliefs) and <i>fiqh</i> (jurisprudence), <i>tafseer</i> (Qur&#8217;aanic explanation), and <i>hadeeth</i>, on essential part of the way of the Salaf includes understanding matters relating to <i>aadaab</i> and <i>akhlaaq</i> (manners and etiquettes) and <i>tazkiyatun-nufoos</i> (purification of the souls) and reflecting upon the lives of the Salafus-Saaliheen. Since this &#8211; it is hoped &#8211; will enable hearts to cultivate mildness and humility in the worship of Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; and also strengthen the determination to strive to making His Religion uppermost in the hearts of the people and upon the face of this earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn al-Jawzee (d.597H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;I feel that occupying oneself with jurisprudence and acquiring the narrations is hardly enough to correct the heart, unless he adds to that the study of <i>raqaa&#8217;iq</i> (heart-melting narrations) and the study of the lives of the Salaf us-Saaliheen (the Pious Predecessors). Since they attained what is desirous from the narrations and took from the outer actions what is ordered and what is wanted from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I do not inform you of this except after personal trial and experience. Since I have found that the majority of the narrators and the students of Hadeeth are concerned chiefly with attaining the briefest <i>isnaad</i> (chain of narration) and increase in the number of narrations. And the majority of the Jurisprudents are concerned with dialectics and how to win arguments. So how can the hearts be softened with these things? Previously a group of the Salaf would visit a pious servant to see his conduct and manners, not to take from his knowledge. This was because the fruit of his knowledge was his manners and conduct, so understand this. Thus, along with the study of <i>fiqh</i> and Hadeeth, study the lives of the Salaf and those who were <i>zaahid</i> (abstainers) with regards to the world, so that this may be a cause of softness in your hearts.&#8221;11</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yoonus ibn &#8216;Ubayd (d.139H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> -said:<br />
&#8220;With good manners you understand the knowledge. With the knowledge your actions are corrected. With actions wisdom is obtained. With wisdom you understand <i>zuhd</i> (abstinence) and are granted its benefits. With <i>zuhd</i> comes abandoning the world. With abandoning the world comes desire for the Hereafter. With desire for the Hereafter the pleasure of Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; is obtained.&#8221;12</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE FOUNDATIONS FOR UNITY</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said:<br />
<i>&#8220;This knowledge will be carried by the trustworthy ones of every generation. They will expel from it the alteration made by those going beyond bounds; the false claims of the liars and the false interpretations of the ignorant ones.&#8221;</i>13</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is our hope in Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect- that He adorns us with the correct knowledge bequeathed to us by our Salafus-Saalih, and that He aids us in learning their <i>&#8216;aqeedah</i>, so that hearts may embrace it; learning their <i>manhaj</i>, so that people may follow it and learning also their manners and behaviour, so that souls may be cultivated upon it, seeking to convey this to others with the wisdom, patience and forebearance that this pure and sublime message demands. So herein lies the excellence and of the one who reaches it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Rajab (d.795H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;So the beneficial knowledge from amongst all the types of knowledge is to take possession of the texts of the Book and the Sunnah and to understand their meanings, and to limit oneself in that to what is reported from the Companions, the <i>Taabi&#8217;een</i> and their Successors &#8211; with regards to the meaning of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Hadeeth, and what is reported from them as regard to the <i>halaal</i> (lawful) and <i>haraam</i> (prohibited), and <i>zuhd</i>, <i>raqaa&#8217;iq</i>, the accounts (of previous nations and Prophets), and other than that. Striving firstly, to distinguish what is authentic and what is weak; and then secondly, striving to understand and comprehend it. And there is enough in that for the intelligent one, and enough to occupy one who busies himself with beneficial knowledge. And he who stops at that and makes his intention purely for the Face of Allaah and seeks His help &#8211; then Allaah will help him, guide him and grant him success, satisfaction, understanding and inspiration. Then such a person will take the benefits of this knowledge &#8211; which ore found through it alone &#8211; and that is fear of Allaah, as Allaah &#8211; the Exalted and Majestic &#8211; says: <b>&#8220;Indeed, it is only those who have knowledge, amongst His slaves, that truly tear Allaah.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Faatir 35:10].&#8221;14</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Awaa&#8217;ee (d.157H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;Hold fast to the narrations of the Salaf, even if people were to abandon you. And beware of the opinions of the people, no matter how much they beautify it with their speech.&#8221;15</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan al-Basree (d.110H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;If there was a man who reached the first Salaf, then he (this man) was raised up today, he would not recognise anything of Islaam.&#8221; The narrator said: Al-Hasan put his hand on his cheek and said. &#8220;Except for this Prayer.&#8221; Then he said. &#8220;So &#8211; by Allaah &#8211; how is it for the one who lives in this bad time, not having reached the Salafus-Saalih. So he sees on innovator calling to his innovation, and a worldly person calling to the world, but Allaah protects him from that and makes his heart lean towards those Salafus-Saalih, asking about their way, seeking their narrations and following their path. Allaah will recompense him with a greet reward. So be like that &#8211; if Allaah wills.&#8221;16</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah (d.751 H), rahimahullaah 1<br />
From al-Istiqaamah magazine Shawwal 1418H/ February 1998</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O you who believe! Remember Allaah and remember Him a lot.&#8221; [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:4I]. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Those men and women who remember Allaah a lot.&#8221; [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:35]. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;So when you have finished the rights of your Pilgrimage, then remember Allaah as you remember your fore-father, or with more intense remembrance.&#8221; [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:200]. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These verses contain a command to remember Allaah intensely and abundantly, since the worshipper is in dire need of [remembering Allaah] and cannot do without it even for a twinkling of an eye. This is because every moment that a person does not spend in the dhikr (remembrance) of Allaah will not be of any benefit to him. Rather, the harm entailed in being neglectful of the dhikr of Allaah is far greater than any benefits that can be gained. One of the &#8216;aarifeen (those who are knowledgeable about Allaah) said:&#8221;If a person were to spend such and such number of years engaged [in the dhikr of Allaah], then he turns away from it for just a moment, what he will lose is far greater than whatever he has already gained.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bayhaqee relates from &#8216;Aaishah radiallaahu &#8216;anhaa that the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said: &#8220;There is no time in which the son of Aadam does not remember AIIaah in it, except that it will be a source of regret for him on the Day of Judgement&#8221; 2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mu&#8217;aadh ibn jabal radiallaahu &#8216;anhu relates that the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said: &#8220;The people of Paradise will not have any regrets except for those moments in which they were not engaged in the dhikr (remembrance) of Allaah.&#8221; 3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mu&#8217;aadh ibn Jabal also relates that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam was asked: What action is the most beloved to Allaah? So he replied: &#8220;That you continue to keep your tongue moist with the dhikr of Allaah, until you die.&#8221; 4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>POLISHING THE HEART</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dardaa radiallaahu &#8216;anhu said:&#8221;For everything there is a polish and the polish for the heart is the dhikr of Allaah&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bayhaqee relates from Ibn &#8216;Umar radiallaahu &#8216;anhu that AlIaah&#8217;s Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said: &#8220;For everything there is a polish, and the polish for the hearts is the dhikr (remembrance) of Allaah. There is nothing more potent in saving a person from the punishment of Allaah than the dhikr of Allaah.&#8221; It was said: Not even Jihaad in the path of Allaah. So he replied: &#8220;Not even if you were to continue striking with your sword until it breaks.&#8221;5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that hearts becomes rusty just as copper and silver coins become rusty. The polish for [this rust] is the dhikr of AIlaah. This is because [dhikr] is like a polish [which polishes the heart] like a shiny mirror. When dhikr is left, the rust returns. But when dhikr resumes, then the heart is [again] polished. And hearts become rusty due to two things:-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) neglecting remembering Allaah, and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) committing sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The polish for these two things is:-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) seeking Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) dhikr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>CONFUSING TRUTH WITH FALSEHOOD</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever neglects [remembering Allaah] most of the time, then his heart will become rusty in accordance with how neglectful the person is. And when this [filthy] rust accumulates on the heart, then it no longer recognises things as they really are. Thus, it views falsehood as if it is the truth, and truth as if it is falsehood. This is because this rust darkens and confuses the heart&#8217;s perception, and so it is unable to truly recognise things for what they really are. So as the rust accumulates, the heart gets blackened, and as this happens the heart becomes stained with this filthy rust, and when this occurs it corrupts the heart&#8217;s perception and recognition of things. The heart [then] does not accept the truth nor does it reject falsehood, and this is the greatest calamity that can strike the heart. Being neglectful [of dhikr] and following of whims and desires is a direct consequence of such a heart, which [further] extinguish the heart&#8217;s light and blinds its vision. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:<br />
<strong>&#8220;And do not obey him whose heart We have made to be neglectful of Our remembrance, one who follows his own whims and desires and whose affairs are furat [have gone beyond bounds and whose deeds have been lost].&#8221; [Soorah al-Kahf 18:28]. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>QUALITIES OF A GUIDE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when a worshipper desires to follow another person, then let him see: Is this person from the people of dhikr, or from the people who are negligent [about remembering Allaah]? Does this person judge in accordance with his whims and desires, or by the Revelation? So, if he judges by whims and desires then he is actually from those people who are negligent; those whose affairs have gone beyond bounds and whose deeds are lost.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The term furat [which occurs in the above verse] has been explained in many ways. It has been explained to mean:- (i) losing the rewards of that type of action which is essential to do, and in which lies success and happiness; (ii) exceeding the limits of something; (iii) being destroyed; and (iv) opposing the truth. Each of these sayings are very close in meaning to each other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point is that Allaah &#8211; the One free from all imperfections, the Most High &#8211; has prohibited following all those who possess such attributes. So it is absolutely essential that a person considers whether such attributes are found in his shaykh, or the person who&#8217;s example he follows, or the person that he obeys. If they are, then he should distance himself from such a person. However, if it is found that the person is, in most cases, pre-occupied with the dhikr of Allaah and with following the Sunnah, and his affairs do not exceed the limits, but rather he is judicious and resolute in his affairs, then he should cling to him very firmly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, there is no difference between the living and the dead, except with the dhikr of Allaah; since [the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam] said: &#8220;The example of one who remembers Allaah and someone who does not, is like the example between the living and the dead.&#8221;6</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">source: From Al-Istiqaamah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SHAYKH &#8216;ABDUL-&#8216;AZEEZ BIN BAAZ</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: What is the obligation upon the Muslim Scholars with regard to the large number of <i>jam&#8217;iyyaat</i> (societies) and <i>jamaa&#8217;aat</i> (groups) in many of the Islaamic lands and elsewhere, and with regard to the differences that exist between them, to the point that each group declares the others to be misguided. Do you not hold that it is fitting to enter into explaining the like of this matter, and to clarify the truth concerning their differences, for fear that these differences will increase and lead to evil consequences for the Muslims?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: &#8220;Our Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> made clear to us a single way which it is obligatory upon the Muslims to follow and traverse, and that is Allaah&#8217;s Straight Path and the methodology of His upright religion. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And this is My Straight Path, so follow it and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path. This has He ordained for you, that you may become pious.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:153]. Just as the Lord of Might and Majesty warned the Ummah (nation) of Muhammad <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> against splitting and disunity, since that is one of the greatest causes of failure and of the enemy taking control, as occurs in the saying of Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic&#8217;s: <b>&#8220;And fold fast altogether to the rope of Allaah and do not be divided.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:101]. And His &#8211; the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;He has ordained for you the same religion which He ordained for Nooh, and that which We revealed to you, and that which We ordained for Ibraaheem, Moosaa and &#8216;Eesaa <i>&#8216;alayhimus-salaam</i>, saying: that you should establish the religion by doing that which you are ordered with, and make no divisions in it. Intolerable for the Pagans is that to which you call them.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:13]. So this is a Divine call to unity and for hearts to be harmonised. And in any Islaamic land, if there are many groups for the purpose of good, aid, co-operating in righteousness and piety between the Muslims &#8211; without their being differences between the desires of the companions and followers &#8211; then this is good, is a blessing, and produces great benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if each of them declare the others to be misguided and attack their actions, then this harm is very great and its evil consequences very serious. Then what is obligatory upon the Muslims is to clarify the true state of affairs and to discuss with each group and to sincerely advise all of them that they should proceed upon the way laid down by Allaah for His servants, and upon that which our Prophet Muhammad <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> called to. Then those who ignore this, or continue in their stubbornness, due to personal benefit or goal &#8211; known only to Allaah &#8211; then what is obligatory upon those who know the reality is to make this known about them and to warn against them, so that the people may avoid their path, and that those who do not know the reality of their affair may not fall into it and be led astray, and that they are not turned away from the Straight Path which Allaah ordered that we follow, as occurs in His &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;And this is My Straight Path, so follow it and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path. This has He ordained for you, that you may become pious.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:153]. And from that which there is no doubt about is that the multitude of sects and groups in the Islaamic society is, firstly something desired by Shaytaan, and secondly something desired by the enemies of Islaam from amongst mankind. Since agreement and unification of the Muslims, and their being aware of the dangers which threaten them and their <i>&#8216;aqeedah</i> (beliefs), will make them active in refuting and rebutting it, and acting in a unified manner for the benefit of the Muslims &#8211; thus repelling the danger from their religion, their lands and their brothers. And this is something which the enemies &#8211; from amongst mankind and jinn &#8211; are not pleased with. Therefore they are very eager to split-up the Muslims, destroy their unity and to sow the seeds of enmity and discord between them. We ask Allaah that He unites the Muslims upon the truth and that He removes from their society every type of misguidance and every cause of discord. Indeed He is the One Who is able to do that, and He is the One having full power over it.&#8221; 1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: &#8230; and the students of knowledge refer back to you and to the other major Scholars and ask them. So what do you advise them? Do you advise and approve of entering (i.e. joining) the likes of these groups; such as <i>Jamaa&#8217;atul-Ikhwaan</i>, <i>Jamaa&#8217;atut-Tableegh</i>, <i>Jamaa&#8217;atul-Jihaad</i>, and so on, or do you advise them to remain upon seeking knowledge with the students of knowledge from those who call to the way of the Salaf (the Pious Predecessors)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: &#8220;All praise is for Allaah and may Allaah extol and send blessings of peace upon His Prophet. We advise them all to unite upon a single way and that is the way of seeking knowledge and attaining understanding of the Book and the Sunnah, and to proceed along the <i>manhaj</i> (methodology) of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah. I advise them all that their goal should be to follow the Book and the Sunnah and to proceed upon the <i>manhaj</i> of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah, and that they should all call themselves Ahlus-Sunnah or the followers of the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> (Pious Predecessors). But as for <i>tahazzub</i> (bigotted partisanship) for the <i>Ikhwaanul-Muslimeen</i>, or <i>Jamaa&#8217;atut-Tableegh</i>, or so on, then I do not advise that. That is a mistake. Rather we advise them that they should be together upon a single way, a single <i>jamaa&#8217;ah</i>, advising one another with the truth and having allegiance to Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah. This is the correct way to prevent differences. But if there are various groups upon that same way (i.e. of following the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i>) &#8211; a group in such and such a place, and another in such and such a place &#8211; but all of them are upon the <i>Salafee</i>2 way, following the Book and the Sunnah, calling to Allaah and having allegiance to Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah &#8211; without <i>tahazzub</i> (partisanship) and without <i>ta&#8217;assub</i> (bigotted blind-following) &#8211; then that is not harmful &#8211; even if there are a number of groups &#8211; as long as their way and their goal is one.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SHAYKH SAALIH AL-FAWZAAN</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: Noble Shaykh, with regards to the serious state in which the Ummah of Islaam lives &#8211; a state of confusion in peoples&#8217; thoughts &#8211; particularly in matter relating to the Religion. For the Islamic <i>Jamaa&#8217;ahs</i> (groups) and sects have become many, and each of them claim that their <i>manhaj</i> (methodology) is the correct Islamic methodology which must be followed. So the Muslim is left in a state of confusion as to what he should follow and which one is upon the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: &#8220;Splitting up is not from the Religion, since the Religion commands us with unity and that we should be a single <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i> and a single Ummah upon the <i>&#8216;aqeedah</i> (belief) of Tawheed (i.e. to single out Allaah alone for worship) and upon following the Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Indeed this Ummah of yours is a single Ummah and I am your Lord, so worship Me alone.&#8221; </b>[Soorah al-Anbiyaa 21:92]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And hold fast altogether to the rope of Allaah and do not become divided.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:103]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Indeed those who split-up their Religion and become sects, you have no part with them in the least. Their affair is with Allaah who will tell them what they used to do.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:159]. So this contains a severe warning against splitting and differing. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:<b> &#8220;And do not be like those who split-up and differed after the clear evidences came to them. For them is a tremendous punishment.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:105].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So our Religion is the Religion of <i>al-Jamaa&#8217;ah</i>, and the Religion of agreement and unity. Splitting is not from the Religion, since the Religion orders that we are a single <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i> and the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<i> &#8220;The Believer to the Believer is like a building, one part supporting the other.&#8221;</i>4 And he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> also said: <i>&#8220;The example of the Believers with respect to their mutual love, mercy and affection is like the example of a single body.&#8221;</i>5 And it is known that a building and a body are a single cohesive thing, not disunited and fragmented &#8211; since if a building splits then it will collapse; and likewise a body, if it splits, then life will be lost. Thus, there must be a unity and we must be a single <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i> whose foundations is Tawheed and whose methodology is the <i>da&#8217;wah</i> (call) of the Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>; and which proceeds upon the Religion of Islaam. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And this is My Straight Path, so follow it, and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:153]. So these groups, and this splitting which is present today, is not approved of by Islaam. Rather, Islaam forbids it severely and commands uniting upon the <i>&#8216;aqeedah</i> (belief) of Tawheed and upon the methodology of Islaam, a single <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i> and a single Ummah, just as our Lord &#8211; the Most Perfect, the Most High &#8211; ordered. And splitting and their being many (differing) groups and parties is from the plots of the devils &#8211; from the jinn and mankind &#8211; against this Ummah. So the <i>kuffaar</i> (disbelievers) and the <i>munaafiqs</i> (hypocrites) have never ceased, since olden times, introducing their poison in order to split the Ummah. The jews said previously: <b>&#8220;And a party of the People of the Book say: Believe in the morning in that which is revealed to the Muslims, but reject it at the end of the day, so they may turn back.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:72]. Meaning: that the Muslims will leave their religion when they see you leaving it. And the Hypocrites said: <b>&#8220;Do not spend on those who are with Allaah&#8217;s Messenger until they desert him.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Munaafiqoon 63:7]. <b>&#8220;And as for those who erect a mosque by way of disbelief and seeking to harm and disunite the Believers &#8230;&#8221;</b> [Soorah at-Tawbah 9:107].&#8221; 6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: What is the ruling with regards to those who align themselves with those <i>jamaa&#8217;ahs</i>, particularly those that are established upon secrecy and giving <i>bay&#8217;ah</i> (pledge of allegiance to the party leader)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: &#8220;The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> informed us that splitting would occur and he ordered us, at that particular time, to come together and to be upon that which the Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and his Companions were upon. So he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;The jews split-up into seventy-one sects and my Ummah would split-up into seventy-three sects. All of them are in the Fire except one.&#8221;</i> They said: Who is it O Messenger of Allaah? So he replied: <i>&#8220;That which I and my Companions are upon this day.&#8221;</i>7 And he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said, when his Companions asked him to advise him: <i>&#8220;I advise you to have taqwaa (fear and obedience) of Allaah and to hear and to obey, even if an Abysinnian slave is a leader over you. And those of you who live long after me will see many differences of opinion. So hold fast to my Sunnah and the guidance of the Rightly-Guided Khaleefahs (Successors) after me; cling to it tightly &#8230;&#8221;</i>8 So this is the <i>manhaj</i> (methodology) which is obligatory for all the Muslims to follow, until the Day of Resurrection. So when disagreements occur then they must return back to that which the Salaf (the Pious Predecessors) of this Ummah were upon, with regards to <i>manhaj</i>, <i>bay&#8217;ah</i> (pledge of allegiance), and other matter connected to the Religion.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Al-Istiqaamah &#8211; Shawwaal 1418H / February 1998 &#8211; Issue No.8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]:<b>THE OBLIGATION TO UNIFY THE RANKS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ibn al-&#8216;Uthaymeen &#8211; hafidhahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;From the sincere advice which I hold to be necessary in the Religion to give to the youths, a word which I hope that Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect, the Most High &#8211; will cause to be of benefit, and it is:That they should all be in conformity and harmony, so that they may become strong, and become an obstacle blocking the way of those who plot against Islaam and its people. This is what Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; has enjoined upon us. He &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And hold fast altogether to the rope of Allaah and do not be divided. And remember the favour of Allaah upon you, in that you were once enemies to one another, but He joined your hearts together, so that by His Grace you became brothers.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:103]. And Allaah the Blessed, the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Let there arise from amongst you a group of people inviting to all that is good, enjoining the good and forbidding the evil. It is they who are the successful ones, And do not be like those who differed amongst themselves after the clear proofs had come to them; for them is a painful punishment.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:104-105]. So Allaah ordered that they should all cling together to His rope and He forbade splitting, and in other Aayahs He forbade differing, and informed us that it is the cause of failure and the cause of decline of strength, and He ordered us to persevere patiently. So Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And do not differ, lest you lose courage and your strength departs, and be patient. Indeed Allaah is with those who are patient.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anfaal 8:46]. And as is known, the people of good who help the youths of the revival in their work &#8211; with what they are able from wealth, and so on &#8211; if they see them splitting in this way, then they will not be so eager to help and assist them. So I call all of our brothers to unite together, and to fear Allaah with regards to themselves and with regards to the Ummah (nation) of Islaam, and that they should not cover up this light which has appeared on the horizon; the call to Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8230;&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;Holding fast to the rope of Allaah altogether and not becoming divided is one of the greatest usool (fundamentals) of Islaam.&#8221;2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]:<b>THE PROHIBITION OF SPLITTING</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan &#8211; hafidhahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;Splitting up is not from the Religion, since the Religion</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">commands us with unity and that we should be a single Jamaa&#8217;ah and a single Ummah upon the &#8216;aqeedah (belief) of Tawheed (i.e. to single out Allaah alone for worship) and upon following the Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;aloyhi wa sallam. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:<b>&#8220;Indeed this Ummah of yours is a single Ummah and I am your Lord, so worship Me alone.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anbiyaa 21:92]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High -said: <b>&#8220;And hold fast altogether to the rope of Allaah and do not become divided.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmaan 3:103]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Indeed those who split-up their Religion and become sects, you have no part with them in the least. Their affair is with Allaah who will tell them what they used to do.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:159]. So this contains a severe warning against splitting and differing. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And do not be like there who split-up and differed after the clear evidences came to them. For them is a tremendous punishment.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:105].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So our Religion is the Religion of al-Jamaa&#8217;ah, and the Religion of agreement and unity. Splitting is not from the Religion, since the Religion orders that we are a single Jamaa&#8217;ah and the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said: <i>&#8220;The Believer to the Believer is like a building, one part supporting the other.&#8221;</i>3 And he sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam also said: <i>&#8220;The example of the Believers with respect to their mutual love, mercy and affection is like the example of a single body.&#8221;</i>4 And it is known that a building and a body are a single cohesive thing, not disunited and fragmented &#8211; since if a building splits then it will collapse; and likewise a body, if it splits, then life will be lost. Thus, there must be a unity and we must be a single Jamaa&#8217;ah whose foundation is Tawheed and whose methodology is the da&#8217;wah (call) of the Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam; and which proceeds upon the Religion of Islaam. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:<b>&#8220;And this is My Straight Path, so follow it, and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:153]. So these groups, and this splitting which is present today, is not approved of by Islaam. Rather, Islaam forbids it severely and commands uniting upon the &#8216;aqeedah (belief) of Tawheed and upon the methodology of Islaam, a single Jamaa&#8217;ah and a single Ummah, just as our Lord &#8211; the Most Perfect, the Most High &#8211; ordered. And splitting and their being many (differing) groups and parties is from the plots of the devils &#8211; from the jinn and mankind against this Ummah. So the kuffaar (disbelievers) and the munaafiqs (hypocrites) have never ceased, since olden times, introducing their poison in order to split the Ummah. The jews said previously: <b>&#8220;And a party of the People of the Book say: Believe in the morning in that which is revealed to the Muslims, but reject it at the end of the day, so they turn back.&#8221; </b>[Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: that the Muslims will leave their religion when they see you leaving it. And the Hypocrites said: <b>&#8220;Do not spend on those who are with Allaah&#8217;s Messenger until they desert him.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Munaafiqoon 63:7]. <b>&#8220;And as for those who erect a mosque by way of disbelief and seeking to harm and disunite the Believers &#8230;&#8221;</b> [Soorah at-Tawbah 9:107].&#8221;5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]: <b>THE CONNECTION BETWEEN UNITY AND REFUTING FALSE BELIEFS AND PRACTICES</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin Baaz &#8211; hafidhahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There is no doubt that it is obligatory upon the Muslims to unify their ranks and to unite their word upon the truth and to co-operate in goodness and piety against the enemies of Islaam &#8211; as Allaah, the Most Perfect &#8211; ordered them with in His saying: <b>&#8220;And hold fast altogether to the rope of Allaah and do not become divided.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:102]. And likewise, Allaah has warned the Muslims against splitting up, as occurs in His &#8211; the Most Perfect&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;And do not be like those who differed and split-up after the clear evidences came to them.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:105]. However, the order to unify the Muslims and unite their word upon the truth and to hold fast to the rope of Allaah, does not mean that they should not censure wrong beliefs and practices &#8211; whether from the Soofees or other than them. Rather, what the order to hold fast to the Rope of Allaah necessitates is: To order the good; forbid the evil; to clarify the truth, with the clear Sharee&#8217;ah proofs, to whomsoever is misguided or has a mistaken opinion, until they unite upon the truth and turn away from that which opposes it. All of this is included in His &#8211; the Most Perfect&#8217;s &#8211; saying:<b> &#8220;And help you one another in righteousness and piety, and do not help one another in sin and transgression.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:2]. And His &#8211; the Most Perfect&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;Let there arise from amongst you a group of people calling to all that is good, enjoining the good and forbidding the evil, they are the ones who are successful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal&#8217;Imraan 3:1 10]. And when the people of truth hold back from clarifying the mistakes of those who have erred or are mistaken, then they will not have achieved that which Allaah ordered them with, as regards calling to goodness, ordering the good and forbidding the evil. So the person in error will remain upon his error, and the one acting in opposition to the truth will remain upon his mistake. And this is contrary to what Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; prescribed, with regards to sincere advice, co-operation upon goodness, ordering the good and forbidding the evil &#8211; and Allaah alone is the One Who grants success.&#8221;6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;Refuting ahlul-bida&#8217; (the innovators) is a Jihaad, to the extent that Yahyaa ibn Yahyaa (d.226H) said: &#8220;Defence of the Sunnah is more excellent than Jihaad in the path of Allaah.&#8221;7&#8243;8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Humaydee (d.218H) &#8211; rahimahullaoh &#8211; said: &#8220;By Allaah, that I fight against those who reject the hadeeth of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam is more beloved to me than fighting the unbelievers.&#8221;9</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim (d.751H)- rahimahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;Jihaad with the clear proofs and the tongue; Comes before Jihaad with the sword and the spear.&#8221;10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;When some people asked Ahmad bin Hanbal (d.241H) that they felt uneasy about [criticising people] by saying that such and such is this, and such and such is that, he replied: &#8220;lf I were to remain silent, how would the ignorant ones know the authentic [narrations] from the inauthentic?&#8221; Similarly, the innovators who introduce heretical writings which oppose the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, and those who innovate in matters of worship, then explaining their true condition and warning the Ummah against them is an obligation by the unanimous agreement of the Muslim Scholars. In fact, when Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal was asked whether a person who fasted, prayed and secluded himself in the mosque for worship was dearer to him than a person who spoke out against ahlul-bid&#8217;ah (the innovators), he replied: &#8220;When he fasts and prays and secludes himself, then he does so for the benefit of his own self. However, when he speaks out against the innovators, he does so for the benefit of the Muslims in general, and this is more virtuous.&#8221; So it is clear that opposing the Innovators is of general benefit to the Muslims and is considered one of the types of Jihaad in the path of Allaah. Since purifying the Religion of Allaah, and its minhaaj (methodology), its Shoree&#8217;ah, and defending it from their attacks and that of their enemies is a collective obligation &#8211; a fact which is agreed upon by the Scholars. For if Allaah did not raise up some people to repel the harms [caused by] others, then the Religion would become corrupted. Indeed, this type of corruption is even greater than the corruption resulting from the disbelievers conquering the Muslims. This is because <b>when the disbelievers conquer the Muslims, they do not corrupt their hearts nor their Religion, except after some time. Whereas the innovators corrupt the hearts from the very outset.&#8221;</b>11</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah, Issue No.3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the One free from all imperfections &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;So have <i>taqwaa</i> (fear and obedience) of Allaah and reconcile the differences between yourselves.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anfaal 8:1].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed the Believers are but brothers. Therefore reconcile the differences between your brothers, and fear Allaah so that you may receive mercy.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Hujuraat 49:10].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;So this is a knot which Allaah has bound the Believers together with, such that whenever a person is found possessing <i>eemaan</i> (faith) in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers and the Last Bay &#8211; whether in the eastern or western part of the world &#8211; then such a person becomes the brother of the Believers. This brotherhood obligates that the Believers should love for that person that which they love for themselves, and hate for that person that which they hate for themselves. Therefore, the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said &#8211; whilst ordering the brotherhood of <i>eemaan</i> (faith): <i>&#8220;Do not envy one another. Do not inflate prices upon one another. Do not hate one another. Do not forsake one another. Do not under-cut one another. But be worshippers of Allaah and brothers. The Muslim is the brother of another Muslim; he neither oppresses him, nor humiliates him, nor lies to him, nor holds him in contempt. And piety is right here &#8211; and he pointed to his chest three times. It is enough evil for a person to hold his brother Muslim in contempt. The whole of a Muslim for another Muslim is sacred; his blood, his property and his honour.&#8221;</i>1 And he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;The Believer to the Believer is like a solid structure, one part supporting the other.&#8221; And he interlaced his fingers to demonstrate this.</i>2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus Allaah and His Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> ordered that the rights of the Believers be fulfilled by each other, and that those matters which will bring about harmony, love and togetherness be carried out. All of this is to be done in order to further the rights that they have over one another. So from such tights is that when fighting occurs between them &#8211; thereby causing their hearts to separate and to have hatred and to cut-off from each other &#8211; then the Believers should bring about reconciliation between their brothers and do that which will remove the enmity. Then Allaah ordered <i>taqwaa</i> in general and made the bestowal of His Mercy the consequence of their having <i>taqwaa</i> and their fulfilling the rights of the Believers. So He said: <b>&#8220;And have taqwaa of Allaah in order that you may receive mercy.&#8221;</b> Thus, if Allaah&#8217;s Mercy is attained, then the good of this world and the Hereafter will also be attained.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Aaishah <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhaa</i> used to say, that when people abandoned acting upon this Aayah (verse): <b>&#8220;When two parties of the Believers fight each other, then make reconciliation between them.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Hujuraat 49:9]. So when the Muslims began fighting each other, it was obligatory to reconcile them, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; ordered. However, when they did not do this, then fitnah (trials and tribulations) spread, as did ignorance, and this is what caused the differences to continue.4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Shall I not inform you of something that is greeter in degree than (optional) fasting, charity and Prayer?&#8221;</i> They said: Indeed inform us. So he said: <i>&#8220;It is reconciling the people. For indeed causing corruption between them is the shaver!&#8221;</i>5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> explained this shaving in another saying: <i>&#8220;The disease of the people before you has overcome you, namely envy and hatred and it is the shaver. I do not say that it shaves-off the heir. Rather, it shaves-off the religion!&#8221;</i>6</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh bin Bâz [1]<br />
Source: Istiqaamah Magazine, Issue No.6 &#8211; Dhul-Qa&#8217;dah 1417H / March 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: What is the obligation upon the Muslim Scholars with regard to facing the trials and calamities that have befallen the Islaamic world?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: From that which there is no doubt about is that sins, and being far removed from the correct Islaamic <i>&#8216;aqeedah</i> (beliefs) &#8211; in both sayings and actions &#8211; are from the greatest reasons of bringing about the various crisis and calamities that have befallen the Muslims. Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Whatever of good reaches you, it is from Allaah; and whatever of evil befalls you, it is from yourself.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:79]. Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect, the Most High &#8211; also said: <b>&#8220;And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. Yet He pardons much.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:30]. So Allaah is Most Forgiving and the Most Merciful to His servants, sending to them clear signs and warnings, in order that they may run back to Him in <i>tawbah</i> (sincere repentance) and that He may forgive them. So when a person runs to Allaah and draws closer to Him by an arm&#8217;s length, then Allaah draws closer to him by two arm&#8217;s length. For indeed Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; loves those of His servants that turn to Him in <i>tawbah</i> and is happy with that, whilst He &#8211; the Majestic, the Most High &#8211; remains absolutely self-sufficient from His servants. The obedience of the obedient ones does not benefit Him, nor do the sins of the sinful ones harm Him. But He is Most Kind, Ever Merciful to His servants. And He grants them the ability to do acts of obedience and to leave acts of disobedience. So these crisis and calamities are none other than a warning to His servants, in that they should turn back to Allaah in repentance and obedience, and He informs them of this by way of testing them. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And certainly We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruit. But give glad tidings to those who have <i>sabr</i> (patience); those who, when afflicted with a calamity, say: Indeed to Allaah we belong, and to Him shall we return. They are those for whom are the <i>salawaat</i> (blessings and forgiveness) from their Lord, and His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided-ones.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:155] Allaah &#8211; the One free From all defects &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Evil has appeared on the land and the sea, because of what the hands of men have earned. That Allaah may make them taste a part of that which they have done, in order that they may return to Allaah in repentance.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Room 30:41]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And We shall test you by way of evil and good, and to Us will you return.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anbiyaa 21:35]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And We tested them with good blessings and evil calamities, in order that they may return to the obedience of Allaah.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-A&#8217;raaf 7:168]. And there are many other Verses with a similar meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the obligation upon the leaders of the Muslims &#8211; the Scholars, rulers, and other than them &#8211; is to have concern for the various afflictions and calamities that occurs, and to remind and admonish the people, and explain to them what they have fallen into. Also. those in authority &#8211; from the Scholars and the rulers &#8211; should set a good example of righteous conduct and should discuss the reasons as to why Allaah is angered and gives retribution; and they should seek to cure this with <i>tawbah</i> (repentance), <i>istighfaar</i> (seeking Allaah&#8217;s Forgiveness) and correcting their affairs. The rest of the Ummah will then follow them in this, since the guidance of the Scholars, and the wisdom of the rulers &#8211; and both being correct and upright &#8211; has one of the greatest effects with regards to the fulfillment of responsibilities. The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Each of you is a guardian, and is responsible for those whom he is in charge of. So the ruler is a guardian and is responsible for his subjects; a man is the guardian of his family and is responsible for those under his care; a woman is a guardian of her husband&#8217;s home and is responsible for those under her care; a servant is the guardian of his master&#8217;s wealth and is responsible for that which he is entrusted with; and a man is the guardian of his father&#8217;s wealth and is responsible for that which is under his care. So each one of you is a guardian and is responsible for what he is entrusted with.&#8221;</i>2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, when the Muslims become accustomed to sinning and with being contented with it, and those who wield authority and power do not try to prevent them, then Allaah&#8217;s anger will quickly descend upon the Ummah. And when His anger occurs, and His punishment takes place, then it covers both the sinful and obedient, and Allaah&#8217;s protection is sought from this. About this Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:<b> &#8220;And beware of the <i>fitnah</i> (trial and discord) that does not affect in particular only those amongst you who are wrong-doers.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Afaal 8:25]. Likewise. the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<i> &#8220;When the people see an evil, and they do not try to change it, then Allaah will cover them all with punishment from Himself.</i>&#8220;3 Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said:<b> &#8220;Indeed Allaah will not change the condition of a people until they change themselves.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ar-Ra&#8217;d 13:11]. So the Scholars will be thorougly questioned in front of Allaah with regards to them giving knowledge and guidance to the people, and explaining to them what is correct and what is wrong, and also clarifying the beneficial from the harmful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we ask Allaah that He favours all the Muslims and grants them the ability to be obedient to their Lord, and to cling to the guidance of their Prophet Muhammad <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, and that He grants their leaders the ability to fulfill their duties, and that He teaches their Scholars the ways of guidance, so that they may all traverse its path and direct the Ummah to it, and that He guides the misguided Muslims and corrects their affairs. Indeed He is the Guardian over this, and the One having power to do this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: The enemies of Allaah are very eager to enter into the Muslim lands by various methods. So what efforts do you believe should be exerted in order to put a stop to this surge that has threatened the Islaamic societies?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: This is not something strange coming from the callers to Christianity, Judaism, or the other religions of <i>kufr</i> (disbelief). Since Allaah, the Most Perfect &#8211; and to Him belongs all praise &#8211; has informed us about this in His clear Revelation, when He said: <b>&#8220;Never will the Jews and the Christians be pleased with you until you follow their ways of life. Say: Indeed the Guidance of Allaah, that is the only true Guidance. And if you were to follow their false desires after what you have received of the knowledge of Revelation, then you would have neither a guardian, nor any helper against Allaah.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:120]. Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; also said: <b>&#8220;And they will never stop fighting you, until they turn you away from your Religion, if they can.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:217]. This is why they utilize every possible means to penetrate into the Muslim lands, and use various methods and tactics to acheive this. One of their methods is to plant the seeds of doubt and uncertainty into the minds and thoughts &#8211; and they continue to do so without easing-up or become weary &#8211; utilising the church to spread their hatred and enmity, and directing their efforts through it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore it is obligatory upon the leaders and Scholars to exert every possible effort in cautioning and directing the Muslim children, and to oppose the efforts of the enemies of Islaam with countermeasures. For indeed the Ummah of Islaam is an Ummah that has been entrusted  with a responsibility of carrying this Religion and conveying it to others. So when we &#8211; in the Islaamic societies &#8211; are determined to arm our sons and daughters with correct knowledge, and true understanding of the Religion; beginning this process at an early age, then we will never fear the enemy &#8211; by the permission of Allaah. Thus, as long as we continue to cling to the Religion of Allaah, glorifying and venerating Him, following His <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Prescribed Laws), and fighting those who oppose Him, then the opposite will happen; it will be the enemies of Allaah who will fear the Muslims. Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect, the One to Whom belongs all praise &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;O you who believe. If you help Allaah by acting upon what you have been commanded with, then Allaah will plant your feet firmly by giving you victory over your enemies.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Muhammad 47:7]. Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; also said: <b>&#8220;But if you have <i>sabr</i> (remain patient) and have <i>taqwaa</i> (piety) by doing what Allaah orders and refraining from what He has prohibited, then no harm will their cunning plots be to you at all. Indeed Allaah encompasses everything by His Knowledge.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-lmraan 3:120]. And there are plenty of other Verses with similar meaning. So the most important factor in stopping this attack is to prepare a generation that truly know and understands the realities of Islaam. This can be achieved by giving them the correct guidance and cultivation at home, and by utilising the various means of education in order to develop the society. Add to this the role of guiding, which is the duty of those in authority, and their duty of being constant in doing beneficial acts, being constant in reminding the people with what is of benefit to them, and doing that which cultivates the correct Islaamic <i>&#8216;aqeedah </i>(belief) in the people: <b>&#8220;Indeed in the remembrance of Allaah do hearts truly find tranquility.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ar-Ra&#8217;d 13:28].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is no doubt that negligence is one of the causes that lets the enemies of Islaam into the Muslim lands &#8211; along with their ideological attack &#8211; which gradually distances the Muslims from their Religion, step by step. So with this, evil will increase amongst them and they will be affected by the false ideologies of their enemies. And Allaah &#8211; One free from all defects, the Most High &#8211; ordered the Believers to have <i>sabr</i> (patience), to call to patience, and to strive in His Path using every method at their disposal; as He &#8211; the Most Majestic, Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;O you who Believe. Persevere and be more patient, and guard your territory by stationing army units permanently at the places from where the enemy can attack you, and have <i>taqwaa</i> of Allaah (by doing what He orders and keeping away from what He prohibits) in order that you may be successful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:200]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said:<b> &#8220;And those who strive hard in Our cause, We shall surely guide them to Our Avenues. Indeed Allaah is with the doers of good.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-&#8216;Ankaboot 29:69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah by His beautiful Names and lofty Attributes that He improves and corrects the affairs of the Muslims, and that He grants to them the understanding of the Religion, gathers the word of their leaders upon the truth, and improves and corrects their close advisors. Indeed He is the Most Kind, Most Generous. And may Allaah extol and send abundant blessings of peace upon our Leader and our Prophet, Muhammad, and upon his Family, his Companions, and his true followers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">istiqaamah magazine/july1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an important warning against a disease which has adversely affected many groups who ascribe themselves to the noble task of Da&#8217;wah. Everything which is outside the call of Islaam and the Qur‘aan, with regards to lineage, land, nationality, schools of thoughts and ways, then it is from the calls of jaahiliyyah. perfect opposite is confirmed for Allaah &#8211; the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Islaam has forbidden the calls of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> (the pre-Islaamic days of ignorance) and there are many textual evidences which forbid all of the characteristics and manners of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> and their actions, except those (good and decent) practices which Islaam agreed to.  And there is no doubt that the call to nationalism is from these calls of <em>jaahiliyyah</em>, since nationalism is a call to other than Islaam and an aiding of other than the truth.  And how many ills, evils and serious wars has such calls of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> caused to their people, causing great harm to their souls, their wealth and their possessions. The consequences of such calls (for the Muslims) was a splitting up of their unity and a planting of enmity and hatred of each other in their hearts and a fragmentation and splitting between tribes and nations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) – rahimahullaah – said: [2] “Everything which is outside the call of Islaam and the <em>Qur‘aan</em>, with regards to lineage, land, nationality, schools of thoughts and ways, then it is from the calls of <em>jaahiliyyah</em>. Indeed, even when the <em>Muhaajirs</em> (those Companions who migrated from Makkah to al-Madeenah) and the <em>Ansaars</em> (those Companions who aided and supported those who migrated) argued, such that one of the <em>Muhaajirs</em> said: “O <em>Muhaajirs</em>! (implying; rally to my aid).”  And then one of the <em>Ansaar</em> said: “O Ansaar!”  Upon hearing this, the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “Is it with the calls of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> that you call, and I am still amongst you!”  And he became very angry at that.” [3]<br />
And from the textual evidences pertaining to this issue is Allaah the Most High’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>And stay in your homes and do not display yourselves, like the display of the times of jaahiliyyah</strong> (pre-Islaamic ignorance)<strong>. But establish the Prayer, give the Zakaat and obey Allaah and His Messenger.</strong>” [Sooratul-Ahzaab 33:33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>When those who disbelieved placed in their hearts pride and arrogance the pride and arrogance of jaahiliyyah then Allaah sent down His tranquility upon His Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam and upon the Believers&#8230;</strong>” [Sooratul-Fath 48:26].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “Whosoever leaves off obedience and separates from the <em>Jamaa’ah</em> (united body) and dies, then he dies a death of <em>jaahiliyyah</em>.  Whoever fights under the banner of the blind, becoming angry for <em>’asabiyyah</em> (partisanship and party spirit), or calling to <em>’asabiyyah</em>, or assisting <em>’asabiyyah</em>, then dies, he dies a death of <em>jaahiliyyah</em>.” [4] Also in <em>Saheeh Muslim</em> (8/120), the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “Indeed Allaah has revealed to me that you should have humility, and that no one should act proudly and oppressively over anyone else, nor should anyone boast over anyone else.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is no doubt that the call to nationalism is a call to <em>’asabiyyah</em> (partisanship and party spirit) and it is a call to becoming angry for the sake of <em>’asabiyyah</em> and fighting for <em>’asabiyyah</em>. And there is no doubt also, that the call to nationalism is a call to transgression, pride and arrogance, since nationalism is not a divinely revealed way of life which prevents its people from oppression and proud boasting.  Rather it is an ideology from the time of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> which leads its people to boasting about it and having <em>’asabiyyah</em> for it even if they are the oppressors and the others are the oppressed!  So – O noble reader – consider this and the truth will be clear to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the textual evidences connected with this is what at-Tirmidhee relates from Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) that he said: “Let people stop boasting about their forefathers who have died, who are merely fuel for the Hellfire; or they will certainly be more insignificant with Allaah than the beetle which roles dung with its nose. Allaah has removed from you the party spirit of the days of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> and the boasting about one’s forefathers.  Indeed a person is either a pious Believer or a wretched sinner. All of mankind are the children of Aadam, and Aadam was created from clay.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) also said: “Indeed there is no excellence for an Arab over a non-Arab, nor a non-Arab over an Arab, nor a white person over a black one, nor a black person over a white one, except through <em>taqwaa</em> (piety and obedience to Allaah).” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this accords with Allaah the Most High&#8217;s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>O mankind! We have created you from male and female and have made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Indeed the most noblest of you with Allaah is the one who has the most taqwaa.</strong>” [Sooratul-Hujuraat 49:13].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah – the One free from all defects – made clear in this noble <em>aayah</em> (verse) that people have been made into nations and tribes so that they may come to know each other, not that they should boast and have pride over one another.  And Allaah the Most High considered the most noblest of them to be the one with the most piety and <em>taqwaa</em>. Likewise, the previously mentioned narration shows the same meaning, and guides to the fact that it is from the ways of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> to vainly boast and to have false pride for one’s fore fathers and ancestry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what the calls of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> lead to, whereas Islaam is in opposition to this.  Rather Islaam calls to modesty, humility, <em>taqwaa</em> and to having love for the sake of Allaah, and that the true and sincere Muslims are merely one of the categories of the children of Aadam (<em>’alayhis-salaam</em>), and that the Muslims are a single body and a single structure; each part supporting the other and each part feeling the pain that the other parts are suffering as occurs in an authentic <em>hadeeth</em> (narration) from the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>), that he said: “The Believer to the Believer is like a solid building, one part supports the other.”  And he interlaced his fingers to demonstrate this. [7].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) also said: “The example of the Believer in their mutual love and mercy is like the example of a body, if one part of the body feels pain, then all the body suffers in sleeplessness and fever.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O people! I call to you in the name of Allaah. Does your nationalism call you to these noble manners of mercy and kindness to the Muslims the Arabs and the non-Arabs and of having mutual sympathy and concern for them, and feeling pain at their pain? No, by Allaah! Rather it calls you to having allegiance with those who have evil character and it calls you to cultivating enmity and hatred for those who deny this false creed of nationalism.  So beware, O Muslim who desires safety and salvation, and consider the reality of the affair with a fair consideration, without being prejudiced with party spirit and desires. Only then you will see the reality as it truly is.  So may Allaah guide me and you to the means of safety and salvation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is related by Imaam al-Bukhaaree in his <em>Saheeh</em> (8/137), that a young man from the <em>Muhaajirs</em> and a young man from the <em>Ansaar</em> quarreled.  So the <em>Muhaajir</em> said: “O <em>Muhaajirs</em>! (meaning: rally to my help).” And the <em>Ansaaree</em> said: “O <em>Ansaar</em>!” So the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) heard this and said: “Is it with the call of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> that you are calling out, and I am present amongst you!”  Even though the term <em>Muhaajir</em> and <em>Ansaar</em> are two ascriptions which are beloved to Allaah the One free from all defects and He has praised these two groups with a very great praise, in His the Most High’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>And the first to embrace Islaam from the Muhaajirs and the Ansaar, and those who followed them in goodness, beliefs and actions. Allaah is well pleased with them, and they are well pleased with Him. He has prepared for them Gardens of Paradise, beneath which rivers flow, to live therein forever. That is the supreme achievement.</strong>” [Sooratut-Tawbah 9:100].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet in the above incident, this ascription to the <em>Muhaajirs</em> and seeking the help from them, and the <em>Ansaar</em> and seeking the help from them, when the likes of this was considered to be from the calls of <em>jaahiliyyah</em>, then what about those who claim allegiance e to nationalism and seek help through that and become angry for that?  Will this not be more fitting to be considered one of the calls from the days of <em>jaahiliyyah</em>?   This is a matter in which there is no doubt, and it is one of the clearest of all matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is what has been established in the authentic <em>hadeeth</em> (narration), from al-Haarith al-Ash’aree (<em>radiyallaahu ’anhu</em>), that the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “I order you with five things which Allaah ordered me with: The <em>Jamaa’ah</em>, listening, obeying, <em>hijrah</em> (migration) and <em>jihaad</em> in the way of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.  So whosoever separates from the <em>Jamaa’ah</em> by a hand span, he throws the yoke of Islaam from his neck, unless he repents.  And whosoever calls with the call of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> (the days of ignorance), then he is from the hoarded heap of Hell Fire.” It was said: Even if he fasts and prays?  He said: “Even if he fasts and prays. So call with the call of Allaah which Allaah gave: The Muslims, the Believers, Worshippers of Allaah.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>hadeeth</em> is absolutely clear with regards to rendering futile the calls to nationalism.  Its callers deserve that they should be from the heap of Hellfire, even if they fast and they pray and claim that they are Muslims.  So what a severe threat and severe warning is given here; warning every Muslim from the calls of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> and warning them from entering into this even if such calls are adorned with false talks and enchanting speeches.  Rather it is a deception and a blind following which leads it s people to the worst and most despicable of ends. And we ask Allaah for safety and freedom from that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Guidelines for Unifying the Ummah<br />
source: Al-Istiqaamah Issue No.8 &#8211; Shawwal 1418H / February 1998</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THE 3 INFALLIBLES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first and most important of these guidelines is: Clinging to the three infallibles; the Qur&#8217;aan, the Sunnah, and that which the Pious Predecessors of this Ummah had Ijmaa&#8217; (agreement) upon.It is these infallible that determine the correct method of understanding the Religion. It it these infallibles which make up the great usool (fundamentals) that this precious Ummah should be called to gather and unite upon.Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;The religion of the Muslims is based upon following the Book of Allaah, the Sunnah of His Prophet &#8216;alayhis-salaam, and that which the Ummah has agreed upon; these are the three infallible usool.&#8221; He also said, &#8220;The ijmaa&#8217; which is affirmed is that which the Pious Predecessors were [agreed] upon.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>TOLERANCE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another important guideline is to cultivate greater tolerance in the Ummah by knowing the etiquettes of differing; which type of differing is permitted and tolerated in Islaam, and which type is actually prohibited and condemned?The prohibited differing involves opposing any of the great usool. This type of differing is forbidden by the Revelation. So whoever opposes these usool, without a valid excuse, has resembled the heretics and deviants.As regards differing in other issues other than the great usool, or in issues of ijtihaad, then such differences are permitted and should be tolerated. It is forbidden to allow such differences to become a source of inciting hatred between Muslims, or a means to split the ranks of this precious Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>ALLEGIANCE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;It is not for anyone to set-up a person for the Ummah; calling to his way, and having walaa (allegiance) or &#8216;adaa (enmity) based upon that, except for the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam. Nor is any speech set-up for them, upon which they form allegiance or enmity, except for the Speech of Allaah, and that of His Messenger, and that which the Ummah has agreed upon.&#8221;It is essential that walaa and &#8216;adaa be formed only upon the basis of Islaam and the Sunnah. As regards the disease of hizbiyyah (partisanship) &#8211; which is where allegiance or enmity is formed upon the basis of either nationalism, groups or parties, or schools of thought &#8211; then this is clearly forbidden. Indeed this disease has destroyed, and continues to destroy, the very fabric of comprehensive Muslim unity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>PURITY</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another essential guideline to purify the intentions such that actions are done only for Allaah&#8217;s sake, and not for the sake of elevating one&#8217;s ego, gaining leadership, or venting personal grudges, jealousy or enmity.Shaykh &#8216;Abdullaah al-Ghunaymaan said: &#8220;It is obligatory upon all those who speak about any affair of the Religion that they do so purely for Allaah&#8217;s sake and sincerely for the truth. They should overcome their souls and strive hard against following their own whims and desires. They should beware of inclining towards worldly matters; such as love of being praised, seeking fame and status, seeking to gain a following, and other such matters. So the one who seeks to gain any of this will only gain the vanities of this world.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>SCHOLARS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet &#8216;alayhis salaam said in an authentic narration: &#8220;Allaah does not take away knowledge by snatching it away from the people, but He takes it away by the death of the Scholars. So when no scholar remains, the people take ignorant ones as their leaders, who give rulings without knowledge; thereby misguiding themselves and misguiding others.&#8221;Thus, goodness remaining in the Ummah is dependant upon the existence of the Scholars; those who preserve the for this Ummah the correct understanding of the religion..There is no way to unify this Ummah, except by clinging to its Scholars. Indeed, without them, deviation and ignorance will continue to spread, which only further weakens the unity of this already fragile Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>HOPE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said: &#8220;Allaah has promised to those amongst you who have faith and do righteous actions that He will grant you the khilaafah (succession of rule) upon the land, as He granted it to those before you&#8230;&#8221; [Soorah an-Noor 24:55].The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said in an authentic narration: &#8220;Give good-tidings to this Ummah about a high position, being established upon the earth, victory, and a lofty position in this world and the Hereafter.&#8221;So it is essential to spread hope throughout this Ummah and not to despair about Allaah&#8217;s promise of victory; which will only be realised on the condition that the Muslims return to acting in accordance with Allaah&#8217;s commands &#8211; inwardly and outwardly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah, Issue No.7 ,July 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And those who were given the Scripture (the Jews and the Christians) did not split-up except out of <i>baghee</i> (hatred and envy) between each other, after the knowledge had come to them.&#8221; </b>[Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:19].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam as-Sa&#8217;dee (d.1376H)- <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This is why Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; ordered the Muslims with<i> ijtimaa&#8217;</i> (collectiveness) in their Religion, and prohibited them from <i>tafarruq</i> (splitting-up). He informed them that they must not reject what Allaah revealed to them from the Book. Indeed the People of the Book (i.e. the jews and the Christians) did not split-up until after Allaah had revealed to them the Scripture, in which He ordered them with<i> ijtimaa&#8217;</i> (being unified). However, they did the opposite to what He ordered them with, due to mutual jealousy and hatred. So hatred and jealousy culminated in them having grudges and enmity between one another, they then fell into differing and splitting up. So &#8211; O Muslims &#8211; beware of doing the likes of this.&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;Allaah explained that their splitting only occurred after the knowledge had come to them, and which showed them what they were commanded to do and to avoid. For Allaah does not leave people to stray, except after giving them guidance, until He explains to them what they were commanded to do. And He informed that the reason for their <i>tafarruq</i> (splitting) was due to <i>baghee</i> (mutual envy, jealousy, hatred) And <i>baghee</i> occurs due to either falling short of the truth, or transgressing the limits. It is due either to abandoning an obligation, or doing something prohibited. So know that this is what necessitates <i>tafarruq</i> (splitting).&#8221;2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE ROOT OF CORRUPTION</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim (d.751H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It is upon the one who speaks in this matter, or any other matter, that he should only do so based upon knowledge and the truth; and that his objective should be sincerity to Allaah, to His Book, to His Messenger; and the giving of sincere advice to his Muslim brothers. But if he makes the truth accord with his own whims and desires, then this will corrupt and ruin the heart, the actions, and the state of affairs. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And if the truth were to be in accordance with their desires, then indeed the heavens and the earth &#8211; and all that is therein &#8211; would be corrupted and ruined.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Mu&#8217;minoon 23:71]. The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;None of you truly believe until he makes</i> <i>his desires accord with what I have been sent with.&#8221;</i>3 So <i>&#8216;ilm</i> (knowledge) and <i>&#8216;adl</i> (justice) are the root of every good, whereas <i>dhulm</i> (oppression) and <i>jahl</i> (ignorance) are the root of every evil. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; sent His Messenger with the Guidance and the Religion of Truth, and He commanded the doing of justice between people and that none of them should follow their whims and desires. Allaah the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;So call to Islaam and stand firm, and do not follow their whims and desires, but say: I believe in whatever has been revealed by Allaah from the Book, and I have been commanded to do justice between you. Allaah is our Lord and your Lord, for us our deeds and for you your deeds. There is no dispute between us and you. Allaah will assemble us all, and to Him is the final return.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:15].&#8221;4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>A NECESSARY JIHAAD</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;<i>Jihaad</i> against the <i>nafs</i> (soul) and its whims and desires is the foundation of <i>jihaad</i> against the unbelievers and the hypocrites. Indeed a person will not have the ability to wage <i>jihaad</i> against them, until he wages <i>jihaad</i> against his own soul and its whims and desires first.&#8221;5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Ghunaymaan &#8211; <i>hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;It is obligatory upon all those who speak about an affair from the affairs of the Religion that they do so purely for Allaah&#8217;s sake, sincerely for the truth. And that they overcome their soul and strive hard against following their whims and desires, not inclining towards worldly matters; such as love of being praised, seeking fame and reputation, gaining a large following, and other such matters. So the one who seeks to gain any of this, will gain only the vanities of this world.&#8221;6</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah Issue No.8 &#8211; Shawwal 1418H / February 1998</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SETTING THE STANDARD</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ibn Ibraaheem- rahimahullaah- (d. 1389H) said: &#8220;Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah [the Saved Sect] have an usool (set of fundamentals) which is firmly based upon proofs; and upon this are built the furoo&#8217; (subsidiary issues).&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>GUIDELINES REGARDING DIFFERENCES</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam as-Sa&#8217;dee (d. 1376H)- rahimahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;Differences of opinions that occur between the [Scholars] of the Ummah are from two angles:- Firstly: Differences in the furoo&#8217; (subsidiary issues), and in issues of ijtihaad (qualified striving to reach the truth); such that when a person &#8211; whether it is a judge, muftee, writer, or teacher &#8211; strives to arrive at a ruling and is correct, he is rewarded two-fold. But if he strives and is mistaken, then he is rewarded once. Second: Differences in matters of usool (fundamentals); such as the issues related to Allaah&#8217;s Attributes, al-Qadr (Predestination and Pre-Decree), Eemaan (faith), and their like. These cause those who oppose [such usool] to be regarded as deviants, because of them opposing the proofs from the Book and the Sunnah, and that which the Salafus-Saalih (Pious Predecessors) &#8211; the Companions and those who followed them in goodness &#8211; were agreed upon.&#8221;2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE PERMISSIBLE TYPE OF DIFFERING</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ibn al-&#8216;Uthaymeen &#8211; hafidhahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;This sect [i.e. the Saved-Sect] unites upon the truth, even if its people do have differences of opinion between themselves. However, these differences do not harm their [unity], nor cause them to declare each other as deviants. Rather, their hearts are still united, even when these difference of opinion occur in matters linked to the &#8216;aqeedoh (beliefs); such as did the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam see his Lord with his eyes, or did he not see him [with his eyes]? Or is the punishment in the grave to the body and the soul, or just to the soul only? Or other such issues. This is because these issues are subsidiary issues connected with the usool, they are not in the actual usool itself. So they do not declare each other as being deviants when they differ in such matters &#8211; contrary to what the innovators do.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE PROHIBITED TYPE OF DIFFERING</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;The Scholars &#8211; from the Companions, the Taabi&#8217;een, and those who came after them &#8211; when they differed in any matter, then they followed the command of Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; in His saying: <b>&#8220;If you differ in anything amongst yourselves then refer it back to Allaah and His Messenger, if you do truly believe in Allaah and the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:59]. So they would discuss concerning the issue; discuss, consult and sincerely advise. Sometimes they would differ in matters linked to the &#8216;aqeedah, as well as issues linked to actions, yet along with such differences, they still preserved the unity and brotherhood. Yes, whosoever opposes the clear Book and the beneficial Sunnah, or that which the Pious Predecessors of this Ummah had Ijmaa&#8217; (consensus) upon, opposing it without a justifiable excuse, then such a person has acted with the action of the Innovators &#8230; As regards differing in matters of rulings and actions, then the examples are too many to be recorded. So if every Muslim who differed in something were to be boycotted and abandoned, then no unity or brotherhood would ever remain. And Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar radiallaahu &#8216;anhumaa &#8211; who were the best of the Muslims &#8211; used to differ in matters, but they did not intend except good. And the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said to his Companions on the day of [the expedition to] Banu Quraydhah: &#8220;Let none of you pray &#8216;Asr except when you reach Bonu Quraydhah.&#8221; So the time for the &#8216;Asr Prayer came during the journey, so one group amongst them said: We will not pray until we reach Banu Quraydhah; so they missed the actual time for &#8216;Asr. The other group said: We will not miss it by delaying the Prayer; so they prayed along the way. And the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam did not criticise any of the two groups. This is related by al-Bukhaaree and Muslim, from Ibn &#8216;Umar.4 So this differing was in a matter related to rulings and actions, not in the important usool (fundamantels) itself.&#8221; 5</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah , Issue No.5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>A FACT ABOUT PEOPLE AND GROUPS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Jamaalud-Deen al-Qaasimee (d.1288H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From that which is well-known about what occurs when people gather together upon some matter, is that any group which becomes strong and has many followers, then you will definitely find in them the pure and the impure, the justly-balanced and the imbalanced, the extreme and the moderate. And a well established fact is that the extremists are more vocal and have greater acceptance, since the ones who are justly-balanced follow a middle course. And those who seek this balanced approach are few in number, in every age and plate. As for extremism, then this is what most people thrive upon, and what the over-whelming majority incline towards &#8211; and this has been the path of the various sects and religions as well. So the extremists try to monopolise their being mention amongst people and to be single in their <i>da&#8217;wah</i>. And they did not find any way to gain a monopoly over people except by extremism, which they achieve by degrading people and belittling them at every possible opportunity; either by their tongues, or other than that. And the first to open this door &#8211; the door of unleashing their tongues against there who oppose them &#8211; were the Khawaarij. And this is the route by which they came to the masses, through the door of <i>takfeer</i> (declaring a Muslim to be an unbeliever), in order that the masses would flee from other than them, so that they could then secure a relationship with the masses for themselves. Then this disease was transmitted to others, such that the extreme elements of each group started unjustly declaring Muslims to be either unbelievers, sinners, innovators or deviants &#8230;&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>DEALING WITH THOSE WHO ERR OR DEVIATE</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Imaams of the Sunnah and the <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i>, and the people of knowledge and <i>eemaan</i> (faith) have in them <i>&#8216;adl</i> (justice), <i>&#8216;ilm</i> (knowledge) and <i>rahmah</i> (mercy), and they know the truth which <i>conforms</i> to the Sunnah and which is free from innovations. They do justice to those who depart from the Sunnah and the <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i>, even if they have been wronged, just as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;O you who believe!! Stand out firmly for Allaah and be witnesses, and do not let the hatred of others swerve you away from doing justice. But be just! That is closer to taqwaa (piety).&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:8]. Likewise, they are merciful to the creation; desiring for them goodness guidance and knowledge. They never intend for them any harm or evil. Rather, when they criticise them and explain to them their error, ignorance or wrong-doing, then their purpose in doing so is only to clarify the truth, and to be merciful to the creation, to enjoin the good and forbid the evil, and to make the word of Allaah uppermost so that the way of life becomes purely for Allaah.&#8221;2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE BALANCED APPROACH</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When dealing with the people of sin, one must not exceed the limits prescribed by the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> &#8211; neither in hating, censuring, preventing, abandoning or chastising them. Rather, the one who does so should be told: Worry about your own self. No harm will come to you from those who are misled, if you are truly guided, as Allaah &#8211; the Mort High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And do not let your hatred of others swerve you away from doing justice. But be just! That is closer to taqwaa (piety).&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:8]. And Allaah said: <b>&#8220;And fight in the way of Allaah those who fight you, but do not transgress the limits.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:190]. Indeed, many of those who command and forbid overstep the limits set by Allaah, either through <i>jahl</i> (ignorance) or <i>dhulm</i> (injustice). Thus, this issue (of justice) must be firmly maintained, whether it is in regards to censuring the unbelievers, the hypocrites, the sinners or the disobedient ones.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He further said: &#8220;The one commanding the good or forbidding the evil should do so in the way prescribed by the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i>; with knowledge, gentleness and patience, and with good intentions, and by following a balanced approach. All of this enters into Allaah&#8217;s saying: <b>&#8220;O you who believe! Beware of your own selves. No harm will come to you from those who are misled, if you are truly guided.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:105) &#8230; There is in this <i>Aayah</i> (Verse) another meaning as well, which is that a person must turn towards that which will be of benefit to him, both in knowledge and action, and he must avoid what does not concern him &#8211; as the conveyer of the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (i.e. the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said:<i> &#8220;From the perfection of a person&#8217;s Islaam is to leave alone that which doer not concern him.&#8221;</i>4 This especially applies to a person delving into that which doer not concern him regarding someone&#8217;s religious or worldly affairs. Thus, such a person may speak out of envy or desire for position; or act either with deliberate oppression, or foolish scorn and sarcasm. How often does Shaytaan make such an act appear to be an art of commanding the good or prohibiting the evil, or jihaad in the path of Allaah, whereas it is actually an act of injustice and transgression!&#8221;5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>A COMPREHENSIVE DESCRIPTION</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; also said: &#8220;And Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah follow the Book and the Sunnah, obey Allaah and His Messenger, they follow the truth and are merciful to the creation.&#8221;6</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">By Shaykh ‘Abdul ‘Azeez Ibn Baaz (d.1420H) (rahimahullaah) [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This small article was a response to a particular question concerning the position and status of Muslim women, and has been taken from his <strong><i>Majmoo&#8217; Fataawaa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi&#8217;ah</i></strong> (3/348-350).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Al-Istiqaamah , Issue No.1 &#8211; Dhul-Hijjah 1416H / May 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The status of the Muslim woman in Islaam is a very noble and lofty one, and her effect is very great in the life of every Muslim. Indeed, the Muslim woman is the initial teacher in the building of a righteous society, providing she follows the guidance from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. Since adherence to the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah distances every Muslim male or female from being misguided in any matter. The misguidance that the various nations suffer from, the path of Allaah the Most Perfect, the Most High, and from what His Prophets and Messengers, may Allaah&#8217;s peace and prayers be upon them all, came with. The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <em>&#8220;I am leaving behind two matters, you will not go astray as long as you cling to them both, the Book of Allaah and my Sunnah.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great importance of the Muslim woman&#8217;s role &#8211; whether as wife, sister or daughter, and the rights that are due to her and the obligations due from her have been explained in the noble Qur&#8217;aan, and further details of this have been explained in the purified Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The secret of her importance lies in the tremendous burden and responsibility that is placed upon her, and the difficulties that she has to shoulder. In terms of responsibilities, some of which not even a man can bear. This is why from the most important obligations upon a person is to show gratitude to the mother, and kindness and good companionship with her. And in this matter, she is to be given precedence over and above the father. Allaah the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And We have enjoined upon man to be dutiful and good to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness upon weakness and hardship upon hardship, and his weaning is in two years. Show gratitude and thanks to Me and to your parents. Unto Me is the final destination.&#8221; </strong>[Al-Qur&#8217;aan 31:14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Most High, said:<strong> &#8220;And We have enjoined upon man to be dutiful and kind to his parents. His mother bears him with hardship, and she brings him forth with hardship. And the bearing and the weaning of him is thirty months.&#8221;</strong> [Al-Qur&#8217;aan 46:15].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <em>O Messenger of Allaah! Who from amongst mankind warrants the best companionship from me. He replied: &#8220;Your mother.&#8221; The man asked: Then who? So he replied: &#8220;Your mother.&#8221; The man asked: Then who? So the Prophet replied again: &#8220;Your mother.&#8221; The man then asked: Then who? So he replied: &#8220;Then your father.&#8221;</em> So this necessitates that the mother is given three times the likes of kindness and good treatment than the father.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards the wife, then her effect in making the soul tranquil and serene, has been clearly shown in the noble aayah (verse), in His &#8211; the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And from amongst His Signs is this: That He created for you wives from amongst yourselves, so that you may find serenity and tranquility in them, And He has put between you love and compassion. Indeed, in this are signs for those who reflect.&#8221;</strong> [Al-Qur&#8217;aan 30:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Katheer (d.774H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said, whilst explaining the terms <i>mawaddah</i> and <i>rahmah</i> which occur in the above verse. &#8220;<i>Al-mawaddah</i> means love and affection, and <i>ar-rahmah</i> means compassion and pity, since a man takes the hand of a woman either due to his love for her, or because of compassion and pity for her; by giving to her a child from himself&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the unique stance that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> wife Khadeejah &#8211; <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhaa</i> &#8211; took, had a huge effect in calming and reassuring Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, when the angel Jibreel &#8211; <i>&#8216;alayhis-salaam</i> &#8211; first came to him in the cave of Hiraa. The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayi wa sallam</i> returned to Khadeejah with the first Revelation and with his heart trembling and beating severely, saying to her, <em>&#8220;Cover me! Cover me!&#8221;</em> So she covered him until his fear was over, after which he told Khadeejah &#8211; <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhaa</i> &#8211; everything that had happened, and said:<em> &#8220;I fear that something may happen to me.&#8221; </em>She said to him: &#8220;<b>Never! By Allaah! Allaah will never  disgrace you. You keep good ties with relations, you help the poor and  the destitute, you serve your guests generouly and assist those who have been affected with calamities.</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And do not forget about &#8216;Aaishah &#8211; <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhaa</i> &#8211; and her immense contribution. Even the eminent <i>Sahaabah</i> (Companions) used to take knowledge of <i>Hadeeth</i> from her, and many of the <i>Sahaabiyaat</i> (female Companions) learnt the various rulings pertaining to women&#8217;s issues from her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I have no doubt that my mother (may Allaah shower His mercy upon her) had a tremendous effect upon me, and has a great excellence over me, in encouraging me to study, and she assisted me in it. May Allaah greatly increase her reward and reward her with the best of rewards for what she did for me. And there is no doubt also, that the house in which there is kindness, gentleness, love and care, with the correct Islaamic tarbiyah (education and cultivation) will greatly affect the man. So he will become, if Allaah wills, successful in his affairs and in any matter whether it be seeking knowledge, trading, earning a living, etc. So it is Allaah alone that I ask to grant us all success and to guide us all to that which He loves and is pleased with. And may the prayers and peace of Allaah be upon our Prophet Muhammad, and upon his Family, his Companions and his followers.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">1. He is the exemplary Scholar: Abu &#8216;Abdullaah, &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin &#8216;Abdullaah bin Baaz. He was born in the city of Riyaadh (Sa&#8217;udi Arabiah) on the 12th Dhul-Hijjah in the year 1330H. He began seeking knowledge by first memorising the Qur&#8217;aan before reaching the age of maturity. He then went on to study the various Islaamic sciences, such as <i>&#8216;Aqeedah</i> (Beliefs), <i>Fiqh</i> (Jurisprudence), <i>Usoolul-Fiqh</i> (Fundamentals of Jurisprudence), <i>Hadeeth</i> (Prophetic Narrations), <i>Faraa&#8217;id</i> (Laws of Inheritance), <i>Nahw</i> (Grammar) and <i>Sarf</i> (Morphology) &#8211; even though the Shaykh became permanently blind at the age of seventeen. He studied these sciences under some of the most prominent Scholars of Riyaadh and Makkah of his time, including Shaykh Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdul-Lateef ibn Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Hasan and also the former grand-muftee and noble scholar, Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem &#8211; whom he studied under for ten years. He is eighty-six years old, mild, generous and forbearing in nature, whilst firm, yet wise, when speaking the truth. He is a <i>zaahid</i> (one who abstains) with respect to this world and is one of the foremost Scholars of <i>Ahlul-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;at</i> in this present age. The noble Shaykh has &#8211; by Allaah&#8217;s grace &#8211; devoted his whole life to the cause of Islaam and its people, authoring many books and booklets, teaching and serving the masses, along with being very active in the field of <i>da&#8217;wah</i>. May Allaah protect our noble father and Shaykh, and may He continue to benefit the Ummah with him.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Istiqaamah Magazine]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Q.3]:</strong> Even though my husband &#8211; may Allaah forgive him &#8211; is a person of good character and fears Allaah, yet he does not treat me with kindness. He is always moody, frowning and troubled at heart &#8211; and he often says that I am the cause of this. However, Allaah knows &#8211; and all praise is for Allaah &#8211; that I do fulfill his rights and try to bring to him tranquility and peace of mind and I try to stay clear of all that which displeases him, whilst patiently bearing his excesses against me. Every time I ask him about something, or speak about a particular matter, he becomes angry and says that my speech is stupidity &#8211; even though I know that he is perfectly happy in the company of his friends and associates. However, when it concerns me, then he does not treat me in the same manner, nor with the same feeling. This causes me great hurt and anger and I have often considered leaving the house. I have &#8211; and all praise is for Allaah &#8211; been educated to a good level and fulfill that which Allaah has obligated me with. O noble Shaykh! If I leave the house with my children, try to educate them and live my own life, will I be sinful in doing so? Or should I continue to live in my present circumstance, abstain from speaking and continue patiently bearing these difficulties? Please advise me as to what I should do &#8211; and may Allaah reward you with goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [A.3]:</strong> There is no doubt that it is obligatory for the husband and wife to live together in a kind and sociable manner. There should be good manners and treatment between them, along with affection and pleasant behaviour &#8211; as Allaah the Mighty and Majestic – says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<strong>And live with them in honour and in kindness.</strong>’’ [Sooratun-Nisaa‘ 4:19 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His &#8211; the Most Perfect – saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<strong>And the wives have rights over the husbands &#8211; similar to those of the husbands over them &#8211; in that which is reasonable. But men have a degree over them.</strong>’’ [Sooratul-Baqarah 2:228]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) said, ‘‘Righteousness is good character.’’ [1] And he (<em>’alayhis-salaatu was-salaam</em>) then said, ‘‘Do not consider any good action as insignificant- even if it is meeting your brother with a cheerful face.’’ [2] And he (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) also said, ‘‘The most perfect of Believers in <em>eemaan </em>(faith) is the one with the best character. And the best of you are those that are best to their women-folk, and I am the best amongst you to my family.’’ [3] There are besides these many other <em>ahaadeeth</em> which are a general proof for the encouragement of good character, cheerful meeting and good companionship between Muslims. If this is the general case between Muslims, then good treatment between husband and wife and relatives is even more important. You have done well in patiently persevering and bearing the ill treatment and bad character from your husband. However, I advise you to have even greater patience and not to leave the house, and if Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; wills, there will be a great deal of good in this and a praiseworthy end for you. Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<strong>Patiently persevere! Indeed Allaah is with those who patiently persevere.</strong>’’ [Sooratul-Anfaal 6:46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic – saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<strong>Indeed whosoever fears Allaah, obeys Him, turns away from disobedience and patiently perseveres, then Allaah does not cause the rewards of the doers of good to be lost.</strong>’’ [Soorah Yoosuf 12:90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic – saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<strong>Only those who patiently persevere shall receive their reward in full without reckoning.</strong>’’ [Sooratuz-Zumar 39:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<strong>So patiently persevere! Indeed, the end will be good for those who are pious.</strong>’’[Soorah Hood 11:49]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, this does not prevent you from speaking to your husband with such words, and behaving with him in such a manner, that will soften his heart- and lead to him being pleased with you and fulfilling your rights of companionship. And as long as he is fulfilling the main and important obligations towards you, then try not to ask him for any worldly need, until his heart is opened and his chest is expanded in accepting your request and fulfilling your needs; in this way &#8211; if Allaah wills your ending will be a praiseworthy one. May Allaah grant you increase in all that is good, and that the condition of your husband improves, and that he is guided to good character, kindness in companionship and to fulfilling the rights that are due upon him. Indeed Allaah is the best of those who are asked, and only He guides to the path that is straight. [4]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">By Shaykh ’Abdul-’Azeez Ibn ’Abdullaah Ibn Baaz<br />
[al-Istiqaamah] [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>COMPATIBILITY IS ONLY BASED UPON RELIGION AND PIETY: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the evil and reprehensible matters is that some who claim to be from the tribe of Haashim (i.e. claim to be a <em>Sayyid</em>; someone related to the Prophet’s (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) family) say that there is no <em>kafaa‘ah</em> (marriage compatibility) between them and someone from outside of their own clan. So they do not get married outside of their clan, nor allow anyone from outside of their clan to marry them. This is a great error, a monstrous ignorance, oppression against the woman, and it is a legislation which neither Allaah nor His Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) legislated or prescribed. Rather, Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>O mankind! We have created you from a male and female, and have made you into nations and tribes; that you may know one another, Indeed the most noblest of you with Allaah is the one who has the most taqwaa </strong>(piety, fear, and obedience of Allaah)<strong>.</strong>” [Sooratul-Hujuraat 49:13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>Indeed the Believers are but brothers.</strong>” [Sooratul-Hujuraat 49:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>The Believers &#8211; men and women &#8211; are allies and protectors, one to another.</strong>” [Sooratut-Tawbah 9:71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>So their Lord accepted from them their supplication, and responded: Never will I allow to be lost the actions of any of you, be they male or female. You are one to another.</strong>” [Soorah Aali-’Imraan 3:195]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “Indeed there is no excellence for an arab over a non-arab, nor for a non-arab over on arab, nor for a white person over a black one, nor for a black person over a white one, except through <em>taqwaa</em> (piety and obedience to Allaah). The people are from Aadam, and Aadam was from earth.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) also said: “Indeed my <em>awliyaa‘</em> (friends and allies) are not the tribe of so and so. Rather my friends and allies are the <em>muttaqoon</em> (those who possess <em>taqwaa</em>) &#8211; wherever they may be.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “If there comes to you a person whose Religion and character are pleasing to you, then marry him (i.e. give the girl in marriage to him). If you do not do this, there will be <em>fitnah</em> (trial and discord) and great <em>fasaad </em>(corruption) upon the earth.” This was related by at-Tirmidhee and others, with a <em>hasan isnaad </em>(good chain of narration). [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) married Zaynab bint Jahsh of the Quraysh (i.e. the Prophet’s clan) to Zayd Ibn Haarithah, his freed slave. He married Faatimah bint Qays from the Quraysh clan, to Usaamah, the son of Zayd. Bilaal ibn Rabaah, the Ethiopian married the sister of ’Abdur-Rahmaan Ibn ’Awf of the Quraysh. So the purpose here is to explain the falsehood of those who claim that it is forbidden, or detested, for someone from the Prophet&#8217;s (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) clan to marry outside of that clan or tribe. Rather, what it is obligatory in this matter is to consider only Religion as the compatibility factor. So the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) distanced Aboo Taalib and Aboo Lahab (his uncles) &#8211; because they were not Muslims and drew near Salmaan the Persian, Suhayb the Roman, and Bilaal the Ethiopian. This is because they possessed <em>eemaan</em> (faith) and piety, and they followed the Prescribed Laws and traversed the Straight Path. Thus, whosoever adopts this false and ignorant practice of barring Haashimee women from marrying from outside of their clan or tribe, will only achieve blameworthy results; such as corruption of the people, or adversely affecting the birth-rates, even though Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>And marry those amongst you who are single, and the righteous from your slaves. If they be poor, Allaah will enrich them out of His Bounty. And Allaah is all-Sufficient for His creation, the all-Knowing about their state.</strong>” [Sooratun-Noor 24:32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He commanded to marry those that are single, and to marry all other categories of Muslims &#8211; irrespective of whether they be rich or poor. Thus, since the Islaamic <em>Sharee’ah</em> urges and encourages the institution of marriage. So the Muslims should hasten to fulfill this command of Allaah and of His Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) when he said: “O youths! Whosoever amongst you has the ability to marry, then let him do so; for it lowers the gaze and restrains the private parts. But whosoever does not have the ability then let him take to fasting; for indeed it is a shield for him.” Its authenticity has been agreed upon. [5] Thus, it is incumbent upon the guardians to fear Allaah concerning their guardianship, since it is an <em>amaanah</em> (trust and responsibility) around their necks, and Allaah will question them concerning this trust. So it is upon them to hasten in getting their daughters, sons, and sisters married, to the extent that this task has taken full effect in life, and the corruption and harms of not doing so have been minimized. And it is known that when women are prevented from getting married, or if their marriage is delayed and deferred, then this is a cause for calamities to occur, a cause for shameful moral crimes to take place, and a cause for a decline in standards of behaviour. So &#8211; O worshippers of Allaah &#8211; it is upon you to fear Allaah regarding your own selves, and with regards to the daughters, sisters, and other women whom Allaah has been placed under your charge and authority, and that the Muslims should come in order to realise the good and the happiness for the society, and to follow the path that will increase the good and lessen the crimes. And you should know that you will all be questioned and held to account about your actions, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>By your Lord! We shall call them all to account for all that they used to do.</strong>” [Sooratul-Hijr 15:92]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>And to Allaah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth, that He may punish those who do evil with that which they have done; and reward those who do good with Paradise which is best.</strong> ” [Sooratun-Najm 53:31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So hasten in getting your sons and daughters married, following in the footsteps of your Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>), and the footsteps of the noble <em>Sahaabah</em> (Companions) (<em>radiyallaahu ’anhum</em>), and all those who follow their path and guidance. I also advise you all not to seek excessive sums for the <em>mahr</em> (dowry), but rather be moderate in this, and that you strive to select pious and righteous people for marriage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah to grant us the understanding of the Religion; grant us firmness upon it; and that He protects us and all the Muslims from the evil promptings of our own souls, and our evil resultant actions; and that He keeps away from us the deviating trials and discords, whether open or hidden. And we ask Allaah also to correct all those who have a position of authority over the affairs of the Muslims, and that He rectifies them. Indeed he is the One having the power to do so. And may Allaah extol and send blessings of peace upon Muhammad, and upon his Family, Companions and all those who follow them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">By Imam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee<br />
Source: Silsilatul-Ahaadeeth As-Saheehah (1/442-445)<br />
Translated by Al-Istiqaamah Newsletter [1]<br />
al-manhaj.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah (radhi Allaahu anhu) related that the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wa sallam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Fast when they fast, end the fast when they end theirs, and sacrifice the day that they sacrifice.&#8221;</b> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bayhaqee relates by way of Abu Haneefah, who said: &#8216;Alee ibn al-Aqmar related to me, from Masrooq, who said: I entered upon &#8216;Aaishah on the day of &#8216;Arafah, so she said: &#8220;Serve Masrooq with some gruel, and make it more sweet.&#8221; Masrooq said: Nothing prevented me from fasting this day except that I feared that it may be the day of Sacrifice. So &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah said to me: &#8220;The day of Sacrifice is when the people sacrifice, and the day of ending the fast is when the people end their fast.&#8221; This chain of narration is jayyid (good) due to what has preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Understanding This Hadeeth:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam at-Tirmidhee says after quoting the hadeeth: &#8220;One of the people of knowledge has explained this hadeeth by saying: Its meaning is to fast and end the fast along with the Jamaa&#8217;ah and the majority of people.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-San&#8217;aanee said in Sublus-Salaam (2/72): &#8220;In this (hadeeth) is a proof that being in agreement with the people is accepted in establishing &#8216;Eed, and that the individual person who believes that it is the day of &#8216;Eed &#8211; because of the sighting of the moon &#8211; then it is obligatory upon him to be in agreement with the people, and that the ruling of the people &#8211; concerning the Prayer, breaking the fast, and sacrificing &#8211; is binding upon the individual.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim (rahimahullaah) mentioned this meaning in Tahdheebus-Sunan (3/214), and said: &#8220;It is said: In it a refutation of those who say that whosoever knows the positions of the moon due to astronomical calculations, then it is permissible for him to fast and end the fast, even if others do not know. It is also said: That the individual witness who sees the moon, but the qaadee (judge) has not accepted his testimony, then there is no fasting for him, just as there is no fasting for the people.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul-Hasan as-Sindee said in Haashiyah &#8216;alaa Ibn Maajah, after mentioning the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah which was related by at-Tirmidhee: &#8220;And its apparent meaning is: That there is no room for individual (opinions) to enter into these affairs, nor to act individually in this. Rather, this affair goes back to the Imaam (the Leader of the Muslims) and the Jamaa&#8217;ah (united body of Muslims under the Imaam). It is obligatory upon the individuals to follow the Imaam and the Jamaa&#8217;ah. From this is that is an individual sights the moon, but the qaadee rejects his witness, then the individual has no right in these matters, but rather he must follow the Jamaa&#8217;ah in this.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is the meaning which is evident from the hadeeth, and which is emphasized by the fact that &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (radhi Allahu anha) used it with Masrooq when he prevented himself from fasting on the day of &#8216;Arafah, fearing that it could be the day of Sacrifice. So she explained to him that there is no weight given to his individual opinion in this, and that he should follow the Jamaa&#8217;ah. So she said to him: &#8220;The day of Sacrifice is when the people sacrifice, and the day of ending the fast is when the people end their fast.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Unity is One of the Goals of the Sharee&#8217;ah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is what is befitting for the easy-natured and tolerant Sharee&#8217;ah (Prescribed Islaamic Law), one of the goals of which is uniting the people together, unifying their ranks and keeping away from them all that would split their comprehensive unity &#8211; from the individual opinions. So the Sharee&#8217;ah does not give any weight to the individual opinion in matters concerning &#8216;ibaadah jamaa&#8217;iyyah (collective acts of worship), such as Fasting, &#8216;Eed and Prayer in congregation &#8211; even if the opinion is correct, from one angle. Do you not see that the Sahaabah (the Companions) &#8211; radiallaahu &#8216;anhum &#8211; used to pray behind each other. So from them were those who held the view that touching a woman, or the flowing of blood from the body invalidates the wudhoo&#8217; (ablution), along with those who did not hold this view. From them were those who would complete the Prayer whilst traveling, whilst others shortened. Yet these, and other such differences, did not prevent them from collectively praying behind a single Imaam and deeming it to be acceptable. And this is because they knew that tafarruq (splitting-up) in the Religion is more evil than having ikhtilaaf (differences) in some opinions. Indeed, the matter with one of them reached the extent that he would not even deem acceptable any opinion which differed with the great Imaam in the major gatherings; such as the gathering at Minaa (during Hajj), to the extent that he would totally abandon acting upon his opinion in that gathering &#8211; fleeing from that which could result from this evil, because of acting according to his own opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, Abu Daawood relates (1/307) that &#8216;Uthmaan (raa) prayed four rak&#8217;ahs at Minaa, so &#8216;Abdullaah ibn Mas&#8217;ood criticized him saying: &#8220;I prayed two rak&#8217;ahs with the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) and two rak&#8217;ahs with Abu Bakr, and two rak&#8217;ahs with &#8216;Umar, and two rak&#8217;ahs with &#8216;Uthmaan in the beginning of his rule, then he completed it (i.e. by praying four rak&#8217;ahs). After that the ways became divided with you all. So I hope from these four rak&#8217;ahs, that two of them would be accepted.&#8221; Then Ibn Mas&#8217;ood prayed four rak&#8217;ahs. So it was said to him: You criticized &#8216;Uthmaan, yet you prayed four? So he said: &#8220;Differing is evil.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Its chain of narration is Saheeh (authentic), and something similar to this is related in the Musnad (5/155) of Imaam Ahmad, from Abu Dharr (radhi Allaahu anhu).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So those who continue splitting-up with regards to the Prayer, and who refuse to follow the local Imaams in some mosques &#8211; especially in the witr Prayer during Ramadaan &#8211; using as proof that this is against their madhhab (school of thought), then they should reflect upon the above mentioned hadeeth and athar (narration). Likewise, those who claim knowledge of astronomy and who, due to their opinion, fast and end their fast alone &#8211; preceding or lagging behind the majority of Muslims, not seeing any problem in doing so &#8211; should also reflect upon the previously quoted proofs. So all of them should consider, and reflect upon the knowledge that has been mentioned. Perhaps they will find for themselves a cure for their ignorance and self-delusion, so that they may then become a unified rank along with their Muslim brothers &#8211; for indeed the Hand of Allaah Subhanahu wa Taa&#8217;ala is over the Jamaa&#8217;ah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah Issue No.5 &#8211; Ramadân 1417H / January 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>DETERMINING THE BEGINNING OF RAMADHAN</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>[Q]</b>: Is it permissible to rely upon astronomical calculations in determining the start of Ramadhan?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: &#8220;The Prophet <i>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> ordered the Muslims saying: <i>&#8220;Do not fast until you see the new moon, and do not stop fasting until you see it, and if it is concealed by clouds then count out (the thirty days of Sha&#8217;ban) for it.&#8221;</i>1 And he &#8216;alayhis-salatu was-salam said: <i>&#8220;We are an illiterate nation that neither writes nor calculates (i.e. using astronomical calculations). The month is either like this, or this (Meaning: Sometimes it is of twenty-nine days, and sometimes it is of thirty.) &#8220;</i>2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is established in the Sahih (no.1903) of al-Bukhari from Abu Hurayrah <i>radiallahu &#8216;anhu</i> that the Prophet <i>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Fast when it (the moon) is seen, and cease fasting when it is seen, so if it is concealed by clouds then complete thirty days of Sha&#8217;ban.&#8221;</i> And he <i>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> also said: <i>&#8220;Do not fast until you have seen the moon, and if it is concealed by clouds then complete thirty days.&#8221;</i>3 There are plenty of <i>ahadith</i> in this connection, and all of them point towards the obligation of actually sighting the moon, or if unable, then to complete the number of days in the absence of observing it. These narrations also point towards the impermissibility of using astronomical calculations in this regard. And Shaykhul-Islam Ibn TaymiWah has actually stated an ijma&#8217; (consensus) from the People of Knowledge about the impermissibility of relying upon astronomical calculations in this regard &#8211; and this is the truth about which there is no doubt.&#8221; And with Allah alone is the ability.&#8221;5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>BRUSHING ONE&#8217;S TEETH WHILST FASTING</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>[Q]</b>: Is it permissible to use a <i>miswak</i> to brush one&#8217;s teeth, whilst fasting. And it it permissible to use toothpaste as well? What if some blood appear whilst I brush my teeth, doe this invalidate my fast?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: &#8220;There is no problem in cleaning one&#8217;s teeth either using water, <i>miswak</i> or toothbrush, whilst fasting. Some have held it to be <i>makruh</i> (detested) to use a <i>miswak</i> whilst fasting, since it changes the smell of a person&#8217;s breath. However, what is correct is that it is recommended to use a <i>miswak</i> in the beginning and the end of the day, since doing so does not change the odour, rather it just cleanses the mouth from impurities and small pieces of food that become lodged in one&#8217;s teeth. As regards to the use of toothpaste, then it is <i>makruh</i> (detested), since it contains a distinctive taste and flavour which may then get mixed with one&#8217;s saliva and then be swallowed. Thus, whosoever needs to use it should do so after <i>suhur</i> (the pre-dawn meal), before the time of Fajr and fasting begins. However, if one can safeguard allowing the toothpaste and salvia to be mixed then swallowed, then there is no harm in using such toothpaste. If &#8211; whilst cleaning&#8217;s one teeth with water, <i>miswak</i> or a toothbrush &#8211; a small amount of blood flows out, then this does not break the fast, and Allah knows best.&#8221;6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>CONCERNING THE <em>TARAWIH</em> PRAYER</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>[Q]</b>: Some people insist that there is an<i> ijma&#8217; </i>(consensus) from the four well known Imams &#8211; Abu Hanifah, Malik, ash-Shafi&#8217;i and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, <i>rahimahumallah</i> &#8211; on praying <b>only</b> twenty <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> for <i>tarawih</i>. Is this correct?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: &#8220;This is an erroneous claim. This is what has been stated in the <i>Hanafi</i> books of fiqh (jurisprudence), for we do not find any book that can be authentically ascribed to Abu Hanifah (d.150H) <i>rahimahullah</i>. Rather, what is apparent from looking into <i>al-Muwatta</i> of Imam Muhammad (one of the main students of Abu Hanifah) is that Abu Hanifah&#8217;s <i>madhhab</i> (school of thought) was to pray eleven <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Muhammad includes a chapter in <i>al-Muwatta</i> (p.110), stating: &#8220;Chapter: Establishing the Night Prayer in the month of Ramadhan, and the virtues contained in it.&#8221; Under this chapter he relates four ahadith. The first, third and fourth narrations do not make mention of any specified number of <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> for the <em>tarawih</em> prayer, rather they just mention the excellence of establishing Prayer in congregation and the excellence of the night prayer in Ramadhan. However, in the second narration eleven <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> is mentioned. Then Imam Muhammad said (p.111): &#8220;And we take all of this.&#8221; &#8230; Thus, he has shown that his <i>madhhab</i> is eleven <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i>, and this can only be the <i>madhhab</i> of Imam Abu Hanifah &#8211; <i>rahmatullah &#8216;alayhi</i> &#8211; as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shafi&#8217;i (d.204H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullah</i> &#8211; said: &#8220;There is no limit to its maximum, since it is an optional prayer. Thus, if the standing is lengthened, whilst the number of prostrations is shortened (i.e. the number of <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> is fewer), then that is good and that is what is most beloved to me. However, if the number of prostrations and bowings are increased (i.e. the number of <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> are increased), then this is also good.&#8221;7 So it is affirmed that Imam ash-Shafi&#8217;i &#8211; <i>rahimahullah</i> &#8211; does not advocate restricting the number of <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> to twenty. Rather, he gives preference for there to be fewer <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> and an increase in the length of standing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (d.241H) has approved of eleven <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> as well as twenty &#8211; as Shaykhul-Islam ibn Taymiyyah says in <i>al-Ikhtiyaratul-&#8216;Ilmiyyah</i> (p.38) and Shah Waliullah says in <i>al-Misriyyah</i> (1/174) and <i>al-Musaffa</i> (1/177).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Malik (d.179H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullah</i> &#8211; also supports eleven <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i>, as Shaykhul-Islam ibn Taymiyyah mentioned in <i>al-Ikhtiyarat</i> (p.38) and as Jalalud-Din as-Suyuti mentions in <i>al-Hawi lil-Fatawa</i> (p.350), where he said: al-Juri, one of our companions said, from Malik who said: &#8220;That which &#8216;Umar ibn al-Khattab gathered the people upon is more beloved to us. and that was eleven rak&#8217;ahs, and that was the prayer of Allah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>.&#8221; It was said to him: Eleven <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> with the Witr? So he said: Yes, and thirteen is close.&#8221; Then he said: <b>&#8220;I do not know from where they have introduced these numerous <i>ruku&#8217;s</i> (bowings).&#8221;</b>8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praying eleven <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> is based upon a number of authentic narrations, from them:-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] What al-Bukhari relates in his Sahih (no.2013) from Abu Salamah ibn &#8216;Abdur-Rahman who relates that he asked &#8216;aishah <i>radiallahu &#8216;anha</i>: How was the Prayer of the Prophet <i>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> in Ramadhan? So she said: &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Messenger, <i>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> did not used to pray more than eleven <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> during Ramadhan or in other than Ramadhan. He would pray four <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i>, and do not ask about their beauty and length. Then he would pray another four, and do not ask about their beauty and length. Then he would pray three (<i>witr</i>).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Jabir <i>radiallahu &#8216;anhu</i> said: &#8221;Allah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> led us in the month of Ramadhan with eight <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> and <i>witr</i>. Then on the following night we gathered in the mosque and hoped that he would come out, and we continued in that state until morning. Then we entered our houses, so we said: O Messenger of Allah we gathered in the mosque last night hoping that you would pray with us. So he said: &#8220;I feared that it would become prescribed (i.e. obligatory) for you.&#8221;9</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Imam Malik relates in his <i>al-Muwatta</i> (no.248): From Muhammad ibn Yusuf, from as-Sa&#8217;ib ibn Yazid who said: &#8220;&#8216;Umar ibn al-Khattab ordered &#8216;Ubayy ibn Ka&#8217;b and Tamim ud-Dari to lead the people in Prayer with eleven <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i>. And the reciter would recite some hundreds of Verses until one of us would lean upon a stick because of the length of standing, and we had not used to finish until the appearance of Fajr.&#8221;10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] &#8216;Ubayy ibn Ka&#8217;b came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam </i>and said: O Messenger of Allah, something happened with me last night &#8211; meaning in Ramadhan. So he said: <i>&#8220;And what was that &#8216;Ubayy?&#8221;</i> He said: Some women in my house said, we do not recite the Qur&#8217;an, so can you lead us in Prayer? So I lead them in eight <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> and prayed the <i>witr</i>. And this was a Sunnah of his approval, since he remained quiet and he did not say anything.11</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So all this goes to show that insisting that there is a consensus on praying only twenty <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> for <i>tarawih</i> &#8211; claiming this to be the only view of all the four well-known Imams &#8211; is not only incorrect, but is against the established evidence. As regards a detailed discussion regarding the whole issue, then this is not possible here, nor is it the place to discuss the correctness, or merits, of praying twenty <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> over eight, or vice-versa. Rather, one can find such discussions in the relevant chapters in the books of fiqh, whilst remembering that: &#8220;Difference in opinion must not be a source of obstinacy nor anger.&#8221;12</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>WHAT SHOULD I DO IN RAMADHAN?</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>[Q]</b>: What should a fasting person do, and what is obligatory upon him?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: &#8220;The fasting person must increase in obedience to Allah and to keep away from all the prohibited meters. It is obligatory upon the fasting person to safeguard the obligatory duties and to distance himself from all the prohibitions. So he should pray the five daily Prayers in their correct times and in congregation, and abandon lying, backbiting, cheating, dealing in usury, and all other prohibited matters. The Prophet <i>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever does not abandon falsehood in speech and action, then Allah the Mighty and Majestic has no need that he should leave his food and drink.&#8221;</i>13&#8243;14</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>EYE DROPS AND VOMITING</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[Q] Is it permissible to use eye or ear-drops whilst fasting, or does it invalidate the fast? And does vomiting also break the fast?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: &#8220;Whosoever uses eye or ear drops for medicinal purposes, then this does not invalidate their fast, and this is the correct opinion. This is because such drops are not termed as being food or drink &#8211; neither are they called so by convention, nor by Islamic terminology &#8211; and this is because such drops are administered through those places which food and drink are not administered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if taking such drops could be delayed until the night, then this would avoid entering into any difference of opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, whosoever vomits whilst fasting, then this does not invalidate their fast. This is because Allah does not burden a soul with more than it can bear, and also that the <em>Shari&#8217;ah</em> (Divinely Prescribed Islamic Law) is built upon facilitating ease and removing hardships, as Allah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And We have not made for you any hardships in the Religion.&#8221;</b> [Surah al-Baqarah 2:222].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, the Prophet <i>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever has an attack of vomiting, then no atonement is required of him, but whoever intentionally vomits, then let him atone for it.&#8221;</i>15&#8243;16</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Huqooq Da&#8217;at Ilayhal-Fitrah wa Qarrarthash-Sharee&#8217;ah (pp.11-13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah Magazine, Issue No.6 &#8211; Dhul-Qa&#8217;dah 1417H / March 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Relatives are those who are related to you through blood and close ties; such as the brother, the uncle, the aunty, or their children. Everyone who has a tie of relation with you has certain rights upon you in accordance with how closely they are related to you. About this, Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And give to the relative his right.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-lsraa 17:26]. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; also said: <b>&#8220;And worship Allaah alone, and do not set-up any partner to Him in worship, and be kind and good to the parents, and to the relatives.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:36].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory upon everyone to treat their relatives in the best possible manner, and to support them in accordance with their needs, and what they seek of help and support. And this is what is necessitated by the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Prescribed Islaamic Law), the <i>&#8216;aql</i> (sound reasoning) and the <i>fitrah</i> (natural state).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are many textual evidences encouraging and urging <i>silatur-rahm</i> (joining the ties of relations); such as what Abu Hurayrah <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> relates from the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, that he said: <i>&#8220;Indeed Allaah created the creation, until when He finished doing so, the Rahm (womb/ties of relation) stood-up and said: Is this the place of one who seeks refuge in You from those who severe and cut ties with me. So Allaah said: Yes, Indeed. Would it please you that I keep ties with those who keep ties with You, and cut-off ties with those who cut-off ties with you? So the Rahm said: Yes, indeed! So Allaah said: Then this is for you.&#8221;</i> Then Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <b>&#8220;Recite if you wish: &#8216;Would you then, if you were given the authority, cause corruption in the land, and cut-off ties of relations. They are those upon whom is the curse of Allaah, so that He makes them deaf and blinds them.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Muhammad 47:22-23].&#8221;2 The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> also said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever believes in Allaah and the Last Day let him keep the ties of relations.&#8221;</i>3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unfortunately, many people do not fulfill this <i>haqq</i> (right) and transgress the bounds concerning this. Some of them do not seek to join ties with relatives or show kindness to them; neither through wealth, nor through good behaviour, nor through the giving of occasional gifts and presents nor through rendering help to them in their rimes of need. indeed, many days or months may pass without even seeing or visiting them. And sometimes, rather than seeking to join ties of relations, some people even intend to severe such ties, by seeking to harm their relatives &#8211; either through words, or action, or both. Such people may even keep close ties with those who are not relation, yet cut-off ties with relatives!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people only keep ties of relations with those who maintain ties with them, but cut-off from those who cut-off from them. So such people are not truly the <i>waasils</i> (those who keeps ties of relations), but rather they are those who do so based upon tit for rat. So they will only keep ties with those who keep ties with them whether relatives, or other than them. However, the true <i>waasil</i> (one who keeps ties of relations) is the one who keeps ties of relation for the sake of Allaah &#8211; regardless of whether his relations keep ties with him or not. &#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8216;Amr <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> relates that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<i> &#8220;The waasil (one who keeps the ties of relations) is not the one who merely does so out of reciprocation. Rather, the waasil is the one who even when the relatives cut-off from him, yet he still maintains ties with them.&#8221;</i> So a man asked: O Messenger of Allaah. I have relatives with whom I maintain ties of relations, yet they cut-off from me. I treat them kindly, yet they treat me in an evil manner. And I am forbearing and patient with them, yet they behave rudely and ignorantly towards me. The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;If the situation is as you say, then it is as if you are filling their mouths with sand. And Allaah will continue to aid and support you as long as you continue doing what you are doing.&#8221;</i>4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If there were no other rewards for keeping ties of relations, except that Allaah keeps ties with the <i>waasil</i> in this world and the Hereafter, and that He extends His Mercy due to it, and makes affairs easier through it, and removes distress and anxieties by it, then that would be more than sufficient. However, along with this, <i>silatur-rahim</i> (joining the ties of relations) brings with it closeness to one&#8217;s family and relatives, as well as love and compassion developing between one another, and their being mutual help, in times of ease and hardship. between one another, and other such joys and delights &#8211; as is experienced and well-known. And when ties of relations are not maintained, then each one of the aforementioned benefits turn to their opposites, and great harm comes to the society.</p>

Al-Istiqaamah Newsletter, Issue No. 2, Safar 1417</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">I begin my question by seeking your advice that I may benefit from you with regards to how I may increase my <em>eemaan</em> (faith?)…</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We advise you to <strong>recite the Qur&#8217;aan frequently</strong> and that you <strong>increase in your hearing</strong> of it and in your recitation of it. Reflect and consider its meaning to the best of your ability and what you do not understand of it, then ask the people of knowledge of your country about it, or write to those outside of your country from the Scholars of <em>Sunnah</em> (Prophetic guidance).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also advise you to <strong>increase in the <em>dhikr</em></strong> (remembrance) of Allaah with such remembrances and supplications that are authentically related, such as saying <em>laa ilaaha illallaah</em> (that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah), or saying <em>subhaanallaah wal-hamdulillaah wa laa ilaha illallaahu wallaahu akbar</em> (declaring Allaah free from all imperfections, praising Him and declaring that none has the right to be worshipped except Him and that He is greater), and their like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For this purpose, we urge you to refer to books such as <em>al-Kalimut-Tayyib</em> of Ibn Taymiyyah, <em>al-Waabilus-Sayyib</em> of Ibn al-Qayyim, <em>Riyaadhus-Saaliheen</em> and <em>al-Adhkaar</em> both by Imaam an-Nawawee, and their like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because the remembrance of Allaah increases <em>eemaan</em> (faith) and causes hearts to attain tranquility, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed in the remembrance of Allaah do hearts find tranquility</span><b>.&#8221;</b><br />
[Soorah ar-Ra`d 13:28].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also <strong>preserve your five daily Prayers, your Fasting and the rest of your obligations</strong> &#8211; along with hoping in Allaah&#8217;s mercy and forgiveness and relying upon Him in all your affairs. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;The Believers are only those who, when Allaah is mentioned, feel a fear in the hearts, and when His Verses are recited to them, it increases their eemaan (faith), and they put their trust and rely upon Allaah alone. They are those who perform the Prayer and spend out of that which We have given them, they are Believers in truth. For them are grades of dignity and nobility with their Lord, and also forgiveness and generous provisions.&#8221; </span>[Soorah al-Anfaal 8:2-4]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <strong>Al-Istiqaamah Magazine</strong>, Issue No.6 &#8211; Dhul-Qa&#8217;dah 1417H / March 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By the Grace of Allaah we have started the month of<i> Dhul-Hijjah </i>(the month of<i> Hajj</i> or Pilgrimage), in which Allaah has marked out, for both the pilgrims and the non-pilgrims, some very blessed days. So we shall mention here some of the virtues and rewardful acts that are connected to these blessed days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> DOING GOOD DEEDS IN GENERAL:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first ten days of<i> Dhul-Hijjah </i>are the best and most virtuous days of the year. They are the days in which Allaah the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; most loves the doing of good deeds. About this the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, “<strong>The best days in the world are the ten days.</strong>” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim (d.751H) &#8211; <i> rahimahullaah</i> – said, “Indeed, its days are the most excellent of all the days with Allaah. And it has been confirmed in <i>Saheehul-Bukhaaree</i> (2/382), from Ibn ’Abbaas (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhumaa</i>) who said, that Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, “There ore no days during which good deeds are more beloved to Allaah than these (ten) days.” He was then asked, ‘Not even <i>jihaad</i> in the path of Allaah?’ So he replied, “Not even <i>jihaad</i> in the path of Allaah, except for a person who goes out with his self and his wealth, and comes back with nothing.” And it is these ten days that Allaah has taken an oath by in His Book, by His saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>By the Dawn and by the Ten Nights.</b>” [Sooratul-Fajr 89:1-2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why it is recommended to increase in making <i>takbeer</i> (saying <i>Allaahu akbar</i>), <i>tahleel</i> (saying<i> Laa ilaaha illallaah</i>) and <i>tamheed</i> (saying<i> Alhamdulillaah</i>) during these days &#8230;”[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, “There are no days that are greater with Allaah, and in which good deeds are more beloved to Him, than these ten days. So increase in making<i> tasbeeh </i>(saying <i>Subhaanallaah), tahmeed</i>,<i> tahleel and takbeer</i>, during them.”[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> FASTING THE DAY OF ’ARAFAH:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ninth day of<i> Dhul-Hijjah </i> is the day of ’Arafah, since it is on this day that the pilgrims gather at the mountain plain of ’Arafah, praying and supplicating to their Lord. It is <i> mustahabb</i> (highly recommended) for those who are not pilgrims to fast on this day, since the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) was asked about fasting on the day of ’Arafah, so he said, “It expiates the sins of the past year and the coming year.” [4] Likewise, the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, ‘There is no day on which Allaah frees people from the Fire more so than on the day of ’Arafah. He comes close to those (people standing on ’Arafah), and then He revels before His Angels saying, ‘What are these people seeking.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam at-Tirmidhee (d.275H) &#8211; <i> rahimahullaah</i> – said, “The People of Knowledge consider it recommended to fast on the day of ’Arafah, except for those at ’Arafah.” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><b> SLAUGHTERING ON THE DAY OF AN-NAHR AND ’EEDUL-ADHAA OR THE FOLLOWING THREE DAYS:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tenth day of<i> Dhul-Hiijah </i> is known as the day of <i>an-Nahr</i> (slaughtering), since it marks the ending of the major rites of<i> Hajj</i> (Pilgrimage), and commemorates the bounty and mercy of Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; in that He gave His beloved Prophet Ibraaheem &#8211; <i>’alayhis-salaam</i> &#8211; a ram to sacrifice in place of his firstborn son Ismaa’eel &#8211; <i>’alayhis-salaam</i>. And out of the ten best days of the year, it is the day of <i>an-Nahr</i> which is the most excellent day of the year with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> – said, “The most excellent day of the week is the day of Friday, by the agreement of the Scholars. And the most excellent day of the year is the day of <i>an-Nahr</i>. And some of them said that it is the day of ’Arafah. However, the first opinion is the correct one, since it is related in the <i>Sunan</i> collections that the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, “<strong>The most excellent days with Allaah is the day of an-Nahr, then the day of al-Qarr (the day that the Muslims reside in Minaa)</strong>.” [7]” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>The greatest day of the<i> Hajj </i>(Pilgrimage) is the Day of an-Nahr (Slaughtering).</strong>” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The day of <i>an-Nahr</i> is also known as ’Eedul-Adhaa (the Festivity of Sacrifice) and is one of the two major festivals that Allaah has granted to this<i> Ummah</i>. Anas (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhu</i>) said, ‘The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) came to al-Madeenah and the people of al-Madeenah had &#8211; since the times of <i>jaahiliyyah</i> (Pre-lslaamic Ignorance) &#8211; two days which they marked out for play and amusement. So the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, ‘I came to you, and you had two days of play and amusement in the times of <i>jaahiliyyah</i>. But Allaah has replaced them with something better for you: The day of al-Adhaa (sacrificing) and the day of al-Fitr (ending the Fast).” [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) also said, “The day of al-Fitr, and the day of an-Nahr, and the days of <i>at-</i>Tashreeq (the three days after an-Nahr) are our days of <i> ’Eed </i>(festivity); and they are days of eating and drinking.” [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Eedul-Adhaa, is a day in which the Muslims slaughter a camel, cow, sheep or goat, in commemoration of the sacrifice of Ibraaheem &#8211; <i>’alayis-salaam</i>. And this sacrifice is an obligation upon all those who have the means to do so &#8211; according to the most correct opinion of the Scholars. [12] The basis of this is the Prophet’s (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) saying, “One who has the ability to sacrifice, but chooses not to do so, should not approach our place of (<i>’Eed</i>) Prayer.” [13] And his (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) saying, “Whosoever sacrificed before the Prayer, then let him do so again. But whosoever has not sacrificed, then let him sacrifice.” [14] So this order refers to those who have the ability to do so &#8211; and Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards those who intends to sacrifice &#8211; normally the head of the household &#8211; then they are prohibited from cutting their hair or nails, starting from the first day of<i> Dhul-Hijjah </i> up until after the sacrifice. Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, “When the ten days start, and one of you intends to sacrifice, then let him not cut his hair or his nails.” [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> GLORIFYING ALLAAH WITH THE TAKBEER:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the day of ’Arafah (the 9th of<i> Dhul-Hijjah</i>), up until the<i> ’Asr </i>Prayer on the thirteen day, are days in which the <i>takbeeraat</i> (saying<i> Allaahu Akbar</i>) should be said. Imaam al-Khattaabee (d.456H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> – said, “The wisdom behind saying the <i>takbeeraat</i> in these days is that in the times of <i> jaahiliyyah</i> (pre-lslaamic ignorance), they used to slaughter for their <i> tawaagheet </i>(false objects of worship). So the <i>takbeeraat</i> were prescribed in order to indicate that the act of slaughtering is directed to Allaah alone, and by mentioning only His &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; Name.” [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; <i> rahimahullaah</i> – said, “All praise be to Allaah. The most correct saying concerning the <i>takbeer</i> &#8211; that which the majority of the <i>Salaf</i> (Pious Predecessors), and the Scholars from the Companions and Imaams were upon &#8211; is to begin making the <i>takbeer</i> from <i>Fajr</i> (dawn) on the day of ’Arafah, up until the last day of <i>at-Tashreeq</i> (the thirteenth of<i> Dhul-Hijjah</i>), after every Prayer.” [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abee Shaybah relates, “That ’Alee (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhu</i>) used to make the <i>takbeer</i> beginning after the <i>Fajr</i> Prayer on the day of ’Arafah, up until after the ’Asr Prayer on the last day of <i>at-Tashreeq</i>.” [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards the actual wording of the <i>takbeeraat</i>, then nothing authentic has been related from the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>). However, certain wordings have been authentically related from a group of Companions. From them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas’ood (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhu</i>) would say, “Allaah is great, Allaah is great. None has the right to be worshipped except Him. And Allaah is great, Allaah is great. And to Him belongs all praise. [<i>Allaahu akbar</i>,<i> Allaahu akbar</i>,<i> Allaahu akbar</i>,<i> Laa ilaahaa illallaah</i>,<i> wallaahu akbar</i>,<i> Allaahu akbar wa lillaahil-hamd</i>.]” [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ’Abbaas (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhu</i>) said, “Allaah is great, Allaah is great, Allaah is great, and to Allaah belongs all praise. Allaah is greater and Sublime. Allaah is greater to what He has guided us to. <i>[Allaahu akbar</i>,<i> Allaahu akbar</i>,<i> Allaahu akbar</i>,<i> wa lillaahil-hamd</i>.<i> Allaahu akbar wa ajalla</i>.<i> Allaahu akbar ’alaa maa hadaanaa</i>.]” [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unfortunately, many Muslims have neglected the <i>takbeer</i> established from our <i>Salaf</i> (Pious Predecessors) and have instead resorted to additions which have no basis at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr (d.856H) &#8211; <i> rahimahullaah</i> – said, “Indeed, additions have been invented upon this day, which have no basis at all.” [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And may Allaah have mercy upon the one who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<i>Every good is in following the Salaf; And every evil is in the innovations of the late-comers.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And all praise is for Allaah, Lord of the worlds. And may Allaah extol and send the choicest blessings of peace upon our Leader, Muhammad, and upon his Family, his Companions, and all those who follow them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Without doubt, we all hate the slavery and subjugation that we see on the earth today; meaning the subjugation of some men over others, by which some enslave others; humiliating them, and trampling over them. This is indeed hated. However, the enslavement that we wish to talk about is different to this. It is as Rib&#8217;ee ibn &#8216;Aamir <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> said:<b> &#8220;Allaah has sent us to deliver whomsoever chooses, from the<i> &#8216;uboodiyyah</i> (enslavement, worship and servitude) of men to the <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> of Allaah, And from the narrowness of this world, to the vastness of this world and the Hereafter. And from the tyranny and oppression of (false) religions, to the justice of Islaam.&#8221;</b> 2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> (enslavement, servitude and worship) mentioned here is the <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> to Allaah, which makes a person the noblest of all creatures upon the earth. One of the Salaf (Pious Predecessors) said in a couplet:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;What has made me noble and precious;<br />
Is that You, O Allaah, have mode me enter into Your submission.<br />
And have made me one of the followers of;<br />
Your Prophet Muhammad sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> &#8211; this submission, worship and enslavement is what Allaah refers to in His Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;I have not created Jinn and Mankind, except that they should worship Me.&#8221;</b> [Soorah adh-Dhaariyaat 51:56].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another Verse Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;O mankind! Worship your Lord who has created you from a single person.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:1].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But how do we define this<i> &#8216;uboodiyyah</i>? This worship or <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> is: All that which Allaah loves and is pleased with, whether it is an action of the heart, the tongue or the limbs. We, however, will specifically discuss the <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> of the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Enslavement of the Heart]</b><br />
Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; has placed in everyone that He has created, a heart which must be filled; either with <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> (worship, submission and enslavement) to Allaah, or <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> to other than Allaah. Every single heart has feelings, desires and inclinations. The question is: will those feelings, desires and inclinations be directed to and for Allaah alone, or will they be directed to other than Allaah! Only the former counts as being the true <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> of the heart to Allaah. The <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> of the heart to things other than Allaah are many. Sometimes the heart is enslaved by, and worships money, sometimes it is enslaved by, and worships power and position, sometimes it is enslaved by, and worships women; or other similar things that people desire and covet so much. However, whatever they covet can either lessen their <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> of Allaah, or completely nullify it!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[</b><b>Being a Slave to Wealth]</b><br />
Someone may ask: What is the proof that some people become slaves to money, or other similar things, and worship it? The proof is in the saying of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> where he said: <i>&#8220;Woe be to the&#8217;abd (slave and worshipper) of the dirham, woe be to the &#8216;abd of the deenaar (dirham ond deenaar: equivilant to the Pound and the pence) &#8230;&#8221;</i>3 Someone may ask: How does this enslavement to money manifest itself, and what is its nature! It is when the heart becomes so in love with money, that it covers up, or suppresses the love for Allaah, This love can reach such an extent that a person desires to attain this wealth by any means possible &#8211; neither caring whether the wealth comes to him through <i>halaal</i> (lawful) means; in obedience to Allaah and His Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, or means that are <i>haraam</i> (unlawful and forbidden) in the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So understand by reflection, that every single heart in all created things has feelings, desires and inclinations. It has the desire to love, to gain good and beneficial things for itself, it can feel fear and terror, and it can also surrender and become submissive. Thus, when its feelings, desires and inclinations are all directed to and for Allaah, then it is a heart that truly worships, submits and surrenders to Allaah alone. Therefore, it has <i>khawf</i> (fear) of only Allaah; it has <i>rajaa</i> (hope) in Allaah&#8217;s Mercy; it has <i>mahabbah</i> (love) for Allaah and whatever Allaah loves; and it has <i>istislaam</i> (submits and surrenders) to only Allaah. However, when these feelings, desires and inclinations are directed to other than Allaah, then it is a heart that is enslaved and worships that object which has captured and enslaved it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The forbiddance of the heart submitting to other than Allaah should not be misunderstood to mean that Muslims must forsake the world and dealing with it. Rather, the true position of a Muslim is that which was with the <i>Sahaabah</i> (Companions) <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhum</i>. They held the wealth in their hands, yet none of it was in their hearts. [About this, Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;The position of wealth should be regarded like that of the toilet, in that there is need for it, but it has no place in the heart, and it is resorted to when needed.&#8221;4] The point being made is that we are not trying to call the people to the opinion of some of the <i>Soofees</i>, who believe that it is forbidden for a Muslim to possess wealth and take part in worldly transactions. Rather, it is obligatory for the Muslims to be the richest of people so that they may use this wealth as a means to worship Allaah &#8211; the One free from all imperfections &#8211; and to help people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another form of submitting and being enslaved to other than Allaah is when people submit and enslave their hearts to power and leadership. They are prepared for humiliation to take hold of them, and to abandon their scruples, in order to gain votes during elections; or other such similar situations. They are prepared to submit themselves to people &#8211; doing whatever is necessary for them to do &#8211; in order to win other people&#8217;s favour, and thus gain that vote or position. Thus, this is another form of submitting and enslaving one&#8217;s heart to other than Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[The Greatness of Tawheed]</b><br />
As opposed to all this, the true and pure <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> to Allaah; the true submission and enslavement of one&#8217;s heart to Allaah; is the same as when we say: <i>Tawheed</i> (to sincerely and purely single-out Allaah alone for worship). When the person has this degree of <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i>, he worships Allaah alone; fears Allaah alone; loves Allaah and for Allaah alone; and all his inclinations and desires are directed to Allaah. For this reason <i>Tawheed</i> is the greatest action that a person can perform, and the most beneficial action that a person can possess for himself on the Day of Judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever witnesses that none has the right to be worshiped except Allaah, with ikhlaas (purely and sincerely) from his heart, will enter Paradise.&#8221;</i>5 The meaning of this is that the person who actualised Tawheed in his life, and does what this <i>Tawheed</i> requires of him. Likewise, based upon this, we understand that any act of worship, or any good action or nice manner ism &#8211; if it is not accompanied by this Tawheed &#8211; will not be accepted by Allaah on the Day of judgement, no matter how great and valuable that action apparently seems. And what shows you the greatness of this <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> (submission and enslavement) and Tawheed (pure worship) of Allaah in the heart, is the following incident:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;There was a man who used to greatly sin. So when death approached him, he said to his sons: When I die, burn me and then crush my remains and then scatter the remains into the air. For by Allaah! If Allaah has power over me, then He will punish me in a manner that He has never punished anyone else. So when he died, then sons did what they were asked to do. So Allaah ordered the earth saying. Gather what you have of his remains. So it did. And behold, there he was standing. So Allaah asked him: What made you do what you did? The man said, Due to fear of You, 0 my Lord. So Allaah forgave him because of this.&#8221;</i>6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows us the greatness of <i>khashyah</i> (fear), since this fear that he had was one of the meanings that are part of, and included in, the meaning of <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why all actions &#8211; even if they were to fill the heavens and the earth &#8211; will not be accepted by Allaah unless these actions have sprouted from a person having pure <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> (submission, worship and servitude) to Allaah, worshipping Allaah alone, and not associating any partner along with Him in this worship (i.e. not committing Shirk). Allaah &#8211; the One free from all imperfections &#8211; says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allaah does not forgive that partners should be set-up with Him, but He forgives anything lesser than that to whomsoever He Wills. Whoever set-up partners with Allaah (commits Shirk) has indeed committed the most grievous sin.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:48].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And We came forth to what they brought from their actions and We made it scattered dust.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That which shows us the greatness of Tawheed also, is this second incident:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a jewish boy who used to serve the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and had become ill. So the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> went to visit him and sat by his head and said: &#8220;Accept Islaam.&#8221; The boy looked at his father who was with him. So his father said to him: Obey Abul-Qaasim (i.e. the Prophet) <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. So he accepted Islaam. As the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was leaving, he said: <i>&#8220;All praise is for Allaah who saved this boy from the Fire.&#8221;</i>7 Meaning, that although this person had no good deeds, yet because of him saying this statement of <i>Tawheed</i> &#8211; purely and sincerely from his heart &#8211; it was enough to save him from the Hellfire and cause him to enter Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[</b><b>The Fruits of Tawheed]</b><br />
So as this <i>Tawheed</i> strengthens in the heart, becoming stronger, firmer and more well-rooted, then as a result, one&#8217;s deeds will likewise multiply and his worship of Allaah will</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">become greater and much more firmer. Since, if a person realises with <i>ikhlaas</i> (sincerity) and <i>yaqeen</i> (certainty) in his heart that Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; is the One who has created him, then he knows that he should only worship Allaah &#8211; the One free from all imperfections. Thus, as this realisation becomes firmer in the heart, then good deeds become more apparent and multiply in number.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So reflect upon Allaah&#8217;s great Wisdom in that when He created Hellfire, He created it with different levels and degrees. The highest level being the one having the least punishment and torment in it &#8211; which is for those people who had <i>Tawheed</i>, yet along with this, had many sins that they did not repent from. Thus, though they will be punished at this level, until they are purified from their sins, but because of this <i>Tawheed</i> and <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> to Allaah alone in their hearts, they will eventually be saved from the Hellfire and admitted into Paradise. This level of Hellfire will then have no inhabitants left in it. This shows the greatness and virtue of <i>Tawheed</i> and the worship of Allaah alone, due to which they will eventually be rescued from the Hellfire, not being eternally condemned in it.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah has sent us to deliver whomsoever chooses, from the <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> (enslavement, worship and servitude) of men to the <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> of Allaah; from the narrowness of this world, to the vastness of this world and the Hereafter; and from the tyranny and oppression of (false) religions, to the justice of Islaam.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Laying the Foundations]</b><br />
What also shows the importance of <i>Tawheed</i>, is the life and example of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. It can be divided into two stages: The first stage is when he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was in Makkah. The second stage was in Madeenah. So in Makkaah his message was only to teach one thing; and that was the worship of Allaah alone without any partners; which is the matter of <i>Tawheed</i> or <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> to Allaah alone. The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> did not call the people to leave any other sin, nor to do any other good deed. During this period he only called them to single out Allaah alone with worship, since this is the foundation upon which all else is built. Thus, we must understand that once a person&#8217;s heart is truly filled with the <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> (love, humility, submission and enslavement) to Allaah alone, he will then begin to fulfill all the obligations which Allaah has placed upon him, to the best of his ability. This is borne out by the following statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Aaishah <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhoo</i> said:<br />
&#8220;The first part (of the Qur&#8217;aan) to be revealed was a <i>Soorah</i> (chapter) from the <i>mufassal</i> (shorter chapters) in which Paradise and Hell were mentioned. Then, when the people entered into Islaam, came the revelation regarding the <i>halaal</i> (lawful) and <i>haraam</i> (unlawful). Had the first revelation been: Do not drink <i>khamr</i> (wine and other intoxicants). They would have said: We shall never give up drinking <i>khamr</i>. Had the first revelation been: Do not commit <i>zinaa</i> (adultery and fornication), they would have said: We shall never give up committing <i>zinaa</i>.&#8221;8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the foundation, about which &#8211; if a person agrees he will then desire and agree to abandon all sins and acts of disobedience. Indeed, it was only after Tawheed, the worship of Allaah alone; and the willingness to submit and surrender to Allaah was understood by the Companions &#8211; <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhum</i> &#8211; and it had settled in the depths of their hearts, that Allaah began to order them with the various commands and prohibitions. It was then that the command was revealed to establish <i>Salaah</i> (Prayer); pay the <i>Zakaah</i>; fast in the month of <i>Ramadaan</i>; then afterwards the command to make <i>Hajj</i> (Pilgrimage to Makkah); and so on, until all the commands which Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; wanted to order and prohibit the people with were given, step by step, one by one &#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this call to the <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> of Allaah and to single Him out alone for love, obedience and worship, is the common message of all the Prophets and Messengers <i>&#8216;alayhimus-salaam</i>. Every single Prophet and Messenger came to his people saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;O my people, worship Allaah alone, making all your worship purely for Him, since there is none besides Him having the right to be worshiped by you.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-A&#8217;raaf 7:56].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the message of the Prophet Nooh, Ibraaheem, Moosaa, &#8216;Eesaa ibn Maryam <i>&#8216;alayhimus-salaam</i>; and the <i>khaatim</i> (final and last) of the Prophets, Muhammad <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. They all came with this same message.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Al-Istiqaamah Magazine, Issue No.7</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><b>[1]: MAN&#8217;S FITRAH (NATURAL DISPOSITION)</b></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is essential to know is that: &#8220;Allaah created the creation in order that they should worship Him. Furthermore, Allaah prepared for them &#8211; from His Provision &#8211; all that they would require. About this Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;I did not create jinn and mankind, except that they should worship Me. I do not seek any provisions from them, nor do I ask that they should feed me. Indeed Allaah is the Provider, the Possessor of Might and Strength.&#8221; </b>[Soorah adh-Dhaariyaat 51:56-58].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the soul &#8211; if left to its <i>Fitrah</i> (natural disposition and inclination) &#8211; would find itself acknowledging Allaah&#8217;s Divinity, loving Him and worshiping Him alone, without worshipping others along with Him. However, this <i>fitrah</i> becomes corrupted and it deviates away from the pure worship of Allaah, due to what the devils &#8211; from amongst mankind and jinn &#8211; whisper to some people, beautifying to them their whispers of deception. So Tawheed (to worship Allaah alone) is the core and root of man&#8217;s <i>fitrah</i>, whereas Shirk (directing any part of worship that belongs only to Allaah, to other than Allaah) is alien to it and is something that deceptively enters into it. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;So set your face to the <i>Haneef</i> Religion (the Religion of pure Tawheed), This is the <i>fitrah</i> of Allaah which He created mankind upon. There is to be no change in the creation (i.e, Religion) of Allaah. That is the straight and upright Religion. But most of mankind do not have knowledge.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Room 30:30].&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above Aayah (Verse) clearly refutes the false notion of the atheists; who claim that the natural basis of man is Shirk, and that Tawheed evolved in man! Not only does the previous Aayah refutes this falsehood, but so do the following two authentic narrations:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Firstly</b>: Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said, that his Lord said: <i>&#8220;I created all My Servants upon the true Religion (upon Tawheed, free from Shirk). Then the devils come to them end led them astray from their true Religion. They made unlawful to people that which I had mode lawful for them, and they commended them to associate in worship with Me, that for which I had sent down no authority.&#8221;</i>4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Secondly</b>: Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Every child is born upon the Fitrah (i.e. Islaam), but his parents make him a jew or a christian or a magian. It is like the way on animal gives birth to a natural offspring. Have you noticed any born mutilated, before you mutilate them.&#8221;</i> Abu Hurayrah said: Recite if you wish: <b>&#8220;Allaah&#8217;s fitrah with which He created mankind. There is to be no change to the creation (Religion) of Allaah.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Room 30:30].&#8221;3</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><b>[2]: THE BEGINNING OF IDOL-WORSHIP</b></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mankind was, in the beginning, a single Ummah (nation) upon <i>Tawheed</i>, the pure worship of Allaah alone. Then <i>Shirk</i> gradually overcame them. The basis for this belief is what Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Mankind was one Ummah (nation), then Allaah sent Prophets bringing good news and warnings.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:213].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Mankind was not except a single Ummah, then they differed.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Yoonus 12. 19].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbaas <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> said:<br />
&#8220;Between Noah and Aadam there were ten generations, all of them were upon the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Law) of the truth, then they differed. So Allaah sent Prophets as bringers of good news and as warners.&#8221;4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So: &#8220;During the time of the Prophet Noah<i> &#8216;alayhis-salaam</i>, <i>Shirk</i> appeared amongst his people, and they started worshipping idols along with worshipping Allaah. So Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>Indeed We sent Noah<i> &#8216;alayhis-salaam</i> to his people and he said to them: I have come to you as a clear warner; that you should worship only Allaah.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Hood 1 1:25-26].&#8221;5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After this clear explanation, it is of the utmost importance for the Muslims to know exactly how <i>Shirk</i> spread amongst the Believers, after they were people upon pure <i>Tawheed</i>?</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><b>[3]: THE ORIGINS OF SHIRK</b></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said about the people of Noah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And they said: You shall not forsake your</b> <b>deities / gods, nor shall you forsake Wadd, nor Suwaa&#8217;, nor Yaghooth, nor Ya&#8217;ooq, nor Nasr.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Nooh 71:23].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbaas <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> relates:<br />
&#8220;These were all idols from Noah&#8217;s nation, which eventually ended up amongst the Arabs. <i>Wadd</i> was the idol which was worshipped by the Kalb tribe in the region of Dawmatul-Jandal; <i>Suwaa&#8217;</i> was for the Hudhayl tribe; <i>Yaghooth</i> by the Ghutayf tribe at Jurf near the region of Sabaa; <i>Ya&#8217;ooq</i> for the Hamdaan tribe and <i>Nasr</i> was the idol worshipped by the Dhul-Kalaa of the Himayr tribe. <b>Indeed these five idols were the names of righteous men from the nation of Noah. When they died Shaytaan whispered to their people to make statues of them in honour of them, and to place these statues in their places of gathering as a reminder of them, so they did this. However, none from amongst them worshipped these statues, until when that generation passed away and the purpose of the statues was forgotten, the next generation then began worshipping them.</b>&#8220;6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad ibn Qays <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> said:<br />
&#8220;<i>Yaghooth</i>, <i>Ya&#8217;ooq</i> and <i>Nasr</i> were a group of righteous men, who were taken as examples to be followed by their people. So when they died their companions said: If we were to make pictures of them it would encourage us to do acts of worship and obedience to Allaah (as they did). So they made pictures of them. However, when they died and the next generation came, Shaytaan whispered to them saying: Your fore-fathers used to worship these righteous men, and it was due to them that it rained. So they began to worship them.&#8221;7</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the beginnings of Shirk lay in the excessive praise and respect given to certain dead pious Muslims, who &#8211; due to peoples&#8217; love for them &#8211; became idols that were worshipped and supplicated along with Allaah. So what needs to be understood is why people felt that they had to worship these righteous people along with worshipping Allaah.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><b>[4]: TAKING THE DEAD AS INTERCESSORS</b></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed We have sent down to you the Book in truth, so worship Allaah alone by making the Religion purely for Him. Surely the Religion, worship and obedience should be for Allaah alone. But those who take as <i>awliyaa</i> (friends and protectors) others along with Allaah say: We only worship them so that they may bring us closer to Allaah. Indeed Allaah will judge between them concerning that in which they differ. Indeed Allaah does not guide those who are liars and disbelievers.&#8221;</b> [Soorah az-Zumar 39:2-3].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And they worship those besides Allaah that can neither harm nor benefit them, and they say: These are our intercessors with Allaah. Say to them: Do you inform Allaah about that which He does not have knowledge in the heavens and the earth. Glory be to Allaah and how free He is from that which the associate as partners with Him.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Yoosuf 10:18].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;So Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; informed us in these two <i>Aayaat</i> (Verses) that the <i>mushriks</i> had taken others from the creation as <i>awliyaa</i> along with Allaah. They worshipped them along with Him, by offering <i>du&#8217;aa</i> (supplication) to them, and directing to them hope (of attaining safety or of being cured from some illness) and fear, sacrifice, vows, and their like claiming that directing such worship to these <i>awliyaa</i> would bring them closer to Allaah and that these <i>awliyaa</i> would then act as intercessors between them and Allaah. Yet Allaah &#8211; the the Most Perfect &#8211; rejected such claims and made clear its falseness and labeled those who claimed such a thing as being liars and disbelievers!&#8221;8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Thus it should be clear to all who have intellect, that the cause of disbelief of the earlier <i>kuffaar</i> (disbelievers) was due to them taking the Prophets, <i>awliyaa</i>, trees, stones and other things from the creation, as intercessors between them and Allaah, believing that such intercessors would fulfill for them their needs and aspirations, without any permission from Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; nor His approval. They considered it to be similar to how ministers and advisors intercede on behalf of the people with the worldly kings. So they made a (false) analogy between Allaah &#8211; the Most Majestic &#8211; and the worldly kings and leaders, saying: lust as a person who wishes to present his needs to a king has to go through the king&#8217;s advisors and ministers, then likewise we draw closer to Allaah by making <i>du&#8217;aa</i> (supplication) to the Prophets and the <i>awliyaa</i>; taking them as intercessors between us and Allaah. However, this analogy is the height of futility and falsehood. Since Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects &#8211; has none that is comparable to Him, nor can analogies be made between Him and His creation. Indeed no one intercedes for His creation, except with His permission. and none will be granted <i>shafaa&#8217;a</i> (intercession), except the people of <i>Tawheed</i>. For Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; has knowledge and power over all things, and is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy. He does not fear anyone, nor is frightened by anyone, since He &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; has power and dominion over His slaves and disposes of their affairs as He Wills. This is contrary to the earthly kings and leaders, for they do not have power over everything, nor do they have knowledge about everything. This is why they are dependant upon advisers, ministers and armies to assist them in matters which they, by themselves, are unable to do. They are also in need of being informed about those who are in need, which is another reason for their being surrounded by ministers and advisors. But the Lord &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic, the One free from all defects and shortcomings &#8211; is free from any type of need or assistance from any of His creation. He is more merciful to them that their mothers and He is the Most Just. And according to His Wisdom, Knowledge and Power, He places all things in their proper place. It is therefore not permissible to compare Allaah with His creation in this manner.&#8221;9</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><b>[5]: DU&#8217;AA TO OTHER THAN ALLAAH IS SHIRK</b></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<br />
&#8220;Whosoever dies whilst making <i>du&#8217;aa</i> (invocation, supplication) to others besides Allaah, will enter the HellFire.&#8221;10</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><b>[6]: A PROOF FROM THE COMPANIONS</b></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> related:<br />
&#8220;In times of drought, &#8216;Umar ibn al-Khattaab <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> used to ask &#8216;Abbaas ibn &#8216;Abdul-Muttalib to pray for rain on their behalf. He himself would say: &#8220;O Allaah we used to ask Your Prophet to supplicate on our behalf to You, and You would bless us with rain. Now we ask the uncle of our Prophet to supplicate to You on our behalf, so bless us with rain.&#8221; Anas said: So they would be blessed with rain.&#8221;11</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sulaym ibn &#8216;Aamir al-Khabaairee relates:<br />
&#8220;That the sky withheld all rain, so Mu&#8217;aawiyah ibn Abee Sufyaan went out to pray for rain along with the people of Damascus. So when Mu&#8217;aawiyah sat upon the pulpit he said: &#8220;Where is Yazeed ibn al-Aswad al-Jurashee?&#8221; So the people called him and he came stepping between the people. Then Mu&#8217;aawiyah commanded him, so he ascended the pulpit and sat at his feet. Then Mu&#8217;aawiyah said: &#8220;O Allaah! Today we are asking the best and most noblest amongst us to supplicate to You for us. O Allaah, today we put Yazeed ibn al-Aswad al-Jurashee forward to supplicate to You for us. O Yazeed! Raise up your hands to Allaah.&#8221; So he raised up his hands and the people raised up their hands. Then rain-clouds, like large shields, came quickly from the west, and the winds blew, and it rained so much that people could hardly reach their houses.&#8221;12</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So why didn&#8217;t &#8216;Umar <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> and the rest of the Companions who were with him, go to the grave of our beloved Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>; or to the grave of the greatest of the <i>awliyaa</i> Abu Bakr <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i>, and make <i>du&#8217;aa</i> (supplication) to them for rain? Why? Because they knew that doing so would constitute <i>shirk</i>? Likewise, why didn&#8217;t Mu&#8217;aawiyah, and those of the righteous people with him, not delegate someone to go to Madeenah &#8211; to the grave of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, or any of the Companions buried there &#8211; or directly make <i>du&#8217;aa</i> to them from Damascus, in their time of distress and great need? Why? Because they knew that doing so would constitute <i>shirk</i>!</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><b>[7]: SOME POINTS OF BENEFIT</b></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Firstly</b>: That <i>Shirk</i> began during the time of Noah &#8216;alayhis-salaam, due to the excessive love and veneration that the people had for certain dead pious Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Qurtubee (d.654H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said: &#8220;The initial images that were made of these righteous men were done in order that the people could be reminded about their righteousness and so strive in being righteous; as they strove. So they worshipped Allaah by the graves of these righteous men. Then a people came after them who forgot the intent of their fore-fathers&#8217; actions. So Shaytaan whispered to them saying: Your fore-fathers used to worship these images and held them in great veneration.&#8221;13</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Secondly</b>: &#8220;That Shaytaan is eager to misguide mankind and to plot against them. He comes from the angle of exploiting man&#8217;s emotions, and lures them into doing acts that are (apparently) good. Thus, when Shaytaan saw amongst the people of Noah their great love and esteem for the righteous, he tricked them into going beyond the bounds in their love, and he got them to make and place statues of these dead pious Muslims in their places of gatherings. The objective of this was to make them swerve away from the right path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Thirdly</b>: That Shaytaan does not only observe the present generation, and seek to deceive only them; but he also wishes to misguide and deceive future generations. Thus, when he could not plunge the present generation, from the people of Noah, into Shirk, he eagerly awaited the next generation&#8217;s arrival, in order that he could misguide them.&#8221;14</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Fourthly</b>: That the worshipping of dead pious Muslims continues to be practiced amongst the <i>Ummah</i> even today. The difference being is that the names have changed. Thus, instead of worshipping <i>Wadd</i>, or <i>Yaghooth</i>, or <i>Ya&#8217;ooq</i>; people have instead directed the same practices of <i>Shirk</i> &#8211; like supplicating directly to the pious dead, and taking them as intercessors between them and Allaah &#8211; to others; such as to Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-Qaadir al-Jeelaanee in Iraaq, or al-Baydaawee in Eygypt, or Chishtee in India, etc. However, changing the name of a thing, does not change its reality.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah News Letter<br />
Safar 1417H / July 1996 , Issue No.2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Describing Paradise, Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed Allaah will enter those who believe and do righteous and correct actions into Paradise, beneath which rivers flow. Wherein they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls and their garments will be made of silk.&#8221; </b>[Soorah al-Hajj 24:23].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed the pious and obedient ones will be in Paradise, amongst gardens and water-springs. It will be said to them: Enter! In peace and safety. And We shall remove from their hearts any ill-feeling, so they will be like brothers, facing each other on thrones. No sense of hardship shall touch them, and they will be of those who never leave.&#8221; </b>[Soorah al-Hijr 15:45-46].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>Paradise</b>, that precious sanctity to which, throughout the ages, the Believers run towards.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Paradise</b>, a burning flame that was in the hearts of our <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> (Pious Predecessors), a flame that spurred them to aim for the highest examples of velour in <i>jihaad</i> and sacrifice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Paradise</b>, that noble goal which aspiring eyes are fixed towards and which yearning souls long for, in all times and in all places. They find worldly afflictions agreeable to them for the sake of achieving Paradise. Indeed, to enter into it and remain in it is considered the greatest goal for the Believers, and it is a hope which is kept in view throughout life&#8217;s journey. How often has Paradise been the incentive and a motivation for goodness and truth, despite the dangers, afflictions and thorns that lie along the path &#8211; even if it involves certain death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the case in the days of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, as Anas <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> related: Once Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and his Companions proceeded towards Badr and arrived there before the disbelievers of Makkah. When the disbelievers arrived Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<i> &#8220;None of you should proceed ahead of me in anything.&#8221;</i> The disbelievers then advanced towards us and Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Rise-up to enter Paradise, whose width is equal to the heavens and the earth.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umayr ibn al-Humaam al-Ansaaree <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> said: O Messenger of Allaah ! Is Paradise equal in width to the heavens and the earth? He said: <i>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</i> Umayr then exclaimed words of astonishment and excitement, so Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> asked him: <i>&#8220;What made you say these words of astonishment and excitement?&#8221;</i> He replied: O Messenger of Allaah ! Nothing but the desire to be amongst its inhabitants. Allaah&#8217;s Messeneger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> then said, <i>&#8220;Indeed, you are surely from amongst its inhabitants.&#8221;</i> So &#8216;Umayr then took some dates from his bag and began to eat them. Then he said: If I were to live until I have eaten all the dates, then indeed this life would be too long. He threw away the remaining dates which were with him and he fought until he was killed. 1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was also the stance taken in later times:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Moosaa al-Ash&#8217;aree <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i>, whilst in the presence of his enemy, narrated: Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> &#8220;Indeed, the gates of Paradise are beneath the shade of swords.&#8221;</i> A man who was in a shabby condition got up and said: Abu Moosaa! did you hear this from the Messenger of Allaah <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>? So he said: Yes! He returned to his friend and said: I bid you salaam (a farewell greeting of peace). Then he broke the sheath of his sword, threw it away, then rushed into the thick of the enemy and fought them until he was slain. 2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee (d.204H) &#8211; rahimahullaah -said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;O my soul! It is not, except a few days of patience;<br />
As if the extent were but a few dreams.<br />
O my soul! Pass quickly on through this world;<br />
And leave it, for indeed life lies ahead of it.&#8221;</i> 4</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Istiqaamah Magazine , Issue No.2 ,1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>DEFENDING THE RELIGION</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal</strong> (d.241H)- <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;All praise is for Allaah who, in every age and intervals between the Prophets, raises up a group from the People of Knowledge, who call the misguided to guidance, patiently bearing ill treatment and harm. With the Book of Allaah they give life to the dead, and by Allaah&#8217;s Light they give sight to the blind. How many a person killed by Iblees (the Devil) have they revived. How many people astray and wandering have they guided. How beautiful their effect has been upon the people, and how vile people have been towards them. They expel from the Book of Allaah the alterations of those going beyond bounds, the false claims of the liars and the false interpretations of the ignorant ones &#8211; those who uphold die banner of innovation and let loose the trials and discords; who differ about the Book, oppose the Book, and agree upon opposing the Book. They speak about Allaah and His Book without knowledge, argue about what is ambiguous in the Book, and deceive the ignorant masses with such ambiguities. We seek refuge in Allaah from the trials of the misguided ones.&#8221; 1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah</strong> (d.728H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When some people asked Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal that they felt uneasy about criticizing people, he replied: <span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8220;If I were to remain silent, how would the ignorant masses know the truth from falsehood?&#8221;</span> Those who introduce heretical writings which oppose the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah and those who innovate in matters of worship, then it is obligatory that they be exposed and that the Muslims be warned against them &#8211; by unanimous agreement of the Muslims Scholars. In fact, when Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal was asked about a person who fasted, preyed and secluded himself in the mosque for worship; if he was dearer to him than a person who spoke out against <i>ahlul-bid&#8217;ah</i> (the innovators), he replied: &#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">When he fasts and prays and secludes himself, then he does so for the benefit of his own self. However, when he speaks out against the innovators, he does so for the benefit of the Muslims in general, and this is more virtuous</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is clear that openly opposing the innovators is of general benefit to the Muslims and is considered one of the types of <i>jihaad</i> in the path of Allaah. Since purifying the religion of Allaah and defending it from their attacks is a collective obligation &#8211; as is agreed upon by the Scholars. For Allaah did not raise up some people to oppose the innovators, then the religion would suffer harm, corruption and deviation. Indeed, this type of corruption is even greater then the corruption resulting from the disbelievers conquering the Muslims. Since when the disbelievers conquer the Muslims, they do not corrupt their hearts, nor their religion, except after some time. Whereas the innovators corrupt the hearts from the very beginning.&#8221; [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>UNITING THE RANKS UPON THE TRUTH</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin Baaz</strong> &#8211; hafidhahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There is no doubt that it is obligatory upon the Muslims to unify their ranks and to unite their word upon the truth and to co-operate in goodness and piety against the enemies of Islaam &#8211; as Allaah, the Most Perfect, ordered them with in His saying: <b>&#8220;And hold fast altogether to the rope of Allaah and do not become divided.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:102]. And likewise, Allaah has warned the Muslims against splitting up, as occurs in His &#8211; the Most Perfect&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;And do not be like those who differed and split-up after the clear evidences came to them.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:105]. However, the order to unify the Muslims and unite their word upon the truth and to hold fast to the rope of Allaah, does not necessitate that they should not censure wrong beliefs and practices &#8211; whether from the Soofees or other than them. Rather, what the order to hold fast to the rope of Allaah necessitates is: to order the good, forbid the evil and also to clarify the truth &#8211; with the clear <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> proofs &#8211; to whomsoever is misguided or has a mistaken opinion, until they unite upon the truth and turn away from that which opposes it. All of this is included in His &#8211; the Most Perfect&#8217;s &#8211; saying: &#8220;And help you one another in righteousness and piety, and do not help one another in sin and transgression.&#8221; [Sooratul-Maa&#8217;idah 5:2]. And His &#8211; the Most Perfect&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;Let there arise from amongst you a group of people calling to all that is good, enjoining the good and forbidding the evil, they are the ones who shall be successful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal&#8217;-lmraan 3:110]. And when the people of truth withhold from clarifying the mistakes of those who have erred or are mistaken, then they will not have achieved that which Allaah ordered them with, as regards calling to goodness, ordering the good and forbidding the evil. So the person in error will remain upon his error, and the one acting in opposition to the truth will remain upon his opposition. And this is contrary to what Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; prescribed, with regards sincere advice, co-operation upon goodness, ordering the good and forbidding the evil &#8211; and Allaah alone is the One who grants success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin Baaz</strong> was asked about the correctness of the saying: &#8220;We should unite upon that which we agree, and excuse each other in that which we disagree.&#8221; The Shaykh commented:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Yes! It is obligatory to co-operate in that which we agree, by aiding the truth, calling to it and warning against that which Allaah and His Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> have prohibited. Its for excusing each other for that in which we differ &#8211; then this is not to be taken in an absolute sense, but rather in a general one. Thus, if the difference involves a particular issue of ijtihaad wherein the proofs are deep and detailed &#8211; then it is obligatory not to reproach or censure one another. However, if it opposes a clear text of the Book and the Sunnah, then it is obligatory to correct the one who has opposed the clear texts, but with wisdom, beautiful admonition and debating in the best possible manner, acting upon Allaah -the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;And help you one another in righteousness and piety, but do not help one another in sin and transgression.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:2] And His &#8211; the Most Perfect&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;The Believers &#8211; man and woman &#8211; are protectors to each other, they order the good and forbid the evil &#8230; &#8220;</b> [Soorah at-Towbah 9:71]. And His &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and beautiful admonition, and argue with them in ways that are better.</b>&#8221; [Soorah an-Nahl 16:125]. And he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever sees an evil, then let him change it with his hand. If he is unable to do this, then with his tongue, and if he is unable to do this, then with his heart. And that is the weakest of eemaan (faith).&#8221;</i> And he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever directs a person to do good, will have a reward similar to the one who does that good.&#8221;</i> 5 And the <i>aayaat</i> (verses) and <i>ahaadeeth</i> with this meaning are plenty.&#8221; 6</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><strong>Al-Istiqaamah</strong> Magazine, Issue No.6 &#8211; Dhul-Qa&#8217;dah 1417H / March 1997</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kumail ibn Ziyaad said: &#8216;Alee ibn Abee Taalib took hold of my hand and took me off towards the desert. When we reached it, he sat down, took a deep breath and then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O Kumail ibn Ziyaad! The hearts are receptacles, so the best of them is the one which preserves the best. So memorise what I say to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The people are of three (types)</strong>: the Scholar who is rabbaanee [1],  the one learning being upon the path of salvation, and the confused rabble who follow everyone who calls out &#8211; bending along with every wind &#8211; they are not enlightened by the light of knowledge, nor do they lean upon a firm support.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Knowledge is better than wealth</strong>. Knowledge is a protection for you, whereas it is you that has to protect wealth. The zakaat of knowledge is action, whereas spending decreases wealth. And love of the Scholar is part of the Religion. Knowledge brings about obedience for the Scholar in his own lifetime and causes him to have good repute after his death, whereas the benefit of wealth ceases when it passes away. The hoarders of wealth have died even though they are still alive, whereas the Scholars remain for as long as time remains &#8211; their persons are lost, but their examples remain in the hearts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here, indeed here &#8211; (and he pointed to his chest) &#8211; there is knowledge, if only I could find carriers for it. But instead I have found them quick to comprehend, but not trustworthy. They use what pertains to the Religion for worldly ends. They seek to use Allaah&#8217;s proofs against His Book, blindly following the people of truth, but having no insight regarding receiving it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Doubt pierces their hearts when anything problematic arises. They are neither this nor that. They do not know where the truth lies, and if they are mistaken then they do not know why. They are ardently in love with something the true state of which they do not know &#8211; so they become a trial for others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed, the utmost good is for the one to whom Allaah grants understanding of the Religion And it is enough ignorance for a person that he does not know about his Religion. Such a person is passionately addicted to pleasures, accustomed to following desires, or is one given to amassing wealth and piling it up. Such people are not from the callers to the Religion rather they are more like the grazing cattle. And thus knowledge passes away with the passing away of those who carry it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh Allaah, yes! The earth will not be without one who stands upright for Allaah, with proof &#8211; so that Allaah&#8217;s proofs and clear signs are not abolished. They are the ones who are few in number, but having the most value to Allaah. With them, Allaah asserts His proofs amongst their contemporaries and cultivates them in the hearts of those similar to them. With them, knowledge assaults and comes upon the true state of affairs, so that which those accustomed to easy living find difficult therein, they find easy; and they are at home with that which causes consternation to the ignorant ones. They live in this world with their bodies, whereas their souls are attached to higher things. They are Allaah&#8217;s ambassadors in His land and the callers to His Religion. Oh how I would like to see them, and I seek Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness for myself and for you. If you wish then you may leave.&#8221; [2]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah Magazine , Issue No.6 &#8211; Dhul-Qa&#8217;dah 1417H / March 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullaah ibn Mas&#8217;ood <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> relates that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> would supplicate:<i> &#8220;O Allaah! I ask You for guidance, piety, safety and well-being, and contentment and sufficiency.&#8221;</i> [<b><i>Allaahumma innee as&#8217;alukal-hudaa wat-tuqaa wal-&#8216;afaafa wal-ghinaa</i></b>].1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam as-Sa&#8217;dee (d.1376H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <i>du&#8217;aa</i> (supplication) is from the most comprehensive and beneficial <i>du&#8217;aas</i> (supplications), since it includes asking Allaah for well-being with regards to both the Religion and the world. Thus, <i>al-hudaa</i> (the guidance) is beneficial knowledge, and <i>at-tuqaa </i>(i.e. <i>taqwaa</i> or piety) is righteous actions and leaving-off what Allaah and His Messenger have forbidden; and this is (asking) for correctness and well-being of a person&#8217;s Religion. For indeed, the Religion comprises of beneficial knowledge and recognising the truth &#8211; which is guidance &#8211; and standing firm upon obedience to Allaah and His Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> &#8211; and this is piety.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <i>al-&#8216;afaafa</i> (well-being and safety) and <i>al-ghinaa</i> (contentment and sufficiency) comprises of being safe from (the harms of) the creation and that the heart is not attached to them. And it also comprises of being contented with Allaah and what He provides, and seeking whatever will cause the heart to be satisfied with Him. So with this, happiness in this worldly life is completed, and the heart tastes true sweetness and delight &#8211; and this is a goodly life. So whosoever is granted the provisions of guidance, Piety. well-being and contentment has indeed achieved true happiness, and has acquired all that could be possibly sought after, as well as being saved from all that is dreadful and frightening.&#8221;2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>KNOWLEDGE AND HUMILITY</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam adh-Dhahabee (d.748H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whosoever seeks knowledge for actions, then his knowledge makes him humble and fearful, and causes him to weep at (the deficiencies in) himself. But whosoever seeks knowledge for the sake of merely teaching, giving verdicts, in order to brag, or to show-off; becomes foolish, arrogant and looks down in contempt at the people, and is destroyed by pride, and the people hate him. <b>&#8220;Truly he succeeds who purifies his soul, and he fails who corrupts it.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shams 99:4-5]. Meaning that it is corrupted with sin and disobedience.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>REMEMBERING THE GUIDANCE</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qaadee &#8216;Iyaadh (d.591H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; relates: &#8220;Mu&#8217;sab ibn &#8216;Abdullaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Imaam Maalik (d.179H) would mention the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, his colour would change and he would have to lean down, and those in his gathering would feel disturbed. So one day, on being asked about this, he said: If you had seen what I have seen, you would not have rejected what you had seen. I have seen Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir (d.130H) &#8211; and he was the leader of the Reciters &#8211; that he would never be asked about a <i>hadeeth</i> (Prophetic narration), except that he would weep, until we had mercy upon him. And I have seen Ja&#8217;far ibn Muhammad (d.148H) who used to smile alot. Yet whenever the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was mentioned to him, he would turn pale. I have never seen him narrating the <i>hadeeth</i> of the Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, except in a state of purification. And when times deteriorated, I never saw him except in one of three conditions: Either Praying, observing silence, or reciting the Qur&#8217;aan. He never uttered a word having no significance, and he was one of the Scholars and worshippers who had great fear of Allaah. Whenever &#8216;Abdur-Rahmaan ibn al-Qaasim (d.126H) mentioned the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, he turned pale, as if the blood had been drained from his face, and his tongue dried-up due to reverence for Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. I went to &#8216;Aamir ibn &#8216;Abdullaah ibn az-Zubayr (d.123H), and whenever the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was mentioned to him, he would weep so much, until he was unable to weep any longer. I saw az-Zuhree (d.124H) &#8211; and he was from the kindest of people, and closest to them &#8211; that when the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was mentioned to him, he would not be able to recognise you, nor would you be able to recognise him. I came to Safwaan ibn Sulaym (d.132H) &#8211; and he was one of the <i>mujtahid</i> Scholars and worshippers &#8211; that whenever he mentioned the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> he would weep, and he would not stop weeping, to the extent that the people would have to get up and leave him.&#8221;4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is from the likes of such weeping souls that we have inherited the knowledge of our Religion!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Saalih al-Uthaymeen<br />
Source: Al-Istiqaamah Magazine , Issue No.5 &#8211; Ramadân 1417H / January 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed all praise is for Allaah. We praise Him, we seek His help and we seek forgiveness from Him. And we seek refuge in Allaah from the evils within our own souls and our evil actions. Whomsoever Allaah guide, then none can misguide him; and whomsoever Allaah leaves to stray, then none can guide him aright. Indeed it is Allaah who sent His Messenger Muhammad <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> with the Guidance and the Religion of Truth, and he conveyed this Message, fulfilled his trust, fought <i>Jihaad</i> as it should be fought, and he did not die except that he left his Ummah (nation) upon a clear path, its night is like its day, and no one deviates from it except that he is destroyed. And may Allaah extol and send blessings of peace upon His Messenger Muhammad, and upon his Family, his Companions, and those who follow them in goodness. Then to proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So on this night, Sunday the 27th of Rabee&#8217;ul-Awwal 1417H &#8211; which corresponds to the 10th of August 1996CE &#8211; I am pleased to have this opportunity to say a few words to you. I hope that Allaah would bless them and that He would also bless our brothers in England; who have traveled from various places in order to here these few words on the telephone, for which they will receive &#8211; with the help of Allaah &#8211; that promise which has been mentioned by the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> when he said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever treads a path to seek knowledge, then Allaah would make easy for him a path to Paradise.&#8221;</i>1 So I ask from my brothers to accept these <i>wasaayah</i> (legacies and sincere advices) which I hope would be of benefit to them:-</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>THE FIRST LEGACY</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advise you to have the <i>taqwaa</i> of Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; both in private and public. And <i>taqwaa</i> means that a person should stand firm upon the obedience of Allaah, doing what Allaah ordered him to do, and abandoning what He prohibited him from, starting with establishing the <i>Salaah</i> (Prayer) in their fixed and stated times, and in congregation, for those who are obliged to do so. Along with the five daily Prayers, you should also pray the <i>rawaatib</i> (stressed and recommended Prayers) which are connected to the five daily Prayers &#8211; and they are four <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> before the <i>Dhuhr</i> Prayer and two after it. Two <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> after the <i>Maghrib</i> Prayer. Two <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> after the <i>&#8216;Ishaa</i> Prayer. And two <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> before the <i>Fajr</i> Prayer. The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;There is no Muslim who Prays twelve optional rak&#8217;ahs from the non-obligatory Prayer every day, except that Allaah will build for him a house in Paradise.&#8221;</i>2 Likewise, you should pay the Zakaah; which is an obligatory amount taken from your wealth and given to the poor and the needy. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said to his Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Take charity from their wealth in order to purify them and to sanctify them by it.&#8221;</b> [Soorah a-Tawbah 9:103].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said to Mu&#8217;aadh ibn Jabal, when he was sending him to Yemen: <i>&#8220;And inform them that Allaah has obligated upon them to give charity from their wealth, to be taken from the rich and given to the poor.&#8221;</i>3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, one should fast in the month of Ramadaan, because Allaah has prescribed it for this Ummah, and one should make the <i>Hajj</i> (Pilgramage) and the <i>&#8216;Umrah</i> (Lesser Pilgramage) for whosoever has the ability to do so. These are the pillars of Islaam, after the first pillar which is the <i>Shahaadatain</i> (the two testimonies); to testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and to testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>THE SECOND LEGACY</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I advise my brothers that they should unify their ranks, and that they should be like a single body seeking to establish the Religion of Allaah, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allaah has prescribed for you the same Religion which He prescribed to Noah, and that which We revealed to the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, and that which We prescribed to Ibraaheem, Moses and Jesus <i>&#8216;alayhimus-salaam</i>, saying: That you should establish the Religion by doing that which you were commanded with, and that you should not make any divisions in it.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:13].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus it becomes very clear that what is required from us &#8211; as it was required from the Prophets who were foremost in resolve &#8211; is to establish the Religion and not to make any divisions therein. So our Lord &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; ordered us to establish the Religion and not to make any divisions in it. O my brothers! Unite your ranks, and do not differ, since Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And do not dispute with each other, unless you loose courage and your power departs, but be patient. For indeed Allaah is with those who are patient.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anfaal 8:46].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not label each other as being deviant, nor label each other as being sinners. If you see in any of your brothers that which is objectionable, then go to them and debate with them about this, until your word is unified, and thus cause the Ummah to remain united. None of you should try to slander his brother, since this will cause a great deal of enmity and hatred. Likewise, none of you should declare his Muslim brother to be a disbeliever, innovator or a sinner &#8211; since this is not from the nature of a Muslim.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>THE THIRD LEGACY</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also advise you &#8211; O brothers &#8211; to do those actions which will be the cause of love and affection to develop between you. Many people do not truly understand the Religion of Islaam. Indeed many people think that the Religion of Islaam includes certain bad traits &#8211; even though Islaam in reality objects to them &#8211; because some Muslims portray a false image of Islaam. Rather, the Religion of Islaam is a Religion of truthfulness, righteousness and justice. It is a Religion which calls for reconciling people. It is also a Religion which wages war against all bad actions and characteristics; such as lying, cheating, deception and transgressing upon others. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed Allaah enjoins upon you justice, kindness and the giving of good to relatives and near ones, and He prohibits you from all shameful and evil deeds, oppression and transgression. He admonishes you, in order that you may take heed and be reminded. And fulfil the Covenant of Allaah when you have made it, and do not break your oaths after you have confirmed them, and indeed you have appointed Allaah as your Guarantor. Indeed Allaah knows all what you do.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nahl 16:90-91].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O my brothers, <i>da&#8217;wah</i> (calling to Islaam) is to be done by your actions, as you are commanded to do it with your speech However, <i>da&#8217;wah</i> through actions will be more effective than <i>da&#8217;wah</i> which is merely done with speech. So I say again, that those who practice Islaam in a wrong manner, they will create a false understanding of Islaam in people&#8217;s view. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; has said about those who invite to what is correct, but do not practice themselves:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! Why do you say that which you do not do. It is most hateful to Allaah that you say that which you do not do.&#8221;</b> [Soorah as-Saff 61:2-3].</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>THE FOURTH LEGACY</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I advise you all to safeguard your time and to occupy yourselves in that which is beneficial. You should know that time is more precious than wealth, as Allaah &#8211; the Most Blessed, the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Until when death comes to him, he says: O my Lord! Give me respite so that I may then do righteous actions.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:333].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Time is such that when it departs it does not return, whereas wealth, when it departs, then it is possible to replace it. So time is of the utmost importance. This is why I advise you to safeguard your time, and to occupy yourselves in that which benefits. Keep away from <i>qeela wa qaal</i> (gossiping) &#8211; that so and so said such and such about this and that person &#8211; because the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said in an authentic narration: <i>&#8220;Indeed Allaah hates qeela wa qaal (gossip mongering), asking too many questions, and wasting one&#8217;s wealth.&#8221;</i>4 Unfortunately, many of the youths &#8211; after returning to the correct path, and uniting their hearts and unifying their word &#8211; have become disunited and fragmented into many factions, and this is due to the whisperings of Shaytaan amongst them and the disuniting of their word. So I advise the brothers to utilise your time in beneficial matters, and to keep away from <i>qeela wa qaal</i>. Indeed, time is like a sword; either you strike it, or it will strike you!</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>THE FIFTH LEGACY</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Call to Allaah with mildness, forebearance, and intending to rectify matters &#8211; not with harshness, nor intending to cause divisions. This is because Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said to His Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Call mankind to the way prescribed by your Lord, with wisdom, and admonish them with the examples and warnings that Allaah has provided in His Book, and argue with them in a way that is better.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nahl 16:125].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;By the mercy of Allaah you behaved with gentleness towards them. Had you been severe or harsh-hearted they would have left you and departed. So pass over their faults, and ask Allaah to forgive them, and consult them in the affairs.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aali-&#8216;Imraan 3:159].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, it is obligatory for the Believer to follow the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> in this, and to be mild and forebearing in calling to Allaah &#8211; the Most Blessed, the Most High &#8211; since it is authentically established from the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa aalihi wa sallam</i> that he said: <i>&#8220;Indeed Allaah is gentle and loves gentleness, and He gives due to gentleness that which He does not give due to harshness.&#8221;</i>5</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>THE SIXTH LEGACY</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Striving hard in acquiring knowledge, since that is the reason why you have left your cities and homes, and have left your family and friends. So it is upon you all to strive hard in gaining knowledge, and to study deeply &#8211; not merely to take an exam, rather it is for the knowledge itself. So strive hard in seeking knowledge. Finally, I ask Allaah that He enables us to utilise our time in a beneficial way, according to what Allaah &#8211; the Most Blessed, the Most High &#8211; has made us responsible for.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah Magazine, Issue No.6 &#8211; Dhul-Qa&#8217;dah 1417H / March 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: I am a young man, nineteen years of age, and have involved myself in a great deal of sin. Even to the extent that I do not pray most of my Prayers in the mosque, and I have never completely fasted the month of Ramadaan in my entire life. Besides these, I have committed other sins as well. I have vowed to repent many times before, however, after doing so I lapse back into these same sins. The youths of my area are just as bad, as are the friends that I associate with. And Allaah knows that I have transgressed against myself and that whenever I repent, I return back to the same sins. I hope that you may direct me to a path that will bring me closer to my Lord and distance me from these evil actions of mine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: Allaah &#8211; the Might and Majestic &#8211; says: <b>&#8220;Say O My Slaves who have transgressed against their own souls! Do not despair of Allaah&#8217;s mercy. Indeed Allaah forgives all sins, Truly He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah az-Zumar 39:53]. There is a consensus from the Scholars that this noble <i>aayah</i> (verse) was revealed for the <i>taa&#8217;ibeen</i> (those who repent). So whoever sincerely repents from his sins, then Allaah will forgive him all his sins, as occurs in the saving of Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; : <b>&#8220;O you who Believe! Turn to Allaah in sincere repentance. Perhaps your Lord may remove from you your sins and admit you into Paradise beneath which rivers flow.&#8221;</b> [Soorah at-Tahreem 66:8]. So in this <i>aayah</i> (verse), Allaah has made the removal of sins and entry into Paradise dependant upon sincere repentance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And sincere repentance is conditional upon: [i] abandoning the sin and keeping away from it, [ii] having regret and remorse for committing the sin, [iii] truly intending not to commit the sin again, [iv] remembering the greatness of Allaah and hoping for His reward, whilst fearing His punishment. Another condition for sincere repentance is that if due to transgression, the wealth or property of someone has been stolen or usurped, then it must be returned or forgiveness must be sought from the one whose wealth, blood or honour has been taken. However, if the honour of a person has been violated and the situation is such that it is not possible to seek that persons forgiveness, then plenty of <i>du&#8217;aa</i> (supplication) should be made for his welfare and he should be spoken good of in those places where he had previously been backbitten, since good deeds wipe away bad ones. Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Turn you all in repentance to Allaah, O Believers, in order that you may be successful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Noor 24:31]. So in this <i>aayah</i> (verse) Allaah the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; linked success with <i>tawbah</i> (repentance) and points to the fact that the repentant person will reach success and happiness, and if such a person were to follow up this repentance with <i>eemaan</i> (faith) and doing righteous actions, then Allaah would efface his evil actions and change them to good actions, as Allaah the Most Perfect &#8211; said after mentioning the sins of Shirk (directing worship that is due only for Allaah to other than Allaah), taking a life without just cause and fornication and adultery-: <b>&#8220;And whoever does this, will receive the punishment, The punishment will be doubled for him on the Day of Judgement and he will live therein in disgrace. Except for those who repent, have <i>eemaan</i> (faith) and do righteous actions. For them Allaah will change their evil deeds into good ones, and Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Furqaan 25:68-70]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the causes of <i>tawbah</i> (repentance) are humility and submissiveness to Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; and asking Allaah for guidance and ability, and that acceptance of one&#8217;s repentance is considered as a Favour from Allaah, as Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: &#8216;<b>&#8216;Call upon Me and I will respond to your supplication.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Ghaafir 40:60] And He &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And when My servant asks you concerning Me, say to them that I am indeed near, And I respond to the supplication of the one who supplicates to Me.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:186]. Also, from the causes of <i>tawbah</i> is choosing good companionship and friendship and following them in righteous conduct, whilst staying clear of bad companionship. It is authentically related from Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallaallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> that he said: <i>&#8220;A person is upon the way of life of his friend, so let one of you look to whom he keeps as a friend.&#8221;</i>2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <i>sallaallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam </i>also said:<i> &#8220;The example of a good companion and a bad companion is like that of a seller of musk, and the one who blows the blacksmith&#8217;s bellows. As for the seller of musk, then either he will grant you some, or at the very least you enjoy a pleasant smell from him. As for the one who blows the blacksmith&#8217;s bellows, then either he will burn your clothes or you will get an offensive smell from him.&#8221;</i>3</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">By: Shaykul Islam Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; <i>Majmoo&#8217; Fataawaa</i> (28/50-57)<br />
Source: Al-Istiqaamah<br />
Issue No.6 &#8211; Dhul-Qa&#8217;dah 1417H / March 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy. Indeed Allaah &#8211; to whom belongs all praise &#8211; has bestowed upon me immense grace, great favours and generous blessings which necessitates immense gratitude, being firm upon obedience to Him, and becoming accustomed to having beautiful patience in that which He ordered. Indeed, a servant is ordered to have <i>sabr</i> (patience) in times of ease more so than in times of hardship. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;But if we let man taste the good favours after poverty and harm has touched him, he is sure to boastfully say: Harm has departed from me. Indeed he is exultant, boastful and ungrateful to Allaah, Except those who show patience and do deeds of righteousness and obedience to Allaah, for them will be forgiveness and a great reward.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Hood 11:10-11].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you all know that Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; has blessed this affair 2 with such blessings which contain the means to aid His Religion, raise high His Word, aid His Army, and grant honour to His <i>Awliyaa</i> (pious and righteous servants). It is also the cause for strengthening <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah</i> and causing humiliation to the people of innovations and sectarianism. Likewise, it is also the cause for affirming that which has been affirmed by yourselves from the <i>Sunnah</i> (regarding the truth of this matter), and a cause for increasing this by opening up the avenues of guidance, victory and proofs: such that the truth becomes known to the people, who none but Allaah can enumerate. It is also a cause for the masses to begin to accept the way of the <i>Sunnah</i> and the <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i>; as well as countless other favours. All of this must therefore be accompanied by immense gratitude to Allaah, as well as having patience &#8211; even ii this patience is in times of ease.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you all know that from the great principles which sum up the Religion is: Uniting the hearts, unifying the word, and reconcilination between each other, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;So fear and obey Allaah, and reconcile the matters of differences between yourselves.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anfaal 8:10].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And hold fast altogether to the rope of Allaah and do not split-up.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:103].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And do not be like those who split-up and differed after the clear proofs came to them. For those there will be a severe punishment.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:105].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And other examples like this from the texts (of Revelation), which order us with the <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i> (unity upon the way of the Companions) and coming together, and prohibit splitting and differing. And the people who most exemplify this principle are <i>Ahlul-Jamaa&#8217;ah</i> (the people of the <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i>); just as the people who most exemplify leaving it are the people of sectarianism.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that which sums up the <i>Sunnah</i> is: Obedience to the Messenger. This is why the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<i> &#8220;Indeed Allaah is pleased with three things: That you worship Allaah alone without associating any partner along with Him; that you holdfast all together to the Rope of Allaah and not to become split-up; and that you give sincere advice to whomsoever Allaah put in charge of your affairs.</i><i></i><i>&#8220;</i>3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the <i>Sunan</i> collections from the <i>hadeeth</i> of Zayd ibn Thaabit and Ibn Mas&#8217;ood &#8211; who were both great <i>fuqahaa</i> (Scholars of deep understanding) &#8211; who relate that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;May Allaah enliven whosoever hears my words, memorises them and then conveys them to others. Many a carrier of knowledge does not understand it, and many a carrier of knowledge conveys it to one who has better understanding. There are three things which the heart of a Believer has no malice about: Sincerity for Allaah in one&#8217;s action; sincere advice to those in authority and clinging to the Jamaa&#8217;ah.&#8221;</i>4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying: <i>&#8220;has no malice&#8221;</i> means not having any contempt for them. So the heart of a Muslim does not hate these characteristics. On the contrary, it loves them and is pleased with them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the first thing which I shall begin with regarding this principle is what is connected to myself. So you all know &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with you all &#8211; that I do not desire any harm at all &#8211; inwardly or outwardly &#8211; for anyone from the general masses of the Muslims, let alone our colleagues and companions. Nor do I harbour any ill-feeling towards anyone of them, nor do I blame them for anything at all. Rather, to me they are deserving of nobility, love, honour and respect, over and over &#8211; each in accordance with their level. And a person cannot be except (one of three types): Someone who sincerely strives to ascertain the truth; and is correct, or one who sincerely strives to ascertain the truth; but errs, or a sinful person. As for the first, then he is rewarded and thanked. The second is rewarded for his <i>ijtihaad</i> (striving to ascertain the truth), and is forgiven and excused for his error. As for the third, then may Allaah forgive us, and him, and all the Believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we should not try to dwell upon the words of those who opposed this fundamental; by saying that so and so is deficient, or so and so did not act, or so and so was the cause of harm to the Shaykh, or was the reason why all this occurred, or so and so used to speak about the plots of so and so; and other such similar statements which contain criticism of some of our colleagues and brothers. For indeed do not allow them to harm the brothers and colleagues in this manner, and there is no might, nor any power except with Allaah.5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, the likes of this criticism actually returns to the one who said it in the first place, unless he has good deeds by which Allaah will forgive him &#8211; if He wills &#8211; and indeed Allaah does forgive that which has preceded. And you also all know about the harsh treatment that was given to some of the brothers in Damascus, and that which occurs even now in Egypt. This &#8211; in reality &#8211; is not due to a deficiency or shortcoming in the brothers, nor has it occurred because we have changed our views and hate them. Rather, such people, after receiving such harsh treatment increase in the status, love and respect that we have for them. For indeed the likes of these trials are beneficial to the Believers, because Allaah corrects and improves them due to it. Since the Believer to another Believer is like each of a pair of hands, each washes the other. However, it sometimes happens that dirt cannot be removed except with a certain amount of roughness, but that brings about cleanliness and softness, for which that roughness is praised &#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You (also) all know that much of what has occurred in this matter were lies, false accusations, false suspicions, and the following of false desires, the likes of which cannot be described. So all those lies and false accusations that were directed against me, are actually a source of goodness and blessing for me. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed those who brought forward the lie are a small group amongst you. However, do not think that it is an evil for you. rather, it is good for you. And every person amongst them will be paid the sin of what they earned. And as for the one who took on the leading role in this, his will be a severe punishment.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Noor 24:11].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So through such trials, Allaah manifests the light of truth and its clear proofs, which repel the falsehood and lies. So I do not desire to take revenge upon any of those who lied against me, or oppressed me, or showed enmity and hatred towards me. For indeed I forgive every Muslim, and I love only the good for them, and I desire for every Muslim the good that I desire for myself As for those who lied and did wrong, then I have excused and forgiven them. However, whatever is connected to violating the Rights of Allaah in this affair, then they should seek <i>tawbah</i> (repentance). So if they turn to Allaah in repentance, then Allaah will turn to them in forgiveness, otherwise the Judgement of Allaah will apply to them. So if a person were to be thanked for his evil actions, then I thank all those who were the cause for this (trial) to happen to me &#8211; for it entails all the good of this world and the Hereafter. However, Allaah is thanked for His good blessings and favours by which no affair happens to a Believer, except that there is good for him in it. And the people of good intentions are thanked for their intentions, and the people of good actions are thanked for their actions. And as for those who did evil &#8211; then we ask Allaah that He turns to them in forgiveness. And you all know that this is from my nature and character.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, you all know that Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i>, concerning the matter of <i>al-lfq</i> (the Lie against &#8216;Aaishah, his daughter, and wife of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>), about which Allaah revealed some Verses of the Qur&#8217;aan, so he swore that he would not give any more charity to Mistaah ibn Athaathah; because Mistaah was one of those who participated in the Lie. So Allaah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And let not those amongst you who have been blessed with grace and wealth swear not to give any help or support to their relatives, or to the poor and needy, or to those who migrated in the path of Allaah. Rather, let them pardon and be forgiving. Do you not love that Allaah should forgive you? And Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Noor 24:22].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when this Verse was revealed, Abu Bakr <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> said: &#8220;Rather, by Allaah! I love that Allaah should forgive me.&#8221; So he continued to give to Mistaah the aid and charity that he used to give before.6 So with forgiveness and kind treatment towards one another, and doing <i>Jihaad</i> (fighting and striving) in Allaah&#8217;s Path, then it is a must that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allaah will bring a people whom He will love, and they will love Him; soft, humble and gentle with the Believers, stern towards the unbelievers, fighting in the path of Allaah, and never afraid of the blame of the blamers. That is the Grace of Allaah which He bestows upon whosoever He Wills. And Allaah suffices for the needs of His creation, the All-Knower. Indeed your <i>Walee</i> (protector and guardian) is Allaah, His Messenger, and the Believers; those who offer the Prayer correctly, and give Zakaah, and who bow down in obedience to Allaah. And whosoever takes Allaah, and His Messenger, and the Believers as protectors and guardians, then it is the party of Allaah who will be victorious.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:53-55].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Was-salaamu &#8216;alaykum wa rahmatullaahi wa barakaatuhu.</i></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <i>Majmoo&#8217; Fataawaa</i> (28/50-57), slightly abridged.<br />
2. The affair being referred to is the first of Ibn Taymiyyah&#8217;s unjust imprisonment &#8211; a period of one and a half years, in the year 705H &#8211; which occurred due to some lies and false accusations against him.<br />
3. Related by Muslim (3/1340) and Ahmad (2/367).<br />
4. <b>Saheeh</b>: Related by Ahmad (4/80) and Ibn Maajah (no.230). It was authenticated by al-Albaanee in <i>as-Saheehah</i> (no.404).<br />
5. This is in reference to some of their colleagues and brothers in Damascus, who weakened during this ordeal, and did not remain firm upon the correct methodology. So Ibn Taymiyyah is prohibiting any of his students and collegues from harming them in any way, and makes an excuse for them, and explains that he bears no ill-feeling or hatred in his heart towards any of them. Rather, he makes it clear that he has respect for them, and loves them for the sake of Allaah.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from <i>Al-Furqaan Magazine</i> (no.61/pp.44-46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Al-Istiqaamah, Issue No.5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;All praise is for Allaah who, in every age and intervals between the Prophets, raises up a group from the People of Knowledge, who call the misguided to guidance and patiently bearing ill-treatment and harm. With the Book of Allaah they give life to the dead, and by Allaah&#8217;s Light they sight to the blind. How many a person killed by <i>Iblees</i> have they revived. How many people astray and wondering have they guided. How beautiful their effect has been upon the people, and how vile people have been towards them. They expel from the Book of Allaah the alterations of those going beyond bounds, the false claims of the liars and the false interpretations of the ignorant-ones &#8211; those who uphold the banner of innovation and who unleash <i>fitnah</i> (trial and discord), who differ about the Book oppose the Book and agree to oppose the Book. Those who speak about Allaah and His Book without knowledge, and who argue about what is ambiguous in the Book, and deceive the ignorant with such ambiguities. So we seek refuge in Allaah from the fitnahs (trials and discord) of the misguided-ones.&#8221;2 And I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone, having no partner and that Muhammad <i>sallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> is His trustworthy Slave and Messenger. And may Allaah extol and send His blessings of peace upon him, his family and his companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>FORBIDDANCE OF BEING HASTY AND IMPATIENT</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the very nature of <i>fitnah</i> (trial and discord) is that matters become confused, mistakes increase, and minds and intellects begin to swerve. Protection and safety from this &#8211; in such times &#8211; lies in the <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i>; at the head of which are the scholars. So it is obligatory upon the people &#8211; those leading and those being led &#8211; to take hold of the sayings of the Scholars and to act upon them. Since the general masses being pre-occupied with issues of <i>fitnah</i>, wherein they begin to express their own opinions, only leads to an increase in the <i>fitnah</i> and further splits the Ummah. So the <i>umoorul-&#8216;aammah</i> (affairs pertaining to public benefit and welfare) &#8211; from the matters related to peace, security and fear &#8211; should be referred back to those who possess sounds knowledge and understanding, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;When there comes to them some matter related to public welfare of security or fear, they make it known amongst the people. If they had referred it back to the Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, or to those in authority amongst them, then the proper people would have investigated and evaluated the matter from them. Were it not for the Grace and Mercy of Allaah upon you, you would have indeed followed Shaytaan &#8211; except for a few of you.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:83].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam as-Sa&#8217;dee (d.1376H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;This is the disciplinary admonition from Allaah to His Servants with regards to their unbefitting action. And that it is a must for them, that when there comes to them some news concerning important issues &#8211; such as issues connected to public welfare and safety of the Believers, or those that are related to breach of security, or fear of a calamity befalling them &#8211; that they should first verify such news and not be hasty in spreading it. Rather, they should refer such issues back to the Messenger <i>sallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, and to the people in authority; those who possess knowledge, understanding, sound advice, intellect, maturity and composure; those who understand the affairs and have knowledge of the associated benefits and harms. If they see that in broadcasting it there is a benefit and a cause of happiness for the Believers, and a means of protection from their enemies, then they should do so. This is why Allaah said:<b> &#8220;Then the proper people would have investigated and evaluated the matter from them.&#8221;</b> Meaning: That they would evaluate it with their sound understanding and their firm and correct knowledge. So in this is an evidence for an important principle which is: If there arises a need to investigate a particular issue, then it is obligatory that it is left to those who are qualified for it, and no one should precede them in this &#8211; and this is close to what is correct, and safer from error. And in this is also a prohibition of being hasty and impatient in spreading the news as soon as they hear it. Likewise there is a command to reflect and consider before speaking, so he looks into it to see if there is a benefit in doing so, if so he embarks upon it, and if not, he abstains from it.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE SCHOLARS AND THE AFFAIRS OF THE UMMAH</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the issues of <i>fitnah</i> and other detailed issues, and issues connected to matters of public welfare of the Ummah &#8211; such as affairs related to <i>siyaasatush-shar&#8217;iyyah</i> (politics of the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i>), and the wide-spread evils, and their like &#8211; people are in need of having sound knowledge and understanding of the <i>maslahah</i> and <i>mafsadah</i> (related benefits and harms). Since these issues, most of the time, are the cause for <i>fitnahs</i> to occur, and they are not like the issues related to purification, Prayer, Hajj and their like; which it is possible for a young student of knowledge &#8211; or in some cases, even the layman &#8211; to speak about, and to prefer one saying over another. And this is because: &#8220;Understanding the objectives and goals of the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Islaamic Law) is not possible, except by thoroughly studying the texts and studying the detailed workings of the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i>. Since <i>fiqhul-maqaasid</i> (the science of understanding the objectives and goals of the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i>) is indeed a great and mighty science which cannot be gained by just anyone. Rather, it can only be gained by one who has reached a high level of knowledge, has examined the state of affairs and is well acquainted with them, and who has looked into the various possible outcomes that may occur. And weighing between the benefits and harms is dependant upon understanding the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> and its objectives, and having understanding of the state of affairs, and the various degrees of benefits and harms. So none of this is possible, except for the Scholars.&#8221;4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam an-Nawawee (d.676H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The one ordering the good or forbidding the evil must be knowledgeable about what is being ordered or prohibited. And the level of knowledge required for this will vary in accordance with what is being ordered or prohibited. This, if it is an issue concerning clear-cut obligations and well known prohibitions &#8211; such as Prayer, Fasting, fornication or drinking intoxicants &#8211; then every Muslim is a scholar with regards to such issues. <b>However, if the issue involves detailed matters, or matters connected to <i>ijtihaad</i> (the Science of extracting rulings from the Revelation), then the general body of Muslims cannot enter into it, nor is it for them to order or prohibit. Rather, this is only for the Scholars.</b>&#8220;5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the subjects that we have mentioned (i.e. that which is related to affairs of public benefit and interest of the Ummah; such as matters connected to <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> politics, weighing the affairs, correcting the widespread evil, <i>takfeer</i> (declaring Muslims to be unbelievers) and rebelling against the rulers) are from the most important subjects which have touched the Islaamic awakening in these days, and about which there is plenty of discussion, controversy and argumentation between those Muslim youths who are form in clinging to the Religion and who earnestly desire good. So these subjects are of an extremely important nature, and likewise, deviating from the correct path with regards to them is extremely dangerous!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this, I wanted to gather some of the statements from our noble contemporary scholars on this subject &#8211; may Allaah protect them and look after them, and continue making them of benefit to the Ummah for the remainder of their time &#8211; those who are the Scholars of the Religion and the inheritors of the Prophets, those who concentrated on understanding the formulating principles regarding the <i>halaal</i> (lawful) and the <i>haraam</i> (prohibited). Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said: &#8220;And whosoever from this Ummah, is known for having truthfulness, whereby he has been praised and commended by the majority of the various groups of people from this Ummah, then those are the leaders of guidance and the beacons in the darkness.&#8221;6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they are the Rabbaanee Scholars;7 those who teach the people the Book and the wisdom, and who cultivate the people upon it. And they are the people of deep understanding and wisdom, whom Allaah commanded us to ask, by His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Ask the People of Knowledge if you do not know.&#8221; </b>[Soorah al-Anbiyaa 21:30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So returning to them, being around them, and asking them, is the way out from the fitnahs &#8211; as we have previously explained &#8211; especially when there are a great number of differences and a great number of people differing, and many differing paths ahead of the traveller.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>CLINGING TO THE JAMAA&#8217;AH</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Scholars are the leaders of the Jamaa&#8217;ah that we have been commanded to cling to; and which we have been warned against separating from &#8211; as occurs in the hadeeth of &#8216;Abdullaah ibn Mas&#8217;ood <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> who related that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;The blood of a Muslim who testifies that none has the right to be worshipped, except Allaah; and that I am the Messenger of Allaah, is not lawful, except in one of three cases: the one who commits adultery, a life for a life, or the one who abandons his Religion and splits from the Jamaa&#8217;ah.&#8221;</i>8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar ibn al-Khattab <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> relates that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Cling to the Jamaa&#8217;ah and beware of splitting! For indeed Shaytaan is with the individual person but is further away from the two people. And whosoever desires the centre of Paradise, then let him cling to the Jamaa&#8217;ah. And whosoever is pleased by his good deeds and saddened by his bad deeds, then he is a Believer.&#8221;</i>9</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, whosoever clings to the <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i> &#8211; not separating from it &#8211; will be the successful one. But whosoever splits from the <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i> and is amazed with his own opinion and knowledge, and the large number who follow him &#8211; then he is one who is destroyed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Abu Bakr al-Aajurree (d.360H), after recording various Aayat (verses) and ahadeeth that order clinging to the Jamaa&#8217;ah, then said: &#8220;The sign for whosoever Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; intends goodness for, is that he traverses this path: Clinging to the Book of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, to the Sunnah of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, </i>and to the path of his Companions <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhum</i>; and all those who followed them in correctness and goodness, may Allaah have mercy upon them all; and also to what the Scholars of the Muslims were upon in the various lands &#8211; such as al-Awzaa&#8217;ee (d.157H), Sufyan ath-Thawree (d.164H), Maalik ibn Anas (d.179H), ash-Shafi&#8217;ee (d.204H), Ahmad ibn Hanbal (d.241H), al-Qaasim ibn Salaam (d.235H), and all those who were upon a path similar to theirs, avoiding taking any path which those scholars did not take.&#8221;10</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Source: Tazkiyatun-Nufoos</i> (pp.103-107) of Shaykh Ahmad Fareed</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>RAJAA (HOPE) IN ALLAAH</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hope: it is the peaceful state of the heart which awaits what is dear to it. If the means &#8211; by which what the heart hopes for may come &#8211; are not present, then stupidity and foolishness would be a more accurate name for such a state. Similarly, if there is no doubt that what is being hoped for will definitely occur, then likewise, this state cannot be referred to as hope. For example, it would not be correct to say: I hope that the sun rises today. However, it would be correct to say: I hope that it rains today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Scholars who have studied matters pertaining to the heart have said: that this world is like land that is cultivated for its fruits in the Hereafter; and that the heart is like the earth; and that <i>eemaan</i>(faith) is like the seeds; and that acts of obedience are like ploughing and preparing the soil for planting, and digging channels in order to irrigate and bring water to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The heart which is in love with this world is like barren land, from which seeds cannot sprout. The Day of Judgement is like the day of harvest &#8211; and each person reaps what he sows. And no seed can sprout, except the seeds of <i>eemaan</i>, and <i>eemaan</i> very seldom benefits if the heart is corrupt and has bad qualities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>BETWEEN HOPE AND DELUSION</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The example of a servants hope in Allaah&#8217;s mercy and forgiveness can be likened to the hope of a farmer: If the farmer searches for fertile soil, then sows it with good and healthy seeds, giving to the seeds what they need at the appropriate time, removing from around them the weeds and anything else that may hinder or ruin their growth, then he sits and waits for the Favour of Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; with regards to Him keeping away violent storms and other harmful elements, until the seeds have fully ripened and grown &#8211; then this type of waiting and expectation can truly be described as hope. However, if the farmer sows the seeds in hard and barren soil, too high up for water to reach it, and he does nothing to care and protect the seed from harm, and then he sits and waits for a good harvest &#8211; then this waiting and expectation is not called hope, rather, such waiting is called foolishness and delusion!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the term hope only applies to waiting for what is dear or desired, after all the means &#8211; that will assist in realising this desire and are within the ability of the person &#8211; have been utilised. As for that which is not within the servants ability, then it is left to the favour of Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; and He is the One who can prevent harmful matters, if He so wishes. So if the servant sows the seeds of <i>eemaan</i>, and waters them with acts of obedience to Allaah, and cleanses his heart from harmful qualities and traits, then waits for the favour of Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; with regards being granted firmness upon this until death and an excellent end leading to His forgiveness &#8211; then such a wait can truly be called hope. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>&#8220;Indeed those who believe and those who migrate and who make <i>jihaad</i> in the path of Allaah, they are the ones who have the hope of Allaah&#8217;s mercy. And indeed Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most-Merciful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:218].</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of this being that such people are truly worthy of hoping in Allaah&#8217;s mercy. And He did not intend only to particularise them with this, since others also can hope in Allaah&#8217;s mercy. However, He particularised them as being those who truly deserve to hope. So the one whose hope in Allaah&#8217;s mercy guides him to obedience and deters him from disobedience, his hope is true. And the one whose hope invites him to being immersed in sin and disobedience, is in delusion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also necessary to know that truly hoping in something necessitates three things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Firstly</i>: Yearning for what one hopes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Secondly</i>: Fearing to miss gaining it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Thirdly</i>: Striving to achieve it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If hope is not connected with any one of these matters, then it is mere wishful thinking, since hope is one thing, and wishful thinking something else. And every person who is hopeful, is also fearful, and whosoever traverses a path, makes haste when he fears that he may miss what he hopes for.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> relates that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever fears being plunderered by the enemy, sets out in the early part of the night, and whosoever sets out early reaches the destination. Indeed the treasures of Allaah are precious. Indeed the treasures of Allaah is Paradise.&#8221;</i> 2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects, the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>&#8220;Say: O My servants who have wronged their souls due to sin. Do not despair in Allaah&#8217;s mercy, for indeed Allaah forgives all sins. Indeed He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah az-Zumar 39:53].</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>&#8220;Indeed your Lord is full of forgiveness for mankind, inspite of their wrong-doing.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ar-Ra&#8217;d 13:6].</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar ibn al-Khattaab <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> relates that some prisoners were brought before Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and amongst them was a woman who was frantically searching for someone in the crowd. When she found a baby amongst the prisoners, she took it in her arms, cradled it next to her chest and suckled it. So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Do you think that this woman would ever throw her child into the Fire?&#8221;</i> We said: By Allaah ! Never! So he said: <i>&#8220;Allaah is more merciful to His believing servants than that mother could ever be to her child.&#8221;</i>3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> relates that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Indeed before Allaah created the creation, He decreed for Himself &#8216;Indeed My mercy prevails over My anger.'&#8221;</i>4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas <i>radiallanhu &#8216;anhu</i> relates that he heard Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> say: <i>&#8220;Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said O son of Aadam! As long as you call upon Me and hope in Me, I shall forgive you for what you have done and I shall not mind. O son of Aadam! If your sins were to reach the clouds of the sky and you were then to ask forgiveness of Me, I would forgive you. O son of Aadam! Were you to come to Me with sins nearly as great as the earth, and were you then to meet Me without committing any shirk (i.e. calling upon someone else, or worshipping someone else) along with Me, I would bring you forgiveness as great as it.&#8221;</i>5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahyaa ibn Mu&#8217;aadh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;In my view, the worst kind of self-delusion is to greatly sin, yet hope for forgiveness without feeling any regret; and to hope to draw close to Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; without obedience to Him; and to await the fruits of Paradise, by planting the seeds for Hell-Fire; and to seek the abode of the obedient ones, by doing acts of disobedience; and to expect a reward, without doing any worthy action; and to hope in Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; after overstepping the bounds.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><i>&#8220;You hope for salvation but do not tread its path.<br />
A ship never sails upon dry land.&#8221;</i>6</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Al-Istiqaamah Magazine, Issue No.2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed those who say: Our Lord is Allaah, and then do <i>istiqaamah</i> (be upright and obedient) upon them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. Those will be the companions of Paradise, to dwell therein forever &#8211; a reward for what they used to do.&#8221; </b>[Soorah Ahqaaf 46:13].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Abu &#8216;Umar Sufyan ibn &#8216;Abdullaah <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i>, who said: O Messenger of Allaah <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>! Tell me something about Islaam which I can ask of no one but you? So he said: <i>&#8220;Say: My Lord is Allaah and then do istiqaamah (be upright).&#8221;</i> Abu &#8216;Umar then asked him: O Messenger of Allaah! What do you fear that is the most harmful to me? So he took hold of his tongue and said: <i>&#8220;Control this.&#8221;</i> 1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> said, whilst explaining the meaning of the <i>aayah</i> (verse): <b>&#8220;thereafter do <i>istiqaamah</i>&#8220;</b> said: &#8220;Not associating any partners in the worship of Allaah.&#8221; And he said: &#8220;Not turning to other than Him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul-&#8216;Aaliyah (d.90H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;To make the religion and one&#8217;s actions pure and sincere for Allaah alone.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qataadah (d.104H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;To stand firm upon obedience to Allaah.&#8221; 2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Rajab (d.795H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said: 3<br />
&#8220;The foundation of <i>istiqaamah</i> is: firmness of the heart upon <i>tawheed</i> (i.e. firmness in worshipping Allaah alone, not worshipping others along with Him) &#8211; as Abu Bakr and others have explained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus when the heart is firm and upright upon the <i>ma&#8217;rifah</i> (realisation and knowledge) of Allaah, and upon fear, veneration and awe of Him, and upon love, desire and hope in Him, calling upon Him, and repenting and turning away from everything besides Him &#8211; then the limbs will all follow in obedience to Him. This is because the heart is the king of the limbs and they are its army. So if the king is upright, then his army and subjects will be upright.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, after the heart, the greatest of the body-parts which takes care of one&#8217;s <i>istiqaamah</i> is the tongue &#8211; since the tongue is the translator of the heart and is its interpreter (i.e. the tongue is like a ladle which scoops-out what is in the heart). This is why, when the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> ordered Abu &#8216;Umar with <i>istiqaamah</i>, he then ordered him to safeguard his tongue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam also said:<br />
&#8220;The <i>eemaan</i> (faith) of a person will not be upon <i>istiqaamah</i> (firmness and obedience to Allaah), until his heart is upon <i>istiqaamah</i>. And his heart will not be upon <i>istiqaamah</i>, until his tongue is upon <i>istiqaamah</i>.&#8221; 4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<br />
&#8220;When the son of Aadam wakes up in the morning, then all of the body-parts humble themselves to the tongue, saying: Fear Allaah with regards to us, for we are dependant upon you. If you have <i>istiqaamah</i>, then we have istiqaamah, and if you swerve, then we also swerve.&#8221; 5&#8243;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from Bahjatul-Quloobul-Abraar (pp. 156-158)]Source: Al Istiqamah Magazine, Issue No.7 &#8211; Rabî&#8217; ul-Awwal 1418H / July 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Mas&#8217;ood <i>radi-Allaahu &#8216;anhu</i> who related that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sal-Allaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;<strong>Whoever has an atoms worth of kibr (pride) in his heart will not enter </strong></i><strong><i>Paradise</i></strong><i>.&#8221;</i> So a man said: What about a person who loves (i.e. takes pride in) wearing beautiful clothes and beautiful shoes? So he replied: <i>&#8220;Indeed Allaah is beautiful and loves beauty. Kibr (pride) is to reject the truth, and to despise the people.&#8221;</i> 1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; informs us that the Hellfire is the abode of those who have <i>kibr</i> (pride and arrogance). And we learn from the (above) <i>hadeeth</i> that: <i>&#8220;Whoever has on atoms worth of kibr (pride) in his heart will not enter </i><i>Paradise</i><i>.&#8221;</i> So this is a proof that <i>kibr</i> (pride) necessitates entry into the Hellfire and prevents entry into Paradise. And this comprehensive explanation that the Prophet <i>sal-Allaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam</i> mentioned has clarified the meaning of <i>kibr</i> (pride) in the dearest possible manner. So he divided <i>kibr</i> into two types:-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[1] Pride against the truth:</b> This is to reject the truth and not to accept it. So anyone who reject the truth is proud and arrogant &#8211; in accordance with what he reject of the truth. So it is obligatory upon everyone to humble themselves to the truth which Allaah sent His Messenger with, and which He sent down in His Book. As for those whose pride and arrogance prevents them from totally complying with the Messengers (i.e. having <i>eemaan</i> or faith in them and their message) &#8211; then they are <i>kuffaar</i> (unbelievers) who will dwell in the Hellfire for eternity. Since when the truth comes to them via the Messengers, who explain to them the signs and clear proofs, they reject it and are prevented from accepting it, due to the <i>kibr</i> that they harbour in their hearts. Allaah the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed those who argue about the Signs of Allaah without any authority having come to them, there is nothing in their hearts except <i>kibr</i> (pride). They will never accept the Prophet Muhammad <i>sal-Allaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam</i> as a Prophet.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Ghaafir (40):56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those whose arrogance and pride prevent them from complying with parts of the truth &#8211; because it opposes their personal opinions or their whims and desires &#8211; then such people are not <i>kuffaar</i> (unbelievers), but such an action necessitates them being punished in accordance with what they have of <i>kibr</i>. This is why the Scholars are agreed that whenever the Sunnah (guidance and way) of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sal-Allaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam</i> has been explained to anyone, then it is not lawful for him to turn away from it to the saying of someone else, whoever and whatever status he may have. So it is obligatory upon the seeker of knowledge to give complete and absolute precedence to the saying of Allaah and the saying of His Messenger <i>sal-Allaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam</i> over and above the saying of anyone else, and that he should make that the basis to which he returns, and the foundation upon which he builds; following the guidance of the Prophet <i>sal-Allaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam</i>, striving hard to understand what is intended from it, and following this, both inwardly and outwardly. When a person conforms to this great principle, then he has indeed reached goodness and excellence, and all his errors will be forgiven to him; since his overall objective is to follow that which has been prescribed upon him. So his errors are excused due to his striving his best to recognise and comply with the truth &#8211; and this is humbling oneself to the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[2] Pride towards people:</b> This type is to despise the people, and to look down upon them. This attitude arises when a person is amazed with his own self, thinks highly of himself, and thinks he is better than others. So this causes him to have <i>kibr</i> towards the creation, despise them, mock them, and to degrade them through both speech and action. Allaah&#8217;s Messenger<i> sal-Allaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;It is enough evil for a person to despise his brother Muslim.&#8221;</i> 2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the man asked: &#8220;What about a person who loves (i.e. takes pride in) wearing beautiful clothes and shoes?&#8221; Because he feared that this was the <i>kibr</i> which would be under the threat of punishment. So the Prophet <i>sal-Allaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam</i> explained to him that this was not from <i>kibr</i>; since this person was one who complied with the truth, and was humble towards people, and that this was from the beauty that Allaah loves, for indeed Allaah &#8211; the Most High is beautiful in His <i>Dhaat</i> (Self), <i>Sifaat</i> (Attributes) and <i>Af&#8217;aal</i> (Actions), and He loves both outer and inner beauty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards outer beauty, then it includes cleanliness of the body, clothes and place. As regards to inner beauty, then it is beautifying the character. This is why the Prophet sal-Allaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam used to supplicate:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;O Allaah! Guide me to having beautiful manners and characteristics, no one can guide me to beautifying them except You. And turn away from me all evil actions and characteristics, no one con turn them away from me except You.&#8221;</i> 3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From Al-Istiqaamah Magazine , Issue No.7 , Rabee&#8217; ul-Awwal 1418H / July 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal. Repel evil with that which is better; then indeed, he between whom and you there was enmity, will become as though he was a close friend.&#8221; </b>[Soorah Fussilat 41:34].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam as-Sa&#8217;dee (d. 1376H)- <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Not equal are acts of goodness and obedience, which are done to earn the pleasure of Allaah; and acts of evil and disobedience, that bring about the anger of Allaah, and not His good pleasure. Likewise. not equal are those acts of goodness and kindness that are done towards the creation, and those acts of evil done against them &#8211; neither in their nature, their characteristics, nor in their rewards: <b>&#8220;Is not the reward for good acts, goodness.&#8221;</b> Then, a particular, but important act of <i>ihsaan</i> (goodness and kindness) is commanded, which is: showing <i>ihsaan</i> towards the one who has ill-treated you; because Allaah commanded to repel evil with that which is better. This means that whenever you are ill-treated by anyone from amongst the creation &#8211; in particular those that have great rights over you; such as relatives, friends, and their like &#8211; then return their ill-treatment of you with acts of kindness and goodness towards them. Thus, if you have been cut-off from then seek to join the ties of relation; if you have been oppressed, then be forgiving; if you have been spoken ill of, either in your presence or behind your back, then do not retaliate, but rather be forgiving and speak to them with mild and soft words; if you have been boycotted and abandoned, then continue speaking to those who have done so, with good words, and continue giving them the greetings of <i>salaam</i>. So if you return acts of evil with acts of <i>ihsaan</i> (goodness and kindness), then you will indeed acquire a tremendous benefit.&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consider also, the following incident.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Aaishah <i>radiallaahu&#8217;anhaa</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>: O Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, has there ever been a day more severe upon you than the day of Uhud? So he said: <i>&#8220;Your tribe troubled me</i> <i>greatly, and the most troublesome thing which I experienced from them was on the day of &#8216;Aqabah when I presented myself to Ibn &#8216;Abd Yaaleel ibn &#8216;Abd Kulaal, and he did not respond to my Message as I had hoped. So I returned overwhelmed with grief and sorrow, and did not recover until I reached Qarnuth-Tha&#8217;aalib. I raised my head and saw a cloud shading me. Then I looked and saw (the Angel) Jibreel in it, and he called me saying. Allaah has heard what your people have said to you, and their reply. And Allaah has sent the Angel of the mountains to you to do whatever you wish. So the Angel of the mountains called me, greeted me with Salaam; and then said. O Muhammad. Allaah has heard what your people said to you, and I am the Angel of the mountains. My Lord has sent me to you, that you may order me as you wish. So what do you wish? If you should so wish, I will crush them beneath the two mountains.&#8221;</i> So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;No, rather hope that from their offspring will come who will worship Allaah alone, and not worship anything else along with Him.&#8221;</i>2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abee Haatim (d.328H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I entered Damascus and came upon the students of <i>hadeeth</i>, and I passed by the circle of Qaasim al-Joo&#8217;ee (d.248H). I found a group sitting around him and he was speaking. Their appearance amazed me; and I heard him saying: &#8220;Seize the benefit of five things from the people of your time: when you are present, you are not known; when you are absent, you are not missed; when you are seen, your advice is not sought; when you say something, your saying is not accepted; and when you have some knowledge, you are not given anything for it. I also advise you with five matters: when you are treated unjustly, do not behave unjustly; when you are praised, do not become happy; when you are criticised, do not become upset; when you are not believed, do not become angry; and if people act deceitfully towards you, do not act deceitfully towards them.&#8221; Ibn Abee Haatim said: So I took that as my benefit from Damascus.&#8221;3</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <i>Tazkiyatun-Nufoos</i> (pp.7-10)<br />
<strong>Al-Istiqaamah</strong> Magazine , Issue No.4 &#8211; Jumâdal-Awwal 1417H / November 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>Ikhlaas</i> (purity and sincerity of intentions)</b>: It is the stripping (i.e. the purifying) of one&#8217;s intentions in order to draw closer to Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; in all matters. It is also said that <i>ikhlaas</i> is intending to single out Allaah alone with acts of obedience. It has also been said that <i>ikhlaas</i> is to forget about the creation by constantly looking towards the Creator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <i>ikhlaas</i> (sincerity) is a condition for Allaah to accept those righteous actions that are done in accordance with the Sunnah (guidance) of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. So Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; commanded us with His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And they have not been commanded except to worship Allaah alone, having <i>ikhlaas</i> (purity of intention) in their Religion and not setting-up partners with Allaah in the worship of Him.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Bayyinah 38:5].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Umaamah <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> relates:<br />
Once a man came to Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa<br />
sallam</i> and said: What do you think about a person who joins us in the fighting only to seek fame and wealth? So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alalvhi wa sallam</i> replied:<i> &#8220;He receives nothing!&#8221; </i>The man repeated the question three times, each time Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;He recieves nothing!&#8221;</i> Then he said: <i>&#8220;Indeed Allaah does not accept an action except if it is done with ikhlaas (i.e. purely for Allaah&#8217;s sake), seeking nothing but His Face.&#8221;</i>2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zayd ibn Thaabit <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> relates:<br />
The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;May Allaah brighten whosoever hears my words, memorises them and then conveys them to others. Many a carrier of knowledge does not understand it, and many a carrier of knowledge conveys it to one who has better understanding. There are three things which the heart of a Believer has no malice about: Ikhlaas for Allaah in one&#8217;s action; sincere advice to the Muslim leaders; and clinging to the Jamaa&#8217;ah.&#8221;</i>3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of the above being that these three matters strengthen the heart. And that whosoever adopts them, then his heart will be purified from deceit, corruption and evil. And no servant can be free from Shaytaan except by having <i>ikhlaas</i>, as Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic -said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Except those of Your servants who have <i>ikhlaas</i>.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Saad 38:83].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been related from one of the pious people that he said: &#8220;O my soul! Have <i>ikhlaas</i> and then you will be purified.&#8221; Thus, whenever any share of this world &#8211; in which the soul takes comfort and the heart inclines towards, either greatly or slightly &#8211; enters into our actions, then it marrs the purity and ruins the <i>ikhlaas</i>. For man becomes preoccupied with his portion of the world and becomes immersed in his desires; and very seldom are his action, or acts of worship, free from temporary objectives or desires of this kind. That is why it has been said: &#8220;Whosoever secures in his lifetime even a single moment of <i>ikhlaas</i>, seeking the Face of Allaah, he will be saved.&#8221; This is because <i>ikhlaas</i> is something very precious, and cleansing the heart from impurities is something difficult.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <i>ikhlaas</i> is: Cleansing the heart from all impurities &#8211; whether large or small &#8211; such that the intention of drawing closer to Allaah is stripped of all other motives, except that. And this matter cannot be imagined, except from someone who truly loves Allaah; and who is so absorbed in thinking about the <i>Aakhirah</i> (Hereafter), that there remains no place in his heat for the love of this world to settle. The likes of such a person &#8211; even when he is eating, drinking or answering the call of nature &#8211; has <i>ikhlaas</i> in his actions and has correct intentions. However, whosoever is not like this, then the doors of <i>ikhlaas</i> will be closed to him &#8211; except in rare exceptions. Likewise, whosoever is overwhelmed with the love of Allaah and the love of the Hereafter, then the actions that he does will all be characterised with this <i>ikhlaas</i>. However, if the person&#8217;s soul is overwhelmed with this <i>dunyaa</i> (world), then the actions that he does will be characterised with this love, such that no act of worship &#8211; whether it be Pasting or Praying, or other than these &#8211; will be accepted from him, except in a few cases.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The cure for loving this world is to break these worldly desires that the soul has, curing-off the greed it has for this world and purifying it for the Hereafter. This will then become the overwhelming trait of the heart and with this state achieving <i>ikhlaas</i> will become much easier. For how many actions there are that a person does, thinking that they are done with true <i>ikhlaas</i> (sincerity), seeking only the Face of Allaah, but he is deluded, for he does not see the defects in them!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus it has been related about someone that he used to always pray in the first row of the mosque. One day he was delayed in coming to the Prayer, so he had to pray in the second row. Feeling embarrassed at praying in the second row, the man realised that the satisfaction and pleasure of the heart that he gained from praying in the first row was due to him seeing that the people used to admire him for it. This is a very fine and subtle point and actions are seldom safe from it. Indeed, very few are there who realise such subtleties &#8211; apart from those upon whom Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; has blessed and helped. Rather, those who are negligent of such matters will see their good deeds appearing as evil ones on the Day of Resurrection, and they are the ones who are referred to in Allaah &#8211; the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; sayings:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And there will become clear to them that which they were not expecting. For the evil of their deeds will become apparent to them.&#8221;</b> [Soorah az-Zumr 39:47-48].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Say: Shall We inform you about those who will lose most in respect to their actions? Those whose efforts have been wasted in the life of this world, whilst they thought that they were doing good actions.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al- Kahf 18:103-104].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Some Sayings Concerning Ikhlaas</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ya&#8217;qoob- <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;A <i>mukhlis</i> (one who truly has <i>ikhlaas</i>) is someone who conceals his good actions, as he conceals his bad ones.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Soosee &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> -said:<br />
&#8220;True <i>ikhlaas</i> is not to see your <i>ikhlaas</i>. Indeed, whosoever identifies <i>ikhlaas</i> in his <i>ikhlaas</i>, then he is in need of having <i>ikhlaas</i> in his <i>ikhlaas</i>!&#8221; And what this indicates is to purify one&#8217;s actions from being amazed with oneself. Since whosoever considers his <i>ikhlaas</i>, being amazed with it, has fallen into great danger. For <i>ikhlaas</i> is to be pure and free from such dangers of being amazed with one&#8217;s own actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ayyoob &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> -said:<br />
&#8220;Having <i>Ikhlaas</i> (sincerity for Allaah) in the intentions for any action, is much more harder than performing the action itself.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the Salaf (Pious Predecessors) said:<br />
To have true <i>ikhlaas</i> even for a short time, is to be saved. However, <i>ikhlaas</i> is very rare.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Suhayl &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; was asked: What is the thing most difficult for the <i>nafs</i> (soul)? He replied: &#8220;To have <i>ikhlaas</i>, especially when the soul is not disposed towards it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Fudayl ibn &#8216;Iyyaad &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;Abandoning action for the sake of people, is to seek their admiration. To do an action for the sake of people is to commit Shirk (to associate in the worship of Allaah, others along with Allaah). Indeed ikhlaas is when Allaah saves you from both of these states.&#8221;</p>

<a title="# The Great Enslavement : By Shaykh Sulaymaan as-Sulaymee" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2014/01/17/great-enslavement/">The Great Enslavement</a> by Shaykh Sulaymân as-Sulaymî<br />
Source: <a title="Al-Istiqaamah Magazine" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/al-istiqaamah/" target="_blank">Al-Istiqaamah</a>, Issue No.7</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Someone may ask: What is the proof that some people become slaves to money, or other similar things, and worship it? The proof is in the saying of the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam where he said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Woe be to the &#8216;abd (slave and worshipper) of the dirham, woe be to the &#8216;abd of the deenaar (dirham ond deenaar: equivilant to the Pound and the pence) &#8230;</span>&#8220;[3] Someone may ask: How does this enslavement to money manifest itself, and what is its nature! It is when the heart becomes so in love with money, that it covers up, or suppresses the love for Allaah, This love can reach such an extent that a person desires to attain this wealth by any means possible &#8211; neither caring whether the wealth comes to him through halaal (lawful) means; in obedience to Allaah and His Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, or means that are haraam (unlawful and forbidden) in the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So understand by reflection, that every single heart in all created things has feelings, desires and inclinations. It has the desire to love, to gain good and beneficial things for itself, it can feel fear and terror, and it can also surrender and become submissive. Thus, when its feelings, desires and inclinations are all directed to and for Allaah, then it is a heart that truly worships, submits and surrenders to Allaah alone. Therefore, it has khawf (fear) of only Allaah; it has rajaa (hope) in Allaah&#8217;s Mercy; it has mahabbah (love) for Allaah and whatever Allaah loves; and it has istislaam (submits and surrenders) to only Allaah. However, when these feelings, desires and inclinations are directed to other than Allaah, then it is a heart that is enslaved and worships that object which has captured and enslaved it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The forbiddance of the heart submitting to other than Allaah should not be misunderstood to mean that Muslims must forsake the world and dealing with it. Rather, the true position of a Muslim is that which was with the Sahaabah (Companions) radiallaahu &#8216;anhum. They held the wealth in their hands, yet none of it was in their hearts. [About this, Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The position of wealth should be regarded like that of the toilet, in that there is need for it, but it has no place in the heart, and it is resorted to when needed.&#8221;</span>[4] The point being made is that we are not trying to call the people to the opinion of some of the Soofees, who believe that it is forbidden for a Muslim to possess wealth and take part in worldly transactions. Rather, it is obligatory for the Muslims to be the richest of people so that they may use this wealth as a means to worship Allaah &#8211; the One free from all imperfections &#8211; and to help people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another form of submitting and being enslaved to other than Allaah is when people submit and enslave their hearts to power and leadership. They are prepared for humiliation to take hold of them, and to abandon their scruples, in order to gain votes during elections; or other such similar situations. They are prepared to submit themselves to people &#8211; doing whatever is necessary for them to do &#8211; in order to win other people&#8217;s favour, and thus gain that vote or position. Thus, this is another form of submitting and enslaving one&#8217;s heart to other than Allaah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Al-Wahshiyyi ibn Harb radiallaahu &#8216;anhu related that some of the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<p>O Messenger of Allaah! We eat, but do not become satisfied.</p>
<p>So he said to them: &#8220;Perhaps you eat separately?&#8221;</p>
<p>So they replied: Yes.</p>
<p>So he said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Eat your food collectively, mention the Name of Allaah upon it, then there will be blessings for you in it</span>.&#8221;[1]</p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Ibn al-&#8216;Uthaymeen</strong> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">This indicates that it is essential to eat collectively from a single plate. So if there are five or ten people, they should eat collectively from a single dish, depending upon the situation. Indeed, doing so is a cause for barakah (blessings) to descend, whilst eating separately is a cause for barakah to depart</span>.&#8221;[2]</p>

When their number increased, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) sat down on his knees and rested on the soles of his feet. A bedouin said to him: &#8220;What sort of sitting is that?&#8221; Thereupon Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;Verily, Allah has made me a courteous slave not a fierce tyrant.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;Eat from the sides of the bowl and leave the central part of it so that your food will be blessed.&#8221; [Abu Dawud].</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah &#8211; <em>the Mighty and Majestic</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="quran">&#8220;It is He who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth, that He may make it prevail over all other religions, no matter how much the disbelievers detest it.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 61:9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are given the good tidings in this verse that the future is for Islam, which gain dominance, ascendancy and rule over all other religions. Some people may think that this was fulfilled in the time of the Prophet <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> and the Rightly-Guided <em>Khulafah</em> and the righteous kings &#8211; but that is not the case. Rather, only a part of this true promise was fulfilled then &#8211; as the Prophet<em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> indicated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="hadith">&#8220;Night and day will pass away until Al-Lat and Al-&#8216;Uzza are worshipped.&#8221;</span> So &#8216;Aishah &#8211; <em>radhiallahu &#8216;anha</em> &#8211; said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! I thought that when Allah sent down: <span class="quran">&#8216;It is He who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth, that He may make it prevail over all the other religions, no matter how much the disbelievers detest it,&#8217;</span> that it would be complete. He <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>said, <span class="hadith">&#8220;There will be of that what Allah wishes.&#8221;</span> [Related by Muslim (8/182) and also Abu Ya&#8217;la in his <em>Musnad </em>(Q. 216/2)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[In this <em>hadith</em> is a clarification that the prevalence and ascendancy mentioned in this <em>ayah</em> has not yet happened &#8211; its establishment is yet to be fully realised. There is no doubt that this ascendancy and prevalence continued after the death of the Prophet <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, in the age Rightly­-Guided <em>Khulafah</em> and after them. And it not be completed until Islam is established over the whole of this earth &#8211; and this is realisation is certain.]<span id="qtip0" class="toggle">1</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are other <em>ahadith</em> which show how far Islam will reach and dominate and how far it spread, such that there is no doubt that the future is for Islam, by the permission and favour of Allah. So I quote what I am able to these <em>ahadith</em> and hopefully they will strengthen the determination of the workers for Islam; and be a proof against those who are indifferent and those who have despaired!</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Firstly</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="hadith">&#8220;Indeed Allah gathered up the earth for me so that I saw its east and its west; and indeed the dominion of my Ummah will reach what was what was gathered up for me from it.&#8221;</span> [Related by Muslim (8/171), Abu Dawud (no. 4252) and others, from Thawban <em>radhiallahu &#8216;anhu</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And even clearer than it and more general is the [next] <em>hadith</em>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Secondly</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="hadith">&#8220;This affair will reach what is reached by the night and the day; and Allah will not leave a dwelling of brick, nor fur, except that Allah will cause this Din to enter it &#8211; bringing honour or humiliation. Honour which Allah gives to Islam and humiliation which Allah will give to disbelief.&#8221;</span> [<em>Sahih</em>: Related by Ahmad (4/103), Ibn Hibban in his <em>Sahih</em> (no. 1631) and others. <em>Shaykh</em> Al­-Albani authenticated it in <em>Tahdhirus­-Sajid</em> (p. 118)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Therefore, it is upon the Muslims to prepare themselves, by turning to their Lord, holding on to His Book, following the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Prophet <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, turning away from all that Allah has made unlawful and uniting upon that which He &#8211; <em>the Perfect, Most High</em> &#8211; is pleased with.]<span id="qtip1" class="toggle">2</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, there is no doubt that fulfillment of this prevalence and domination necessitates that the Muslims return to spiritual, material and armed strength, so that they are able to overcome the might of <em>kufr</em> (disbelief) and suppression. This good tiding is given to us in the [next] <em>hadith</em>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Thirdly</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Abu Qabil who said: We were with &#8216;Abdullah ibn &#8216;Amr ibn Al-&#8216;As and he was asked which city will be conquered first &#8211; Constantinople or Rome? So &#8216;Abdullah called for a sealed trunk and he said: Take out a book from it.<span id="qtip2" class="toggle">3</span> Then &#8216;Abdullah said: Whilst we were with the Messenger of <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> writing, The Messenger of <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> was asked: Which city will be conquered first, Constantinople or Rome? So Allah&#8217;s Messenger <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> said: <span class="hadith">&#8220;The city of Heraclius will be conquered first.&#8221;</span> &#8211; meaning Constantinople.<span id="qtip3" class="toggle">4</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The conquest mentioned, occurred at the hands of Muhammad al­-Fattah al-Uthmani &#8211; as is well known &#8211; and it occurred more than eight­hundred years after the Prophet <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> foretold of the conquest. So the second conquest will take place, by the permission of Allah &#8211; <em>the Most High</em> &#8211; and it is certain and you will hear of it after a time. There is also no doubt that the fulfillment of the second conquest necessitates the return of the rightly-guided <em>Khilafah</em> to the Muslim <em>Ummah</em>, which is what he <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> foretold with his saying in the [next] <em>hadith</em>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Fourthly</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="hadith">&#8220;Prophethood will remain amongst you for as long as Allah wishes it to, then Allah will raise it up when He wishes to raise it up. Then there will be Khilafah upon the manner of Prophethood and it will remain amongst you for as long as Allah wishes it to, then Allah will raise up when He wishes to raise up. Then there will be harsh kingship which will remain amongst you for as long as Allah wishes it to, then Allah will raise it up when He wishes to raise it up. Then there will be tyrannical kingship and it will remain amongst you for as long as Allah wishes it to, then will raise it up when He wishes to raise it up. Then there will be Khilafah upon the manner of Prophethood.&#8221;</span> Then he was silent. [<em>Sahih</em>: Related by Ahmad (4/273) and others from An-Nu&#8217;man ibn Bashir <em>radhiallahu &#8216;anhu</em>. It was authenticated by <em>Al­-Hafidh</em> Al-&#8216;Iraqi in <em>Mahajjatul­-Qarab fi Mahabbatil-&#8216;Arab</em> (17/2)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the good tidings of the return of strength to the Muslims, and their having the ability to utilise the earth to attain their goals, and that they have a bright future even in the economic and agricultural spheres, is his <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8216;s saying:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Fifthly</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="hadith">&#8220;The Hour will not be established until the land of the &#8216;Arabs returns to being pastures and rivers.&#8221;</span> [Related by Muslim (3/84), Ahmad (2/703) and Al-Hakim (4/477) from Abu Hurayrah <em>radhiallahu &#8216;anhu</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first signs of the fulfillment of this <em>hadith</em> have begun to appear in some parts of the Arab lands, upon which Allah has poured forth His blessings and great favours &#8211; such that plentiful water is extracted from the desert &#8230; and tomorrow is very near for the one who awaits it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It must also be known that his <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8216;s saying: &#8220;A time will not come upon you, except that which comes after it will be worse &#8211; until you meet your Lord.&#8221; [Related by Al-Bukhari from the <em>hadith</em> of Anas <em>radhiallahu &#8216;anhu</em>] Then this <em>hadith</em> must be understood in the light of the preceding <em>ahadith</em> as well as in the light of others &#8211; such as the <em>ahadith</em> about the Mahdi and also the descent of Isa <em>&#8216;alayhis-salam</em> &#8211; which show that this <em>hadith</em> is not to be understood as having no exceptions. Rather, it is general and has exceptions. Thus, it is not permissible to cause the people to understand it or be unrestricted, so that they fall into despair which no Believer should have as an attribute:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="quran">&#8220;Indeed, no one despairs of Allah&#8217;s mercy, except those who disbelieve.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 12:87]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allah to make us true Believer in Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(s) <em>Silsilatul-Ahadethus-Sahihah</em> (pp. 6-8) of <em>Shaykh</em> Al­-Albani. For the sake of brevity and simplicity, the <em>hadith</em> authentication and checkings by the <em>Shaykh</em> have been abridged.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Paving the Way for Victory</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh</em> Al­-Albani says in <em>Fiqhul-Waqi&#8217;</em> (pp. 49­51):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Therefore, the key to a return of the glory of Islam is: implementation of beneficial knowledge and establishing righteous and correct actions, and this is a very great affair which the Muslims cannot reach, except through the <em>manhaj</em> (methodology) of <em>tasfiyah</em> (purification and correction) and <em>tarbiyah</em> (education and cultivation). These being two very great obligations. By the first of these, the following is intended:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Purifying the Islamic <em>&#8216;aqidah</em> from that which is alien to it, such as <em>shirk</em> (associating partners to in those things that are particular to Him), <em>ta&#8217;til</em> (rejection Attributes), <em>ta&#8217;wil</em> (twisting the meanings of Allah&#8217;s Attributes), refusing authentic <em>ahadith</em>, because they are connected to matters of <em>&#8216;aqidah</em>, and their like.</li>
<li>Purifying the Islamic <em>fiqh</em> from the erroneous judgements made, which are contrary to the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, freeing the minds from the fetters of blind­following and the darkness of sectarianism and party­spirit.</li>
<li>Purifying the books of <em>tafsir</em>, <em>fiqh raqa&#8217;iq</em> (matters concerning the heart) and other than that, from <em>ahadith</em> which are weak and fabricated, or the the unsupported narrations from the people of the Book, and the reprehensible narrations.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards the second obligation, then by it I mean: cultivating the young generation upon this Islam, purified all that we have mentioned, giving to them a correct Islamic education from the start &#8211; without any influence from the disbelieving western education.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt, that bringing these two obligations about requires huge efforts and sincere co­operation between all Muslims &#8211; individuals and groups &#8211; from all those who are truly concerned with establishing the desired Islamic society, each one working in his own field and specialty.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source : Everyday Issues , Al-Istiqaamah Issue No.7 &#8211; Rabî&#8217; ul-Awwal 1418H / July 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa from Shaik Ibn Baaz</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: What is your advice &#8211; O Shaykh &#8211; for those who go without reading the Qur&#8217;aan for a month, or even many months, and who have no excuse for such behaviors? However, you will find some of them reading those magazines that contain no benefit for them, and following them up closely!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: &#8220;It is recommended for every Believing man and woman to recite the Book of Allaah often, with due contemplation and understanding. This may be done by using a copy of the Qur&#8217;aan or from one&#8217;s memory. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <strong>&#8220;This is a Book which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, that you may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember.&#8221; </strong>[Soorah Saad 38:29].And:<strong> &#8220;Indeed those who recite the Book of Allaah and offer the Prayer perfectly and spend in charity out of what We have provided for them &#8211; secretly and openly &#8211; hope for a sure trade-gain that will never perish. That He may pay them their wages in full and give them even more out of His Grace. Indeed, He is Oft-Forgiving, ready to appreciate good deeds.&#8221;</strong> [Soorah Faatir 35:29-30].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The aforementioned recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan includes both reciting and acting upon it. The recitation is to be done with contemplation and understanding of it. Sincerity to Allaah is a means of complying with and acting upon the Qur&#8217;aan, and its recitation contains a great reward &#8211; as the Prophet <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> said: <em>&#8220;Recite the Qur&#8217;aan. For on the Day of Resurrection, it shall come as an intercessor for its companion.&#8221;</em> This was recorded by Muslim in his Saheeh (no.804). The Prophet <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> also said: &#8220;The best of you is he who learns the Qur&#8217;aan and teaches it.&#8221; This was Recorded by al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh (3/66). Another narration states: <em>&#8220;Whosoever reads one harf (letter) of the Qur&#8217;aan shall receive a good deed and ten good deeds similar to it. I do not say that Alif Laam Meem is a harf but Alif is a harf and Laam is a harf and Meem is a harf.&#8221;</em>12 The Prophet <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> said to &#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8220;Amr ibn al-&#8216;Aas: <em>&#8220;Complete the recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan once a month.&#8221;</em> He said: I am able to do more than that. So he said: <em>&#8220;Then complete its recital once in seven days.&#8221;</em>13 The Companions used to complete the entire Qur&#8217;aan once every seven days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advise all the readers of the Qur&#8217;aan to increase in their reading of it, with contemplation and understanding it, along with sincerity to Allaah in this &#8211; with the purpose of learning and benefiting from the Qur&#8217;aan. They should read the entire Qur&#8217;aan once a month. If, however, they are able to do more than this without any difficulty, then they should complete it in less than this time. However, it is best not to complete it in less than three days, since this is the least amount of time that the Prophet <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> mentioned to &#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8216;Amr ibn al-&#8216;Aas. This is because if it is read in less than three days, the person becomes hasty and lacks thought and concentration &#8230;&#8221;14</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. <strong>Saheeh</strong>: Recorded by at-Tirmidhee (no.2912), who authenticated it, from the hadeeth of &#8216;Abdullaah ibn Mas&#8217;ood <em>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>.<br />
13. Recorded by al-Bukhaaree (no.5054).<br />
14. <em>Fataawaa al-Mar&#8217;ah</em> (no.294)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[Q]</strong><em>:</em> I and many others have observed that many people are very excessive when it comes to the matter of the <em> mahr</em> (wedding dowry that is paid to the bride), and that they seek great amounts of <em> mahr</em> when it comes to the marriage of their daughters, and they stipulate as a condition the giving of other gifts to them, along with the <em> mahr</em>. This wealth that people demand in such cases, is it <em> halaal</em> (lawful) or <em> haraam</em> (unlawful)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: What is prescribed in the <em> Sharee&#8217;ah</em> is that the <em> mahr</em> should be a small amount and that people should not compete with each other in this regard, acting in accordance with the many <em> ahaadeeth</em> which are related about this. They should also help facilitate marriages and be keen in preserving the modesty and decency of the young Muslim men and women. And it is not permissible for the <em>awliyaa</em> (guardians of the brides-to-be) to demand and stipulate gifts for themselves, since they have no right at all in this matter. Rather the right belongs to the woman, and in some particular cases to the father. He may stipulate a condition as long as it does not harm the daughter, nor lead to the delaying of the marriage. However, if the father forgoes such a right then this is better and more preferable. Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects &#8211; says:<strong> &#8220;And marry those amongst you who are single and also marry the pious of your male and female slaves. If they be poor, Allaah will enrich them out of His Bounty.&#8221; </strong>[Soorah an-Noor 24:32].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the <em> hadeeth</em> of &#8216;Uqbah ibn &#8216;Aamir <em> radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, the Prophet <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> said: <em> &#8220;The best dowry is that which is easy.&#8221;</em> This was narrated by Abu Daawood and al-Haakim who authenticated it. And once a woman offered herself to the Prophet <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> for marriage. However, one of his Companions desired to marry her, so the Prophet <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> said [regarding the <em>mahr</em>]: <em>&#8220;Bring something, even if it be an iron ring.&#8221;</em> So when he could not find even this, the Prophet <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> married them for the dowry that the man would teach whatever of the Qur&#8217;aan he knew to her. 2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the dowry of the Prophet <em> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</em> wives was five-hundred dirhams, which is equivalent to one-hundred and thirty riyaals today. And his daughters were married for the <em> mahr</em> of four-hundred dinaars, which is equivalent to one-hundred riyaals today. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <strong> &#8220;Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a most beautiful example to follow.&#8221;</strong> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:21].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whenever the difficulties relating to marriage are lightened, then preserving the modesty and decency of young men and women becomes easier, shameful and evil deeds decrease, and the Ummah &#8211; as a result &#8211; will increase in number. However if this matter is made difficult, and people continue competing with each other with regards to the <em> mahr</em> (dowry), then the number of marriages will decrease, fornication will become more widespread and more young men and women will remain unmarried &#8211; except those whom Allaah saves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So my sincere advice to all the Muslims, wherever they may be, is to facilitate the marriage process and to cooperate in this and make it easy. They should turn away from demanding excessive <em> mahr</em> and avoid unnecessary hardships and difficulties in the <em>waleemah</em> (wedding-feast). Rather, they should content themselves with a <em> waleemah</em> that is according to the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em>, in which the burdens and difficulties for the husband and wife are minimal. May Allaah improve and rectify all the affairs of the Muslims and may He give them the guidance and ability to cling to the <em> Sunnah</em> (Prophetic guidance) in all matters. 3</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source : Al-Istiqaamah Issue No.7 &#8211; Rabî&#8217; ul-Awwal 1418H / July 1997 &#8211; <a title="# Questions Concerning Everyday Issues : Shaykh bin Bâz" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2014/01/31/daily-issues-2/">Everyday Issues</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[Q]</strong>: There was a person in our city who was very firm in practicing the Religion, and was later afflicted with an illness. Some of the people started saying to him that the cause of him being afflicted with this illness is because of his adhering to the Religion. Being affected with this type of talk, the person then shaved off his beard and he neglected his Prayers. So is it permissible to say that the cause of his affliction was due to him clinging to the commandments of the Religion? And the one who says such a thing, is he considered a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) because of such a saying?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[A]</strong>: &#8221;Clinging on to the Religion is not a cause for his illness. Rather, it is a cause for every good, both in this life and in the Hereafter. And it is not permissible for any Muslim, that when some foolish and ignorant people utter words such as this, to give them any weight. Nor is it permissible to shave one&#8217;s beard or shorten it, or to neglect guarding the five obligatory Prayers in congregation. Rather, it is obligatory for such a person to remain steadfast upon the truth, and to keep away from all that Allaah has prohibited, and to beware of all that which angers Allaah and incurs His punishment &#8211; by obeying Allaah and His Messenger <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects said: <strong>&#8220;Whosoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger will be admitted into Gardens of Paradise, beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. That will be the greatest achievement. But whosoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger and oversteps His limits, Allaah will cast him in the Fire, to abide therein; and he shall have a humiliating punishment.&#8221;</strong> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:13-14]. And Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said: <strong>&#8220;Whosoever has taqwaa (piety, fear and obedience) of Allaah, He will make a way out for him. And He will provide for him from places he could never imagine.&#8221;</strong> [Soorah at-Talaaq 65:2-3]. And He &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <strong>&#8220;Whosoever has taqwaa of Allaah, He will make his affair easy for him,&#8221; </strong>[Soorah at-Talaaq 65:4]. And the verses with this meaning are plentiful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the person who says that the cause for such affliction is due to being firm and steadfast upon the Religion &#8211; then such a person is ignorant. It is obligatory to censure such a person and to know that <strong>clinging to the Religion does not bring about anything except good</strong>. As for what occurs to a Muslim by way of a calamity that he dislikes, then this is a form of expiating his evil actions and a forgiveness for his sins. As regards to the issue of <em>takfeer</em> (declaring a Muslim to be a <em>kaafir</em>, a disbeliever) upon this person, then this requires detail, and is known from the chapters concerning the judgement upon a <em>murtad</em> (apostate) &#8211; which can be found in the books of Islaamic jurisprudence and understanding. And with Allaah is the power and ability.&#8221;1</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Principle of Permissibility</strong></p>
<p>Source : Islamic Principles #1: The Principle of Permissibility , Al-Istiqaamah Issue No.5 &#8211; Ramadân 1417H / January 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The principle regarding acts of worship is one of prohibition, except if the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> (Divinely Prescribed Law) relates a prescription for it. And the principle regarding customary behaviour is permissibility, except when the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> relates a prohibition for it.&#8221; (<em><strong>Al-aslu fil-&#8216;ibaadat al-hadhru illaa ma waradah &#8216;anish-shar&#8217;ee tashree&#8217;ahu. Wal-aslu fil-&#8216;aadaat al-ibaahah illaa ma waradah &#8216;anish-shar&#8217;ee tahreemahu</strong></em>).1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above principle is an important principle that Islaam teaches. Thus, with regards to matters of <em>&#8216;aadaat</em> (day-to-day actions), such as eating, drinking and wearing clothes, then everything is allowed in this regard, except if there is a clear and authentic evidence restricting or prohibiting its allowance. However, when it comes to <em>&#8216;ibaadaat</em> (acts of worship), then the opposite is the true. Here, nothing can be established as an act of worship, except if there is a clear and authentic text to allow it. So the basic principle for <em>&#8216;aadaat</em> is <em>ibaahah</em> (permissibility), whereas the basic principle for <em>&#8216;ibaadaat</em> is <em>tahreem</em> (prohibition).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H)- <em>rahimahullaah</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Peoples&#8217; sayings and actions are of two kinds: <em>&#8216;ibaadaat</em> (acts of worship) by which their Religion is established, and <em>&#8216;aadaat</em> (customary practices) which are required for day-to-day living. From the principles of the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> (Divinely Prescribed Islaamic Law) we know that acts of worship are those acts which have been prescribed by Allaah or approved by Him; nothing is to be affirmed here, except through the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em>. However, as far as worldly activities of people are concerned, they are necessary for everyday life. Here the principle is freedom of action; nothing may be restricted in this regard except what Allaah &#8211; the Mort Perfect &#8211; has restricted. This is the case because commanding and prohibiting are both in Allaah&#8217;s Hands. As far as worship is concerned, there has to be a command from Him concerning it. Thus, when it requires a command from Allaah to establish something, how can we say that something is restricted without His command? This is why Ahmad bin Hanbal (d.241H) and other jurists who base their judgements upon <em>ahaadeeth</em> (Prophetic narrations) say: In relation to acts of worship, then the principle is tawqeef (limitation); that is to lay, nothing can be legislated in this regard except what Allaah legislates. To do otherwise is to incur the risk of being included in the meaning of the <em>Aayah</em> (verse):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Do they have partners with Allaah who prescribe for them in the Religion that for which Allaah has not given any permission.&#8221;</strong> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:21].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, as far as living habits are concerned, the principle here is freedom, because nothing can be restricted in this regard except what Allaah has prohibited. To do otherwise is to be included in the meaning of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Say: Do you see what Allaah has sent down to you for sustenance? Yet you have made some part of it <em>halaal</em> (lawful) and some part <em>haraam</em> (prohibited).&#8221;</strong> [Soorah Yoonus 10:59].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a great and beneficial principle, on the basis of which we can say that buying, selling, leasing, giving gifts, and other such matters are necessary activities for people, as are eating, drinking and the wearing of clothes. Thus, if the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> (Divinely Prescribed Islaamic Law) says something about these day-to-day matters, it is in order to teach good behaviour. Accordingly, it has prohibited whatever leads to corruption, has made obligatory that which is essential, has disapproved of that which is superfluous, and has approved of that which is beneficial. All this has been done with due consideration of the magnitude and properties of the various types of activities involved. Since this is the position of the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em>, people are free to buy, sell and to lease just as they wish, just as they are free to eat and drink what they like &#8211; as long as it is not <em>haraam</em> (unlawful). Even though some of these things may be disapproved, they are still free in this regard, since the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> does not go to the extent of prohibiting them &#8211; and thus the original principle (of permissibility) remains.&#8221;2</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>FASTING THE DAY OF ’ARAFAH:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ninth day of<em> Dhul-Hijjah </em> is the day of ’Arafah, since it is on this day that the pilgrims gather at the mountain plain of ’Arafah, praying and supplicating to their Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is <em> mustahabb</em> (highly recommended) for those who are not pilgrims to fast on this day, since the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) was asked about fasting on the day of ’Arafah, so he said, “<strong>It expiates the sins of the past year and the coming year</strong>.” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) said, ‘<strong>There is no day on which Allaah frees people from the Fire more so than on the day of ’Arafah</strong>. He comes close to those (people standing on ’Arafah), and then He revels before His Angels saying, ‘What are these people seeking.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam at-Tirmidhee (d.275H) &#8211; <em> rahimahullaah</em> – said, “The People of Knowledge consider it recommended to fast on the day of ’Arafah, except for those at ’Arafah.” [6]</p>

<div>Your life in the present moment is in between the past and the future.</div>
<div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what has preceded can be rectified by tawbah (repentance), nadam (regret) and istighfar (seeking Allaah’s forgiveness). And this is something that will neither tire you, nor cause you to toil as you would with strenuous labour. Rather it is an action of the heart.Then as regards the future (then it can be corrected) by withholding yourself from sins. And this abandonment is merely the leaving of something and to be at ease from it. This also is not action of the limbs, which requires you to strive and toil. Rather this is a firm resolve and intention of the heart – which will give rest to your body, heart and thoughts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So as for what has preceded, then you rectify it with repentance. And as for the future – then you rectify it with firm resolve and intention. Neither of these involves any hardship or exertion of the limbs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But then your attention must be directed to your life in the present &#8211; the time between two times. If you waste it, then you have wasted the opportunity to be of the fortunate and saved ones. If you look after it, having rectified the two times – what is before and after it, as we have said – then you will be successful and achieve rest, delight and ever-lasting bliss. However, looking after it is harder than that which comes before and after it, since guarding it involves keeping to that which is most befitting and beneficial for your soul, and that which will bring it success and well-being.</p>
</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: : Al-Istiqaamah Magazine, Issue No.7 &#8211; <a title="# The Beginnings of Deviation (Al Istiqaamah Magazine)" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/01/17/beginnings_of_deviation/">The Beginnings of Deviation</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: That <em>Shirk</em> began during the time of Noah &#8216;alayhis-salaam, due to the excessive love and veneration that the people had for certain dead pious Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Qurtubee (d.654H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullaah</em> &#8211; said: &#8220;The initial images that were made of these righteous men were done in order that the people could be reminded about their righteousness and so strive in being righteous; as they strove. So they worshipped Allaah by the graves of these righteous men. Then a people came after them who forgot the intent of their fore-fathers&#8217; actions. So Shaytaan whispered to them saying: Your fore-fathers used to worship these images and held them in great veneration.&#8221;13</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: &#8220;That Shaytaan is eager to misguide mankind and to plot against them. He comes from the angle of exploiting man&#8217;s emotions, and lures them into doing acts that are (apparently) good. Thus, when Shaytaan saw amongst the people of Noah their great love and esteem for the righteous, he tricked them into going beyond the bounds in their love, and he got them to make and place statues of these dead pious Muslims in their places of gatherings. The objective of this was to make them swerve away from the right path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>: That Shaytaan does not only observe the present generation, and seek to deceive only them; but he also wishes to misguide and deceive future generations. Thus, when he could not plunge the present generation, from the people of Noah, into Shirk, he eagerly awaited the next generation&#8217;s arrival, in order that he could misguide them.&#8221;14</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourthly</strong>: That the worshipping of dead pious Muslims continues to be practiced amongst the <em>Ummah</em> even today. The difference being is that the names have changed. Thus, instead of worshipping <em>Wadd</em>, or <em>Yaghooth</em>, or <em>Ya&#8217;ooq</em>; people have instead directed the same practices of <em>Shirk</em> &#8211; like supplicating directly to the pious dead, and taking them as intercessors between them and Allaah &#8211; to others; such as to Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-Qaadir al-Jeelaanee in Iraaq, or al-Baydaawee in Eygypt, or Chishtee in India, etc. However, changing the name of a thing, does not change its reality.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align:left;">Sharh Usoolul-Eemaan (pp.4-7)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh said in <em>Sharh Usoolul-Eemaan</em> (pp.4-7):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <strong>The deen (religion) of Islaam</strong>: It is the way of life that Allaah sent the Prophet Muhammad <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> with. By it, Allaah terminated the validity of all other religions, perfected this religion for His worshippers, completed His favour upon them and has chosen only this religion for them &#8211; no other religion will be accepted by Him from anyone. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Muhammad is not the father of any man amongst you. Rather he is the Messenger of Allaah and the khaatim (last and final) of the Prophets.&#8221;</strong> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:40].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islaam as your religion.&#8221;</strong> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:3].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Indeed the religion with Allaah is Islaam.&#8221;</strong> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:19].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Whosoever seeks a religion other than Islaam, never will it be accepted from him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.&#8221;</strong> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:85].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; obligated all of mankind to take Islaam as their religion. So Allaah said, whilst addressing His Messenger <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Say: O Mankind! Indeed I have been sent to you all as the Messenger of Allaah; to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. None has the right to be worshipped except Him; it is He who gives life and cause death. So believe in Allaah and His Messenger &#8211; the Prophet who can neither read nor write &#8211; who believes in Allaah and His Words. So follow the Messenger of Allaah so that you may be rightly-guided.&#8221;</strong> [Soorah al-A&#8217;raaf 7:158].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in <em>Saheeh Muslim</em> (1/93), from Abu Hurayrah <em>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</em> that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> said: <em>&#8220;By Him in whose Hand is the life of Muhammad! There is no one from this nation, be he a Jew or a Christian, who hears of me and dies whilst not having eemaan (faith) in what I have been sent with, except that he will be one of the companions of the Hellfire.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>eemaan</em> (faith) in the Prophet implies: affirming that which he was sent with, along with acceptance of it and submission to it. Without these two matters, mere affirmation is not sufficient. This is why even though Abu Taalib (the Prophet&#8217;s uncle) affirmed what was sent to the Prophet <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> and that Islaam was the best of religions, yet he did not accept his message nor submit to it; and thus he did not have <em>eemaan</em> in the Prophet <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] <strong>The religion of Islaam</strong> contains all that was beneficial from the previous religions. It is suitable for implementation in any age, any where and by any nation. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said, whilst addressing His Messenger <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And We have sent down to you the Book in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it, testifying to the truth contained therein whilst exposing the falsehood that has been added therein.&#8221;</strong> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:48].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That Islaam is suitable for implementation in any age, any where and by any nation does not mean that it becomes submissive to nations &#8211; being altered and changed by them &#8211; as some people falsely think. But rather it means that whenever it is truly adhered to then it brings benefit and goodness to that nation, as well as reforming and correcting it &#8211; in whatever age or place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] <strong>The religion of Islaam</strong> is the religion of truth. It is the way of life that Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; guaranteed His help and victory to those who truly adhere to it, and that He would make it dominant over all other religions. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;It is He who has sent His Messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth, that it may prevail over all other religions, even if the pagans detest it.&#8221;</strong> [Soorah at-Tawbah 9:33].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Allaah has promised to those amongst you who truly have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith and belief) and act in obedience to Allaah and His Messenger, that He will grant them ruler ship upon the earth, just as He granted it to those before them, and that He will establish their Religion for them and grant them the authority to practice their Religion which He chose and ordered them with. And He will certainly change their situation to one of security, after their fear. Providing that they worship and obey Me, not associating anything else in worship with Me. Then, whoever rejects this favour by disobedience to their Lord &#8211; then they are the rebellious transgressors.&#8221;</strong> [Soorah an-Noor 24:55].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] The religion of Islaam is a complete religion comprising both <em>&#8216;aqeedah</em> (beliefs) and <em>sharee&#8217;ah</em> (laws).</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>It commands them with <em>tawheed</em> (to single out Allaah alone for worship) and prohibits them from shirk (associating partners with Allaah, in that which is particular to Him).</li>
<li>It commands them with being truthful and prohibits them from lying.</li>
<li>It commands them with <em>&#8216;adl</em> (justice) and prohibits them from injustice and oppression.</li>
<li>It commands them with fulfilling trusts and prohibits them from acting treacherously.</li>
<li>It commands them keeping promises and prohibits them from breaking them.</li>
<li>It commands them with kindness and good treatment of parents and prohibits them from disobedience to them in that which is not sinful.</li>
<li>It commands them with joining the ties of relations and prohibits them from severing them.</li>
<li>It commands them with good treatment of neighbours and prohibits the causing of harm to them.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In short, Islaam orders alls that is good, from manners and morals, and prohibits all that is evil from it. Likewise, it orders all actions which are righteous and good and prohibits all actions that are evil and harmful. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Indeed Allaah enjoins upon you justice, kindness and the giving of good to relatives and near ones. And He prohibits you from all shameful and evil deeds, oppression and transgression. Thus He admonishes you, that you may take heed and be reminded.&#8221;</strong> [Soorah an-Nahl 16:90].</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez </strong><strong>Ibn Baaz</strong> was asked about the correctness of the saying:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;We should unite upon that which we agree, and excuse each other in that which we disagree.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The Shaykh commented:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! It is obligatory to co-operate in that which we agree, by aiding the truth, calling to it and warning against that which Allaah and His Messenger <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> have prohibited.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">Its for excusing each other for that in which we differ &#8211; then <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>this is not to be taken in an absolute sense, but rather in a general one</strong></span>. Thus, <span style="color:#ff6600;">if the difference involves a particular issue of <strong>ijtihaad</strong> wherein the proofs are deep and detailed &#8211; then it is obligatory not to reproach or censure one another. However, if it opposes a <strong>clear text of the Book and the Sunnah</strong>, then it is obligatory to correct the one who has opposed the clear texts, but with wisdom, beautiful admonition and debating in the best possible manner</span>, acting upon Allaah -the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And help you one another in righteousness and piety, but do not help one another in sin and transgression.&#8221;</span> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His &#8211; the Most Perfect&#8217;s &#8211; saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The Believers &#8211; man and woman &#8211; are protectors to each other, they order the good and forbid the evil &#8230; &#8221; </span>[Soorah at-Towbah 9:71].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic&#8217;s &#8211; saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and beautiful admonition, and argue with them in ways that are better.&#8221;</span> [Soorah an-Nahl 16:125].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Whosoever sees an evil, then let him change it with his hand. If he is unable to do this, then with his tongue, and if he is unable to do this, then with his heart. And that is the weakest of eemaan (faith).&#8221;</em> </span></p>
<p>And he <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Whosoever directs a person to do good, will have a reward similar to the one who does that good.&#8221;</em> </span>[5]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#008000;">Q &amp; A&#8217;s Concerning the Ideological Attack</span></span><br />
Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin Baaz , Al-Istiqaamah Magazine</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">[Q3]: What are the means which the west uses in order to spread their ideas and thoughts?</span><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A3]: The means that the west employs in order to spread their thoughts and ideas are many, from them:-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: The attempt <span style="color:#993300;">to conquer the minds of the Muslim children</span>. They do this by infusing in them western values and concepts so that they then believe that the best way to adopt in any matter is that of the west &#8211; whether it is with regards to what religion or sect they believe, or with regards to the languages that they speak, or the manners, customs and values with which they clothe themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Custody of a large group of the children of the Muslims in every country,</span> concern for them and bringing them up, so that when they <span style="color:#993300;">absorb western thoughts</span>, they return to their countries with a halo of praise and compliment, until they acquire position and authority in their countries by which they circulate western ideologies and establish learning centres conforming to western curricula or are directly influenced by them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>: Their active drive towards <span style="color:#993300;">promoting the learning of western languages in the Muslim lands</span>, making them compete with the Muslims&#8217; languages, especially the Arabic language, which is language of the Qur&#8217;aan &#8211; by which this Book was sent and by which the Muslims worship their Lord;in their Salaah (Prayer), their rites of Hajj (Pilgrimage), their forms of remembrances and glorifications, etc. From this is the <span style="color:#993300;">encouragement of destructive propaganda that fights against [the usage and learning] of [pure and classical] Arabic Language</span> and attempt to weaken the conformity to it in the Muslim lands. They do this by calling to using colloquialism, and by arranging numerous studies that intend to &#8216;develop&#8217; grammar in order to corrupt it; as well as formalising folk literature and and matters of national heritage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourthly</strong>: Development of <span style="color:#993300;">western universities and missionary schools in Muslim countries</span> and also initiating the role of kindergarten and playschools, hospitals and clinics which they make as dens and nests for their evil aims. They encourage the higher classes to study in them (western and missionary schools and universities) and after them help in acquire leadership posts and great position until they become an aid for their masters in following their plots in the Muslim lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifthly</strong>: The attempt <span style="color:#993300;">to control education curricula in Muslim lands</span> and drawing out their politics, either directly; as occurred in some Muslim countries when the priest Dunlop undertook that task there, or by indirect methods. When the task was undertaken, most of the successful students who studied in Dunlop&#8217;s schools and graduated in them, arose as a destructive pickaxe in their country, or as one of the enemies most lethal weapons. [Such students] strive hard to influence the educational curriculum and steer it towards secularism &#8211; an ideology which does not centre around having eemaan (faith) in Allaah and His Messenger; but rather steers in the direction of atheism, or towards immorality and corruption.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sixthly</strong>: The large number of individuals amongst the <span style="color:#993300;">jews and christians</span> who have undertaken the study of Islam, Arabic Language, compiling books, and <span style="color:#993300;">taking positions of teaching in universities; until they created an ideological turmoil</span> and confusion amongst the educated Muslims, which they hurl at those that they are teaching, or with which they fill their books &#8211; until some of those books became sources which writers and researchers refer to in matters of ideology or history. Many people who were responsible for creating some of these fitnahs (trials and turmoil) in the Muslim countries, were actually Muslims who graduated at the hands of the people. The praise and awe which surrounded such graduates helped them to achieve this, as well as achieve their post and positions; such as important posts in teaching and leadership. So they completed what their teachers had initiated [of corruption and destruction] and fulfilled what they couldn&#8217;t achieve, because they were of Muslim offspring and from the same skin, ascribing themselves to them and speaking their tongue &#8211; so we ask and seek Allaah&#8217;s help.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Seventhly</strong>: A large number of <span style="color:#993300;">missionary workers calling to christianity</span> have proceeded between the Muslims that they have performed their work on. [This missionary activity is done upon] well studied principles, and upon a large scale; employing hundreds of thousands of men and women. Huge financial budgets are put aside for this task, and [they are aided in such a way that] their task is made easier for them and obstacles are removed for them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;They want to extinguish the Light (i.e, the Religion) of Allaah with their mouths, but Allaah will bring His Light to perfection and completion, even though the disbelievers hate it.&#8221; </span>[Soorah as-Saff 61:8].</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as the efforts of the missionaries are set up and aimed mostly at the common levels; then the efforts of the orientalist are directed to the educated &#8211; as I previously mentioned. The missionaries take on huge hardships in their work in the African Countries, and in the remote villages of the far extreme Muslim lands; in eastern Asia. After that, every so often, they hold conferences in order to review their accounts and their plans; then they analyse, adjust and implement. They met in Cairo in 1906, in Edinburgh in 1910, in Lucknow (India) in 1911, and in Jerusalem in 1935, and they continue to hold such assemblies, seminars and conferences &#8211; so glory be to the One in Whose Hand is the sole sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and to Him return all affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Eighthly</strong>: Spreading corruption in the Muslim societies; belittling the with regards to their role in life, making her transgress the limits set by Allaah for her, creating in her a satisfaction in abstaining from the [correct] Path. They do this by <span style="color:#993300;">spreading propaganda amongst the Muslims in various ways and manners, so that women freely mix with men, and so that women work in the places of men</span>. By this, they aim to corrupt the Muslim society, and to put an end to the chastity and purity which is found therein. Additionally, by bringing up imaginary issues and false propaganda &#8211; [claiming] that Islaam oppresses women, and that Muslim women have very little rights &#8211; they want to take her out of her home, and put her wherever they may want; even though the limits that Allaah has set [in the Qur&#8217;aan] are clear; as are His commands [concerning these matters], and as is the Sunnah (Guidance) of His Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the Believing women to draw their jilbaabs (cloaks) over their entire body. That will be better, that they should be known (as free and respectable women), so as not to be harassed, And Allaah is Ever-Forgiving, Most-Merciful.&#8221;</span> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:59].</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And &#8211; the Most High &#8211; says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And let the Believing women draw their khimaars (head-scarves) over their faces, necks and chests, and not to display their beauty, except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband&#8217;s fathers, or their sons, or their husband&#8217;s sons &#8230;&#8221;</span> [Soorah an-Noor 24:31].</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And when you ask them for something, ask them from behind a screen; that is purer for your hearts and their hearts.&#8221; </span>[Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:53].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And stay in your houses, and do not display yourselves like that of the times of jaahiliyyah (pre-lslaamic ignorance).&#8221;</span> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:33].</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said:<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Beware of entering into the company of women.&#8221;</em> </span>A man from the Ansaar said: O Messenger of Allaah, what about the husband&#8217;s brothers and relatives! He replied: <em>&#8220;The husband&#8217;s brothers and relatives are death!&#8221; </em>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam also said:<br />
<em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;A man must not be alone in the company of a women, for indeed the third of them is shaytaan.&#8221;</span> </em>[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ninthly</strong>: The <span style="color:#993300;">Building of churches and temples in the Muslim lands</span> and spending great amounts of wealth on them; beautifying them, making them very conspicuous and noticeable, and building them in the largest and best of places.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tenthly</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Radio stations set up solely for the purpose of calling to christianity and communism</span>, spreading their [false] objectives. They intend to misguide, through such false ideas, the children of the innocent and naive Muslims &#8211; who neither understand, nor did they receive a sufficient Islaamic education. This is the case, in particular, in Africa where the Bible is published and distributed in plenty of hotels, etc. [They also] send missionary publications and false preaching to many of the Muslim children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are some of the means utilised by the enemies of Islaam today &#8211; from east and the west &#8211; in waging war against the Muslim&#8217;s thought, [intending by this ideological attack] to put an end to correct righteous thought, so that they are replaced by [false and] foreign ideas; whether eastern or western.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And &#8211; O noble reader &#8211; as you can see, these means involve tremendous efforts, enormous amounts of money and a multitude of soldiers. All of this is done in order to take the Muslims away from Islaam, even if they do not actually embrace christianity, judaism or marxism. Since their primary goal in doing this is to take the Muslims away from Islaam, so that when this stage is achieved, then whatever [misguidance] follows becomes far easier to implement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, despite all this we say: that Allaah will frustrate them in their hopes, and will nullify their plans &#8211; but only if the Muslims are sincere in their fight against them, cautious and alert to their plans, and obedient and upright upon their Religion; as Allaah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;But if you remain patient and become pious and obedient to Allaah, their plots will not harm you in the least. Indeed, Allah encompasses all that they do.&#8221; </span>[Soorah Aal-lmraan 3:120].</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan ibn al-Fawzaan [1]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Source: <strong>Al-Istiqaamah Magazine</strong> Issue No.8 &#8211; Shawwal 1418H / February 1998</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[Q]: There are some people here, who keep away from [attending] lessons on &#8216;aqeedah (creed/beliefs), and they say: &#8216;We are Muslims, we are not unbelievers or idol-worshippers such that we have to learn &#8216;aqeedah or attend lectures about it&#8217; So, O noble Shaykh, what is your view regarding this!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: Teaching the Muslims [the correct] &#8216;aqeedah does not mean that we have judged them to be unbelievers. Rather, we teach the Muslims about &#8216;aqeedah in order for them to know about it thoroughly, and know what matters nullify it and what matters are contrary to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan, one of the distinguished Companions &#8211; radiallaahu &#8216;anhu &#8211; said:<em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;People used to ask the Messenger about the good, but I used to ask him about the evil, for fear of falling into it.&#8221;</span></em>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise &#8216;Umar ibn al-Khattaab radiallaahu &#8216;anhu said: <span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Soon the bonds of Islaam will be loosened bit by bit, because people will enter into Islaam but will be unaware of Jaahiliyyah (ignorant practices that Islaam opposes).&#8221;</em></span>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, when we teach &#8216;aqeedoh, this does not imply that we have judged those whom we are teaching to be non-Muslims. Rather, what it means is that we desire that they should be thoroughly aware of the correct Islaamic &#8216;aqeedah; so as to cling to it, and to be aware of what opposes it; so as to keep far away from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said, whilst addressing His Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam: <span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;So have knowledge about Laa ilaaha illallaah (i.e, have knowledge that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah), and seek forgiveness for your sins, and for the believing men and women.&#8221;</em></span> [Soorah Muhammad 47:19].</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">So it is essential that a person learns and that he does not content himself with merely saying: &#8216;I am a Muslim.&#8217; Yes indeed, you are a Muslim &#8211; and all praise is for Allaah! However, if one of you were asked as to what Islaam means, or you were asked to explain what Islaam is, then many of you would not be able to correctly explain this. If one of you were to be asked to explain what are those factors which nullify Islaam, then many of you would not be able to explain this. Thus, if a person is ignorant [of such fundamentals], it is possible that he may fall into falsehood without realising it. If one of you were asked to explain the pillars of Islaam or eemaan (faith) that the Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam explained and taught, we would find that most people would be unable to do so. So how is it that a person [suffices with] saying: &#8216;l am a Muslim,&#8217; yet does not know these [basic] matters!</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unfortunately, many of the daa&#8217;ees (callers to Islaam) are themselves unaware of [basic matters such as] what are the conditions for Prayer, or unaware of the rules and regulations concerning wudhoo (ablution) and those matters which invalidate wudhoo. Some of them do not even know what matters form the arkaan (pillars) of the Prayer, or form its waajibaat (obligations), or those matters which invalidate the Prayer. So what Islaam are they calling to! Islaam is not merely a call, rather it is a reality to be learnt and practiced. So it is essential to acquire sound knowledge and understanding of the Religion. This is because a person who does not have sound knowledge, may fall into dangers without even realising it; just like a person who walks down a path, but is ignorant of the fact that along this path there is a ditch, or a hole, or even an ambush. Yet [due to his ignorance] he ends up falling into the hole, or the ambush, without even realising it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus it is essential to learn about tawheed, since it is tawheed that is the basic foundation [of both the Religion and the correct Islaamic &#8216;aqeedah]. Indeed, no one abstains from learning about tawheed [and those matters it necessitates, as well as its limits, conditions, fundamentals, clear proofs, fruits and consequences, and those matters which increase and strengthen it, and those that decrease and weaken it, etc.] except one of two people: [i] an ignorant person &#8211; and the ignorant person&#8217;s [view] is not to be given any weight; or [ii] a bigoted deviant &#8211; one who desires to avert people from the &#8216;aqeedah of pure tawheed, and who wishes to conceal from the people his own false beliefs, and those other deviant beliefs that are [falsely] ascribed to Islaam. And this is possibly the Ease of many of those who abstain from learning about tawheed. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: &#8220;And it is not proper for all the Believers to go out together and fight. From every troop of them only a party of them should go forth, so that those who remain behind may gain understanding of the Religion so that they may [instruct and] warn their people when they return to them, in order that they may beware.&#8221; [Soorah at-Tawbaa 9:122]. Also, the Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said: &#8220;Whoever Allaah desires to show goodness to, He gives him the understanding of the Religion.&#8221; [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of this hadeeth is that whenever Allaah does not want to show goodness to a person, He does not give him the understanding of the Religion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">So the one who says: &#8216;l do not need to learn &#8216;aqeedah.&#8217; It is as if he is saying: &#8216;l do not need to gain understanding of the Religion!&#8217; And this is said by either an ignorant person, or one who is misguided!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AsSalam Alaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakaatuhu</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The example of a servant&#8217;s hope in Allaah&#8217;s mercy and forgiveness</strong><br />
By <strong>Shaykh Ahmad Fareed</strong><br />
Source: Al-Istiqaamah Magazine, Issue No.3 &#8211; Rabî&#8217;ul-Awwal 1417H / August 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The example of a <strong>servants hope in Allaah&#8217;s mercy and forgiveness</strong> can be likened to the <strong>hope of a farmer</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">If the farmer searches for fertile soil, then sows it with good and healthy seeds, giving to the seeds what they need at the appropriate time, removing from around them the weeds and anything else that may hinder or ruin their growth, then he sits and waits for the Favour of Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; with regards to Him keeping away violent storms and other harmful elements, until the seeds have fully ripened and grown &#8211; then this type of waiting and expectation can truly be described as hope. However, if the farmer sows the seeds in hard and barren soil, too high up for water to reach it, and he does nothing to care and protect the seed from harm, and then he sits and waits for a good harvest &#8211; then this waiting and expectation is not called <strong>hope</strong>, rather, such waiting is called <strong>foolishness and delusion</strong>!</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the term hope only applies to waiting for what is dear or desired, after all the means &#8211; that will assist in realising this desire and are within the ability of the person &#8211; have been utilised. As for that which is not within the servants ability, then it is left to the favour of Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; and He is the One who can prevent harmful matters, if He so wishes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">So if the servant sows the seeds of <em>eemaan</em>, and waters them with acts of obedience to Allaah, and cleanses his heart from harmful qualities and traits, then waits for the favour of Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; with regards being granted firmness upon this until death and an excellent end leading to His forgiveness &#8211; then such a wait can truly be called hope. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Indeed those who believe and those who migrate and who make jihaad in the path of Allaah, they are the ones who have the hope of Allaah&#8217;s mercy. And indeed Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most-Merciful.&#8221; </em></span>[Soorah al-Baqarah 2:218].</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of this being that such people are truly worthy of hoping in Allaah&#8217;s mercy. And He did not intend only to particularise them with this, since others also can hope in Allaah&#8217;s mercy. However, He particularised them as being those who truly deserve to hope. So the one whose hope in Allaah&#8217;s mercy guides him to obedience and deters him from disobedience, his hope is true. And the one whose hope invites him to being immersed in sin and disobedience, is in delusion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also necessary to know that truly hoping in something necessitates three things:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><em>Firstly</em>: Yearning for what one hopes.</li>
<li><em>Secondly</em>: Fearing to miss gaining it.</li>
<li><em>Thirdly</em>: Striving to achieve it.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If hope is not connected with any one of these matters, then it is mere <strong>wishful thinking</strong>, since hope is one thing, and wishful thinking something else. And every person who is hopeful, is also fearful, and whosoever traverses a path, makes haste when he fears that he may miss what he hopes for.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AsSalam Alaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakaatuhu</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Supplication for the Best of Both Worlds</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Taken From the articles &#8220;<strong>Reflections</strong>&#8221;<br />
Al-Istiqaamah Magazine, <strong>Issue No.6 &#8211; Dhul-Qa&#8217;dah 1417H / March 1997</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullaah ibn Mas&#8217;ood <em>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</em> relates that the Prophet <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> would supplicate:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;"><em> &#8220;</em>O Allaah! I ask You for guidance, piety, safety and well-being, and contentment and sufficiency<em>.&#8221;</em></span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">[Allaahumma innee as&#8217;alukal-hudaa wat-tuqaa wal-&#8216;afaafa wal-ghinaa].</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Sahih Muslim (no.2721)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam as-Sa&#8217;dee (d.1376H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullaah</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>du&#8217;aa</em> (supplication) is <strong>from the most comprehensive and beneficial <em>du&#8217;aas</em> (supplications),</strong> since it includes asking Allaah for well-being with regards to both the Religion and the world. Thus, <em>al-hudaa</em> (the guidance) is beneficial knowledge, and <em>at-tuqaa </em>(i.e. <em>taqwaa</em> or piety) is righteous actions and leaving-off what Allaah and His Messenger have forbidden; and this is (asking) for correctness and well-being of a person&#8217;s Religion. For indeed, the Religion comprises of beneficial knowledge and recognising the truth &#8211; which is guidance &#8211; and standing firm upon obedience to Allaah and His Messenger <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; and this is piety.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>al-&#8216;afaafa</em> (well-being and safety) and <em>al-ghinaa</em> (contentment and sufficiency) comprises of being safe from (the harms of) the creation and that the heart is not attached to them. And it also comprises of being contented with Allaah and what He provides, and seeking whatever will cause the heart to be satisfied with Him. So with this, happiness in this worldly life is completed, and the heart tastes true sweetness and delight &#8211; and this is a goodly life. So whosoever is granted the provisions of guidance, Piety. well-being and contentment has indeed achieved true happiness, and has acquired all that could be possibly sought after, as well as being saved from all that is dreadful and frightening.&#8221; [<em>Bahjatul-Quloobul-Abraar </em>(p.198)]</p>
