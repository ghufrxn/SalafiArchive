<p class="has-text-align-justify">“<strong>There are no days during which the righteous action is so pleasing to Allah than these days (i.e., the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah)</strong>.” He was asked: “O Messenger of Allah, not even Jihad in the Cause of Allah?” He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, “Not even Jihad in the Cause of Allah, except in case one goes forth with his life and his property and does not return with either of it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">CHAPTER No: 25</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>بيان شيء من أنواع السحر</strong></span></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Clarification of types of Sorcery (As-Sihr)</strong></span></p>



<p>Imam Ahmad (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Muhammad bin Ja&#8217;far narrated from Auf, from Haiyan bin Al- `Ala&#8217;, from Qatan bin Qabisah, from his father that he heard the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) say:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إن العيافة والطرق والطيرة من الجبت</strong></span></h2>



<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Verily, Al-Iyafah (letting birds fly to foretell events) and At-Tarq (drawing lines on earth to predict events) and At-Tiyarah (taking sight on some object as a bad omen) are Al-Jibt (sorceries/magic).&#8221;</strong></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">`Auf (رضي الله عنه) said,</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>العيافة: زجر الطير، والطرق: الخط يخط بالأرض والجبت</strong></span></h2>



<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Al-&#8216;Iyafah is letting a bird&#8217;s flight foretell events while At-Tarq is drawing line on earth.&#8221;</span></strong></p>



<p>Hasan Basri (May Allah be pleased with him) said,</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>والجبت </strong><strong>رنة الشيطان</strong></span></h2>



<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Al- Jibt is the scream of Satan (devil).&#8221;</span></strong></p>



<p>The above Hadith has been narrated through good chain of narrators and collected by Abu Dawud, An-Nasa&#8217;i and Ibn Hibban.</p>



<p>Abu Dawud reported in his book with Sahih lsnad that Ibn Abbas (رضي الله عنه) narrated that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) said:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>من اقتبس شعبة من النجوم، فقد اقتبس شعبة من السحر، زاد ما زاد</strong></span></h2>



<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Whoever learns a part of astrology (drawing knowledge from stars) has learned a part of sorcery (magic). Those who learn more are getting that much more (sin to their credit).&#8221;</span></strong></p>



<p>In An-Nasa&#8217;i, Abu Hurairah (رضي الله عنه) is reported to have said:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>من عقد عقدة ثم نفث فيها فقد سحر، ومن سحر فقد أشرك، ومن تعلق شيئاً وكل إليه</strong></span></h2>



<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Whoever tied a knot and blew on it, has committed sorcery and whoever committed sorcery has committed Shirk. Whoever wears an amulet or talisman will be subjected to its control.&#8221;</span></strong></p>



<p>Ibn Mas&#8217;ud (رضي الله عنه) is reported to have heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) saying:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>ألا هل أنبئكم ما الغضة؟ هي النميمة، القالة بين الناس</strong></span></h2>



<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Shall I not tell you what Al-&#8216;Adh (literally: lying, sorcery etc.) is? It is conveying false rumors for the purpose of causing disputes between people.&#8221;</span> </strong>(Muslim)</p>



<p>Both Sahih collectors reported from Ibn Umar (رضي الله عنه) that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) said:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إن من البيان لسحراً</strong></span></h2>



<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Some eloquence can be (so beautiful that it constitutes) sorcery.”</span></strong></p>



<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Important issues of the Chapter</span></strong></p>



<p>1) Al-&#8216;Iyafah, At-Tarq, At-Tiyarah are three kinds of Al-Jibt (sorcery/magic).<br />2) Al-&#8216;Iyafah, and At-Tarq are explained.<br />3) Astrology too is a kind of sorcery.<br />4) Tying knots and blowing over them is also sorcery.<br />5) An-Namimah (tale bearing, backbiting) is also a form of sorcery.<br />6) Talking sometimes superfluously and eloquently can too be sorcery.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation of Verse 5 of Sooratul Faatiha</strong></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">اهْدِنَا الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">ihdinā aṣ-Ṣirāṭ al-Mustaqīm</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Guide us to the straight path.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;the path&#8221; (aṣ-Ṣirāṭ):</strong></span> Regarding this word, there are two permissible recitations, one with the Arabic letter س (sīn) as in السِّرَاط and another with the letter ص (ṣād) as it is here in the verse: الصِّرَاط . The meaning of <em>aṣ-Ṣirāṭ</em> is the way or path. The meaning of &#8220;<strong>Guide us&#8221;</strong> refers to the guidance of showing and directing to the right path as well as the guidance of granting success. So, by reciting, <strong>&#8220;Guide us to the straight path&#8221;</strong>, you are asking Allah for <strong>beneficial knowledge</strong> (which is the guidance of direction) and <strong>righteous action</strong> (which is the guidance of success in following the knowledge).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;straight&#8221; (al-Mustaqīm):</strong></span> This means the correct path with no crookedness or deviation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Points of Benefit of al-Fātiḥah, Verse 5:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. From the benefits we gain from this verse is the concept of mankind’s resorting back to Allah. After requesting Allah’s help in fulfilling his worship in the previous verse, mankind now asks Allah to guide them to the straight path. There must be sincerity solely to Allah in worship as indicated by the verse, &#8220;<strong>You alone we worship</strong>&#8221; and help must be sought in fulfilling and strengthening this worship as indicated by the verse, &#8220;<strong>and from you alone we seek help</strong>&#8220;. Also, one must follow the Islamic legislation and this is indicated by the verse, &#8220;<strong>Guide us to the straight path</strong>&#8221; because the straight path is none other than the complete legislation with which the messenger ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) has come with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Another point from this verse is that the eloquence of the Qur&#8217;an is shown in that there is no preposition after <strong>&#8220;Guide us&#8221;</strong> in the Arabic text.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808080;">[TN: The author here refers to the original Arabic text. The verse would literally be translated as “Guide us the straight path” without the added English preposition “to.”]</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This point is made so that the verse would contain both types of seeking guidance: the guidance of knowledge and direction, and the guidance of success and action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>This first type</strong></span> is only the directing to and showing the straight path, and Allah guides all of mankind with this meaning of guidance as in his statement:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ الَّذِي أُنْزِلَ فِيهِ الْقُرْآنُ هُدًى لِلنَّاسِ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The month of Ramadan in which the Qur&#8217;an was revealed (as) guidance for mankind</span>. [Sūrah al-Baqarah, 2:185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The second type of guidance</span></strong> is the granting of success along with the first type of guidance and the following of the Islamic legislation as Allah ( سبحانه وتعالى ) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ذَلِكَ الْكِتَابُ لا رَيْبَ فِيهِ هُدًى لِلْمُتَّقِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">That is the book, wherein there is no doubt, a means of guidance for the <em>Muttaqīn</em> (those who are constantly and fearfully conscious of Allah)</span>. [Sūrah al-Baqarah, 2:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This second type of guidance may not be achieved by some people as Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَمَّا ثَمُودُ فَهَدَيْنَاهُمْ فَاسْتَحَبُّوا الْعَمَى عَلَى الْهُدَى</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And as for (the people of) Thamūd, we guided them (i.e. showed them the right way), but they preferred blindness over guidance.</span> [Sūrah al-Fuṣṣilat, 41:17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here,<strong> &#8220;we guided them&#8221;</strong> means: We made clear to them the truth and directed them to follow it but they chose not to accept the guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Another benefit we get from this verse is that the “path” is of two types: one straight and all others crooked.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whatever is in accordance with the truth, it is the straight path as Allah tells the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) to say:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنَّ هَذَا صِرَاطِي مُسْتَقِيمًا فَاتَّبِعُوهُ وَلا تَتَّبِعُوا السُّبُلَ فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكُمْ عَنْ سَبِيلِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And this is my straight path so follow it and do not follow (other) paths for they will separate you away from his (Allah’s) path</span>. [Sūrah al-An’ām, 6:153]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And anything that opposes the truth is a crooked path.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Explanation of Verses 6 &amp; 7  of Sooratul Faatiha</span></strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Ṣirāṭ al-ladhīna an’amta ‘alayhim</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">The path of those you bestowed grace upon</span></strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلا الضَّالِّينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">ghayri al-Maghḍūbi ‘alayhim wa lā aḍ-Ḍālīn</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Not of those who earned anger upon themselves, nor of those who are astray.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The path of those you bestowed grace upon&#8221; (Ṣirāṭ al-ladhīna An’amta ‘alayhim)</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse is connected to the previous verse and provides further clarification of &#8220;the straight path&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;those you bestowed grace upon&#8221; (al-ladhīna an’amta ‘alayhim):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are the same ones mentioned in the statement of Allah in another part of the Qur&#8217;an:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَنْ يُطِعِ اللَّهَ وَالرَّسُولَ فَأُولَئِكَ مَعَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ مِنَ النَّبِيِّينَ  وَالصِّدِّيقِينَ وَالشُّهَدَاءِ وَالصَّالِحِينَ وَحَسُنَ أُولَئِكَ رَفِيقًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever obeys Allah and the messenger, then they will be with those Allah bestowed grace upon of the prophets, the truthful, the martyrs, and the righteous. And what excellent companions they are!</span> [Sūrah an-Nisā, 4:69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Not of those who earned anger upon themselves&#8221; (ghayri al-Maghḍūbi ‘alayhim): </strong>Such as the followers of Judaism and anyone else who knows the truth yet refuses to act according to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;nor of those who are astray&#8221; (wa lā aḍ-Ḍālīn): </strong>Such as the Christians before the mission of the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) began. It also refers to anyone who works contrary to the truth, choosing to remain ignorant of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the word &#8220;upon them&#8221; (‘alayhim), it has two acceptable recitations from the seven forms: one is with a (ḍammah) on the letter هُ (hā) making the reading عَلَيْهُم (‘alayhum) and the other reading is the common one with a (kasrah) on the هِ (hā) which is read as عَلَيْهِم (‘alayhim).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is important to know that any different form of recitation that is not within the copies of the Qur&#8217;an that most people have, this different recitation, even though it is permissible, should not be read among common people who may not be aware of the different ways of reciting. This is due to three reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Even the common people, although unaware of the different forms of recitation, consider this Qur&#8217;an to be something amazing and honorable. Their hearts are filled with its greatness and respect for it. If they began to hear it read sometimes one way and then other times a different way, then this may result in the Qur&#8217;an being lower with them from the high status it was once given. This is only because they are not aware of the various recitations and therefore cannot distinguish between them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. If someone recites with the different forms of recitation, he may be accused of making mistakes and not knowing how to recite. This is because he recites in a way that is unknown to most people. So, this reader, even though may be correct, is then spoken about in a negative way amongst the majority of the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Even if a common person gives someone reciting in a different way the benefit of the doubt and believes that he knows what he recites, then such a person may begin to blindly follow the one reciting in the various ways of reading. So, perhaps he, the common person, may then mistakenly recite a way different from any of the permissible ways believing it to be one of the seven allowable recitations of the Qur&#8217;an. This would then be a form of distortion and corruption. For this reason, ‘Alī (رضي الله عنه), one of the prophet’s companions, said, “<strong>Speak to people according to what they know, (otherwise) would you like that they (unknowingly) deny what Allah and his messenger say (because you confuse them)?”</strong> [Recorded by al-Bukhārī as notes to another ḥadīth (no. 127)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibn Mas’ūd ( رضي الله عنه ), another companion of Prophet Muhammad ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم), said, “<strong>You will never speak to any people with something that they cannot comprehend except that it will become a Fitnah (negative trial or tribulation) for some of them</strong>.” [Recorded by Muslim (no. 14)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whenever ‘Umar Ibn al-Khaṭṭāb heard Hishām Ibn Ḥakīm recite a verse that he had never heard recited in that way before, he (‘Umar) dragged him to the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and informed him of this. The prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said to Hishām:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>اِقْرَأ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Recite</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he finished reading, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>هَكَذَا أُنْزِلَتْ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">It was revealed in this way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) told ‘Umar to recite and afterwards again said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>هَكَذَا أُنْزِلَتْ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">It was (also) revealed in this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;">[Recorded by al-Bukhārī (no. 4992) and Muslim (no. 818)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;an was revealed in seven different dialects and the people used to recite in all of them until ‘Uthmān gathered the people together upon one common recitation because they were beginning to differ and dispute over each other’s recitations. He feared that the differences would become severe, dividing the people. So, he gathered them all together upon one recitation which was the dialect of the Quraysh tribe because the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ), upon whom the Qur&#8217;an was revealed, was sent from and among them. The other forms of recitation were somewhat forgotten by most people. So, if ‘Umar ( رضي الله عنه ) did what he did to another companion, then what about an ordinary person who hears you recite in a way different from the familiar copy of the Qur&#8217;an he has?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And thanks to Allah, the scholars have always been in agreement that it is not compulsory for people to recite in all the different permissible ways. If a person remains reciting upon one particular recitation, there is no problem with this. So, avoid problems and what could lead to them.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Points of Benefit of al-Fātiḥah, Verses 6 and 7:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. From the benefits we gain from these two verses is the mentioning of specific descriptive details after a general description. This is from the verse, &#8220;<strong>Guide us to the straight path</strong>&#8221; – this is a general description and &#8220;<strong>The path of those you bestowed grace upon</strong>&#8221; is a more specific and detailed description of the path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The benefit in mentioning something general and then afterwards more relevant details is that when a person hears of something general that could benefit him, he might eagerly anticipate more details and a clearer explanation. Then, after becoming aware of the detailed descriptions, he is ready to accept them and anxiously hopes to obtain what is mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another benefit is the explanation that the people upon whom Allah has bestowed his favors and grace, they are the same ones who are upon the straight path as a result of this grace.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Another point we learn from this verse is that the blessing of guidance, with which some people have been favored, is directly from Allah alone; it is a pure favor from Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. From the verse, we understand that all of mankind is of either one of three categories: those upon whom Allah has bestowed his grace, those who have earned anger upon themselves, or those who are astray. Each of these categories has already been explained previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ways leading away from the straight path are either <strong>ignorance</strong> or <strong>arrogant disobedience</strong>.The ones who were taken away from the straight path due to arrogance and disobedience, they are those who earned anger upon themselves and the head of this group are the followers of Judaism. The other group, those who have deviated from the straight path due to ignorance, they are any people who do not know the truth, the main ones among these being the Christians. However, this was their (the Christian’s) situation before the advent of the last prophet, Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم). Now that the prophet’s mission has been established and completed, they have known the truth but in spite of that, opposed it. So, they and the Jews both have become the same – all of them are those who have earned anger upon themselves (if they do not repent and accept Allah’s religion).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. These last two verses also illustrate the eloquence of the Qur&#8217;an in that the expression used to refer to those who have earned anger upon themselves, مَغْضُوْب (Maghḍūb), is in the Arabic form (according to Arabic morphology) known as the مَفْعُوْل (maf’ūl) – an Arabic conjugal form that indicates that the anger upon them has already begun and is continuously occurring from Allah and from his close allies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Another point we learn from these verses is that the severest type of misguided group is placed first, then the next in severity. Allah mentioned those who earned anger upon themselves before those who are astray because the first are more severe in opposition to the truth than the ones astray and misguided. Opposing something while being fully aware of it is much harder to return from than opposing something simply because of being ignorant of it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Here, the Arabic noun for the verb used is <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>اِسْتِقَامَة</strong> </span>(<strong>istiqāmah</strong>) which means “<strong>moderation</strong>.” And there is nothing more moderate or just than the justice found within Allah’s legislated religion. Previous legislations were suitable for earlier nations, appropriate for their time, place, and circumstances. Likewise, after the mission of the messenger Muhammad ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ), the legislation he brought is suitable and applicable to those to whom he was sent – everyone from the beginning of his mission until the end of this world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a well-known saying in our religion: The religion of Islam is suitable and ensures the well-being of every time, place, and circumstance. When people stick to it, Allah corrects the affairs of creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consider that a person is instructed to pray standing. If he is unable to stand, then sitting, and if unable to sit, he may pray lying down. In this way, the religion is suitable and easily applied—and progressive—according to the circumstances of each individual. This religion is appropriate for every time, place, and condition. Similarly, someone who washes for prayer may use water if he is able or has it. Otherwise, he may use clean sand or even pray without washing at all. This is because Allah’s religious legislation, all of it, is based on moderation and justice. There is no unfairness, discrimination, oppression, strictness or hardship in it. For this reason, Allah refers to it as &#8220;<strong> the straight path</strong> &#8221; .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The opposite of this <strong>istiqāmah</strong>, this moderation or “<strong>straightness</strong>,” is <strong>deviation</strong> – deviation to the side of extremism and intolerance or deviation to the side of negligence and slackness. So people follow three different paths regarding the religion of Allah: 1) the path of extremism, intolerance, or extravagance; 2) the path of negligence and carelessness, and 3) the path of moderation between the two extremes. This third path is the &#8221; the straight path &#8221; , the praiseworthy manner of following the religion of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the first and second paths, extremism and negligence, both lead to destruction. They destroy their followers with excessiveness or negligence. For example, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) forbade people from going to the extreme of intolerance and harshness; he said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">هَلَكَ الْمُتَنَطِّعُونَ ، هَلَكَ الْمُتَنَطِّعُونَ ، هَلَكَ الْمُتَنَطِّعُونَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">The harsh ones are destroyed, the harsh ones are destroyed, the harsh ones are destroyed.</span></strong>[54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Harshness brings about hardship and causes people to leave the religion of Allah ( عزّ وجلّ ). The other extreme, that of negligence and carelessness, has also been criticized. Allah says, describing the hypocrites:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِذَا قَامُوا إِلَى الصَّلَاةِ قَامُوا كُسَالَىٰ يُرَاءُونَ النَّاسَ وَلَا يَذْكُرُونَ اللَّهَ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And when they stand up for prayer, they stand with laziness and (only) to be seen of men, and they do not remember Allah but little.</span> [Sūrah al-Nisā, 4:142]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The religion of Allah is one of moderation, between extremism and negligence, and this is why Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;For whoever wills among you to take the straight path&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever wills to take this path, let him not deviate right or left. He should constantly remain straight on his religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for this “straightness” as it relates to behaving with the creator—which is to worship him alone—it also relates to one’s behavior with his creation. So your character toward people should be between these two extremes. Neither be harsh, intolerant, and overly strict; nor be careless, or behave as inferior or feeble. Rather, behave with seriousness though with leniency toward others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some scholars used to advise judges to be lenient yet without weakness, strong yet without harshness. One’s leniency and gentleness should not lead him to become weak, yet one’s strength should not lead him to behave harshly with others. Instead, a person should be lenient but not weak, strong without harshness so that he achieves moderation in all his affairs. You find some people always acting rough, inflexible, or confrontational as if he is above everyone else. This is wrong. Others you see them among people as if they were worthless, so humble that they belittle themselves. They behave totally indifferent or as if they have no dignity. This is also wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People should be between the two extremes as was the guidance and character of the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ). He was tough in situations which called for that, gentle when gentleness was appropriate. So we should try to behave with others with seriousness and determination yet also with leniency and mercy.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[54] Collected by Muslim. Imam al-Nawawī, in his explanation of Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim, explained the Arabic word in the ḥadīth المُتَنَطِّعُوْن (<strong>al-Mutanaṭṭi’ūn</strong>), to mean, “<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The extremists who go beyond the limits in their statements and actions</strong></span>.” In another ḥadīth collected by Muslim, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ رَفِيقٌ يُحِبُّ الرِّفْقَ ، وَيُعْطِي عَلَى الرِّفْقِ مَا لا يُعْطِي عَلَى الْعُنْفِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">Indeed, Allah is gentle and loves gentleness. He gives due to gentleness that which he does not give due to harshness.</span></strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">لِمَن شَاءَ مِنكُمْ أَن يَسْتَقِيمَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>For whoever wills among you to take the straight path </strong></span>(Surah al-Takwir Verse 28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>For whoever wills</strong>&#8221; is connected to what came before it, &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">It is only a reminder to the worlds, for whoever among you wills to take the straight path</span>&#8220;. As for those who choose not to take the straight path, they neither accept the reminder, nor do they gain any benefit from it. Allah says about those who do accept the reminder:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لَذِكْر َ لِمَن كَانَ لَهُ قَلْبٌ أَوْ أَلْقَى السَّمْعَ وَهُوَ شَهِيدٌ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>In that is surely a reminder for whoever has a heart or listens while he is heedful.</strong> </span>[Sūrah Qāf, 50:37]</p>
<p>For anyone who does not want to take this straight path, there is no way to benefit such a person with this Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Issue of Freewill:</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here is a question: <strong>Do people actually have freewill to do as they choose?</strong> Yes, people have the freedom to choose as they will. Allah (عزّ وجل) has allowed each person the freedom of choice and freewill; if he wants, he does something, if not he does not do it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this were not the case—if people had no freewill—then anyone to whom the messengers were sent would have an excuse against Allah to plead (because they disbelieved): “<strong>We had no choice in the matter</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So yes, people certainly have the freedom to act on their choices. Each individual knows that if he decides, for example, to visit Mecca, Medina, or some other place, it is by his choice. Anytime a person makes a choice, it is by his own decision. He neither feels others force his choice on him or force him to prefer one thing over another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, if an individual chooses to obey Allah, it is by his own choice. And should someone choose to commit a sin, it is also by his own choice. So people do have freewill yet we know with total certainty that people will never “will,” or actually make something happen (including his own actions), unless Allah has willed it to happen before it happens. For this reason, after &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">For whoever wills among you to take the straight path</span>&#8221; Allah then clarifies: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">And you do not will unless Allah wills</span>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not will for anything to happen unless Allah has already allowed it to happen. So when anything happens, we know Allah has obviously allowed it to take place. If Allah had not allowed it to happen, we could not have willed it to occur ourselves as Allah  (تعالى) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ مَا اقْتَتَلَ الَّذِينَ مِن بَعْدِهِم مِّن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَتْهُمُ الْبَيِّنَاتُ وَلَكِنِ </span><span style="color:#000000;">اخْتَلَفُوا فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ آمَنَ وَمِنْهُم مَّن كَفَرَ ۖ وَلَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ مَا اقْتَتَلُوا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">If Allah had willed, those (generations) succeeding them would not have fought each other after the clear proofs had come to them. But they differed, so some of them believed and some of them disbelieved. And if Allah had willed, they would not have fought each other.</span> [Sūrah al-Baqarah, 2:253]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after we have done anything, we know we chose to do it based on our will and choice, but we also know that this occurred by the will of Allah (عزّ وجل), If he had not willed it, we would not have accomplished it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Now we come to another question:</strong></span> Based on the points above, we then have an excuse to commit sins because whatever happens, Allah allows it and has willed it. We say no, we have no justification for sinning because we have no way of knowing whether Allah has willed something or not until after we have done the deed – after we have chosen to do it. We cannot say, “Allah has willed this for me,” until the sin has already taken place. So once the sin does take place, once it is committed, why was it committed? Because of our freewill and our choice to do it. Therefore, sinners have no justification or excuse before Allah. He nullifies this claim by saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">سَيَقُولُ الَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوا لَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ مَا أَشْرَكْنَا وَلا آبَاؤُنَا وَلا حَرَّمْنَا مِن شَيْءٍ </span><span style="color:#000000;">ۖ كَذَلِكَ كَذَّبَ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ حَتَّى ذَاقُوا بَأْسَنَا </span></h2>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">Those who associated others (in worship) with Allah will say, “If Allah had willed, we would not have associated partners with him, nor would our fathers, and we would not have forbidden anything (against his will).” Likewise, those before them denied until they tasted our punishment.</span> [Sūrah al-An’ām, 6:148]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If they had any justification for making their Shirk (worshipping others with Allah), then they would not have been punished by Allah; they would have been spared the punishment. But they had no right or excuse to worship others, so they were punished. As another example, consider that if someone were informed about a land, safe and peaceful, with sufficient provision and affluence for everyone, everywhere and with successful commerce and a strong economy not found in another land. At the same time, the person is also told of a land where people constantly fear for their lives, live in chaos, having no reliable economy, no law and order, no guaranteed safety for anyone. To which land would he choose to travel? Of course, he travels to the first land and he does not imagine someone, somewhere has forced him to make his decision. He chose the first land based on his own determination and freewill.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have before us now a similar choice: a path to good and a path leading to evil. Allah has already clearly simplified the two for us: this is the path to Paradise, this one to Hell.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, he explained some of what is waiting for us in Paradise of blessings and enjoyment and some punishments that await us in the fire. Which path do we take? Clearly, we would choose the path to Paradise just like we would choose to move to the peaceful land over the land in turmoil. Had we chosen the path to the fire, we alone would have justifiably been to blame. We would have made the worst, most foolish choice just as if we had decided to move to the land of fear and instability. Everyone would understandably hold us responsible for our own choice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, in Allah’s statement &#8220;<strong>For whoever wills among you</strong>&#8220;, he confirms that each individual has the choice and will to decide his actions; he has freewill. Still, we know that even before we do or will anything, once it has happened, we know full well that Allah willed it to happen. Otherwise, it would not have occurred.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many times, people become determined to do something, yet at the last minute they find themselves unable to do it for whatever reason. This is because Allah did not will such an action to take place. For example, we may decide to go to the mosque to attend a lecture, yet on our way there, we may then remember we have some other obligations which prevent us from attending.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a final example, it is said that a common Bedouin, knowing little about the details of religion, was asked, “<strong>How do you know you have a Lord?</strong>” he answered, “<strong>By unfulfilled determination and changes in plans</strong>.” In other words, a person may be fully determined to do something, completely resolved and able to do it. Yet, something totally contradictory to his intentions occurs. Who changed his resolve? He does not think someone made him prefer something over his original decision. Instead, Allah simply did not will it to happen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, a person may plan to do something and sets out to accomplish his plans, but he then finds within himself some reason not to carry out his plans. It may be something physically preventing him or simply a change of mind; he decides to do something else instead. All of this is from Allah (عزّ وجل).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q.316. When does the first hour of the Friday prayer begin?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. The hours which the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) has mentioned are five in number; he said:</p>
<p><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/friday-fisrthour-camel.jpg"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="54213" data-permalink="https://abdurrahman.org/2019/01/14/when-does-the-first-hour-of-the-friday-prayer-begin/friday-fisrthour-camel/" data-orig-file="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/friday-fisrthour-camel.jpg" data-orig-size="745,155" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;AbdurRahman Meda&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1547491667&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="friday-fisrthour-camel" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/friday-fisrthour-camel.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/friday-fisrthour-camel.jpg?w=715" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54213" src="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/friday-fisrthour-camel.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="114" srcset="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/friday-fisrthour-camel.jpg?w=550&amp;h=114 550w, https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/friday-fisrthour-camel.jpg?w=100&amp;h=21 100w, https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/friday-fisrthour-camel.jpg?w=300&amp;h=62 300w, https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/friday-fisrthour-camel.jpg 745w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#333300;">Whoever bathed on Friday, performing the <em>Ghusl</em> of major ritual impurity (<em>Janabah</em>), then went (to the Masjid) in the first hour, he is like one who offers a camel as a sacrifice, and he who comes at the second hour is like one who offers a cow, and he who comes at the third hour is like one who offers a ram with horns, and he who comes at the fourth hour is like one who offers a hen, and he who comes at the fifth hour is like one who offers an egg</span></strong>.&#8221; [<span style="color:#ff0000;">01</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, he has divided the time from sunrise until the arrival of the Imam into five parts. Each part might be equivalent to the well known hour (i.e. 60 minutes), or the hour might be more or less, because the time changes, so the hours are five between the sunrise and the arrival of the Imam for the prayer. It begins from sunrise, although it has been said that it is from the start of Fajr, but the former is more likely, because before sunrise is the time for the Fajr prayer.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">The Explanation of Verse 1 of Sooratul Faatiha</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">(<span style="color:#008000;">al-Ḥamdu lillāhi Rabbil-‘Ālamīn</span>)<br />
<strong>All praise and thanks are for Allah, the lord of all creations.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>&#8220;All praise and thanks&#8221; (al-Ḥamd):</strong></span> This word الْحَمْدُ (<strong>al-Ḥamd</strong>) is used only to describe someone, out of love and honor, with complete perfection of self, attributes, and actions. So, Allah is perfect in his self, his attributes, and his actions. This praising, however, must be with a condition, it must be made with love and honor. The people of knowledge say that simply describing someone with perfection yet not out of real love and honor for the praised one is not called حَمْدُ (Ḥamd). Rather, in that case it would only be called مَدْح (<strong>Madḥ</strong>) (a lesser degree of praise or admiration). Therefore, this (second) type of praising occurs often from people while they may not really love the one they are praising. Often, they only want to gain something from them. For example, some poets stand before their government leaders and recite poetry of amazing praiseworthy descriptions of them yet void of any real love for them. The poets’ love is for the wealth they are given or they do this out of fear of the leaders. On the contrary, our praise for our lord is a form of praise out of love and honor.<strong> So, &#8220;All praise and thanks&#8221; is to praise the one described with total perfection out of love and honor for him</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ال (al-) in الْحَمْدُ (al-Ḥamd) is inclusive, meaning that it includes all forms of praise and thanks.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;are for Allah&#8221; (lillāhi):</span> </strong>The لِ (li) is to show possession and a sense of deserving. The name “Allah” is the proper name of our lord ( عزّ وجلّ ) and no one else is given this name; it means the one god that is worshipped out of love and honor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;the lord&#8221; (Rabb):</span></strong> The word “lord” here includes three main descriptions: the creator, the owner, and the controller of all affairs. So, he is the creator of all that exists, the owner of all that exists, and the controller of everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;of all creations&#8221; (al-‘Ālamīn):</span> </strong>As for the word “‘Ālamīn”, the scholars say it refers to anything and everything other than Allah. Everything else besides Allah is described with this word because the very existence of everything is a sign or indication (in Arabic: Ālam) that they have a creator (سبحانه وتعالى) In every form of creation there is a sign indicating the existence of its creator, his capability, wisdom, mercy, power, and the rest of his attributes of lordship.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Points of Benefit of al-Fātiḥah, Verse 1:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. One of the beneficial points we gain from this verse is the affirmation of praise of perfection to Allah ( عزّ وجلّ ). This is shown by the “al-” in the word “al-Ḥamd” because this definite article in Arabic grammar is inclusive to include all forms or praise and gratitude.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. It also shows that Allah alone deserves all forms of praise and gratitude. For this reason, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) used to say whenever something happened he was happy with:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">الحَمْدُ للهِ الَّذِي بِنِعْمَتِهِ تُتِمُّ الصَّالِحَات</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>All praise and thanks are for Allah by whose favor righteous deeds are fulfilled.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he would say when if something did not please him:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">الحَمْدُ للهِ عَلَى كُلِّ حَالٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>All praise and thanks are for Allah in all situations</strong>.[<span style="color:#ff0000;">18</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Another point of benefit from the verse is the description of Allah with his sole right to worship first before describing him with his lordship. This is either indicated because the name “Allah” is his proper name, specific to him and the source of all the rest of His names; or it is due to the fact that the people the messengers were sent to used to only deny Allah’s sole right to worship. Most of the people did not deny Allah’s lordship (that he is the creator, owner, and controller of everything).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. This verse also proves Allah’s complete lordship over all of the creations due to his statement: &#8220;<strong>The lord of all creation</strong>s.&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">18</span>] Recorded by Ibn Mājah (no. 3803) and al-Ḥākim in his “Mustadrak” (1/449) and he said, “This ḥadīth has an authentic chain of narrators.” adh-Dhahabī agreed with him. The famous ḥadīth scholar, al-Albānī, said it is “ḥasan” in “Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan Ibn Mājah” (no. 3066).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"></p>



<p>On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (<em>radi Allaahu anhu</em>) who said:&nbsp;The Messenger of Allah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,&nbsp; “Verily Allah <em>ta’ala</em> has said:</p>



<p><span style="color: #008000">‘Whosoever shows enmity to a <strong><a style="color: #008000" href="https://abdurrahman.org/category/islam/awliya/"><em>wali</em></a> </strong>(friend) of Mine, then I have declared war against him. And My servant does not draw near to Me with anything more loved to Me than the religious duties I have obligated upon him. And My servant continues to draw near to me with <em>nafil</em> (supererogatory) deeds until I Love him. When I Love him, I am his hearing with which he hears, and his sight with which he sees, and his hand with which he strikes, and his foot with which he walks. Were he to ask [something] of Me, I would surely give it to him; and were he to seek refuge with Me, I would surely grant him refuge.’</span> ”</p>



<p>[Bukhari]</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What is Shirk?</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You may have already studied Tawḥīd. However, to truly understand Tawḥīd, its opposite, Shirk, must also be understood. The greatest thing Allah has commanded us to do is worship him alone, and the greatest sin he has forbidden is Shirk as He says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئً</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Worship Allah and do not make Shirk with anything along with him.</span> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is Shirk? Shirk (شِرْك) is an Arabic word which means <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>sharing something with others that only Allah deserves</strong></span>. Worshipping others along with Allah is the main type of Shirk. The verse above means we must worship Allah and only him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever worships someone or something instead of Allah, he is a disbeliever in Allah who has refused to worship him alone. If someone worships Him but also worships someone else along with Allah, he is still a disbeliever in Allah, and it is this person who makes Shirk. As for someone who worships Allah alone, he is a Muslim who sincerely believes in Tawḥīd.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shirk is the greatest sin against Allah and he says about it:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدِ افْتَرَى إِثْمًا عَظِيمًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever makes Shirk with Allah has certainly made up a great sin</span>.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shirk is also the worst of all major sins. Prophet Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) once asked his companions:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَلا أُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِأَكْبَرِ الْكَبَائِرِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Should I tell you the greatest of all major sins?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His companions said, “Of course, messenger of Allah.” He then said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الإِشْرَاكُ بِاللَّهِ وَعُقُوقُ الْوَالِدَيْنِ وَشَهَادَةُ الزُّورِ أَوْ قَوْلُ الزُّورِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Making Shirk with Allah, disobeying parents, and lying.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was laying back when he said that, but then he sat up and began repeating that over and over because of how serious Shirk and those other major sins are in Islam. [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) was also asked, “What is the greatest sin?” He answered:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَنْ تَجْعَلَ لِلَّهِ نِدًّا وَهُوَ خَلَقَكَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">That you make something equal to Allah while he is the (only) one who created you.</span> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Making someone or something equal to Allah is Shirk. It is to belittle Allah, believing him to be less than He is while believing others are equal to Him. About this, Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بِرَبِّهِمْ يَعْدِلُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Those who disbelieve think others are equal to their Lord.</span>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though Allah lets people choose to make Shirk and believe others are equal to Him, He does not like it and forbids us from doing so:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَلا تَجْعَلُوا لِلَّهِ أَندَادًا وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So do not make anything equal with Allah while you know (that he alone should be worshipped).</span>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shirk is also to deny the very reason Allah created us which was to worship him alone as he says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالإِنسَ إِلاَّ لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">I only created Jinn and people to worship me.</span>[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever worships others along with Allah, believing they deserve to be worshipped, they have made the creation equal to its creator. This is the worse comparison because it is to believe that people who are helpless and in need are equal to Allah, the one who is able to do anything and who needs nothing from any of his creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shirk is the greatest crime of injustice and unfairness. This is because the greatest rights are the rights Allah deserves. Yet when people make Shirk, they are refusing to give him what he deserves most &#8211; Tawḥīd. This is the greatest form of injustice and unfairness just like Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الشِّرْكَ لَظُلْمٌ عَظِيمٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Shirk is certainly a great crime of injustice.</span>[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shirk is also the greatest form of misguidance and straying from the right way of believing in Allah:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلالاً بَعِيدًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever makes Shirk with Allah has certainly gone far astray.</span>[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In short, Shirk is to share something that only Allah deserves with others such as worshipping others or describing others with Allah’s descriptions. It is the greatest sin against Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Review</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. What is Allah’s greatest command to us?<br />
2. What is the greatest sin against Allah?<br />
3. Explain in your own words the meaning of Shirk.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">SHIRK IN TAWḤĪD OF LORDSHIP</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you learned about Tawḥīd, you may remember there are three main categories. Let us review the categories of Tawḥīd before moving on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Tawḥīd of Lordship: Allah is the only one who creates, owns, and controls everything.<br />
2. Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions: Allah is the only one who is described with his perfect names and descriptions.<br />
3. Tawḥīd of Worship: Allah is the only one who deserves worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shirk in Tawḥīd of Lordship is to believe that others besides Allah create or share control over his creation. This belief means that someone other than Allah can make good things happen or keep bad things from happening.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One example of this type of Shirk is to believe something brings good luck. People often have “good luck” rings or similar items they believe will help good things happen to them. Others tie special strings around them or their children, believing that if they recite the Qur&#8217;aan over the strings, they will protect from bad things happening. However, only Allah can protect us from bad things and we should only seek his protection in ways he mentions in the Qur&#8217;aan or the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) taught us in the ḥadīth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another common example of Shirk in Tawḥīd of Lordship today is when people believe others like themselves who are created and have no control in Allah’s universe can control what happens. Such people even wait until the ones they believe in are dead before worshipping them by praying to them. The act of praying to dead people is Shirk in Tawḥīd of Worship (which we will cover shortly), but the belief itself is also Shirk in Tawḥīd of Lordship because when people pray to dead people, they believe the souls of humans can control things in this life even after their death. This is completely wrong because the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) told us:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">When a person dies, his actions come to an end except for (receiving rewards for) three things: continuous charity, beneficial knowledge, or a righteous child who prays for him.</span> [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While a person may still receive rewards from Allah for things he left behind after he died, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) clearly told us that after death, a human being’s actions stop. So how can dead people control whether good and bad things happen in life when they are not even in life anymore? Still, some people continue to pray to the dead, asking for their help in changing events in this life although only Allah can do this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even if a dead person was a righteous worshipper of Allah, believing that dead people or anyone else controls things in this life is Shirk in Tawḥīd of Lordship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Review</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. What is Shirk in Tawḥīd of Lordship?<br />
2. Give an example of Shirk in Tawḥīd of Lordship.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>SHIRK IN TAWḤĪD OF NAMES AND DESCRIPTIONS</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions is to believe that Allah is the only one who deserves to be described with perfect names and descriptions. Shirk in this category of Tawḥīd is to believe that Allah can be described with descriptions of the creation, or to believe that others besides Allah share in his descriptions. So believing that Allah is like his creation or that his creation is like Allah is Shirk.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Describing Allah with Descriptions of His Creation</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When people describe Allah with the descriptions of creation or they believe Allah is similar to people, they have made Shirk in Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions. There are several ways this type of Shirk is made. One example is when people make statues or paintings of God, claiming they are images of Allah. By doing so, they have described Allah in the image or form of people although Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like him.</span> [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today, Christians fall into this type of Shirk when they believe Allah has a son. They believe the Messiah, Prophet Jesus the son of Mary, is his son. Allah knows they believe this and he says about this statement of Shirk and disbelief:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالُوا اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَٰنُ وَلَدًا </span><span style="color:#000000;">لَّقَدْ جِئْتُمْ شَيْئًا إِدًّا </span><span style="color:#000000;">تَكَادُ السَّمَاوَاتُ يَتَفَطَّرْنَ مِنْهُ وَتَنشَقُّ الْأَرْضُ وَتَخِرُّ الْجِبَالُ هَدًّا </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَن دَعَوْا لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ وَلَدًا  </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا يَنبَغِي لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَدًا  </span><span style="color:#000000;">إِن كُلُّ مَن فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ إِلَّا آتِي الرَّحْمَٰنِ عَبْدًا</span></h2>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">And they say, “The Most-Merciful has a son.” You have said a terrible thing. The heavens are almost torn, the earth is split open, and the mountains almost fall in ruin because they claim the Most-Merciful has a son. But it is not suitable that the Most-Merciful has a son. There is no one in the heavens and earth except that will come to the Most-Merciful as a servant. </span>[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah explains who Prophet Jesus truly is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّمَا الْمَسِيحُ عِيسَى ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, was only a messenger of Allah.</span> [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example of Shirk in Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions is when many Jewish people claim that Allah likes the Jews more than all other people – just because they were born to a Jewish parent. This belief of theirs means that Allah is prejudice and unfair just like some people are, and this is describing Allah with descriptions of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our belief in Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions is that Allah is not like his creation. He alone deserves the highest descriptions. When someone believes that Allah is like his creation, they have made Shirk in Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions by giving Allah the descriptions of his creation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Describing Creation with Allah’s Descriptions</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The belief that created beings or things share Allah’s names or descriptions is also Shirk in Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions. This type of Shirk is when people raise other humans up to the level of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today, some Christians describe people with Allah’s descriptions. They believe Prophet Jesus or saints can hear their prayers while Allah alone is the All-Hearing. Some Christians even believe Jesus was Allah in the form of a man. This is a form of describing Allah with descriptions of people as well as describing the creation with the descriptions of Allah. About this statement of Shirk and disbelief, Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَقَدْ كَفَرَ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْمَسِيحُ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">They have surely disbelieved who say, “Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary.”</span> [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By believing that someone is nicer than Allah, more merciful, more forgiving, or treats others more fairly than Allah, this is giving created people Allah’s descriptions and this is Shirk in Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">SHIRK IN TAWḤĪD OF WORSHIP</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tawḥīd of Worship means we believe Allah is the only one who deserves worship. Since Shirk is the opposite of Tawḥīd, Shirk in Tawḥīd of Worship is worshipping others along with Allah. We must never share our worship with other than Allah. There are two types of Shirk in this category: Major Shirk and Minor Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is important to remember that both types of Shirk, major and minor, may be in other categories of Tawḥīd as well as Tawḥīd of Worship. We should not become overwhelmed or confused deciding if a statement or action is Shirk in this category of Tawḥīd or that one. Instead, we simply should concentrate on believing in, describing, and worshipping Allah alone as Islam instructs us. Still, we will discuss some differences between Major Shirk and Minor Shirk.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Major Shirk</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Major Shirk is any type of Shirk the Qur&#8217;aan or the ḥadīth explains that whoever does it is not considered a Muslim, not within the religion of Islam, and is not a true believer in Allah. Major Shirk dooms the person to live in Hell forever if he does not stop making Major Shirk before he dies. Any form of worship that is done for other than Allah is Major Shirk, such as praying to others besides Allah or hoping for things from others that only Allah can give (e.g. forgiveness, Paradise, etc.).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A common example of Major Shirk is when people pray to other people such as prophets or visit the graves of saints, believing those people hear or answer prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This form of Shirk is the greatest sin and the most unfair way to behave toward the Lord of all creation. We will mention some of the results of Major Shirk if a person dies while believing in it and doing acts of Major Shirk in worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Major Shirk Removes Hope of Entering Paradise</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says about the punishment for someone who dies while making Major Shirk:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهُ مَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدْ حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ الْجَنَّةَ وَمَأْوَاهُ النَّارُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Surely, whoever makes Shirk with Allah, Allah will make Paradise forbidden to him and his final home will be the fire.</span> [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Major Shirk Guarantees Entrance into the Fire</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said about someone who meets Allah while making Shirk:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ لَقِيَ اللهَ لا يُشْرِكُ بِهِ شَيْئاً دَخَلَ الجَنَّةَ ، وَمَنْ لَقِيَهُ يُشْرِكُ بِهِ شَيْئاً دَخَلَ النَّار</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Whoever meets Allah without making Shirk with him will enter Paradise, and whoever meets him making Shirk with him will enter the fire</span>. [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We will meet Allah when we die, and one of the most common ways people make Major Shirk is by praying to and calling upon someone other than Allah. For this reason, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) clearly said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ مَاتَ وَهْوَ يَدْعُو مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ نِدًّا دَخَلَ النَّارَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Whoever dies while calling upon anything other than Allah, making them equal to Allah (in worship), he will enter the fire.</span> [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Major Shirk Ruins All Good Deeds</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone makes Major Shirk, all their good deeds may be ruined and lost. Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَوْ أَشْرَكُوا لَحَبِطَ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And if they had made Shirk, whatever (good) they used to do would be ruined.</span> [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he also says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَقَدْ أُوحِيَ إِلَيْكَ وَإِلَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكَ لَئِنْ أَشْرَكْتَ لَيَحْبَطَنَّ عَمَلُكَ وَلَتَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">It has been revealed to you and to those before you, if you make Shirk, your deeds will be ruined and you will certainly be among the losers.</span>[20]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Minor Shirk</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Minor Shirk is any type of saying or action that the Qur&#8217;aan or ḥadīth describes as being Shirk but that the person who says or does it could still be considered a Muslim, still inIslam, and is still a believer in Allah. However, Minor Shirk does mean that the person’s belief in Tawḥīd may be incorrect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some actions or statements are considered Minor Shirk. For example, saying something like, “If it was not for Allah and you, something bad would have happened!” Someone once said to Prophet Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم), “Whatever Allah wants and you want (to happen will happen).” The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) explained that such things are not correct to say; he said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَجَعَلْتَنِي مَعَ اللهِ عَدْلاً ؟ لا بَلْ : مَا شَاءَ اللهُ وَحْدَهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Have you made me an equal with Allah? No, instead say: “Whatever Allah alone wants (to happen will happen).”</span> [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some common superstitions are also Minor Shirk. For example, if someone believes Allah will allow bad things to happen if he does not wear a certain ring or hang verses from the Qur&#8217;aan in his car, this is a form of Minor Shirk because Allah has not made those things ways to prevent bad things from happening. However, if someone believes those things themselves actually prevent bad things from happening instead of Allah, then this becomes Major Shirk. Such a wrong belief would then mean there are other things besides Allah that control creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another form of Minor Shirk is harder to recognize. This type of “hidden Shirk” is in a person’s intention, or the reason he does something. When someone does a good deed—which he should do for only Allah—yet he does his good deed just for people to think he is a good worshipper, this is a form of Minor Shirk. Examples of this may be if someone prays very well, raises his voice while remembering Allah or reading the Qur&#8217;aan, or gives charity but he does so only for people to think and say good things about him. About this type of showing off, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إنَّ أَخْوَفَ مَا أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ الشِّرْكَ الأَصْغَرَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">The thing I fear for you the most is Minor Shirk.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His companions asked, “What is Minor Shirk, messenger of Allah?” He (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) answered:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الرِّيَاء ، يَقُوْلُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ : اِذْهَبُوْا إِلَى الَّذِيْنَ كُنْتُمْ تُرَاؤُوْنَ فِي الدُّنْيَا ،فَانْظُرُوْا هَلْ تَجِدُوْنَ عِنْدَهُمْ جَزَاءً</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Showing off (riyā). Allah ( عزّ وجلّ ) will say, <span style="color:#008000;">“Go to those you were showing off for during life and see if you can find any reward with them.”</span></span> [22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Minor Shirk Ruins Good Deeds Done for Showing Off</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Good deeds will not be accepted if they are done for anyone other than Allah. While Major Shirk ruins all a person’s good deeds, Minor Shirk ruins only the deeds that were done for showing off. The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) says about this Shirk in intention:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ اللَّهُ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى : أَنَا أَغْنَى الشُّرَكَاءِ عَنْ الشِّرْكِ ، مَنْ عَمِلَ عَمَلاً أَشْرَكَ فِيهِ مَعِي غَيْرِي تَرَكْتُهُ وَشِرْكَهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Allah ( تبارك وتعالى ) said,<span style="color:#008000;"> “I am in no need of Shirk. Whoever does a deed but does so for someone else besides me, I will reject him and his Shirk”</span>.</span> [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the prophet’s companions named Abū Mūsá al-‘Ash’arī ( رضي الله عنه ) said: The messenger of Allah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) once gave us a talk and said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ ، اتَّقُوا هَذَا الشِّرْكَ فَإِنَّهُ أَخْفَى مِنْ دَبِيبِ النَّمْلِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Oh people, be afraid of this Shirk because it is more hidden than a creeping ant.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While Major Shirk is much worse than Minor Shirk, both are sins against Allah. For this reason, we should stay away from all forms of Shirk because Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Allah will not forgive that Shirk is made with him.</span> [24]</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">CONCLUSION</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not study Tawḥīd and Shirk simply to memorize detailed categories and types of Shirk. We learn Tawḥīd for the purpose of getting closer to Allah by believing in and worshipping him in the way he wants. And we do so only to make him happy with the hope of achieving his forgiveness and entering his Paradise. Similarly, we learn Shirk so we know what beliefs, statements, and actions make Allah unhappy. Remember, while learning the details of Tawḥīd and Shirk may help us know what Allah wants from us, he did not make our religion difficult upon us, he simply instructed us to:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئً</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Worship Allah and do not make Shirk with anything along with him.</span> [25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The important thing to remember is that Allah is the only Lord, the only creator, owner, and controller of everything and everyone in the universe. He is the only one who we describe with the names and descriptions of perfection and we truly believe Allah is not like his creation and his creation is not like him. Allah tells us:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing equal or comparable to him.</span> [26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because we believe Allah is the only Lord and only he deserves the highest descriptions, it only makes sense that we worship him and no one else. So do not let your study of Tawḥīd and Shirk become difficult or confusing. By simply reading about this knowledge, you have taken steps to get closer to Allah. Read what Allah says about those who try to come closer to Allah and those who avoid Shirk:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَنْ تَقَرَّبَ مِنِّي شِبْرًا تَقَرَّبْتُ مِنْهُ ذِرَاعًا ، وَمَنْ تَقَرَّبَ مِنِّي ذِرَاعًا تَقَرَّبْتُ مِنْهُ بَاعًا ، وَمَنْ أتَانِي يَمْشِي أتَيْتُهُ هَرْوَلَةً ، وَمَنْ لَقِيني بِقُرَابِ الأرْض خَطِيئةً لا يُشْرِكُ بِي شَيئاً ، لَقِيتُهُ بِمِثْلِهَا مَغفِرَةً</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Whoever comes close to me a hand-span, I will come close to him an arm’s length; and whoever comes close to me an arm’s length, I will come close to him the distance of two outstretched arms. Whoever comes to me walking, I will come to him running. And whoever meets me with the earth full of sins but does not make Shirk in anything with me, I will meet him with as much forgiveness.” [27]</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">A PRAYER FOR PROTECTION FROM SHIRK</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) once said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الشِّرْكُ فِيكُمْ أَخْفَى مِنْ دَبِيْبِ النَّمْلِ ، وَسَأَدُلُّكَ عَلَى شَيْ ء إِذَا فَعَلْتَهُ أَذْهَبَ عَنْكَ صِغَارَ الشِّرْكِ وَكِبَارَهُ ، تَقُولُ : اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوْذُ بِكَ أَنْ أُشْرِكَ بِكَ وَأَنَا أَعْلَمُ ، وَأَسْتَغْفِرُكَ لِمَا لا أَعْلَمُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Shirk among you is more hidden than a creeping ant, but I will guide you to something that, if you do it, will remove from you Minor Shirk and its Major type. You should say, “<strong>Oh Allah, I ask for your protection from making Shirk with you while I know, and I ask your forgiveness for what I do not know</strong>.”</span> [28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because our belief in Tawḥīd is that Allah is the only one who can help us and we only pray to him, we understand that only he can help us stay away from Shirk completely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of this, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) taught us to ask his protection from knowingly making Shirk in belief, statement, or action. We must also ask for his forgiveness if we happen to make a mistake by believing, saying, or doing anything that is Shirk that we may not know.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <strong><span style="color:#993300;">Is the Basmalah (بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ) an actual verse of Sūrah al-Fātiḥah or Not?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Uthaymeen:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars hold differing opinions about this issue. Some say that it is definitely a verse from al-Fātiḥah and it should be recited aloud in those prayers which are recited out-loud. They believe it is not correct unless the Basmalah is recited since it is part of the entire chapter of al-Fātiḥah. Other scholars say that it is not a verse of al-Fātiḥah, but it is a separate verse from the book of Allah. This latter opinion is the correct one and is proven by other texts as well as the context of the chapter itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the textual proof, Abū Hurayrah ( رضي الله عنه ) narrated a ḥadīth in which the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/I-have-divided-the-prayer-in-two-parts-between-myself-and-my-servant.png"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="53610" data-permalink="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/12/16/is-the-basmalah-an-actual-verse-of-surah-al-fati%e1%b8%a5ah-or-not/i-have-divided-the-prayer-in-two-parts-between-myself-and-my-servant/" data-orig-file="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/I-have-divided-the-prayer-in-two-parts-between-myself-and-my-servant.png" data-orig-size="761,329" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="I have divided the prayer in two parts between myself and my servant" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/I-have-divided-the-prayer-in-two-parts-between-myself-and-my-servant.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/I-have-divided-the-prayer-in-two-parts-between-myself-and-my-servant.png?w=715" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-53610" src="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/I-have-divided-the-prayer-in-two-parts-between-myself-and-my-servant.png" alt="I have divided the prayer in two parts between myself and my servant" width="550" height="238" srcset="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/I-have-divided-the-prayer-in-two-parts-between-myself-and-my-servant.png?w=550&amp;h=238 550w, https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/I-have-divided-the-prayer-in-two-parts-between-myself-and-my-servant.png?w=100&amp;h=43 100w, https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/I-have-divided-the-prayer-in-two-parts-between-myself-and-my-servant.png?w=300&amp;h=130 300w, https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/I-have-divided-the-prayer-in-two-parts-between-myself-and-my-servant.png 761w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah ( تَعَالَى ) says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“I have divided the prayer in two parts between myself and my servant.” When the servant recites, &#8220;All praise and thanks are to Allah, the lord of all creations&#8221;, Allah says, “My servant has praised me.” And when he recites, &#8220;The Most-Merciful, the Bestower of all mercy&#8221;, Allah says, “My servant has honored me.” When he recites, &#8220;The owner of the Day of Recompense&#8221;, Allah says, “My servant has glorified me.” When he recites, &#8220;You alone we worship and from you alone we seek help&#8221;, Allah replies, “This is two parts between my servant and I.” When he recites, &#8220;Guide us to the straight path…&#8221; until the end of the chapter, Allah replies, “This is for My servant and he will have what he asks for.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Recorded by Muslim (no. 395)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a textual proof that the <em>Basmalah</em> is not an actual verse of Sūrah al-Fātiḥah (because it was not the first statement the servant says as mentioned in this ḥadīth).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is another authentic statement of Anas ibn Mālik ( رضي الله عنه ) in “Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim” in which he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>I prayed behind the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ), Abū Bakr, and ‘Umar and none of them used to mention “In the name of Allah, the Most-Merciful, the Bestower of all mercy” at the beginning of their recitations (of Sūrah al-Fātiḥah) nor at the end of it.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Recorded by Muslim (no. 399)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant is that each of them used not to mention it aloud. The fact that there is a distinction between it not being recited aloud as the rest of al-Fātiḥah is recited indicates that it is not actually a part of the chapter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the proof from the context of the other verses’ meanings, Sūrah al-Fātiḥah consists of seven verses as is unanimously agreed upon. If you wanted to measure out seven verses as they pertain to the topics of the chapter, you will find that the middle verse is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">You alone we worship and from you alone we seek help.</span> [Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the same verse about which Allah says, “This is two parts between my servant and I” in the previous ḥadīth. This is because the first verse is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">All praise and thanks are for Allah, the Lord of all creations</span>. [Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second verse is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيم</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Most Merciful, the Bestower of all mercy.</span> [Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third verse:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The owner of the Day of Recompense.</span> [Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These three previous verses are all about the rights of Allah (his attribute, actions, etc.).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the verse:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">You alone we worship, and from you alone we seek help.</span>[Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the fourth verse and the half-way point and it too is even divided into two parts, one part for Allah (“You alone we worship…”) and one part for the servant (“…from you alone we seek help.”).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following verses are:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اهْدِنَا الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Guide us to the straight path.</span> [Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is for the servant.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The path of those upon whom You bestowed Your grace.</span> [Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is also for the servant.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلا الضَّالِّينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Not of those who earned anger upon themselves, nor of those who are astray.</span> [Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And finally, this last verse is also for the servant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, three verses are for Allah ( عزّ وجلّ ) and they are the first three. And three verses are for the servant and they are the last three. One verse is between both the servant and his lord and it is the fourth and middle verse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the proof from the context of the wordings, if we say that the <em>Basmalah</em> is a verse of Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, then the seventh verse would be very long – as long as two of the other verses (thus making the last and incomparably long verse, “The path of those upon whom you bestowed your grace, not of those who earned anger, nor of those who are astray.”). But it is known that the principle of the verses being similar to each other is also regarding their length.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">So, the correct opinion no doubt is that the <em>Basmalah</em> is not a verse of Sūrah al-Fātiḥah just as it is not a verse (at the beginning) of every other chapter in the Qur&#8217;an.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Eight Event</strong></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Allāh Judges Creation</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic word commonly used here, مُحَاسَبَة (<em>muḥāsabah</em>) or حِسَاب (<em>ḥisāb</em>), “judging,” “reckoning,” or “taking to account” is when people will be called to recollect, admit, and be judged on the Day of Resurrection for the actions they did in this life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As far religious evidence for this event, it is confirmed by the Qur&#8217;aan, the Sunnah, the consensus of mainstream Muslims, and even suggested by one’s intellect.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Qur&#8217;aan, Allah (تعالى) says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ إِلَيْنَا إِيَابَهُمْ  ثُمَّ إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا حِسَابَهُم</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Certainly, to us is their return, then certainly upon us is their reckoning</span>.[Sūrah al-Ghāshiyah, 88:25-26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">فَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ بِيَمِينِهِ فَسَوْفَ يُحَاسَبُ حِسَابًا يَسِيرًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Then as for he who is given his record in his right hand, he will be judged with an easy reckoning.</span> [Sūrah al-Inshiqāq, 84:7-8]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Sunnah, numerous ḥadīth have been authentically reported from the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) that Allah will judge his creations. For example, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) used to say in some of his prayers:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُمَّ حَاسِبْنِي حِسَابًا يَسِيْرًا </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">Oh Allah, call me to account with an easy reckoning.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Upon hearing this, ‘Āishah (رضي الله عنها) asked, “What is an easy reckoning?” He answered:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَنْ يَنْظُرَ فِي كِتَابِهِ فَيَتَجَاوَزُ عَنْهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>That he looks into his book but pardons him (or finds in his book that he has been pardoned)</em>.</span>[86]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the consensus among mainstream Muslims, the entire nation of believers has always agreed that Allah will judge creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the intellect, it is understood that Allah will judge us because we have been made responsible for actions: obligated to do some, obligated to avoid some, and obligated to hold certain beliefs. Intellect and wisdom dictates that anyone made responsible for something will be held accountable for it and judged for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">There are, however, some people who will be exempt from being judged;</span></strong> they will be allowed to enter Paradise without judgment or punishment. This has been confirmed in “Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī” and “Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim.” The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">عُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الأُمَمُ فَأَخَذَ النَّبِيُّ يَمُرُّ مَعَهُ الأُمَّةُ وَالنَّبِيُّ يَمُرُّ مَعَهُ النَّفَرُ وَالنَّبِيُّ يَمُرُّ</span><span style="color:#000000;">مَعَهُ الْعَشَرَةُ وَالنَّبِيُّ يَمُرُّ مَعَهُ الْخَمْسَةُ وَالنَّبِيُّ يَمُرُّ وَحْدَهُ ، فَنَظَرْتُ فَإِذَا سَوَادٌ كَثِيرٌ </span><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْتُ : يَا جِبْرِيلُ هَؤُلاءِ أُمَّتِي ؟ قَالَ : لا وَلَكِنْ انْظُرْ إِلَى الأُفُقِ ، فَنَظَرْتُ فَإِذَا سَوَادٌ </span><span style="color:#000000;">كَثِيرٌ ، قَالَ : هَؤُلاءِ أُمَّتُكَ وَهَؤُلاءِ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا قُدَّامَهُمْ لا حِسَابَ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلا عَذَابَ ، </span><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْتُ : وَلِمَ ؟ قَالَ : كَانُوا لا يَكْتَوُونَ وَلا يَسْتَرْقُونَ وَلا يَتَطَيَّرُونَ وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ </span><span style="color:#000000;">يَتَوَكَّلُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">I was shown the nations (of prophets) and I saw a prophet with an entire nation with him, a prophet with only a single follower, a prophet with ten followers, a prophet with five, and a prophet with none. I then saw a huge crowd and asked, “Oh (Angel) Gabriel, is this my nation?” to which he replied, “No, but look to the horizon.” I then looked and saw a huge nation (of followers). Gabriel said, “This is your nation and in front of them are seventy thousand who will have no judgment and no punishment.” I asked, “Why?” He answered, “They did not practice cauterization, did not seek ruqyá (incantations, healings with Qur&#8217;aan recitations), did not believe in good or bad omens, and they relied exclusively on their Lord.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After hearing this, a companion named ‘Ukkāshah Ibn Miḥṣan stood and said to the prophet, “Pray to Allah to make me one of those.” So the prophet said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ مِنْهُمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">Oh Allah, make him one of them.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then another man stood and he too asked, “Pray to Allah to make me one of them,” but the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) replied:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">سَبَقَكَ بِهَا عُكَّاشَةُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">‘Ukkāshah beat you to it.</span></em> [Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is even a narration recorded by Imam Aḥmad (5/280, 281) in which these seventy thousand will each have with them an additional seventy thousand, and all of them (70,000 x 70,000) will enter Paradise without judgment or punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">The creations to be judged will also include the Jinn</span></strong>, the creatures created by Allah that are unseen by mankind, because they too are held accountable for their beliefs and actions. So like a human, a disbelieving Jinn will enter the fire:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ ادْخُلُوا فِي أُمَمٍ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِكُم مِّنَ الْجِنِّ وَالإِنسِ فِي النَّارِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Allah) will say, “Enter among nations which had passed on before you of Jinn and mankind into the fire.”</span> [Sūrah al-A’rāf, 7:38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…and a believing Jinn will enter Paradise according to the opinion of most scholars, and this position is correct as indicated by the statement of Allah about two particular gardens given to those who will enter paradise:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فِيهِنَّ قَاصِرَاتُ الطَّرْفِ لَمْ يَطْمِثْهُنَّ إِنسٌ قَبْلَهُمْ وَلا جَانٌّ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">In them are women limiting (their) glances, untouched before them by man or Jinn. </span>[Sūrah al-Raḥmān, 55:56]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Here is a question: Will animals be judged and held accountable? </strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer is as far as judging between them to establish justice and fairness for what occurred between them, then yes, they will be judged because the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَتُؤَدُّنَّ الْحُقُوقَ إِلَى أَهْلِهَا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ حَتَّى يُقَادَ لِلشَّاةِ الْجَلْحَاءِ مِنْ الشَّاةِ الْقَرْنَاءِ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">The rights of justice will be established among those who deserve them on the Day of Resurrection so much so that a ram without horns will be given its rights taken from it by a ram with horns.</span> </em>[Recorded by Muslim.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But again, this is only for ensuring that complete fairness and justice is finally established. As far as being judged for actions they were responsible for carrying out, then no, animals will not be held accountable as they are not responsible for such actions. They will have neither reward nor punishment.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">A Believer’s Judgment</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Describing the manner in which Allah will judge a believer and take him to account, Ibn ‘Umar (رضي الله عنهما) narrated that the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) described the private counsel to be held between a true believer and his Lord:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُدْنِي الْمُؤْمِنَ فَيَضَعُ عَلَيْهِ كَنَفَهُ وَيَسْتُرُهُ ، فَيَقُولُ : أَتَعْرِفُ ذَنْبَ كَذَا أَتَعْرِفُ </span><span style="color:#000000;">ذَنْبَ كَذَا ؟ فَيَقُولُ : نَعَمْ أَيْ رَبِّ ، حَتَّى إِذَا قَرَّرَهُ بِذُنُوبِهِ وَرَأَى فِي نَفْسِهِ أَنَّهُ هَلَكَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ : سَتَرْتُهَا عَلَيْكَ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَأَنَا أَغْفِرُهَا لَكَ الْيَوْمَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">Allah will draw a believer close, placing him under his care and screening him. Allah will say to him, “Do you remember this sin and that sin?” The person will answer, “Yes, my Lord.” After he is made to confess all of his sins and he sincerely believes he is ruined, Allah will say, “I concealed them for you in life and I forgive you for them today.”</span></em> [Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While speaking with his servant, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) will screen him so that no one will see or hear him during their private conversation. This is a way of Allah (عزّ وجلّ) favoring and showing kindness to a true believer in him. When people make someone confess their crimes publicly in front of everyone, even if they pardon the individual for them, there is still an aspect of scandal and humiliation that remains. Yet if such proceedings were held privately, then this would be a better way of concealing and protecting people from that.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">A Disbeliever’s Judgment</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Describing a disbeliever’s judgment, Ibn Taymiyyah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;As for a disbeliever, they will not be judged in the same manner as someone who has his good and bad deeds weighed. This is because those who disbelieve in Allah have no good deeds at all. Still, their deeds will be counted and they will be held responsible for them; they will be made to confess them and will be humiliated.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of this has come in the same ḥadīth of Ibn ‘Umar previously mentioned in which the prophet spoke about how Allah will conceal a believer and speak privately with him. The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) then said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَمَّا الْكُفَّارُ وَالْمُنَافِقُونَ فَيُنَادَى بِهِمْ عَلَى رُءُوسِ الْخَلائِقِ : هَؤُلاءِ الَّذِينَ كَذَبُوا عَلَى اللَّهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">But as for the disbelievers and hypocrites, they will be publicly called out in front of all creation and it will be announced, “These are the ones who lied against Allah.”</span> </em>[Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in “Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim,” Abū Hurayrah narrated that the messenger of Allah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَيَلْقَى الْعَبْدَ فَيَقُولُ : أَيْ فُلْ أَلَمْ أُكْرِمْكَ وَأُسَوِّدْكَ وَأُزَوِّجْكَ وَأُسَخِّرْ لَكَ الْخَيْلَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَالإِبِلَ وَأَذَرْكَ تَرْأَسُ وَتَرْبَعُ ؟ فَيَقُولُ : بَلَى ، قَالَ : فَيَقُولُ : أَفَظَنَنْتَ أَنَّكَ مُلاقِيَّ ؟ </span><span style="color:#000000;">فَيَقُولُ : لا ، فَيَقُولُ : فَإِنِّي أَنْسَاكَ كَمَا نَسِيتَنِي ،</span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ يَلْقَى الثَّانِيَ فَيَقُولُ : أَيْ فُلْ أَلَمْ أُكْرِمْكَ وَأُسَوِّدْكَ وَأُزَوِّجْكَ وَأُسَخِّرْ لَكَ الْخَيْلَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَالإِبِلَ وَأَذَرْكَ تَرْأَسُ وَتَرْبَعُ ؟ فَيَقُولُ.: بَلَى أَيْ رَبِّ ، فَيَقُولُ : أَفَظَنَنْتَ أَنَّكَ مُلاقِيَّ ؟ </span><span style="color:#000000;">فَيَقُولُ : لا ، فَيَقُولُ : فَإِنِّي أَنْسَاكَ كَمَا نَسِيتَنِي ، </span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ يَلْقَى الثَّالِثَ ، فَيَقُولُ لَهُ مِثْلَ ذَلِكَ ، فَيَقُولُ : يَا رَبِّ آمَنْتُ بِكَ وَبِكِتَابِكَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَبِرُسُلِكَ وَصَلَّيْتُ وَصُمْتُ وَتَصَدَّقْتُ وَيُثْنِي بِخَيْرٍ مَا اسْتَطَاعَ ، فَيَقُولُ : هَاهُنَا إِذًا ،</span><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ : ثُمَّ : يُقَالُ لَهُ : الآنَ نَبْعَثُ شَاهِدَنَا عَلَيْكَ ، وَيَتَفَكَّرُ فِي نَفْسِهِ مَنْ ذَا الَّذِي يَشْهَدُ </span><span style="color:#000000;">عَلَيَّ ، فَيُخْتَمُ عَلَى فِيهِ ، وَيُقَالُ لِفَخِذِهِ وَلَحْمِهِ وَعِظَامِهِ : انْطِقِي ، فَتَنْطِقُ فَخِذُهُ </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَحْمُهُ وَعِظَامُهُ بِعَمَلِهِ ، وَذَلِكَ لِيُعْذِرَ مِنْ نَفْسِهِ وَذَلِكَ الْمُنَافِقُ وَذَلِكَ الَّذِي يَسْخَطُ </span><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">Allah will meet with a servant, asking, “Oh so-and-so, did I not honor you, give you authority, give you a spouse, give you control over horses and camels, and made you a leader (or allowed you to live a comfortable life)?” The person will reply, “You did.” Allah will ask him, “Did you think you would ever meet me?” and he will answer, “No.” So Allah will say, “Then I will forget you as you forgot me.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">Then Allah will meet with a second person and ask, “Oh so-and-so, did I not honor you, give you authority, give you a spouse, give you control over horses and camels, and made you a leader (or allowed you to live a comfortable life)?” The person will reply, “You did, my Lord.” Allah will ask him, “Did you think you would ever meet me?” and he will answer, “No.” So Allah will say, “Then I will forget you as you forgot me.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">Allah will then meet with a third person and will ask him similarly as he did with the others, but this person will say, “My Lord, I believed in you, in your book, and in your messengers. I prayed, fasted, and gave charity.” And he will continue praising the good (he did) as much as he can. Allah will say, “(Stop) then. Now we will bring forth our witness against you.” The person will think to himself about who this witness could be to testify against him. His mouth will then be sealed and his legs, his flesh and bones will be told, “Speak.” His legs, flesh, and bones will then speak about what he did. That is the person who will have no excuse for himself; that is the hypocrite, and that is the one with whom Allah is angry.</span></em> [Recorded by Muslim.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the Day of Judgment, the first people to be judged will be this nation, the Muslims who followed Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم), based on the prophet’s statement:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">نَحْنُ الآخِرُوْنَ السَّابِقُوْنَ يَوْمَ القِيَامَةِ المَقْضِيُّ بَيْنَهُمْ قَبْلَ الخَلائِقِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">We are the last ones (in this life) but the first ones on the Day of Resurrection to have their accounts settled before the rest of creation.</span></em> [94]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, Ibn ‘Abbās (رضي الله عنهما) narrated that the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">نَحْنُ آخِرُ الأُمَمِ وَأَوَّلُ مَنْ يُحَاسَبُ ، يُقَالُ : أَيْنَ الأُمَّةُ الأُمِّيَّةُ وَنَبِيُّهَا ؟ فَنَحْنُ الآخِرُونَ الأَوَّلُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">We are the last religious nation (in this life) but the first to be judged. It will be said, “Where is the illiterate nation and its prophet?” So we are the last ones yet the first ones</span></em>.[95]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first thing for which a worshipper of Allah will be judged and called to account regarding the rights of Allah will be his prayer based on the statement of the prophet :(صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَوَّلُ مَا يُحَاسَبُ بِهِ الْعَبْدُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ الصَلاة ، فَإِنْ صَلُحَتْ صَلُحَ سَائِرُ عَمَلِهِ ،  وَإِنْ فَسَدَتْ فَسَدَ سَائِرُ عَمَلِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>The first thing for which a worshipper will be judged on the Day of Resurrection will be prayer. If it is sound, the rest of his deeds will be sound, but if it is bad, the rest of his deeds will be bad</em>.</span> [96]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the first crimes to be judged regarding the rights of other people will be those pertaining to bloodshed as he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَوَّلَ مَا يُقْضَى بَيْنَ النَّاسِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فِي الدِّمَاءِ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">The first thing to be settled between people on the Day of Resurrection will be (crimes of) bloodshed.</span></em>[97]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because prayer is the best bodily act of worship related to the rights of Allah, and bloodshed is the greatest violation of communal rights related to mankind.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[86] Recorded by Aḥmad (6/48) and Ibn Abī ‘Āṣim in “<em>Kitāb al-Sunnah</em>” (no. 885). al-Albānī said it is authentic in his checking of “<em>Kitāb al-Sunnah</em>” (2/429).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[94] Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim. In a similar ḥadīth, also recorded by them both, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">نَحْنُ الآخِرُونَ السَّابِقُونَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ مِنْ قَبْلِنَا وَأُوتِينَاهُ مِنْ بَعْدِهِمْ ، فَهَذَا الْيَوْمُ الَّذِي اخْتَلَفُوا فِيهِ فَهَدَانَا اللَّهُ فَغَدًا لِلْيَهُودِ وَبَعْدَ غَدٍ لِلنَّصَارَى</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">We are the last ones but the first ones on the Day of Resurrection. They were given the scripture before us and we were given it after them. So this is the day they differed about, but Allah has guided us. So tomorrow is for the Jews, and the day after is for the Christians.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[95] Recorded by Ibn Mājah, Aḥmad, and al-Bayhaqī. al-Albānī said it is authentic in “<em>Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan Ibn Mājah</em>” (no. 3463).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[96] Recorded by al-Tirmidhī, al-Nasāī, Ibn Mājah, and al-Ṭabarānī. The text is from al-Ṭabarānī and al-Albānī said it is authentic in “<em>Ṣaḥīḥ al-Targhīb wal-Tarhīb</em>” (1/185).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Seventh Event</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Books of Deeds are Distributed</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People’s books of deeds will be distributed, open for them to read. An individual’s book of deeds is the register with every action he did in life written inside. These deeds are being written now by the angels entrusted with recording the actions of all the children of Adam. Allah (تعالى) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِنَّ عَلَيْكُمْ لَحَافِظِينَ كِرَامًا كَاتِبِينَ يَعْلَمُونَ مَا تَفْعَلُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And indeed, (appointed) over you are keepers, honorable recorders. They know whatever you do.</span> [Surah al-Isrā, 82:10-12][69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These angels record in a book everything a person does because they are always with him. And on the Day of Resurrection, Allah will bring forth this book, making it known to the person as he says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَكُلَّ إِنسَانٍ أَلْزَمْنَاهُ طَائِرَهُ فِي عُنُقِهِ وَنُخْرِجُ لَهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ كِتَابًا يَلْقَاهُ مَنشُورًا </span><span style="color:#000000;">اقْرَأْ كِتَابَكَ كَفَى بِنَفْسِكَ الْيَوْمَ عَلَيْكَ حَسِيبًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Every person, we have imposed his fate upon his neck. And we will produce for him, on the Day of Resurrection, a record which he will find spread open. (It will be said to him,) “Read your book. You are sufficient today as a reckoner against yourself. </span>[Surah al-Isrā, 17:13-14.]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Recording of Good Deeds</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Both good deeds and bad deeds are written in these books. As for the good deeds, the actions a person actually does are recorded, as are his good intentions and even those deeds he intends to do but may not have actually done them. So there are three types of rewarded behavior: 1) good deeds performed, 2) good intentions, and 3) good deeds intended but not performed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1. Good Deeds:</strong> </span>It is clear that a person’s good deeds are written.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>2. Good Intentions:</strong></span> Intending to do a good deed is also recorded in a person’s favor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But a reward is given for only the intention and not necessarily the action intended. This is based on the hadith of a rich man who spends his wealth in charity and a poor man who says, “<strong>If I had wealth, I would do what he does</strong>.” About these two, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَهُوَ بِنِيَّتِهِ فَأَجْرُهُمَا سَوَاءٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>He is rewarded for his intention, and the reward is the same for both</em>.</span>[71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So both the rich and poor are equally rewarded in intention but not in action. This is also confirmed by the narration in which the poor immigrants of Medina complained to the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) saying, “Oh messenger of Allah, the wealthy have overtaken us (in reward).” The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said (as a way to catch up with the wealthy in rewards):</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">تُسَبِّحُونَ وَتُكَبِّرُونَ وَتَحْمَدُونَ دُبُرَ كُلِّ صَلاةٍ ثَلاثًا وَثَلاثِينَ مَرَّة</span></h2>
<p><em><span style="color:#808000;">Glorify Allah, declare his greatness, and thank him after each prayer thirty-three times.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But when this advice reached the wealthy, they too did likewise. So the poor returned, complaining to the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) again that the rich are now doing both— giving charity and praising Allah after the prayers. He (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) then said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ذَلِكَ فَضْلُ اللَّهِ يُؤْتِهِ مَنْ يَشَاءُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>That is the favor of Allah he gives to whom he wishes. </em></span>[Recorded by al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet did not reply the second time that the poor, despite their sincere intentions, would have the same reward as the rich in deed. And this is fair because a man who does not perform a certain deed is not the same as the one who actually does it, yet he may still get a similar reward for the intention alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>3. Good Deeds Intended but Not Performed:</strong> </span>The third type of rewarded behavior which a person may find written in his book of deeds is the actions he may sincerely intend to do but did not actually do them. The difference between this type and the second is that for these intentions, he does receive a reward for the action itself. These are the deeds that an individual may intend to do and perhaps he does as much as he is able to of such deed. Then something prevents him from completing the deed. In such case, a full good deed will be recorded based on the statement of Allah:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يَخْرُجْ مِن بَيْتِهِ مُهَاجِرًا إِلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ ثُمَّ يُدْرِكْهُ الْمَوْتُ فَقَدْ وَقَعَ أَجْرُهُ عَلَى اللَّهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever leaves his home as an emigrant to Allah and his messenger and then death overtakes him, his reward has already become incumbent upon Allah.</span>[Surah al-Nisa, 4:100]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this is also good news for students of religious knowledge. For example, if someone intends to study religious knowledge for the purpose of benefiting others with such information, defending the Sunnah of the messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) and spreading Allah’s religion throughout the earth, yet he is unable to complete his studies—perhaps he dies in the process, for example—he will still have those good deeds recorded for him and he will achieve its rewards.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even if a person has a habit of performing a particular good deed but for some reason he is unable to do it under certain circumstances, he still has the good deed recorded for him. The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا مَرِضَ الْعَبْدُ أَوْ سَافَرَ كُتِبَ لَهُ مِثْلُ مَا كَانَ يَعْمَلُ مُقِيمًا صَحِيحًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>When a servant becomes sick or travels, whatever he used to do while residing at home or healthy will still be recorded for him.</em></span> [Recorded by al-Bukhari]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Recording of Bad Deeds</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for bad deeds, they are written against a person if: 1) he actually does a bad deed, 2) he intends and hopes to do the bad deed, and 3) he intends to do the bad deed and tries to commit it but for some reason he is unable to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1. Bad Deeds:</strong></span> This is clear; if someone does a bad deed, he has it recorded against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>2. Bad Intentions:</strong> </span>Sins an individual intends or hopes to do are also written against him. But like good intentions, he has a bad deed recorded for the intention and not a full bad deed for the action intended. The proof of this is in the same hadith mentioned about good intentions. The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) spoke about a person Allah had provided wealth but no knowledge so that he aimlessly wasted his wealth. A person Allah had given neither wealth nor knowledge then said, “If I had wealth, I would do what he does,” admiring the former’s wasteful spending. So the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَهُوَ بِنِيَّتِهِ فَوِزْرُهُمَا سَوَاءٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>He is recorded for his intention, and the sin is the same for both of them.</em></span> [75]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As for an individual intending to do a bad deed but refrains from it, this is of three types:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">1) If the person does not do the deed because he was unable though he tried to do it, he is just like a person who actually did the bad deed,</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">2) If he refrains from doing the deed for the sake of Allah, he is rewarded, and</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">3) If he simply decides not to do it (but not for the sake of Allah) or even if committing the deed did not seriously cross his mind, then he has neither sin nor reward written for him.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>3. Bad Deeds Intended but Not Performed:</strong> </span>These are also recorded against a person as complete bad deeds if the person tried his utmost to do them based on the statement (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) of the prophet:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ذَا تَوَاجَهَ الْمُسْلِمَانِ بِسَيْفَيْهِمَا فَكِلاهُمَا مِنْ أَهْلِ النَّارِ</span></h2>
<p><span style="color:#808000;"><em>If two Muslims face off with their swords (i.e. if they fight to the death), both of them are people of the fire.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After hearing this, the companions asked, “Messenger of Allah, we understand about the killer, but why the one killed too?” He replied:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهُ أَرَادَ قَتْلَ صَاحِبِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>He also wanted to kill his opponent.</em></span>[Recorded by al-Bukhari and Muslim.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, if someone wanted to drink alcohol but something happened so that he was unable to do it, it is still recorded against him as a bad deed because he tried as much as he could to commit it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To conclude this topic we must know that Allah rewards good deeds with rewards greater than the original good deed, but He recompenses a bad deed only equivalent to the original sin; He says (تعالى) :</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَن جَاءَ بِالْحَسَنَةِ فَلَهُ عَشْرُ أَمْثَالِهَا وَمَن جَاءَ بِالسَّيِّئَةِ فَلا يُجْزَى إِلاَّ مِثْلَهَا وَهُمْ لا يُظْلَمُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>Whoever comes (on the Day of Judgment) with a good deed will have ten times the like thereof, and whoever comes with an evil deed will not be recompensed except the like thereof, and they will not be wronged.</em></span> [77]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Receiving the Books of Deeds</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">About the distribution of these books and the ways in which people will receive them, Allah (تعالى) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ بِيَمِينِهِ فَسَوْفَ يُحَاسَبُ حِسَابًا يَسِيرًا وَيَنقَلِبُ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ </span><span style="color:#000000;">مَسْرُورًا وَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ وَرَاءَ ظَهْرِهِ فَسَوْفَ يَدْعُو ثُبُورًا وَيَصْلَى سَعِيرًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Then as for he who is given his record in his right hand, he will be judged with an easy reckoning, and he will return to his people in happiness. But as for he who is given his record behind his back, he will cry out for destruction, and he will burn in a blaze.</span>[Surah al-Inshiqaq, 84:7-12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ بِشِمَالِهِ فَيَقُولُ يَا لَيْتَنِي لَمْ أُوتَ كِتَابِيَهْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">But as for he who is given his record in his left hand, he will say, “Oh, I wish I had never been given my record.” </span>[Surah al-Haqqah, 69:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the Day of Judgment, people will receive their books of deeds in different ways. Some will be given their books in their right hands – these are the believers. In this is also an indication that the right hand is more honorable and so a believer is given his book in his right hand. When the believer receives his book of deeds, he will take it with his right hand, rejoice, then cry out:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ بِيَمِينِهِ فَيَقُولُ هَاؤُمُ اقْرَءُوا كِتَابِيَهْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So as for he who is given his record in his right hand, he will say, “Here,read my record!” </span>[Surah al-Haqqah, 69:19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for a disbeliever in Allah, he receives his book of deeds in his left hand or from behind his back. He will then cry out for destruction:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ بِشِمَالِهِ فَيَقُولُ يَا لَيْتَنِي لَمْ أُوتَ كِتَابِيَهْ وَلَمْ أَدْرِ مَا حِسَابِيَهْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">But as for he who is given his record in his left hand, he will say, “Oh, I wish I had never been given my record and had never known what my account was.</span>[Surah al-Haqqah, 69:25-26.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the manner in which people receive their books of deeds is of three types: in the right hand, in the left hand, and behind the back. But these three types are only different in description and are not three separate ways books will be distributed. This is because if an individual receives his book of deeds from behind his back, he is at the same time given his book in his left hand—he takes it with his left hand, reaching his hand behind him. And since he receives his book with his left hand, he is known as one of the “People of the Left.” [82] He receives his book behind his back because during his life, he turned his back on the book of Allah. So it is only befitting that in return, he is given his book of deeds from behind his back, and Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To conclude, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَكُلَّ إِنسَانٍ أَلْزَمْنَاهُ طَائِرَهُ فِي عُنُقِهِ وَنُخْرِجُ لَهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ كِتَابًا يَلْقَاهُ مَنشُورًا </span><span style="color:#000000;">اقْرَأْ كِتَابَكَ كَفَى بِنَفْسِكَ الْيَوْمَ عَلَيْكَ حَسِيبًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Every person, we have imposed his fate upon his neck. And we will produce for him, on the Day of Resurrection, a record which he will find spread open. (It will be said to him,) “Read your book. You are sufficient today as a reckoner against yourself. </span>[Surah al-Isra, 17:13-14.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his fate (i.e. his deeds) imposed on his neck, this is the most befitting attachment for a person’s deeds – bound to his neck – because he will never be separated from them until he dies. He will find his book open; he neither expends effort nor does he find difficulty in opening it. &#8220;<strong>Read your book</strong>&#8221; Read what has been written for or against you. &#8220;<strong>Your own self is sufficient as a reckoner against you today</strong>&#8220;. This is the perfection of justice and fairness – that the individual will be responsible for taking himself to account.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have in front of us now a door we may close on every bad deed, every sin: repentance. Regardless of how great a sin may be, when someone repents to Allah, he will forgive him. Even if a person continuously repeated the same sin but he repents, Allah will forgive him. The matter is still within our hands, so we must ensure that nothing is written in this book except righteous deeds before Allah judges creation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[69] Surah al-Isrā, 82:10-12.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Surah Qaf, 50:17-18, Allah informs us that the angels are seated on the right and left of us:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذْ يَتَلَقَّى الْمُتَلَقِّيَانِ عَنِ الْيَمِينِ وَعَنِ الشِّمَالِ قَعِيدٌ مَّا يَلْفِظُ مِن قَوْلٍ إِلاَّ لَدَيْهِ رَقِيبٌ عَتِيدٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">When the two receivers receive, seated on the right and on the left. Not a word does he utter but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[71] Recorded by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah and al-Albani said it is authentic in “Sahih Sunan al-Tirmidhi” (no. 1894).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The full text of the hadith is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ثَلاثَةٌ أُقْسِمُ عَلَيْهِنَّ وَأُحَدِّثُكُمْ حَدِيثًا فَاحْفَظُوهُ ، قَالَ : مَا نَقَصَ مَالُ عَبْدٍ مِنْ صَدَقَةٍ ، وَلا ظُلِمَ عَبْدٌ مَظْلَمَةً فَصَبَرَ عَلَيْهَا إِلاَّ زَادَهُ اللَّهُ عِزًّا ، </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَلا فَتَحَ عَبْدٌ بَابَ مَسْأَلَةٍ إِلاَّ فَتَحَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ بَابَ فَقْرٍ &#8211; أَوْ كَلِمَةً نَحْوَهَا &#8211; وَأُحَدِّثُكُمْ حَدِيثًا فَاحْفَظُوهُ ، قَالَ : إِنَّمَا الدُّنْيَا لأَرْبَعَةِ نَفَرٍ : عَبْدٍ </span><span style="color:#000000;">رَزَقَهُ اللَّهُ مَالاً وَعِلْمًا فَهُوَ يَتَّقِي فِيهِ رَبَّهُ وَيَصِلُ فِيهِ رَحِمَهُ ، وَيَعْلَمُ لِلَّهِ فِيهِ حَقًّا فَهَذَا بِأَفْضَلِ الْمَنَازِلِ ، وَعَبْدٍ رَزَقَهُ اللَّهُ عِلْمًا وَلَمْ يَرْزُقْهُ مَالاً </span><span style="color:#000000;">فَهُوَ صَادِقُ النِّيَّةِ يَقُولُ : لَوْ أَنَّ لِي مَالاً لَعَمِلْتُ بِعَمَلِ فُلانٍ ، فَهُوَ بِنِيَّتِهِ فَأَجْرُهُمَا سَوَاءٌ ، وَعَبْدٍ رَزَقَهُ اللَّهُ مَالاً وَلَمْ يَرْزُقْهُ عِلْمًا فَهُوَ يَخْبِطُ فِي </span><span style="color:#000000;">مَالِهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ لا يَتَّقِي فِيهِ رَبَّهُ وَلا يَصِلُ فِيهِ رَحِمَهُ وَلا يَعْلَمُ لِلَّهِ فِيهِ حَقًّا فَهَذَا بِأَخْبَثِ الْمَنَازِلِ ، وَعَبْدٍ لَمْ يَرْزُقْهُ اللَّهُ مَالاً وَلا عِلْمًا فَهُوَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">يَقُولُ : لَوْ أَنَّ لِي مَالاً لَعَمِلْتُ فِيهِ بِعَمَلِ فُلانٍ ، فَهُوَ بِنِيَّتِهِ فَوِزْرُهُمَا سَوَاءٌ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">There are three things that I attest to; I will mention them so remember them. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">1) Charity will never decrease a person’s wealth, </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">2) no servant is wronged and patiently endures that except that Allah will increase him in honor, and </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">3) no servant opens the door of begging except that Allah will open the door of poverty (or he said similarly). </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And I will mention something else so remember it. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The world is for four types of people: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">1) a person Allah has provided with wealth and knowledge so he is conscientious of his Lord regarding them and thus gains his mercy therewith. He knows Allah has a right upon him with regards to them, and this is the best of the (four) types. </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">2) A person Allah has provided with knowledge but not wealth, yet he is truthful in his intention when he says, “If I had wealth, I would do what so-and-so does (the first type of person).” So he is rewarded for his intention, and the reward is the same for both of them. </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">3) A person Allah has provided wealth but no knowledge so that he aimlessly wastes his wealth without knowledge. He is neither conscientious of his Lord with it nor does he achieve his mercy. He does not even know that Allah has a right upon him regarding it, and this is the worst of the (four) types. </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">4) A person Allah has provided no wealth and no knowledge. But he says, “If I had wealth, I would do what so-and-so does (the third type of person).” So he is also recorded for his intention, and the sin is the same for both of them.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[75] Recorded by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah and al-Albani said it is authentic in “Sahih Sunan al-Tirmidhi” (no. 1894). See page 53 for the full hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[77] Surah al-Anaam, 6:160.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Evidence from the Sunnah of a ten-fold reward for a good deed and only a single recompense for a bad deed is the hadith recorded by Muslim in which the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يقول الله : مَنْ جَاء بالحَسَنَةِ فَلَهُ عَشْرُ أمْثَالِهَا أَوْ أزْيَد ، وَمَنْ جَاءَ بالسَيِّئَةِ فَجَزاءُ سَيِّئَةٍ سَيِّئَةٌ مِثْلُهَا أَوْ أغْفِرُ . وَمَنْ تَقَرَّبَ مِنِّي شِبْرًا تَقَرَّبْتُ </span><span style="color:#000000;">مِنْهُ ذِرَاعًا ، وَمَنْ تَقَرَّبَ مِنِّي ذِرَاعًا تَقَرَّبْتُ مِنْهُ بَاعًا ، وَمَنْ أتَانِي يَمْشِي أتَيْتُهُ هَرْوَلَةً ، وَمَنْ لَقِيني بِقُرَابِ الأرْض خَطِيئةً لا يُشْرِكُ بِي شَيئاً ، </span><span style="color:#000000;">لَقِيتُهُ بِمِثْلِهَا مَغفِرَةً</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Allah says, “Whoever does a good deed will have ten times reward for it or even more. And whoever does a bad deed will have a single bad deed for it or I will forgive it. Whoever comes close to me a hand-span, I will come close to him an arm’s length; and whoever comes close to me an arm’s length, I will come close to him the distance of two outstretched arms. Whoever comes to me walking, I will come to him running. And whoever meets me with the earth full of sins but associated nothing with me in worship, I will meet him with as much forgiveness.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[82] A similar description is used in the Surah al-Waqi’ah, 56:8-9:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَأَصْحَابُ الْمَيْمَنَةِ مَا أَصْحَابُ الْمَيْمَنَةِ وَأَصْحَابُ الْمَشْأَمَةِ مَا أَصْحَابُ الْمَشْأَمَةِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Companions of the Right – what are the Companions of the Right? And the Companions of the Left – what re the Companions of the Left?</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">The Explanation of Verse 4 of Sooratul Faatiha</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"> إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ </span></h2>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">iyyāka na’budu wa iyyāka nasta’īn</span></strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">You alone we worship, and from you alone we seek help.</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;You alone&#8221; (iyyāka)</strong>: This is a case in grammar when the direct object comes before the verb, <strong>&#8220;we worship&#8221; (na’budu)</strong>. In Arabic grammar, when the direct object precedes the verb, it gives a sense of restriction, so the meaning would be, “<strong>We do not worship anyone or anything except you alone</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;we worship&#8221; (na’budu)</strong>: Meaning: We humble ourselves to you in complete humility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this way, you find the believers placing the most honorable part of their bodies (their faces) at the level of their feet in humility to Allah (عزّ وجلّ). They prostrate on the ground, covering their foreheads with dirt. This is from their humbleness before Allah. And if another person were to say, “I will give you the whole world and what it contains, just prostrate to me once,” you will never find true believers accepting this because this type of humility is a form of worship specifically for Allah alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word “<strong>worship</strong>” includes doing everything Allah commands and avoiding everything he forbids. Whoever is not in accordance with this, not carrying out what he is commanded to do and avoiding what he is forbidden to do then he is not a true worshipper and servant. A worshipper is someone who obeys the one he worships in whatever he legislates. So, worship requires that mankind carry out everything they are commanded to do and avoid everything they are forbidden from doing. However, it is not possible to fulfill all of these duties without the help and assistance of Allah. Because of this, Allah ( سبحانه وتعالى ) then says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;and from you alone we seek help&#8221; (wa iyyāka nasta’īn)</strong>: Meaning, “We do not seek the help of anyone else in worship or in anything else.” This “seeking of help” is to request the help and assistance, and Allah combines between worship and the seeking of assistance or reliance in many places the noble Qur&#8217;an. This is because worship could not be completely established except with the help of Allah by entrusting one’s affairs to him, and relying on him.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Points of Benefit of al-Fātiḥah, Verse 4:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. From the virtues of this verse is the sincerity in worship that is due to Allah alone as he says, &#8220;<strong>You alone we worship</strong>&#8220;. It shows that this worship is due only to Allah by the direct object (“<strong>You</strong>”) coming before the verb (“<strong>we worship</strong>”) according to the rules of Arabic grammar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Another point is that seeking help is also sincerely and solely for Allah based on the statement, &#8220;<strong>and from you alone we seek help</strong>&#8220;. Likewise, the direct object precedes the verb indicating a sense of restriction just like in the first part of the verse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those points being said, what if someone asks:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">How is it that seeking help is exclusively for Allah alone when there has come in another verse:</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَتَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَى </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And help one another in righteousness and piety</span>.[Sūrah al-Māidah, 5:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, how do we understand the previous statements about seeking help only from Allah when, here in this verse, Allah confirms that seeking help from other than himself is permissible (rather it is a command here)? Also, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> تُعِيْنُ الرَّجُلَ فِي دَابَّتِهِ، فَتَحْمِلُهُ عَلَيْهَا، أَوْ تَرْفَعُ لَهُ عَلَيْهَا مَتَاعَهُ صَدَقَةٌ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Helping someone onto his riding animal, carrying him on it, or lifting his belongings up to him while he is on it &#8211; all of these are (considered) acts of charity</span>. [Recorded by Al-Bukhaaree (no. 2891) and Muslim (no. 1009)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer to this question is that the act of seeking help and assistance is of two types. The first type is to request help while entrusting all affairs to the one you ask from. For example, you rely completely on Allah and you realize that any result you seek will not come from your own power or capability. This type of seeking help is specific for Allah ( تعالى ); he alone deserves this type.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second type is to request help or cooperation in something you want to accomplish. This type is permissible as long as the one being requested is living and capable of doing what is asked of him. This is not considered a form of worship. This is the type that Allah refers to when saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَتَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَى</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And help one another in righteousness and piety.</span> [Sūrah al-Māidah, 5:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is further asked, “<span style="color:#ff0000;">Is seeking help from the creation permissible at all times and in all situations?</span>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer is no. Requesting help from the creation is only allowed when the one being asked is fully capable of what he is being asked for, otherwise seeking his help is not permissible. An example would be asking help from someone dead in his grave; this is prohibited, rather it is major Shirk (the associating of partners with Allah in worship)! This is because the person in his grave does not even have the ability to help himself, so how could he help someone else? Similarly, if someone seeks the help of another person who is not present with him such as a person believing that someone else in the far eastern part of the world could help him with something in his (the one seeking help) land – this is also major Shirk because the person whose help is sought is not capable of helping the seeker while they are in different lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is now asked, “<span style="color:#ff0000;">So, is it permissible to seek help from the creation if these conditions are met?</span>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer is that it is better not to ask anyone for any help unless it is absolutely necessary or if it is known that the person would be happy to provide help. In this case, one could request his assistance in order to please him. The act that you seek another’s help in fulfilling must also not be something sinful and prohibited.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Fifteenth Event</strong></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Believers See Their Lord</strong></span></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ نَّاضِرَةٌ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهَا نَاظِرَةٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Some) faces that day will be radiant, looking at their Lord</span>. [Sūrah al-Qiyāmah, 75:22-23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To explain the verse, &#8220;<strong>faces that day</strong>&#8221; means on the last day, the Day of Resurrection. &#8220;<strong>radiant</strong>&#8221; here includes beauty because the word used in the verse comes from the Arabic word نَضَارَة (naḍārah) which means beauty. This meaning is also indicated in the statement of Allah (in which a similar form of the same word is used):</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَوَقَاهُمُ اللَّهُ شَرَّ ذَٰلِكَ الْيَوْمِ وَلَقَّاهُمْ نَضْرَةً وَسُرُورًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So Allah will protect them from the evil of that day and give them radiance and happiness.</span> [Sūrah al-Insān, 76:11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In other words: beauty in their faces and happiness in their hearts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for &#8220;<strong>looking at their Lord</strong>&#8220;, it is real sight which occurs from the faces and by the eyes. This is different from insight that may occur within the heart (similar to the English usage, “I will look into it.”) which means thinking about or considering something. Here, however, the looking occurs from the faces and is directed toward the Lord (عزّ وجلّ) just as is explicitly indicated by &#8220;<strong>at their Lord</strong>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This noble verse means that these radiant, beautiful faces will be looking directly at their Lord (عزّ وجلّ) and, consequently, will increase in beauty. Look at how these faces were prepared, made ready to look at Allah (عزّ وجلّ) – they will have been made bright and beautiful in preparation to look upon the face of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse is a clear proof that Allah will actually be seen with actual eyes and this is the position of mainstream Muslims who follow the Sunnah (<em>Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamā’ah</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They have proven this with the same verses mentioned herein and they also learn this from the numerous statements of the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) transmitted to the companions and to their followers and so on. So these texts are explicitly clear as evidence confirming this (the believers seeing Allah in the hereafter) because they are within the book of Allah (تعالى) and the Sunnah of his messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) and they are reported by many different chains of narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So mainstream Muslims who follow the Sunnah hold the belief that the looking, the sight mentioned here, is real. It does not mean “perception” or “complete awareness” because Allah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">لَّا تُدْرِكُهُ الْأَبْصَارُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ الْأَبْصَارَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Vision does not perceive him. </span>[Sūrah al-An’ām, 6:103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as knowing with one’s heart does not necessarily equate to perceiving his true reality. Allah (تعالى) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِهِ عِلْمًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">But they do not encompass him with knowledge. </span>[Sūrah ṬāHā, 20:110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We know our Lord with our hearts yet we still do not know exactly how he is. Similarly, on the Day of Resurrection we will see our Lord with our own eyes, yet our sight will still not completely perceive him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second verse indicating that believers will see their Lord is the statement of Allah:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">عَلَى الْأَرَائِكِ يَنظُرُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">On thrones, looking. </span>[Sūrah al-Muṭaffifīn, 83:23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah did not mention in this verse specifically what they are looking at so it is general, including anything that is pleasing to look at. The greatest and most pleasing sight is to look upon Allah (تعالى) as he says in the very next verse:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">تَعْرِفُ فِي وُجُوهِهِمْ نَضْرَةَ النَّعِيمِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">You will recognize in their faces the radiance of pleasure.</span> [Sūrah al-Muṭaffifīn, 83:24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the context of the verse is similar to the first one, &#8220;faces that day will be radiant, looking at their Lord&#8221; and they will be looking at everything that pleases them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third verse regarding the believers looking at Allah is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُوا الْحُسْنَىٰ وَزِيَادَةٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">For those who have done good is the best (reward) and even more.</span> [Sūrah Yūnus, 10:26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for &#8220;the best&#8221;, it is Paradise and &#8220;even more&#8221; is the believers looking at the face of Allah. This is how the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) explained this verse as is confirmed in the ḥadīth recorded by Muslim and others:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا دَخَلَ أَهْلُ الْجَنَّةِ الْجَنَّةَ ، قَالَ : يَقُولُ اللَّهُ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى : تُرِيدُونَ شَيْئًا أَزِيدُكُمْ.؟ </span><span style="color:#000000;">فَيَقُولُونَ : أَلَمْ تُبَيِّضْ وُجُوهَنَا ؟ أَلَمْ تُدْخِلْنَا الْجَنَّةَ وَتُنَجِّنَا مِنْ النَّارِ ؟ قَالَ : فَيَكْشِفُ</span><span style="color:#000000;"> الْحِجَابَ فَمَا أُعْطُوا شَيْئًا أَحَبَّ إِلَيْهِمْ مِنْ النَّظَرِ إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">When the people of Paradise have entered Paradise, Allah (تبارك وتعالى) will ask, “Do you want me to give you something more?” They will say, “Have you not brightened our faces? Have you not already admitted us into Paradise and saved us from the fire?” He will then remove the covering and they will not have been given anything more beloved to them than looking at their Lord (عزّ وجلّ)</span> [Recorded by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After saying that, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) then recited the verse, &#8220;For those who have done good is the best (reward) and even more.&#8221; So this verse is evidence of seeing Allah as the messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) has explained, and no doubt, he is the most knowledgeable person of the Quran’s meanings. He explained that it means looking at the face of Allah and this is the &#8220;even more&#8221; reward the believers will be given in addition to the previous delights of Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, this blessing is not the same types of blessing as are well-known of Paradise. Many of the delights of Paradise are physical in nature: rivers to enjoy, physical rewards, fruits, pure spouses, etc. Then the blessings and pleasures of the heart follow. But looking at Allah is a direct delight pleasing to the heart. The people of Paradise will have never seen anything more enjoyable or satisfying than that. We ask Allah to make us those who see him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This blessing is in no way comparable to anything else, not the fruits of Paradise, its rivers, or anything else. Because of this, Allah said &#8220;For those who have done good is the best (reward) and even more.&#8221; because it is in addition to even the best rewards of Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth verse is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَهُم مَّا يَشَاءُونَ فِيهَا وَلَدَيْنَا مَزِيدٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">There they will have all that they desire and with us is even more.</span> [Sūrah Qāf, 50:35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many scholars have explained &#8220;but with us is even more&#8221; just how the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) explained it – that it is looking at the face of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So those are the four verses the author (Ibn Taymiyyah) mentions as proof of the believers seeing Allah. There is also a fifth verse from which Imam al-Shāfi’ī deduced that the believers will see Allah. It is the statement of Allah (تعالى) about the wicked sinners:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">كَلَّا إِنَّهُمْ عَن رَّبِّهِمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ لَّمَحْجُوبُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">No! Surely, they will be veiled from (seeing) their Lord that day.</span> [Sūrah al-Muṭaffifīn, 83:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point he makes from the verse is that since such people will be veiled from Allah due to his anger with them, then it can be understood that those with whom he is pleased will not be veiled. So if the people who gain his anger are veiled from Allah then the people who gain his pleasure will see Him (عزّ وجلّ)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This deduction of Imam al-Shāfi’ī is definitely very strong because if everyone was going to be veiled, prevented from seeing their Lord, then there would have been no reason to specifically mention only the wicked people in the verse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also believe that seeing Allah in this life is impossible. This is because the current nature and condition of humans is one that cannot bear looking at Allah (عزّ وجلّ). How could it when the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) told us about his Lord:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">حِجَابُهُ النُّورُ ، لَوْ كَشَفَهُ لأَحْرَقَتْ سُبُحَاتُ وَجْهِهِ مَا انْتَهَى إِلَيْهِ بَصَرُهُ مِنْ خَلْقِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">His veil is light. If he were to remove it, the splendor of his face would burn his creation, consuming it as far as his sight reaches.</span>[Recorded by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for seeing Allah in the hereafter, it is certainly possible because people that day will be in a different world. Their nature and condition will be different than they are in this life. And this is known from all the texts of the Quran and Sunnah that tell about how people will be, what they will experience during the events of the resurrection and of their final abode in either the home of bliss or Hell.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">About the believers seeing their Lord, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) was once with his companions on a night when the full moon was out. He looked up at the moon and said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّكُمْ سَتَرَوْنَ رَبَّكُمْ كَمَا تَرَوْنَ هَذَا الْقَمَرَ ، لا تُضَامُونَ فِي رُؤْيَتِهِ ، فَإِنْ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ أَنْ  لا تُغْلَبُوا عَلَى صَلاةٍ قَبْلَ طُلُوعِ الشَّمْسِ وَصَلاةٍ قَبْلَ غُرُوبِ الشَّمْسِ فَافْعَلُوا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">You will certainly see your Lord just as you can see this moon; you will have no trouble in seeing him. So if you can avoid missing a prayer before the sun rises and a prayer before it sets, then do so.</span> [Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The statement, “You will certainly see your Lord” is addressed to the believers. As for “just as you can see this moon,” this is a real, actual seeing because when we see the moon, it is actual sight with our eyes. The comparison here is between the sight of the moon and the sight of Allah, and it is not a comparison between the moon and Allah because there is nothing like or comparable to Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) would sometimes try to bring the meaning of what he is talking about closer to people by mentioning what they understand of perceptible things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, Abū Razīn al-‘Uqaylī, a companion of the messenger, once asked him, “Messenger of Allah, will each one of us see his Lord, individually on the Day of Resurrection? And what is a sign similar to that among his creation?” He ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم .) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَبَا رَزِينٍ ، أَلَيْسَ كُلُّكُمْ يَرَى الْقَمَرَ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ مُخْلِيًا بِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Abū Razīn, do you not each individually see the full moon?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abū Razīn answered, “Yes.” The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) then told him:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَاللَّهُ أَعْظَمُ ، فَإِنَّمَا هُوَ خَلْقٌ مِنْ خَلْقِ اللَّهِ ، فَاللَّهُ أَجَلُّ وَأَعْظَمُ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Allah is even greater. That (the moon) is only a single creation from Allah’s creation, but Allah is even more exalted and greater.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[Recorded by Imām Aḥmad (4/11) and Abū Dāwūd (no. 4731). al-Albānī said it is authentic in “Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan Abī Dāwūd” (3957)</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for “<strong>you will have no trouble in seeing him</strong>” in the earlier ḥadīth, different wordings have come in similar narrations, but the point is that no one will prevent another from seeing Allah due to crowding or anything else. Each person will see him ( (سبحانه وتعالى while he is in the utmost state of tranquility and peace.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for “<strong>So if you can avoid missing a prayer before the sun rises and a prayer before it sets, then do so</strong>,” the prayer before sunrise is Fajr, the morning prayer, and before sunset is ‘Aṣr, the afternoon prayer. ‘Aṣr is even better than Fajr because it is the middle prayer which Allah has specifically told us to safeguard after mentioning prayers in general.[167] But Fajr is better than ‘Aṣr from a different perspective in that it is the prayer that is specifically witnessed by the angels as Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَقِمِ الصَّلَاةَ لِدُلُوكِ الشَّمْسِ إِلَىٰ غَسَقِ اللَّيْلِ وَقُرْآنَ الْفَجْرِ ۖ إِنَّ قُرْآنَ الْفَجْرِ كَانَ مَشْهُودًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Keep up prayer from the declining of the sun till the darkness of night and the morning recitation; surely the morning recitation is witnessed</span>. [Sūrah al-Isrā, 17:78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There also occurs in an authentic ḥadīth:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ صَلَّى الْبَرْدَيْنِ دَخَلَ الْجَنَّةَ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Whoever prayers the two cool ones will enter Paradise.</span>[Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The two cool prayers are Fajr and ‘Aṣr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What practical benefit do we gain from knowing these verses (and ḥadīth) about the believers seeing their Lord in Paradise? There is no greater effect on a person’s behavioral approach and direction in life than this. When anyone realizes that his main objective, the height of his reward is to look upon the face of his Lord, this life and everything in it then becomes almost worthless to him in comparison. Nothing else would compare or be as precious to him as reaching that moment of seeing Allah (عزّ وجلّ). It is the goal of every seeker; it is the final achievement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you know that you will one day see your Lord with your own eyes, then by Allah this life would not mean a thing to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everything of this world is nothing in comparison because the sight of Allah’s face is the prize for which the competitors compete, the goal to which the racers race, and it is the greatest triumph of everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you know this, will you strive to reach it or not?</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[167] This occurs in Sūrah al-Baqarah, 2:238:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">حَافِظُوا عَلَى الصَّلَوَاتِ وَالصَّلَاةِ الْوُسْطَىٰ وَقُومُوا لِلَّهِ قَانِتِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Attend constantly to prayers and (in particular) to the middle prayer, and stand up truly obedient to Allah.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Our Lord&#8217;s Descent</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said in an authentic ḥadīth:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَنْزِلُ رَبُّنَا تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى كُلَّ لَيْلَةٍ إِلَى السَّمَاءِ الدُّنْيَا حِينَ يَبْقَى ثُلُثُ اللَّيْلِ </span><span style="color:#000000;">الآخِرُ ، يَقُولُ : مَنْ يَدْعُونِي فَأَسْتَجِيبَ لَهُ ؟ مَنْ يَسْأَلُنِي فَأُعْطِيَهُ ؟ مَنْ يَسْتَغْفِرُنِي </span><span style="color:#000000;">؟ فَأَغْفِرَ لَهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Our Lord, the blessed and exalted, descends every night to the sky of this world when the last third of the night remains. He asks, “Who is calling on me so I can answer him? Who is asking me (for anything) so I can give (it to) him? Who is asking for my forgiveness so I can forgive him?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Recorded by al-Bukhārī (no. 1145) and Muslim (no. 758)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This ḥadīth is a proof confirming the descent of Allah to the lowest heaven, the sky of this world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people of knowledge said this ḥadīth has come with many different chains of narration, and the scholars have always agreed that it is one of the famous ḥadīth often mentioned by the scholars of the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) says,  &#8220;<strong>Our Lord descends every night to the sky of this world</strong>.&#8221; Allah’s descent is real and actual because, as we have mentioned before, anything mentioned with a pronoun that refers back to Allah, it must be attributed to him in a real, actual manner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we should believe in it and accept it as truth, saying just as the ḥadīth says, “<strong>Our Lord descends to the sky of this world</strong>,” to the lowest heaven closest to the earth. There are seven heavens, and Allah (عزّ وجلّ) descends at this time during the night to be near his worshippers just as he does during the afternoon on the Day of ‘Arafah (during the pilgrimage), praising and boasting to the angels about his worshippers. [<span style="color:#ff0000;">41</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for &#8220;<strong>every night</strong>&#8221; it is general to include every single night of the year. &#8220;<strong>when the last third of the night remains</strong>&#8220;. In Islamic legislation, the night begins at sunset and this is unanimously agreed upon. The difference (among scholars) however comes with regards to when the night ends. Does it end with the appearance of first light or the actual rising of the sun? Apparently, the night, according to legislation, ends with the appearance of first light, and the common, “astral” night ends with sunrise. Allah asks, &#8221; “Who is calling on me…”. This is a question yet really intended as an encouragement and motivation rather than expecting an actual answer. It is like his statement (in the Qur&#8217;an):</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">هَلْ أَدُلُّكُمْ عَلَى تِجَارَةٍ تُنجِيكُم مِّنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Shall I guide you to a transaction that will save you from a painful punishment?</span> [Sūrah al-Ṣaf, 61:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>…calling on me…</strong>” saying, “Oh Lord…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>…so I can answer him?</strong>” This is the result and reward for doing the first part – calling on Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> “<strong>Who is asking me (for anything) so I can give (it to) him?</strong>” such as saying, “I ask You for Paradise,” or similar things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>Who is asking for my forgiveness…</strong>” saying, “Oh Allah, forgive me,” or “I seek your forgiveness, Allah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>…so I can forgive him?</strong>” Forgiveness means to conceal one’s sins and overlook them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With this, it should be clear to every person who reads this ḥadīth that what is meant by “<strong>descends</strong>” here is that Allah Himself descends. We do not even need to say He descends “<strong>personally</strong>” because as long as the verb is associated with Him, then He himself does it. Still, some scholars did say, “He personally descends.” They resorted to saying that, compelled to adding “personally” only because there are those people who twist the meaning of ḥadīth, claiming that what really descends is the decision and decree of Allah. Others say it is Allah’s mercy that descends, and even others say it is one of his angels that descends.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of these are incorrect. For one thing, Allah’s decision and decree are constantly descending, and not only during the last third of night as he ( تعالى ) says generally:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يُدَبِّرُ الأَمْرَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ إِلَى الأَرْضِ ثُمَّ يَعْرُجُ إِلَيْهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">He arranges each matter from the heaven to the earth then it will ascend to him</span>.[Sūrah al-Sajdah, 32:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِلَيْهِ يُرْجَعُ الأَمْرُ كُلُّهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And to him the matter will return, all of it</span>.[Sūrah Hūd, 11:123]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for their statement that it is really only the mercy of Allah that descends to the worldly sky when the last third of night remains, Allah is above such deficiencies and insults! Mercy does not descend except at that time?! Allah ( تعالى ) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا بِكُم مِّن نِّعْمَةٍ فَمِنَ اللَّهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whatever you have of blessing, it is from Allah</span>. [Sūrah al-Naḥl, 16:53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every blessing and favor is from Allah, and they are the results of his mercy; they can be witnessed at all times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We could then ask: What good does it do for us if mercy descends only down to the sky (and no further)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who say it is really only an angel that descends, we ask: Does it make sense that an angel would say, “Who is calling on me so I can answer him? Who is asking me for anything…”?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is clear that these claims are distorted meanings, they are incorrect and proven so by the ḥadīth itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Allah, such people who claim these things do not know more about Allah than Allah’s messenger, they are certainly not more sincere in advising the servants of Allah than his messenger, and they are not more precise and eloquent in speech than the messenger of Allah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people also ask: How can you say Allah descends? If He does so, then what about His being high above everything? What about His being over the throne? If He descends, this would involve movement and relocation. Also, if He descends, this would be an action that happens and anything that happens must have a cause.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To this we say: This is baseless and pointless arguing. There is no reason not to say that Allah’s descent is real. Do you know what Allah deserves (of characteristics and descriptions) more than the companions of the messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The companions never made any of these false assumptions and conjectures. Instead they listened, they believed, they accepted, and they trusted it as absolute truth. Yet now, you people come and challenge the meanings, arguing for the sake of falsehood, asking, “How? Why?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We say Allah descends, and we do not delve into asking, “What about his throne? Does this mean he leaves it or not?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his being above, we say he descends and yet he is still high above his creation because “descent” here does not necessarily mean that he is surrounded by the lowest heaven to which he descends while the other heavens are above him. Rather, he is not contained within anything of his creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allah actually descends in a real manner while he is actually high above in a real manner, and nothing is similar to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rising over the throne is an action, not a permanent, personal characteristic. We should not, as far as I am concerned, begin asking whether he leaves the throne or not. Instead, we should keep silent about it just as the companions did, may Allah be pleased with them all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the scholars of those who follow the Sunnah take one of three positions regarding the issue of whether Allah leaves his throne during his descent. Some say he leaves the throne, others say he does not leave it, and others say we should remain silent and not delve into the issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah says in his <em>al-Risālah al-‘Arshiyyah</em> that Allah does not leave the throne (during his descent) because the evidence confirming he is on the throne is strong and explicit just as this ḥadīth is also a strong, explicit proof of his descent. The actions and characteristics of Allah (عزّ وجلّ) are not to be measured by those of creation. So we should leave the texts of his being on the throne confirmed as they are just as we leave the text of his descent confirmed as it is. We say he is established on his throne and yet he still descends to the sky of this world; Allah alone knows the “how” of it. Our minds are too deficient and incomplete to know everything about Allah, the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second position is that Allah leaves the throne during his descent and the third position is to remain silent – in other words, not to say whether he does or does not leave his throne.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people more recently bring up yet another point of confusion. <strong>Since the earth is round and revolves around the sun, they ask how Allah can descend during the last third of the night when the last third is a constant time</strong>. For example, when the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia leaves this time, Europe and surrounding countries enter it. So is Allah constantly and forever descending?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In reply, we say: First and foremost, you should simply believe and accept that Allah descends during this specific time. If you do believe in it, then there is nothing else required from you. Do not go into asking, “How?” Instead, accept that when the last third of night remains in Saudi Arabia, then Allah descends, and when it remains in America, Allah also descends. And His descent finishes when the light of morning appears in any place, respective to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To conclude, our position is that we believe and accept everything that has come to us from Allah’s messenger, Muhammad ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) in that Allah comes down to the sky of this world, the lowest heaven, when the last third of night remains and he asks, “Who is calling on me so I can answer him? Who is asking me (for anything) so I can give (it to) him? Who is asking for my forgiveness so I can forgive him?”</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Beneficial Points We Learn from This Ḥadīth</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>This amazing ḥadīth:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Confirms that Allah is high above creation based on the words, &#8220;<strong>Our Lord descends</strong>.&#8221;</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Confirms that Allah does actions by his choice and will—these are known as “action” characteristics (see footnote no. 7 of the <a href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2012/06/22/in-the-company-of-allaah-confirming-that-allaah-is-with-his-creation-shaykh-ibn-al-uthaymeen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">main article</a>)—based on the statement, &#8220;<strong>Our Lord descends…when the last third of the night remains.</strong>.&#8221;</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Confirms that Allah speaks based on the statement, &#8220;<strong>He asks…</strong>&#8220;</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Confirms Allah’s kindness and generosity based on his questions, <strong>“Who is calling on me…? Who is asking me…? Who is asking for my forgiveness…?”</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People should take advantage of this part of the night, asking for whatever they need from Allah, calling upon him, and asking his forgiveness as he asks, “Who is calling on me…? Who is asking me…? Who is asking for my forgiveness…?” And again, the word “Who” here is presented in the form of a question but is actually intended to motivate rather than ask.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we should take advantage of this chance because nothing that has passed of your life is in your favor except the times you spent in obedience to Allah. Perhaps more days may pass you by, but when death comes it will be as if you were only born that minute. At that time, everything of one’s past life will mean nothing to him.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">41</span>] The ḥadīth about this is recorded by Muslim (no. 1348). The prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَا مِنْ يَوْمٍ أَكْثَرَ مِنْ أَنْ يُعْتِقَ اللَّهُ فِيهِ عَبْدًا مِنْ النَّارِ مِنْ يَوْمِ عَرَفَةَ وَإِنَّهُ لَيَدْنُو ثُمَّ يُبَاهِي بِهِمْ الْمَلائِكَةَ ، فَيَقُولُ :  مَا </span><span style="color:#000000;"> أَرَادَ هَؤُلاءِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">There is no day on which Allah frees more servants from the fire than the Day of ‘Arafah. He comes near (them) and praises and boasts about them to the angels, saying, “What do these want?” (or “Anything they want!”)</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Day of Resurrection: The Tenth Event</strong></span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Bridge</strong></span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic word صِرَاط (Ṣirāṭ) is the bridge stretched over Hell over which people will cross to get to Paradise. About it, Allah ( تعالى ) says:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِن مِّنكُمْ إِلَّا وَارِدُهَا ۚ كَانَ عَلَىٰ رَبِّكَ حَتْمًا مَّقْضِيًّا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And there is none of you except that he will pass over it. This is with your Lord a decree which must be accomplished</span>.[Sūrah Maryam, 19:71]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abdullāh Ibn Mas’ūd, Qatādah, and Zayd Ibn Aslam explained this verse to mean the crossing of the bridge. Others, including Ibn ‘Abbās, explained that it describes those who will enter the fire but will be saved from it.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ يُضْرَبُ الْجِسْرُ عَلَى جَهَنَّمَ ، وَتَحِلُّ الشَّفَاعَةُ وَيَقُولُونَ : اللَّهُمَّ سَلِّمْ سَلِّمْ</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the bridge will be placed over Hell and intercession will be permitted. They (the messengers) will say, “Oh Allah, save (us), save (us).” [<span style="color:#ff0000;">113</span>]</p>





<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars have differed as to the exact nature of this bridge. Some say it is a wide path over which people will cross according to the deeds they did in this life. They say it is wide because the word “bridge,” taken at face value, means just that and because Allah’s messenger ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) described it as being slippery and elusive. They understood that the bridge must be somewhat wide because a very narrow path would not be described with the specific Arabic words (slippery and elusive) that the prophet used. When asked about the bridge, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَدْحَضَةٌ مَزِلَّةٌ عَلَيْهِ خَطَاطِيفُ وَكَلالِيبُ وَحَسَكَةٌ مُفَلْطَحَةٌ لَهَا شَوْكَةٌ عُقَيْفَاءُ</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;"><span style="color:#808000;">It is slippery, elusive with hooks and grapples, and broad spikes and curved thorns</span>.</span>[Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the ḥadīth narrated by Abū Hurayrah, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَبِهِ كَلالِيبُ مِثْلُ شَوْكِ السَّعْدَانِ غَيْرَ أَنَّهَا لا يَعْلَمُ قَدْرَ عِظَمِهَا إِلاَّ اللَّهُ فَتَخْطَفُ </span><span style="color:#000000;">النَّاسَ بِأَعْمَالِهِمْ</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">It has hooks like the thorns of al-Sa’dān (a place in Najd) except that no one but Allah knows the huge size of them. They will seize people according to their deeds</span>.[Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Other scholars said no, it is actually a very narrow bridge just as has come in a ḥadīth narrated by Abū Sa’īd al-Khudrī ( رضي الله عنه ) in which he said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">بَلَغَنِي أَنَّ الصِّرَاطَ أَحَدُّ مِنَ السَّيْفِ وَأَدَقُّ مِنَ الشَّعْرَةِ</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">He informed (or: It has reached) me that the bridge is sharper that a sword and thinner than a hair.</span>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">116</span>]</p>
<p>

</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Here we come to a question: How is it possible for people to actually pass over a bridge like this? The answer is that the events and things to occur in the hereafter cannot be compared to or measured based solely on what we know of things of this life. Allah is capable of anything, and we do not know exactly how people will cross it. Will they cross in groups or one at a time? Allah knows best.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">But regarding this issue—whether the bridge is wide or narrow—it is not incumbent on people to accept one position over the other because both groups of scholars have strong points.</p>



<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Crossing the Bridge</span></strong></h3>



<p style="text-align:justify;">No one will cross the bridge except the believers. As for the disbelievers, they will be taken straight to the fire. The believers will cross it according to their deeds based on the ḥadīth narrated by Abū Sa’īd al-Khudrī ( رضي الله عنه ) that the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَيَمُرُّ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ كَطَرْفِ الْعَيْنِ وَكَالْبَرْقِ وَكَالرِّيحِ وَكَالطَّيْرِ وَكَأَجَاوِيدِ الْخَيْلِ  </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَالرِّكَابِ فَنَاجٍ مُسَلَّمٌ وَمَخْدُوشٌ مُرْسَلٌ وَمَكْدُوسٌ فِي نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">The believers will cross: some as fast as the blink of an eye, some like lightning, some like the wind, some like a bird, some like horses, and some as fast as camels. Some people will be safe a secure, some will be scratched but delivered, and others will fall into the fire of Hell</span>.[Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">The speed at which a person crosses is obviously not by his choice. If it were, naturally everyone would want to cross quickly. Rather, the passage across is according to the speed at which he used to accept religious teachings in this life. So whoever was always quick to accept the teachings of the messengers, he will pass quickly over the bridge. Whoever was slow to accept them will pass slowly over the bridge. It is a suitable reward and the reward is according to the deed.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people will be seized by hooks that are on the bridge and, again, this will only be according to their deeds. As for the prophet’s statement, “others will fall into the fire of Hell,” it is understood that the fire into which sinners will fall is the same fire the disbelievers will be in. However, these believing sinners will still not experience the same punishment as disbelievers will. Some scholars have even said that this fire will be cool and safe for them just as the fire was cool and peaceful on Prophet Abraham. [<span style="color:#ff0000;">118</span>]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">However, what is more apparent is that this is not the case; the fire will likely be hot and painful but not as intense as the heat the disbelievers in Allah will experience. As a side note, the points on the body upon which believers prostrate during prayer will never be touched by the fire just as it has been reported by the prophet in “Ṣaḥīḥ al- Bukhārī” and “Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim.” [<span style="color:#ff0000;">119</span>] The places of prostration are those that touch the ground: the forehead, nose, palms, knees, and the toes.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">In a ḥadīth in “Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim,” the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) also said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">تَجْرِي بِهِمْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ وَنَبِيُّكُمْ قَائِمٌ عَلَى الصِّرَاطِ يَقُولُ : رَبِّ سَلِّمْ سَلِّمْ حَتَّى تَعْجِزَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَعْمَالُ الْعِبَادِ حَتَّى يَجِيءَ الرَّجُلُ فَلا يَسْتَطِيعُ السَّيْرَ إِلاَّ زَحْفًا</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Their deeds will carry them (over the bridge) while your prophet is standing on the bridge saying, “My Lord, save (them), save (them).” Some servants’ deeds will hinder them so much that a man will be unable to pass over except while crawling.</span> [Recorded by Muslim.]</p>





<p style="text-align:justify;">And in “Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī:”</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">حَتَّى يَمُرَّ آخِرُهُمْ يُسْحَبُ سَحْبًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">…until the last of them crosses being dragged.</span>[Recorded by al-Bukhārī]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">The first of the prophets to cross the bridge will be Muhammad ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and the first of all religious nations will be his nation as the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَأَكُونُ أَنَا وَأُمَّتِي أَوَّلَ مَنْ يُجِيزُهَا ، وَلا يَتَكَلَّمُ يَوْمَئِذٍ إِلاَّ الرُّسُلُ ، وَدَعْوَى الرُّسُلِ </span><span style="color:#000000;">يَوْمَئِذٍ : اللَّهُمَّ سَلِّمْ سَلِّمْ</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">I and my nation will be the first to be allowed to cross it. On that day, no one will speak except the messengers and the prayer of the messengers that day will be, “Oh Allah, save (us), save (us)!</span> [Recorded by al-Bukhārī]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah says, “After they cross, they will stop at a bridge/platform between Paradise and the fire and they will settle any unresolved issues between themselves.”</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">This area is a small bridge or platform, and this settling of disagreements between them is not the major settling of affairs and retribution that occurs between people on the Day of Resurrection. Instead, this particular reconciliation is to resolve any bad feelings, grudges, or anger that may still remain in people’s hearts. So in a sense, this is a period of purification because the major settling of disagreements does not necessarily remove all feelings of resentment within people’s hearts.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">So this bridge or platform between Paradise and Hell is to purify the hearts so that the believers enter Paradise having no bad feelings for one another as Allah ( تعالى ) says:</p>





<h2><span style="color:#000000;">ادْخُلُوهَا بِسَلَامٍ آمِنِينَ وَنَزَعْنَا مَا فِي صُدُورِهِم مِّنْ غِلٍّ إِخْوَانًا عَلَىٰ سُرُرٍ مُّتَقَابِلِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Enter it with peace, safe and secure. And we will remove whatever is in their breasts of resentment, (so they will become) brothers, on thrones facing each other</span>.[Sūrah al-Ḥijr, 15:46-47]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">About this bridge before Paradise, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا خَلَصَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ مِنَ النَّارِ ، حُبِسُوا بِقَنْطَرَةٍ بَيْنَ الْجَنَّةِ وَالنَّارِ ، فَيَتَقَاصُّونَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">مَظَالِمَ كَانَتْ بَيْنَهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا ، حَتَّى إِذَا نُقُّوا وَهُذِّبُوا أُذِنَ لَهُمْ بِدُخُولِ الْجَنَّةِ ،</span><span style="color:#000000;">فَوَالَّذِي نَفْسُ مُحَمَّدٍ بِيَدِهِ لأَحَدُهُمْ بِمَسْكَنِهِ فِي الْجَنَّةِ أَدَلُّ بِمَنْزِلِهِ كَانَ فِي الدُّنْيَا</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">When the believers are delivered from the fire, they will be detained at the bridge between Paradise and the fire to settle whatever injustices may have occurred between them in life. When they have all become refined and purified, entrance into Paradise will be granted. And I swear by the one in whose hand is Muhammad’s life, each individual will recognize his home in Paradise even more so than he does his home in this life.</span> [Recorded by al-Bukhārī]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[113] Recorded by by al-Bukhārī and Muslim. The wording of Muslim is above; the wording of al-Bukhārī is:</p>
<p>

</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يُضْرَبُ جِسْرُ جَهَنَّمَ ، فَأَكُونُ أَوَّلَ مَنْ يُجِيزُ ، وَدُعَاءُ الرُّسُلِ يَوْمَئِذٍ : اللَّهُمَّ سَلِّمْ سَلِّمْ</span></h2>
<p>

</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">The bridge of Hell will be placed and I will be the first to be permitted. The supplication of the messengers that day will be, “Oh Allah, save (us), save (us).”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[116] Recorded by Imām Aḥmad in a marfū’ form meaning some ḥadīth scholars accept it as being “raised” to the status of an actual statement of the prophet himself ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ). Imam Muslim also mentioned it in his authentic collection as a comment to another ḥadīth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[118] This is when the disbelieving people attempted to burn Abraham for destroying their idols. About this, Allah says in Sūrah al-Anbiyā, 21:68-69:</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;">قَالُوا حَرِّقُوهُ وَانصُرُوا آلِهَتَكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ فَاعِلِينَ قُلْنَا يَا نَارُ كُونِي بَرْدًا وَسَلَامًا عَلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ</span></h2>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">They said, “Burn him and support your gods if you are to act.” We (Allah) said, “Fire, be coolness and safety upon Abraham.”</span></p>
<p>

</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[119] The ḥadīth, recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim, is:</p>
<p>

</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا أَرَادَ اللَّهُ رَحْمَةَ مَنْ أَرَادَ مِنْ أَهْلِ النَّارِ أَمَرَ اللَّهُ الْمَلائِكَةَ أَنْ يُخْرِجُوا مَنْ كَانَ يَعْبُدُ اللَّهَ فَيُخْرِجُونَهُمْ وَيَعْرِفُونَهُمْ بِآثَارِ السُّجُودِ وَحَرَّمَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُ عَلَى النَّارِ أَنْ تَأْكُلَ أَثَرَ السُّجُودِ</span></h2>
<p>

</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">When Allah wants mercy for someone from the people of the fire, he commands the angels to take out whoever used to worship Allah. So they (the angels) will recognize them by the marks of prostration because Allah has forbidden the fire from destroying the marks of prostration.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Sixth Event</strong></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Scales are Placed &amp; Deeds are Weighed</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one of the verses that proves the scales will be setup on the Day of Resurrection, Allah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">فَمَن ثَقُلَتْ مَوَازِينُهُ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And those whose scales are heavy </strong>(with good deeds)<strong>, it is they who will be successful</strong></span>.[Sūrah al-Muminūn, 23:102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The verse contains a conditional clause; the condition is &#8220;<strong>those whose scales are heavy</strong>&#8220;, and if that condition is met, the consequence is &#8220;<strong>it is they who will be successful</strong>.&#8221; By &#8220;<strong>scales are heavy</strong>&#8220;, what is meant is that one’s good deeds outweigh his bad. &#8220;<strong>Successful</strong>&#8221; here describes an individual who achieves what he hopes for and is saved from what he fears. So he is given safety from what he hates and rewarded with what he loves. Allah also says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَنْ خَفَّتْ مَوَازِينُهُ فَأُولَئِكَ الَّذِينَ خَسِرُوا أَنفُسَهُمْ فِي جَهَنَّمَ خَالِدُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>But those whose scales are light, it is they who have lost their souls. In Hell they will abide forever</strong></span>. [Sūrah al-Muminūn, 23:103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who do not believe in Allah will <strong>&#8220;have lost their souls</strong>.&#8221; They will lose themselves, their families, and the possessions they hold dear:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ إِنَّ الْخَاسِرِينَ الَّذِينَ خَسِرُوا أَنفُسَهُمْ وَأَهْلِيهِمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ۖ أَلا ذَلِكَ هُوَ الْخُسْرَانُ الْمُبِينُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Say: Indeed, the losers are the ones who will lose themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection. Unquestionably, that is the clear loss</span></strong>.[Sūrah al-Zumar, 39:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for a believer in Allah whose behavior was righteous, he will have succeeded, gaining his soul, his family, and his possessions, having benefited from all of them. People who do not believe in Allah (or disbelieve in Allah’s “oneness”) will lose themselves because they will have not benefited from their very existence in life. In fact such people, despite what they presumably achieve in life, actually achieve no true benefit and gain only harm (in the hereafter). In a sense, they even lose their wealth in life as they gain no real benefit from it. Even when they may share it with others among creation, such charity does not benefit the givers. Allah (تعالى) says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا مَنَعَهُمْ أَن تُقْبَلَ مِنْهُمْ نَفَقَاتُهُمْ إِلَّا أَنَّهُمْ كَفَرُوا بِاللَّهِ وَبِرَسُولِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And nothing prevents their spending from being accepted from them except that they disbelieved in Allah and in his messenger</strong></span>.[Sūrah al-Tawbah, 9:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They also lose their families because their families will either be in the fire with them, or if their families are in Paradise, such disbelievers will still have lost them because they themselves will be in the fire. Any individual who dies while disbelieving in Allah will never again enjoy the company of his family. Such enjoyment will be locked out from a disbeliever as soon as he is locked in his coffin, and each one will imagine no one else is receiving a harsher punishment than he.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#000000;">whose scales are light</span></strong>&#8220;, this means his bad deeds will outweigh his good or he will have no good deeds whatsoever. This is the meaning if we accept the position that disbelievers will have their deeds weighed which seems apparent from the verse in Sūrah al-Muminūn, 23:103 and others like it. And this position is one of the two held by religious scholars. The other opinion, that disbelievers will not have their deeds weighed, is the second position and it is based on the verses:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ هَلْ نُنَبِّئُكُم بِالْأَخْسَرِينَ أَعْمَالً الَّذِينَ ضَلَّ سَعْيُهُمْ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَهُمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُمْ يُحْسِنُونَ صُنْعًا أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بِآيَاتِ رَبِّهِمْ وَلِقَائِهِ فَحَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ فَلَا نُقِيمُ لَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ وَزْنًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Say: Shall we inform you of the greatest losers as to (their) deeds? Those whose effort is lost in the worldly life while they thought they were doing good work. Those are the ones who disbelieve in the verses of their Lord and in (their) meeting him. So their deeds have become worthless, and we will not assign to them on the Day of Resurrection any weight.</span></strong> [Sūrah al-Kahf, 18:103-105]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the two positions, whether disbelievers will have their deeds weighed or not, Allah knows best which is correct.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic word for scales used in some verses, ( مَوَازِيْن <em>mawāzīn</em>), has been reported in other texts in both the singular and plural forms. As for the plural form, Allah (تعالى) says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَنَضَعُ الْمَوَازِينَ الْقِسْطَ لِيَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ فَلَا تُظْلَمُ نَفْسٌ شَيْئًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And we place the scales of justice for the Day of Resurrection, so no soul will be treated unjustly in any way. </strong></span>[Sūrah al-Anbiyā, 21:47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَالْوَزْنُ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْحَقُّ ۚ فَمَن ثَقُلَتْ مَوَازِينُهُ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ وَمَنْ خَفَّتْ مَوَازِينُهُ فَأُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ خَسِرُوا أَنفُسَهُم بِمَا كَانُوا بِآيَاتِنَا يَظْلِمُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">And the weighing (of deeds) that day will be true. So those whose scales are heavy, it is they who will be successful. And those whose scales are light, they will lose themselves for what injustice they were doing toward our verses.</span> </strong>[Sūrah al-‘Arāf, 7:8-9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the singular form, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">كَلِمَتَانِ حَبِيبَتَانِ إِلَى الرَّحْمَنِ خَفِيفَتَانِ عَلَى اللِّسَانِ ثَقِيلَتَانِ فِي الْمِيزَانِ : سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ الْعَظِيمِ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There are two statements beloved to the Most Merciful, light on the tongue but heavy on the scale: “Glorified is Allah and all thanks are for him,” and “Glorified is Allah the greatest.”</strong> </span>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">59</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this ḥadīth, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) mentioned the singular form, ( مِيْزَان <em>mīzān</em>), “scale.” So how do we understand the Quran verses which mention “scales” and this ḥadīth which mentions “scale?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps it is mentioned in the plural form only as a way of speaking about what is weighed – deeds – which is plural. Then it is mentioned in the ḥadīth in singular form because the scale is actually one. It could also be because perhaps there is one scale for each nation or even that the prophet meant “heavy in weight” when he said, “heavy on the scale.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, what is apparent—and Allah knows best—is that the scale is actually one but is mentioned in plural form with regards to what is weighed (i.e., deeds). This linguistic usage can also be seen in the verse:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; فَمَن ثَقُلَتْ مَوَازِينُهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So those whose scales are heavy&#8230;</strong></span>[Sūrah al-A’rāf, 7:8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this verse, it is not actually the scales that are heavy, rather it is a form of Arabic speech in which one word (e.g. scales) is used to mean another word relating to the former (e.g. deeds).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a related issue but one into which people have not delved: Will there be a single scale setup for all nations, all mankind, or will there be one for each nation (e.g., one for Muhammad’s nation, one for Jesus’ nation, one for Moses’, etc.)? This question may be relevant because some texts indicate the rewards for deeds vary for different nations. [<span style="color:#ff0000;">61</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These texts, taken at face value, are apparent in that the scale will be real and tangible as this is exactly how the word “scale” is commonly understood. This is because the principle of understanding religious texts reported in the Quran or Sunnah is that they are to be understood upon the commonly known, real and actual meanings of their words unless there is clear evidence that they should be understood differently (i.e. metaphorically). The commonly understood meaning to all Muslim teachers, writers, and lecturers ever since the Quran was revealed up until today is that the scale is real. However, some misguided sects have differed in understanding. For example, those who incorrectly believe any texts can be figurative, having metaphorical meanings instead of what the words actually mean, they claim that there will not be a real scale setup on the Day of Resurrection. They insist that there is really no need for an actual scale to weigh actions because Allah already knows the deeds of his servants and their worth. Instead, they claim that “scale” is allegorical and it really means Allah’s “fairness” or “justice.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No doubt, the claim of such people is incorrect because it contradicts the outward, apparent meaning of the word and the consensus of all the righteous predecessors who understood the word to mean what the word actually means – scale. If we say the meaning is figurative and it really means fairness or justice, then there is little meaning in the several texts which mention “scale,” they would simply say “justice” (as other texts do) because the characteristics of fairness and justice are closer to and speak more directly to people’s souls than the word “scale” anyway. For this reason, Allah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَأْمُرُ بِالْعَدْلِ وَالْإِحْسَانِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Indeed, Allah orders justice and good conduct.</span></strong>[Sūrah al-Naḥl, 16:90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The correct understanding is to take the word “scale” on its intended, actual meaning. We say that the correct understanding is the same one revealed – scale. The “<strong>Ḥadīth of the Card</strong>” (to be mentioned soon) also proves that it is a real, actual scale with weighing pans. This ḥadīth mentions that scrolls of bad deeds placed in one pan will be lighter than a single card placed in the other pan which will be heavier. So it is clear, what is correct is what was revealed – the scale is real.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The actions of the servants will then be weighed. And with that, there are two points of discussion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first point is this:</strong> How will deeds be weighed when it is known that a deed is simply a description or action of the one who performed it, and a deed has no physical form? The answer is that Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) will make these deeds into actual, physical forms. This should not be unbelievably strange when considering the capability of Allah (عزّ وجل). As an analogy, death will be made into the form of a ram on the Day of Judgment and it will be slaughtered between Paradise and Hell [<span style="color:#ff0000;">63</span>] while death now is simply a concept and not a physical form. And to clarify a side-note, the Angel of Death is not the one slaughtered here; it is actually death that Allah (تعالى) will make into a physical form everyone will witness and see. Similarly, Allah (عزّ وجل)جلwill turn deeds into actual forms that will be actually weighed with this actual scale.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second point:</strong> Deeds will actually be weighed, both good and bad. This is the apparent understanding as Allah (تعالى) says in the Quran:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">يَوْمَئِذٍ يَصْدُرُ النَّاسُ أَشْتَاتًا لِّيُرَوْا أَعْمَالَهُمْ  فَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ خَيْرًا يَرَهُ وَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ شَرًّا يَرَهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>That day, people will depart, separated (into categories) to be shown their deeds. So whoever does an atom’s weight of good will see it, and whoever does an atom’s weight of evil will see it.</strong></span> [Sūrah al-Zalzalah, 99:6-8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is clear that deeds will really be weighed whether they are good or bad. Also, as has previously been mentioned, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)said, “There are two statements beloved to the Most Merciful, light on the tongue but heavy on the scale&#8230;” This ḥadīth is also clear, even explicit, in that actions will actually be given form and weight and then weighed, and there are several other texts that prove this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there are other reliable texts that indicate that it may not be the actual deeds weighed but rather the records of deeds. An example of this type is the “Ḥadīth of the Card” in which the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَيُخَلِّصُ رَجُلاً مِنْ أُمَّتِي عَلَى رُءُوسِ الْخَلائِقِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فَيَنْشُرُ عَلَيْهِ </span><span style="color:#000000;">تِسْعَةً وَتِسْعِينَ سِجِلاًّ كُلُّ سِجِلٍّ مِثْلُ مَدِّ الْبَصَرِ ثُمَّ يَقُولُ.: أَتُنْكِرُ مِنْ هَذَا شَيْئًا ؟ </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَظَلَمَكَ كَتَبَتِي الْحَافِظُونَ ؟ فَيَقُولُ : لا يَا رَبِّ ، فَيَقُولُ : أَفَلَكَ عُذْرٌ ؟ فَيَقُولُ : لا يَا </span><span style="color:#000000;">رَبِّ ، فَيَقُولُ : بَلَى إِنَّ لَكَ عِنْدَنَا حَسَنَةً فَإِنَّهُ لا ظُلْمَ عَلَيْكَ الْيَوْمَ ، فَتَخْرُجُ بِطَاقَةٌ فِيهَا </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لا إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ ، فَيَقُولُ : احْضُرْ وَزْنَكَ ، </span><span style="color:#000000;">فَيَقُولُ : يَا رَبِّ مَا هَذِهِ الْبِطَاقَةُ مَعَ هَذِهِ السِّجِلاَّتِ ؟ فَقَالَ : إِنَّكَ لا تُظْلَمُ ، قَالَ : </span><span style="color:#000000;">فَتُوضَعُ السِّجِلاَّتُ فِي كَفَّةٍ وَالْبِطَاقَةُ فِي كَفَّةٍ فَطَاشَتْ السِّجِلاَّتُ وَثَقُلَتْ الْبِطَاقَةُ فَلا </span><span style="color:#000000;">يَثْقُلُ مَعَ اسْمِ اللَّهِ شَيْءٌ »</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allah will single out a man from my nation at the head of all the creations on the Day of Resurrection. Ninety-nine scrolls (of bad deeds) will be spread out before him, each as far as the eye can see. He will be asked, “Do you deny doing any of this? Did my recording, guardian angels wrong you in any way?” The man will answer, “No, my Lord.” He will be asked, “Do you have any excuse?” to which he will again reply, “No, my Lord.” It will then be said, “Rather you certainly do have a good deed with us and there will be no injustice on you today.” A card will then be brought out, written on it: “I testify there is nothing deserving of worship but Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is his servant and messenger.” The man will be told, “Present yourself for your weighing.” He will ask, “My Lord, what is this card compared to all these scrolls (of bad deeds)?” He (Allah) will tell him, “You will certainly not be wronged.” So the scrolls will be placed in one pan (of the scale) and the card in the other, and the scrolls will be lighter and the card heavier as nothing is heavier than the name of Allah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Recorded by al-Tirmidhī, Ibn Mājah, and Aḥmad. al-Albānī said it is authentic in his “Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan al-Tirmidhī” (no.2127)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this ḥadīth, it is apparent that it is the written records of deeds weighed instead of the deeds themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are other texts that indicate what is weighed is the person who does the deeds. For example, Allah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بِآيَاتِ رَبِّهِمْ وَلِقَائِهِ فَحَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ فَلَا نُقِيمُ لَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ وَزْنًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Those are the ones who disbelieve in the verses of their Lord and in </strong>(their)<strong> meeting with him, so their deeds have become worthless. And we will not assign to them on the Day of Resurrection any weight</strong></span>.[Sūrah al-Kahf, 18:105]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But it has been said that the meaning of &#8220;weight&#8221; in the verse could mean “significance” or “importance” instead of weight. Another indication that it may be the person himself that is weighed is the ḥadīth of Abū Hurayrah ( رضي الله عنه)in which he narrated that the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« إِنَّهُ لَيَأْتِي الرَّجُلُ الْعَظِيمُ السَّمِينُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ لا يَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ »</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>A huge, fat man will be brought on the Day of Resurrection and he will not weigh in the sight of Allah even as much as a gnat’s wing</strong> </span>[Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The understanding that it is the person who will be weighed is also indicated by the ḥadīth of Ibn Mas’ūd ( رضي الله عنه)when he was once trying to break a siwāk branch from a tree. He used to have thin legs and the wind blew and started to move him. Because of this, other companions ( رضي الله عنه)مbegan laughing at him. So the prophet ( صلّى الله ) عليه وسلّمasked them, “What are you laughing at?” They answered, “At the skinniness of his legs.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)then said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ ، لَهُمَا أَثْقَلُ فِي الْمِيزَانِ مِنْ أُحُدٍ »</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I swear by the one in who hand is my soul (Allah), they (his legs) are both heavier in the scale than Mt. Uḥud.</strong></span> [Recorded by Aḥmad (1/421) and al-Albānī classed its chain of narrators as ḥasan in “Sharḥ al-A’qīdah al-Ṭaḥāwiyyah.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So to conclude, we have texts indicating three things that will be weighed in the scale: the deeds, the records of deeds, and the person who performed the deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some scholars said the way to understand these together is simply that some people will have their deeds weighed, some will have their records of deeds weighed, and others will be weighed themselves. Other scholars said that when texts mention deeds being weighed, what is really meant is the records of deeds, and as for a person being weighed, this is specific to certain individuals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Other scholars have combined these texts with the understanding that in reality only the records of deeds are weighed, but they will be heavy or light based on the merit and greatness of the deeds written in them. So in essence, it is as if the deeds are weighed. But after reflecting on the texts relevant to this issue, we find most of them indicate that it is the deeds that are weighed. Yet some people will be exclusively chosen to have their records of deeds weighed or even the individual himself. As far as the ḥadīth of Ibn Mas’ūd or the “Ḥadīth of the Card,” it could be that these are specific situations for which Allah chooses whomever he wants from his servants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the scales are placed, people’s deeds are weighed, then the books of deeds are distributed.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Another ḥadīth which mentions “scale” in the singular form and indicates the greatness of this scale is classified as authentic by al-Albānī in “Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah” (no. 941). In it, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« يُوْضَعُ المِيْزَانُ يَوْمَ القِيَامَةِ فَلَوْ وَزِنَ فِيْهِ السَّمَوَاتِ وَالأَرْضَ لَوَسَعَتْ فَتَقُوْلُ المَلائِكَةُ : يَا رَبّ لِمَنْ يَزِنَ هَذَا ؟ فَيَقُوْلُ اللهُ تَعَالَى : لِمَنْ </span><span style="color:#000000;">شِئْتُ مِنْ خَلْقِي . فَتَقُوْلُ المَلائِكَةُ : سُبْحَانَكَمَا عَبَدْنَاكَ حَقَّ عِبَادَتِكَ . وَيُوْضَعُ الصِّرَاطُ مِثْلَ حَدِّ المُوْسَى فَتَقُوْلُ المَلائِكَةُ : مَنْ تَجِيْزُ عَلَى </span><span style="color:#000000;">هَذَا ؟ فَيَقُوْلُ : مَنْ شِئْتُ مِنْ خَلْقِيْ . فَيَقُوْلُوْنَ : سُبْحَانَكَمَا عَبَدْنَاكَ حَقَّ عِبَادَتِكَ »</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The scale will be set up on the Day of Resurrection, and if the heavens and the earth were to be weighed in it, it would be sufficient to hold them. The angels will ask, “Oh Lord, who is this for?” Allah will reply, “For whomsoever I want among my creations.” The angels will then say, “Glory to you, we have not worshipped you as you rightfully deserve to be worshipped.” And the bridge will be placed (over Hell) and it will be like the edge of a razor. The angels will ask Allah, “Who will be saved from this?” to which Allah will again reply, “Whomsoever I want among my creations.” They will say, “Glory to you, we have not worshipped you as you rightfully deserve to be worshipped.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">61</span>] One example of such texts is the ḥadīth recorded by al-Bukhārī in which the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)said comparing Muslims to Jews and Christians:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« مَثَلُكُمْ وَمَثَلُ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابَيْنِ كَمَثَلِ رَجُلٍ اسْتَأْجَرَ أُجَرَاءَ فَقَالَ : مَنْ يَعْمَلُ لِي مِنْ غُدْوَةَ إِلَى نِصْفِ النَّهَارِ عَلَى قِيرَاطٍ ؟ فَعَمِلَتْ الْيَهُودُ ، ثُمَّ قَالَ : مَنْ يَعْمَلُ لِي مِنْ نِصْفِ النَّهَارِ إِلَى صَلاةِ الْعَصْرِ عَلَى قِيرَاطٍ ؟ فَعَمِلَتْ النَّصَارَى ، ثُمَّ قَالَ : مَنْ يَعْمَلُ لِي مِنْ الْعَصْرِ إِلَى أَنْ تَغِيبَ الشَّمْسُ عَلَى قِيرَاطَيْنِ ؟ فَأَنْتُمْ هُمْ ، فَغَضِبَتْ الْيَهُودُ وَالنَّصَارَى فَقَالُوا : مَا لَنَا أَكْثَرَ عَمَلاً وَأَقَلَّ عَطَاءً ؟ قَالَ : هَلْ نَقَصْتُكُمْ مِنْ حَقِّكُمْ ؟ قَالُوا : لا ، قَالَ : فَذَلِكَ فَضْلِي أُوتِيهِ مَنْ أَشَاءُ »</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Your example compared to those of the two former scriptures can be likened to a man who hires a number of laborers. He asks, “Who will work for me from morning until midday for a certain sum?” The Jews are the ones to work at this time. Then he asks, “Who will work from midday to the late afternoon for the same sum?” The Christians are the ones to work at this time. Then he asks, “Who will work from the late afternoon until sunset for double that sum?” You (Muslims) are these people. This angers the Jews and Christians who ask, “Why did we have to work more only to receive less?” He answers, “Have you been cheated of any of your rights?” They answer, “No.” He then says, “This is my favor that I give to whom I please.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">63</span>] The proof is the ḥadīth recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim in which the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« يُؤْتَى بِالْمَوْتِ كَهَيْئَةِ كَبْشٍ أَمْلَحَ فَيُنَادِي مُنَادٍ : يَا أَهْلَ الْجَنَّةِ ، فَيَشْرَئِبُّونَ وَيَنْظُرُونَ ، فَيَقُولُ : هَلْ تَعْرِفُونَ هَذَا ؟ فَيَقُولُونَ : نَعَمْ هَذَا الْمَوْتُ ، وَكُلُّهُمْ قَدْ رَآهُ ، ثُمَّ يُنَادِي : يَا أَهْلَ النَّارِ ، فَيَشْرَئِبُّونَ وَيَنْظُرُونَ ، فَيَقُولُ : هَلْ تَعْرِفُونَ هَذَا ؟ فَيَقُولُونَ : نَعَمْ هَذَا الْمَوْتُ ، وَكُلُّهُمْ قَدْ رَآهُ ، فَيُذْبَحُ ، ثُمَّ يَقُولُ : يَا أَهْلَ الْجَنَّةِ خُلُودٌ فَلا مَوْتَ وَيَا أَهْلَ النَّارِ خُلُودٌ فَلا مَوْتَ ، ثُمَّ قَرَأَ : &#8220;وَأَنْذِرْهُمْ يَوْمَ الْحَسْرَةِ إِذْ قُضِيَ الأَمْرُ وَهُمْ فِي غَفْلَةٍ &#8220;وَهَؤُلاءِ فِي غَفْلَةٍ أَهْلُ الدُّنْيَا &#8220;وَهُمْ لا يُؤْمِنُونَ »&#8221;</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Death will be brought in the form of a black and white ram and a caller will call out, “Oh people of Paradise!” and they will stretch their necks and look. They will be asked, “Do you know what this is?” to which they will answer, “Yes, that is death,” and each of them will be able to see it. Then it will be called out, “Oh people of Hell!” They will also stretch out their necks and look. They will be asked, “Do you know what this is?” and they too will say, “Yes, it is death,” and each of them will see it. It will then be slaughtered. Then it will be said, “Oh people of Paradise, eternity and no death. Oh people of Hell, eternity and no death.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)recited:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنْذِرْهُمْ يَوْمَ الْحَسْرَةِ إِذْ قُضِيَ الأَمْرُ وَهُمْ فِي غَفْلَةٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">And warn them of the Day of Regret, when the matter will be concluded. And yet they are in heedlessness.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then said, “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And these people are headless, people of this life</strong></span>,” and finished the verse:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And they do not believe</strong></span>. [Sūrah Maryam, 19:39]</p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Sunan an-Nasaaee”</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">an-Nasaaee authored a collection which he titled: “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>as-Sunan al-Kubraa</strong></span>” in which he gathered authentic <em>Hadeeth</em> as well as those with defects in their chains. He then summarized his collection which is known as “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>as-Sunan as-Sughraa</strong></span>” although he actually called it “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>al-Mujtabaa</strong></span>”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this summarized collection, he gathered only those Hadeeth which he considered to be authentic; it is this collection that is referred to when a Hadeeth is generally attributed to anNasaaee. “al-Mujtabaa” has the least number of weak Hadeeth out of the other four collections (excluding “Saheeh al-Bukhaaree” and “Saheeh Muslim”). It also contains the least amount of chains including narrators that have been criticized (regarding their Hadeeth narrating). It occupies a status right after “Saheeh al-Bukhaaree” and “Saheeh Muslim”. From the point of only relying upon narrators that are completely void of any criticism, this collection exceeds “Sunan Abu Daawood” and “Sunan at-Tirmithee” due to an-Nasaaee’s severe scrutiny of narrators within his writings. al-Haafith Ibn Hajar said, “How numerous are the narrators that Abu Daawood and atTirmithee relied on, yet an-Nasaaee shunned recording their Hadeeth. He even avoided recording Hadeeth from some of the narrators relied upon in the two authentic collections (“Saheeh al-Bukhaaree” and “Saheeh Muslim”).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summary, the conditions of an-Nasaaee in “al-Mujtabaa” are the strongest after the two authentic collections.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">an-Nasaaee</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is ‘Abdur-Rahmaan Ahmad Ibn Shu’ayb Ibn ‘Alee an-Nasaaee, and it is said his name is anNaswee, referring to Nasa, a famous place in Khuraasaan. He was born in 215 Hijrah in Nasa. He then traveled in search of Hadeeth, eventually hearing from and studying from the people of the Hijaaz (lands such as Syria, Palestine, etc.), Khuraasaan, ash-Shaam, the Arabian Peninsula and other lands. He resided for a long time in Egypt and his writings spread throughout there. Later he journeyed to Damascus where he met with trials and tribulations. He died in 303 Hijrah in Ramlah, Palestine when he was eighty-three years old.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He left behind him many great works of Hadeeth and the study of their defects. May Allaah have mercy on him and reward him on behalf of his contribution to the Muslims.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Day of Resurrection <br />The Third Event</strong></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Sun is Brought Near</strong></span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;">The sun will be brought near to mankind, as close as a “<strong>mile</strong>,” the Arabic word used for mile here being <strong>مِيْل</strong> (mīl). Whether it is the mile we know to be the common unit of distance or the eye-pencil to apply kohl (as the word could imply in Arabic), whatever the case the sun will be very close to people.[<span style="color:#ff0000;">29</span>] If the sun’s heat is as we know it here in this life while there is such a great distance between it and us, then how will it be when it is a “mile” above our heads?</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Here is a question: It is well-known that if the sun were to move even a hair from its position, it would burn the earth, incinerating it completely. So how is it possible on that day for the sun to be that close and not burn creation? The answer is that although people will be resurrected on that day with their previous bodies, they may not be recreated in the same exact state and with the same capability as they have now. Rather, they will be stronger and greater in what they can withstand.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, if people were to remain for fifty days in direct sunshine with no shade, no food, and no water, they would be unable to do so; they would die. But on the Day of Resurrection, they will remain in such a state for fifty thousand years [<span style="color:#ff0000;">30</span>] without food,water, or shade except those to whom Allah ( عزّ وجلّ ) shades. In addition, they will witness other terrifying events but they will be made to withstand them.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">As an example of this greater capability to bear situations without dying, look at how the people of the fire will withstand such seemingly unbearable circumstances:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بِآيَاتِنَا سَوْفَ نُصْلِيهِمْ نَارًا كُلَّمَا نَضِجَتْ جُلُودُهُم بَدَّلْنَاهُمْ جُلُودًا غَيْرَهَا لِيَذُوقُوا الْعَذَابَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Indeed, those who disbelieve in our verses, we will drive them into a fire. Every time their skins are roasted through, we will replace them with other skins so they may taste the punishment. </strong></span>[Surah An-Nisa 4:56]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Will anyone be saved from the heat of the sun on the Day of Resurrection? Yes, there are types of people whom Allah will shade from the sun. The prophet ( صلّى اللّه عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There are seven (types of people) whom Allah will shade in his shade on a day when there will be no shade except his shade: a just ruler; a youth who grew up in the worship of Allah; a man whose heart is attached to the mosques; people who love each other for Allah’s sake, meeting for his sake and parting for his sake; a man who is called by a woman of beauty and position (for adultery), but he says: “(No) I fear Allah;” a man who gives in charity and hides it so much so that his left hand does not know what his right hand gives in charity; and a man who remembered Allah in private so much that his eyes shed tears. </strong></span>[Recorded by al-Bukhārī, Muslim, and al-Tirmidhī]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">There are also other types of individuals Allah will shade on that day. And by, “when there will be no shade except his shade,” it means no shade except the shade Allah creates. And it is not as some people think that it is the shade of Allah himself because that would necessitate that the sun would be above Allah ( عزّ وجلّ)</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">In this life, we can take shelter in shade ourselves, but on the Day of Resurrection, there will be no shade except the shade Allah ( سبحانه وتعالى ) makes so that whoever he wills can take shelter in his shade when the sun is brought near.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to the closeness of the sun, people will sweat so much that it will rise.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The Fourth Event</span></strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Sweat Rises</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the sun’s heat, people will sweat profusely in proportion to their deeds. For some, the sweat will rise to their ankles, some to their knees, some to their waists, and for some, the sweat will rise up to their mouths. So individuals will be at different levels regarding their sweat. They will sweat from the intense heat and the extremely uncomfortable situation: crowdedness, extreme hardships, and at close distance to the sun. Still, although people will sweat from the circumstances of that day, their sweat will only be according to their deeds in this life. [<span style="color:#ff0000;">33</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here is a question: How will they be of varying degrees in sweat if people are all together in one place? To answer, we must return to a basic principle of belief. It is that when dealing with affairs of the unseen, events that authentic texts confirm will take place in the future, it is incumbent upon us to believe in them, trusting them to be true without persisting in asking, “How? Why?” These are things beyond the extent of our own intellects; it is not yet possible for us to perceive or fully understand it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imagine two people buried in a single grave, one a believer and the other a disbeliever. The believer will still experience the enjoyment that he deserves, and the disbeliever will experience the punishment he deserves even though they are in the same grave. Likewise, we believe the sweat will rise on the Day of Judgment as foretold.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now are we saying that Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) will gather together someone whose sweat will reach his mouth in a particular place, someone with sweat to his ankles in a different place, and others with sweat rising to their knees or waist in other places? No, not necessarily but Allah knows best. What we are saying is that it is possible for the individual with sweat reaching only to his ankles to be next to someone with his sweat up to his mouth because Allah is capable of doing anything. This is comparable to the fact that light will encompass believers all around them, yet at the same time, disbelievers in Allah will be surrounded by darkness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So regarding the Day of Resurrection, we must believe in it and all that is to occur on that day. As for the “How?” and “Why?” of the exact nature, that is not our right to know. As people suffer on the Day of Resurrection, standing in their own sweat, they will anxiously wait for judgment to begin. And this will only occur by “The Greatest Intercession.”</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">29</span>] The prophet ( صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ ) said in the ḥadīth recorded by Muslim confirming this:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>» تُدْنَى الشَّمْسُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ مِنْ الْخَلْقِ حَتَّى تَكُونَ مِنْهُمْ كَمِقْدَارِ مِيلٍ «</strong></span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>On the Day of Resurrection, the sun will be brought close to creation so much that it will be a “mile” from them.</strong></p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the narrators of the ḥadīth, Sulaym Ibn ‘Āmir, said, “By Allah, I do not know if he meant by <em>mīl</em> the distance of land or the <em>mīl</em> that is used to apply kohl to the eye.”</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">30</span>] The scholar is perhaps alluding to the verse in Sūrah al-Ma’ārij (70:4) in which Allah says,</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">تَعْرُجُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ وَالرُّوحُ إِلَيْهِ فِي يَوْمٍ كَانَ مِقْدَارُهُ خَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ</span></strong></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The angels and the spirit will ascend to him during a day the extent of which is fifty thousand years.</strong></span></p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, the prophet ( صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ) said in a ḥadīth recorded by Muslim:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">مَا مِنْ صَاحِبِ كَنْزٍ لا يُؤَدِّي زَكَاتَهُ إِلاَّ أُحْمِيَ عَلَيْهِ فِي نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ فَيُجْعَلُ صَفَائِحَ فَيُكْوَى بِهَا جَنْبَاهُ وَجَبِينُهُ حَتَّى يَحْكُمَ اللَّهُ بَيْنَ عِبَادِهِ فِي  </span></strong><strong><span style="color:#000000;">يَوْمٍ كَانَ مِقْدَارُهُ خَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ ثُمَّ يَرَى سَبِيلَهُ إِمَّا إِلَى الْجَنَّةِ وَإِمَّا إِلَى النَّارِ</span></strong></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>There is no owner of treasure who does not pay its zakāh (obligated charity), but it will be heated in the fire of Hell and made into plates with which his sides and forehead will be branded until Allah passes judgment between his slaves on a day the length of which will be like fifty thousand years. Then he will be shown his path, whether it leads to Paradise or to Hell.</strong></p>





<p>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">33</span>] This is established by the ḥadīth recorded by Muslim in which the prophet ( صلّى اللّه عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>فَيَكُونُ النَّاسُ عَلَى قَدْرِ أَعْمَالِهِمْ فِي الْعَرَقِ ، فَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَكُونُ إِلَى كَعْبَيْهِ ، وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَكُونُ إِلَى رُكْبَتَيْهِ ، وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَكُونُ إِلَى حَقْوَيْهِ ، وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يُلْجِمُهُ الْعَرَقُ إِلْجَامًا</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>The people will be in sweat in accordance with their deeds. For some, it will rise to their ankles, some to their knees, some to their waists, and for some of them, the sweat will reach their mouths.</strong></p>

<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Point:</strong></p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">It should not be understood that “Saheeh al-Bukhaaree” and “Saheeh Muslim” encompass every authentically reported statement of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم). Rather, there are many authentic Hadeeth collected by other scholars that neither one of them (al-Bukhaaree &amp; Muslim) recorded in their collections.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>an-Nawawee said:</strong></p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">“The intent of both al-Bukhaaree and Muslim was only to collect a large number of authentic Hadeeth just as a book of Fiqh [2] may collect texts pertaining to many different issues, not encompass every possible issue. However, if there is a Hadeeth having an authentic chain of narration that one of them may have left out, or even both of them, then they would have had a reason to do so or they may have recorded a similar Hadeeth in its place. From what is well-known from them, it may be assumed that perhaps they felt it better not to record it, or perhaps they even forgot. They also may have left certain Hadeeth out in order not to make their collections even longer than they are, or they felt what they have recorded was sufficient pertaining to a certain topic. They may have had other reasons as well.”</p>



<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second Point:</strong></p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars unanimously agree and consider “Saheeh al-Bukhaaree” and “Saheeh Muslim” to be the most authentic written works of Hadeeth. Regarding this, the famous scholar, Ibn Taymiyyah, said, “There is no Hadeeth they both agree to be authentic except that it is undoubtedly authentic.” He also said, “The vast majority of their narrations, the scholars of Hadeeth know with certainty that the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) actually said them.”</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Explanation from Dr. Muhammad Bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Khumayyis&#8217; explanation of <em><a style="color:#993300;" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/21/explanation-of-four-rules-of-shirk-shaykh-muhammad-al-khumayyis/">Four Rules Regarding Shirk</a></em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Language</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>yatawallaaka</em> (He befriend you) meaning that He take you as a friend (<em>walee</em>) through (His) love, granting of success and guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author has begun by supplicating and asking Allaah, the Most Generous, Lord of the Great Throne, to befriend the one who reads this book in this world and the Hereafter. As for befriending him in this worldly life, then it is by loving him, guiding him, directing him and assisting him. And as for befriending him in the Hereafter, then it is by showing him mercy and forgiveness, protecting him from the Hellfire and admitting him into Paradise. Then he also supplicates that he be blessed wherever he may be, and that Allaah make him fulfill the meaning of servitude, as well as its stations, which are three:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>First: Being thankful for His Blessing</strong></span>. This is at the time when He gives it, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Work you, O family of Dawood, with thanks!”</span> [Surah Saba: 13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And if you are grateful, He will be pleased therewith for you.”</span> [Surah Az-Zumar:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And give thanks to Me and do not disbelieve.”</span> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 152]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Being thankful for Allaah’s Blessing is shown through the heart by way of affirming, acknowledging and showing gratitude. And it is shown through the tongue by way of speaking about the blessing and praising it. And it is shown through the limbs by way of acting in accordance with what pleases Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Second: Being patient during tribulations</span>,</strong> hard times and with the things that one hates, which befall the people as a test and examination from Allaah. What is obligatory in these situations is that one have patience. Patience means suppressing the heart from being displeased and from despairing; suppressing the tongue from complaining; and suppressing the limbs from those acts that negate and contradict patience. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And bear with patience whatever befalls you.”</span> [Surah Luqmaan: 17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And give glad tidings to those who are patient.”</span> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 155]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Third: Seeking forgiveness after committing a sin</strong></span>. This is since all of the Son of Aadam (i.e. humans) are sinners. But what is obligatory upon mankind when they should fall into sin is to rush to ask for forgiveness and repentance, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And those who when they commit some immoral act (i.e. fornication) or wrong themselves with evil, remember Allaah and so seek (His) forgiveness for their sins. And who is it that forgives sins except Allaah? And they do not persist knowingly in what sins they committed (after that).”</span> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 135]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are the three characteristics: Being thankful for (Allaah’s) Blessing, being patient during times of tribulation, and seeking forgiveness after committing a sin. Whoever fulfills all of these will no doubt be from those who will experience happiness. In fact, happiness is linked to these three characteristics more than any others. All of them contain the meanings of Tawheed, submission, compliance and acceptance from Allaah.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Saheeh al-Bukhaaree” :</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book was given the title: “<em><strong>al’Jaami’ as-Saheeh</strong></em>” by its author. In it, he recorded six hundred thousand <em>Hadeeth</em> and he exerted great effort in revising them, editing them, and scrutinizing them to determine their authenticity. He was so concerned that he would not place any <em>Hadeeth</em> within his collection without first washing and praying to units of prayer seeking Allaah’s guidance in the decision to include it. He did not include any report or narration unless it was authentically reported from the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) with a clear, connected chain of narrators, all known for their trustworthiness and preciseness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He completed his work over a span of sixteen years. After which, he presented it to <em>Imaam</em> Ahmad, Yahyaa Ibn Ma’een, ‘Alee Ibn al-Madeenee, and others. They admired it and approved of it and attested to its authenticity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since then, scholars of every time period have accepted this collection of <em>Hadeeth</em>. al-Haafith athThahabee said, “<strong>It is the best and most significant book in Islaam after the Book of Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى)</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This collection consists of seven thousand, three-hundred ninety-seven (7,397) <em>Hadeeth</em> including the ones that are repeated, yet placed in different chapters. Excluding the repeated <em>Hadeeth</em>, there are two thousand, six hundred two (2,602) individual <em>Hadeeth</em> as al-Haafith Ibn Hajar pointed out.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>al-Bukhaaree</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is Abu ‘Abdullaah Muhammad Ibn Ismaa’eel Ibn Ibraaheem Ibn al-Mugheerah Ibn Bardizbah [1] al-Ja’fee, originally of Persian origin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was born in Bukhaaraa (in present-day Uzbekistan) in the month of Shawwaal (the 10th month of the Islaamic calendar) in the year 194 <em>Hijrah</em>. He was raised as an orphan (without his father) in the care of his mother. He began traveling throughout different lands, seeking out <em>Hadeeth</em> in the year 210. He resided for six years in various lands including ash-Shaam (the lands of Palestine, Syria, Jordan, etc.), Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, Basra, Koofah, and Baghdad (all three in Iraaq). He was very proficient in memorizing and it was even said that he was able to memorize a book after seeing it only once. He was one who abstained from useless worldly things. He was pious and did not mix much with the kings, princes, or leaders. Yet, he was brave and generous. Scholars of his time and thereafter have praised him. <em>Imaam</em> Ahmad said of him, “<strong>No one even close to him has ever come from (the land of) Khuraasaan</strong>.” Ibn Khuzaymah said, “<strong>There is no one under the sky more knowledgeable of <em>Hadeeth</em> of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم), nor one having memorized more than Muhammad Ibn Ismaa’eel al-Bukhaaree</strong>.” He was also diligent in deducing rulings and had an amazing ability to derive rulings and benefits from <em>Hadeeth</em> as can be witnessed from the manner in which he organized his authentic collection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He died in a place known as Khartank near Samarqand (in Uzbekistan) on the night of <em>‘Eed al-Fitr</em> (the Islaamic holiday to conclude fasting in the month of Ramadhaan) in the year 256 <em>Hijrah</em>. He was thirteen days away from the age of sixty-two years old. He left an enormous amount of knowledge behind in his writings. May Allaah have mercy upon him an reward him on behalf of his contribution to the Muslims.</p>

<hr />
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The below Explanation was taken from Tafseer Ibn Katheer, Darusssalam English Publication</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qari`ah is one of the names of the Day of Judgement, like Al-Haqqah, At-Tammah, As-Sakhkhah, Al-Ghashiyah and other names.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah intensifies concern and fright for it by saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And what will make you know what Al-Qari`ah is</strong></span>) Then He explains this by saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is a Day whereon mankind will be like moths scattered about.</strong></span>) meaning, in their scattering, their dividing, their coming and their going, all due to being bewildered at what is happening to them, they will be like scattered moths. This is like Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As if they were locusts spread abroad</strong></span>.) (54:7) Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the mountains will be like wool, carded</strong></span>.) meaning, they will become like carded wool that has began to wear out (fade away) and be torn apart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Ata&#8217; Al-Khurasani, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi have all said, <strong>(like wool (`Ihn). ) &#8220;Woolen.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah informs about the results received by those who performed the deeds, and the honor and disgrace they will experience based upon their deeds. He says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Then as for him whose Balance will be heavy</strong></span>.) meaning, his good deeds are more than his bad deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He will live a pleasant life</strong></span>.) meaning, in Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong><span style="color:#000000;">But as for him whose Balance will be light.</span></strong>) meaning, his bad deeds are more than his good deeds. Then Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>His mother will be Hawiyah</strong></span>.) It has been said that this means he will be falling and tumbling headfirst into the fire of Hell, and the expression `<strong>his mothe</strong>r&#8217; has been used to refer to his <strong>brain</strong> (as it is the mother of his head). A statement similar to this has been reported from Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Abu Salih and Qatadah. Qatadah said, &#8220;<strong>He will fall into the Hellfire on his head</strong>.&#8221; Abu Salih made a similar statement when he said, &#8220;They will fall into the Fire on their heads.&#8221; It has also been said that it means his mother that he will return to and end up with in the Hereafter will be Hawiyah, which is one of the names of the Hellfire. Ibn Jarir said, &#8220;Al-Hawiyah is only called his mother because he will have no other abode except for it.&#8221; Ibn Zayd said, &#8220;Al-Hawiyah is the Fire, and it will be his mother and his abode to which he will return, and where he will be settled.&#8221; Then he recited the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Their abode will be the Fire.</strong></span>) (3:151) Ibn Abi Hatim said that it has been narrated from Qatadah that he said, &#8220;It is the Fire, and it is their abode.&#8221; Thus, Allah says in explaining the meaning of Al-Hawiyah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And what will make you know what it is</strong></span>). Allah&#8217;s statement</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong><span style="color:#000000;">A fire Hamiyah!</span></strong>) meaning, extreme heat. It is a heat that is accompanied by a strong flame and fire. It is narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>The fire of the Children of Adam that you all kindle is one part of the seventy parts of the fire of Hell</strong>.) They (the Companions) said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Isn&#8217;t it sufficient&#8221; He replied,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>It is more than it by sixty-nine times</strong>.) This has been recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. In some of the wordings he stated,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(It is more than it by sixty-nine times, each of them is like the heat of it</strong>.) It has been narrated in a Hadith that Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>Verily, the person who will receive the lightest torment of the people of the Hellfire will be a man who will have two sandals that will cause his brain to boil.</strong> )&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been confirmed in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>The Hellfire complained to its Lord and said, &#8220;O Lord! Some parts of me devour other parts of me.&#8221; So He (Allah) permitted it to take two breaths: one breath in the winter and one breath in the summer. Thus, the most severe cold that you experience in the winter is from its cold, and the most severe heat that you experience in the summer is from its heat.</strong> )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Two Sahihs it is recorded that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>When the heat becomes intense pray the prayer when it cools down, for indeed the intense heat is from the breath of Hell</strong>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Qari`ah, and all praise and thanks are due to Allah.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation Based on Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s Tafseer</strong></p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَإِذْ جَعَلْنَا الْبَيْتَ مَثَابَةً لِّلنَّاسِ وَأَمْنًا وَاتَّخِذُوا مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ مُصَلًّى ۖ وَعَهِدْنَا إِلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ أَن طَهِّرَا بَيْتِيَ لِلطَّائِفِينَ وَالْعَاكِفِينَ وَالرُّكَّعِ السُّجُودِ</strong></span></h2>

<hr />
<p><strong>The following has been posted from <em>Tafseer Ibn Katheer</em> (Darussalam English Publications):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Virtue of Allah&#8217;s House</strong></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَإِذْ جَعَلْنَا الْبَيْتَ مَثَابَةً لِّلنَّاسِ وَأَمْناً وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">125. And (remember) when We made the House (the Kabah at Makkah) a place of resort for mankind and a place of safety. And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim (or the stone on which Ibrahim as a place)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Awfi reported that Ibn Abbas commented on Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَإِذْ جَعَلْنَا الْبَيْتَ مَثَابَةً لِّلنَّاسِ</strong><br />
(And (remember) when We made the House (the Kabah at Makkah) a place of resort for mankind)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;They do not remain in the House, they only visit it and return to their homes, and then visit it again.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Abu Jafar Ar-Razi narrated from Ar-Rabi bin Anas from Abu Al-Aliyah who said that,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَإِذْ جَعَلْنَا الْبَيْتَ مَثَابَةً لِّلنَّاسِ وَأَمْناً</strong><br />
(And (remember) when We made the House (the Kabah at Makkah) a place of resort for mankind and a place of safety) means,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Safe from enemies and armed conflict. During the time of Jahiliyyah, the people were often victims of raids and kidnapping, while the people in the area surrounding it (Al-Masjid Al-Haram) were safe and not subject to kidnapping.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Mujahid, Ata&#8217;, As-Suddi, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi bin Anas were reported to have said that the Ayah (2:125) means,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Whoever enters it shall be safe.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah indicates that Allah honored the Sacred House, which Allah made as a safe refuge and safe haven. Therefore, the souls are eager, but never bored, to conduct short visits to the House, even every year. This is because Allah accepted the supplication of His Khalil, Ibrahim, when he asked Allah to make the hearts of people eager to visit the House. Ibrahim said (14:40),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>رَبَّنَا وَتَقَبَّلْ دُعَآءِ</strong><br />
(Our Lord! And accept my invocation).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah described the House as a safe resort and refuge, for those who visit it are safe, even if they had committed acts of evil. This honor comes from the honor of the person who built it first, Khalil Ar-Rahman, just as Allah said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَإِذْ بَوَّأْنَا لإِبْرَهِيمَ مَكَانَ الْبَيْتِ أَن لاَّ تُشْرِكْ بِى شَيْئاً</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And (remember) when We showed Ibrahim the site of the (Sacred) House (the Kabah at Makkah) (saying): &#8220;Associate not anything (in worship) with Me&#8230;&#8221;) (22:26) and,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّ أَوَّلَ بَيْتٍ وُضِعَ لِلنَّاسِ لَلَّذِى بِبَكَّةَ مُبَارَكاً وَهُدًى لِّلْعَـلَمِينَ فِيهِ ءَايَـتٌ بَيِّـنَـتٌ مَّقَامُ إِبْرَهِيمَ وَمَن دَخَلَهُ كَانَ ءَامِناً</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, the first House (of worship) appointed for mankind was that at Bakkah (Makkah), full of blessing, and a guidance for Al-Alamin (mankind and Jinn). In it are manifest signs (for example), the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim; whosoever enters it, he attains security) (3:96-97).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last honorable Ayah emphasized the honor of Ibrahim&#8217;s Maqam, and the instruction to pray next to it,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim as a place of prayer). The Maqam of Ibrahim Sufyan Ath-Thawri reported that Said bin Jubayr commented on the Ayah,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim as a place of prayer) &#8220;The stone (Maqam) is the standing place of Ibrahim, Allah&#8217;s Prophet, and a mercy from Allah. Ibrahim stood on the stone, while Ismail was handing him the stones (constructing the Kabah).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Suddi said, &#8220;The Maqam of Ibrahim is a stone which Ismail&#8217;s wife put under Ibrahim&#8217;s feet when washing his head.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qurtubi mentioned this, but he considered it unauthentic, although others gave it prefrence, Ar-Razi reported it in his Tafsir from Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Qatadah, and Ar-Rabi bin Anas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Hatim reported that Jabir, describing the Hajj (pilgrimage) of the Prophet said, &#8220;When the Prophet performed Tawaf, Umar asked him, Is this the Maqam of our father&#8217; He said, Yes.&#8217; Umar said, Should we take it a place of prayer&#8217; So Allah revealed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim (Abraham) as a place of prayer.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari said, &#8220;Chapter: Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim (Abraham) as a place of prayer) meaning, they return to it repeatedly.&#8221; He then narrated that Anas bin Malik said that Umar bin Al-Khattab said, &#8220;I agreed with my Lord, or my Lord agreed with me, regarding three matters. I said, O Messenger of Allah! I wish you take the Maqam of Ibrahim a place for prayer.&#8217; The Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim (Abraham)) was revealed. I also said, O Messenger of Allah! The righteous and the wicked enter your house. I wish you would command the Mothers of the believers (the Prophet&#8217;s wives) to wear Hijab. Allah sent down the Ayah that required the Hijab. And when I knew that the Prophet was angry with some of his wives, I came to them and said, Either you stop what you are doing, or Allah will endow His Messenger with better women than you are.&#8217; I advised one of his wives and she said to me, O Umar! Does the Messenger of Allah not know how to advise his wives, so that you have to do the job instead of him&#8217; Allah then revealed,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>عَسَى رَبُّهُ إِن طَلَّقَكُنَّ أَن يُبْدِلَهُ أَزْوَجاً خَيْراً مِّنكُنَّ مُسْلِمَـتٍ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#008000;">It may be if he divorced you (all) that his Lord will give him instead of you, wives better than you, ـ Muslims (who submit to Allah)</span>).&#8221; (66:5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Ibn Jarir narrated that Jabir said, &#8220;After the Messenger of Allah kissed the Black Stone, he went around the house three times in a fast pace and four times in a slow pace. He then went to Maqam of Ibrahim, with it between him and the House, and prayed two Rakahs.&#8221; This is part of the long Hadith that Muslim recorded in Sahih. Al-Bukhari recorded that Amr bin Dinar said that he heard Ibn Umar say, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah performed Tawaf around the House seven times and then prayed two Rakahs behind the Maqam.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All these texts indicate that the Maqam is the stone that Ibrahim was standing on while building the House. As the House&#8217;s walls became higher, Ismail brought his father a stone, so that he could stand on it, while Ismail handed him the stones. Ibrahim would place the stones on the wall, and whenever he finished one side, he would move to the next side, to complete the building all around. Ibrahim kept repeating this until he finished building the House, as we will describe when we explain the story of Ibrahim and Ismail and how they built the House, as narrated from Ibn Abbas and collected by Al-Bukhari. Ibrahim&#8217;s footprints were still visible in the stone, and the Arabs knew this fact during the time of Jahiliyyah. This is why Abu Talib said in his poem known as Al-Lamiyyah&#8217;, &#8220;And Ibrahim&#8217;s footprint with his bare feet on the stone is still visible.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims also saw Ibrahim&#8217;s footprints on the stone, as Anas bin Malik said, &#8220;I saw the Maqam with the print of Ibrahim&#8217;s toes and feet still visible in it, but the footprints dissipated because of the people rubbing the stone with their hands.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Earlier, the Maqam was placed close to the Kabah&#8217;s wall. In the present time, the Maqam is placed next to Al-Hijr on the right side of those entering through the door.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Ibrahim finished building the House, he placed the stone next to the wall of Al-Kabah. Or, when the House was finished being built, Ibrahim just left the stone where it was last standing, and he was commanded to pray next to the stone when he finished the Tawaf (circumambulating). It is understandable that the Maqam of Ibrahim would stand where the building of the House ended. The Leader of the faithful Umar bin Al-Khattab, one of the Four Rightly Guided Caliphs whom we were commanded to emulate, moved the stone away from the Kabah&#8217;s wall during his reign. Umar is one of the two men, whom the Messenger of Allah described when he said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>«اقْتَدُوا بِاللَّذَيْنِ مِنْ بَعْدِي أَبِي بَكْرٍ وَعُمَر»</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Imitate the two men who will come after me: Abu Bakr and Umar.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar was also the person whom the Qur&#8217;an agreed with regarding praying next to Maqam of Ibrahim. This is why none among the Companions rejected it when he moved it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdur-Razzaq reported from Ibn Jurayj from Ata&#8217;, &#8220;Umar bin Al-Khattab moved the Maqam back.&#8221; Also, Abdur-Razzaq narrated that Mujahid said that Umar was the first person who moved the Maqam back to where it is now standing.&#8221; Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr, Ahmad bin Ali bin Al-Husayn Al-Bayhaqi recorded A&#8217;ishah saying, &#8220;<strong>During the time of the Messenger of Allah and Abu Bakr, the Maqam was right next to the House. Umar moved the Maqam during his reign</strong>.&#8221; This Hadith has an authentic chain of narration.</p>

<p><strong>Posted from</strong>: <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/11/17/tafseer-explanation-surah-al-baqarah-dr-saleh-as-saleh/"><strong>Tafseer – Explanation Surah Al-Baqarah</strong></a> – Dr Saleh as Saleh [Audio Series|En]. Explanation Based on Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s Tafseer</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The following has been posted from <em>Tafseer Ibn Katheer</em> (Darussalam English Publications):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After Allah commanded that He be appreciated, He ordained patience and prayer. It is a fact that the servant is either enjoying a bounty that he should be thankful for, or suffering a calamity that he should meet with patience. A Hadith states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Amazing is the believer, for whatever Allah decrees for him, it is better for him! If he is tested with a bounty, he is grateful for it and this is better for him; and if he is afflicted with a hardship, he is patient with it and this is better for him.</strong></span>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah has stated that the best tools to help ease the effects of the afflictions are patience and prayer. Earlier we mentioned Allah&#8217;s statement:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاسْتَعِينُوا بِالصَّبْرِ وَالصَّلَاةِ ۚ وَإِنَّهَا لَكَبِيرَةٌ إِلَّا عَلَى الْخَاشِعِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And seek help in patience and As-Salah </strong>(the prayer)<strong> and truly, it is extremely heavy and hard except for <em>Al-Khashiin</em> (</strong>i.e., the true believers in Allah<strong>)</strong></span> (2:45)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are several types of Sabr ـ patience: one for avoiding the prohibitions and sins, one for acts of worship and obedience. The second type carries more rewards than the first type. There is a third type of patience required in the face of the afflictions and hardships, which is mandatory, like repentance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Sabr has two parts: patience for the sake of Allah concerning what He is pleased with (i.e., acts of worship and obedience), even if it is hard on the heart and the body, and patience when avoiding what He dislikes, even if it is desired. Those who acquire these qualities will be among the patient persons whom Allah shall greet (when they meet Him in the Hereafter; refer to Surat Al-Ahzab 33:44), Allah willing.&#8221;</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="color:#993300;">باب فِي الأَمَلِ وَطُولِهِ</span>‏</span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَوْلِ اللَّهِ تَعَالَى:</span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">,{ <span style="color:#008000;">فَمَنْ زُحْزِحَ عَنِ النَّارِ وَأُدْخِلَ الْجَنَّةَ فَقَدْ فَازَ وَمَا الْحَيَاةُ الدُّنْيَا إِلاَّ مَتَاعُ الْغُرُورِ </span>}</span></h3>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever is removed away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise, he indeed is successful. The life of this world is only the enjoyment of deception (a deceiving thing) </span>[3:185]</p>

</span></h3>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">Leave them to eat and enjoy, and let them be preoccupied with (false) hope. They will come to know!</span> [15:3]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالَ عَلِيٌّ  :</span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ارْتَحَلَتِ الدُّنْيَا مُدْبِرَةً، وَارْتَحَلَتِ الآخِرَةُ مُقْبِلَةً، وَلِكُلِّ وَاحِدَةٍ مِنْهُمَا بَنُونَ، فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَبْنَاءِ الآخِرَةِ، وَلاَ تَكُونُوا مِنْ أَبْنَاءِ الدُّنْيَا، فَإِنَّ الْيَوْمَ عَمَلٌ وَلاَ حِسَابَ، وَغَدًا حِسَابٌ وَلاَ عَمَلَ. </span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">بِمُزَحْزِحِهِ} بِمُبَاعِدِهِ}</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Hadith</strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">حَدَّثَنَا صَدَقَةُ بْنُ الْفَضْلِ، أَخْبَرَنَا يَحْيَى، عَنْ سُفْيَانَ، قَالَ حَدَّثَنِي أَبِي، عَنْ مُنْذِرٍ، عَنْ رَبِيعِ بْنِ خُثَيْمٍ، عَنْ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ ـ رضى الله عنه ـ قَالَ خَطَّ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم خَطًّا مُرَبَّعًا، وَخَطَّ خَطًّا فِي الْوَسَطِ خَارِجًا مِنْهُ، وَخَطَّ خُطُطًا صِغَارًا إِلَى هَذَا الَّذِي فِي الْوَسَطِ، مِنْ جَانِبِهِ الَّذِي فِي الْوَسَطِ وَقَالَ ‏</span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">‏ هَذَا الإِنْسَانُ، وَهَذَا أَجَلُهُ مُحِيطٌ بِهِ ـ أَوْ قَدْ أَحَاطَ بِهِ ـ وَهَذَا الَّذِي هُوَ خَارِجٌ أَمَلُهُ، وَهَذِهِ الْخُطُطُ الصِّغَارُ الأَعْرَاضُ، فَإِنْ أَخْطَأَهُ هَذَا نَهَشَهُ هَذَا، وَإِنْ أَخْطَأَهُ هَذَا نَهَشَهُ هَذَا ‏&#8221;</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‌‌‏Narrated `Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Prophet (ﷺ) drew a square and then drew a line in the middle of it and let it extend outside the square and then drew several small lines attached to that central line, and said, &#8220;This is the human being, and this, (the square) in his lease of life, encircles him from all sides (or has encircled him), and this (line), which is outside (the square), is his hope, and these small lines are the calamities and troubles (which may befall him), and if one misses him, an-other will snap (i.e. overtake) him, and if the other misses him, a third will snap (i.e. overtake) him.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Sahih al-Bukhari 6417  | In-book : Book 81, Hadith 6 | English : Vol. 8, Book 76, Hadith 426</p>

<h3><span style="color:#000000;">حَدَّثَنَا مُسْلِمٌ، حَدَّثَنَا هَمَّامٌ، عَنْ إِسْحَاقَ بْنِ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ بْنِ أَبِي طَلْحَةَ، عَنْ أَنَسٍ، قَالَ خَطَّ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم خُطُوطًا فَقَالَ ‏</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">‏ هَذَا الأَمَلُ وَهَذَا أَجَلُهُ، فَبَيْنَمَا هُوَ كَذَلِكَ إِذْ جَاءَهُ الْخَطُّ الأَقْرَبُ ‏&#8221;</span></h3>
<p>‌‌‏Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Prophet (ﷺ) drew a few lines and said, &#8220;This is (man&#8217;s) hope, and this is the instant of his death, and while he is in this state (of hope), the nearer line (death) comes to Him.&#8221;</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Leaving the Masjid after the Adhan is announced</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second question of Fatwa no. 5133</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the ruling on leaving the Masjid (mosque) after the Adhan (call to Prayer)? Moreover, does the same ruling apply to a person who may be in a room, not used for Salah, within the precincts of the Masjid but when leaving, he passes through the courtyard of the Masjid?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is not permissible to leave the Masjid after hearing the Adhan except to perform Wudu&#8217;, answering the call of nature, or any other necessity. It is reported that Abu Hurayrah  saw a person leaving the Masjid after the Adhan. Upon this he remarked,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>&#8220;This (man) disobeyed Abu Al-Qasim (peace be upon him).&#8221;</strong> </span>Related by Muslim in his Sahih. The same ruling applies for a person who is in a room inside the precincts of the Masjid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[Q] What is the ruling regarding leaving the Masjid after the Adhan has been called?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A] Abu Hurayrah saw a man leave (the Masjid) after the Adhan (had been called) and said (about him):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">As for this (one), then he has gone against (the teachings of) Abul-Qasim (Muhammad, peace be upon him</span>)</strong></span>.(Sahih Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And to go against (the teachings) principally is prohibited. Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed in a plain error.</strong></span> (Quran, 33:36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, because of this, the people having Islamic knowledge have said: <span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Indeed it is not permissible for a person to leave the Masjid after the Adhan (has been called) except for an (Islamically justifiable) reason, such as leaving to make Wudhu or if he wanted to go to answer the call of nature, then he is permitted to leave, even if he misses the prayer</strong></span> as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">There is no prayer if food has been served or for him who needs to answer the call of nature</span></strong>. (Sahih Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if we say that someone is waiting for the prayer and then felt the need to go and answer the call of nature or even to pass wind, since some people (may be in) need of passing wind, then there is no harm if he left and relieved himself (and) then returned. And if he was able to (catch and) join the congregation, then it is a blessing, and if he was unable to do so, then there is no harm in this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allaah</strong> is the ‘<em>alam</em> (identifying name or title) of the majestic, sole, and true God. This noun, which is the name of Allaah, applies to none other than Him. He, Most Majestic and High, has other names all of which follow on from His name Allaah. The meaning of the name “Allaah” is the <em>ma’looh</em> (that which is worshipped out of love, magnification, deification, and longing).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[See Shaykh Muhammad Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Sharhul ‘Aqeedah Al-Waasitiyyah</em> (Dammaam, KSA: Daar Ibnul Jawzi, 2d. ed. 1415/1994], p. 38, and <em>Sharh Lum’at Al-’Itiqaad</em> (<em>Ismaa’eeliyyah</em>, Egypt: MaktabatulImaam al-Bukhaari (checked by Ashraf Maqsood), 1412/1992)], p. 29.]</span></p>
<p><b>Source</b> : From the eBook: <b><a href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Tafseer Ayatul-Kursi</a></b> – By Shaykh Muhammad bin Saalih Al-’Uthaymeen (<em>rahimahullah</em>). With Related Points of Benefit From the Shaykh’s Commentary on Imaam ibn Taymeeyah’s <em>Sharhul ’Aqeedatil-Waasitiyyah</em>, Prepared by Dr. Saleh As-Saleh (<em>rahimahullah</em>)</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the name <em>Allaah,</em> <strong>Ibn ul-Qayyim</strong> said in <em>Midaarij us-Saalikeen:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“The name <em>Allaah</em> indicates all of the perfect names and lofty attributes in all three ways of indication since it indicates His Divinity, which indicates affirmation of all the characteristics of divinity for Him along with negation of their opposites for Him. So, the attributes of divinity are the attributes of perfection being free from any likeness with the creation and free of any deficiency or imperfection.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the author of the explainer of <em>Kitaab at-Tawheed</em> in <em>Tayseer ul-`Azeez al-<u>H</u>ameed</em>, brings a quote from Ibn ul-Qayyim also with regard to the excellent qualities of the name <em>Allaah</em> that Ibn ul-Qayyim <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the particular virtues of the meaning of this name <em>Allaah</em> then in this regard the most knowledgeable of the creation <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> himself said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“I could not praise You enough as You deserve, You are as You have praised Yourself.”</span></strong></p>
<p>[Reported by Muslim from the <u>h</u>adeeth of A’ishah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anha</em>.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, so how could we enumerate the special virtues of the name of the One Who comprises every perfection unrestrictedly and every praise and commendation and every laudation and exaltation and all splendour and all perfection and all glory and all beauty and all good and all eminence and all generosity, excellence and goodness is for Him and is from Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this name <em>Allaah</em> is not mentioned upon a small amount of something except that it causes it to increase. Nor is it mentioned in a state of fear except that it removes it. Nor is it mentioned upon any misfortune except that it relieves it. Nor in any state of anxiety and distress except that it brings relief. Nor upon any state of difficulty except that it brings ease to it. None who is weak resorts to it except that it brings strength to him. Nor anyone in a state of humiliation except that it brings honour to him. Nor anyone in poverty except that he is enriched. Nor anyone who feels estranged and uneasy except that it causes him to feel at ease. Nor is it mentioned by one who has been overcome except that it brings aid and victory for him. Nor by one who is in straitened circumstances except that his difficulty is removed. Nor is it mentioned by a fugitive except that he finds refuge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is the name, meaning Allaah’s name <em>Allaah</em>, it is the name through which distress is removed through which the descent of blessings is sought and through which supplications are answered. Through it slips are corrected, sins are warded away and good deeds are brought closer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the name with which the earth and heavens were established and with which the revealed books were sent down and with which the messengers were sent. With it the legislated laws were prescribed, through it the prescribed punishments were established and with it <em>jihaad</em> was prescribed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Through this name the creation will become divided into the fortunate and the wretched. With it the true and tremendous day is established and with it, the scales of justice are set up, the bridge laid down and the Paradise and the Fire established. With it, the Lord of all creation is worshipped and praised, for its right the messengers were sent and it will be asked about in the grave and for it, there will be the resurrection. Dispute is regarding it and judgement is to it and alliance and enmity are for it. Through it those who know it and establish its rights will be the fortunate ones and through it those who are ignorant of it and leave its rights will be the wretched ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is the reason for creation and command and through it, they are established and confirmed and to it they arrive at a conclusion. So, the creation comes about through it, returns to it and exists because of it. So, there is nothing in creation and no command nor reward and no punishment except that it starts from it and ends with it. That is what brings it about and its reason. Then he quotes the <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>رَبَّنَا مَا خَلَقْتَ هَٰذَا بَاطِلًا سُبْحَانَكَ فَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O our Lord, You have not created all of this without purpose, free and far removed are You from that. So save us from the punishment of the Fire.</span> </strong> (Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah</em> 191)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then with regard to the name <strong>الله</strong>  <em>Allaah</em>, brief indication of the meaning which is – <strong>t</strong><strong>he One Who is truly venerated and worshipped, the One deserving that He be singled out with all worship because of His perfect attributes of divinity.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>Six</strong>]: In the sixth statement, Allaah (تعالى) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلَّا بِمَا شَاءَ</strong><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills.<br />
</strong></span>[Qur’aan, Aayatul-Kursi , Surah Al-Baqarah 2:255]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The pronoun of the verb { <strong>يُحِيطُونَ </strong>}<strong> &#8220;compass</strong>” refers to either all that is in the heavens and the earth or to the letter haa’ (ـهـ) in Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{ <strong>مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</strong> ] “<strong>What happens to them [the creatures] in the future and what happened to them in the past</strong>.” In the latter case, the meaning would be “Those who Allaah knows what happens to them in the future and what happened to them in the past, will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He Wills.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this statement, Allaah (تعالى) makes clear the perfection of His knowledge and the imperfection of the creature’s knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And thus, He (تعالى) compares His Attributes to that of His ‘<em>ibaad</em> in order that His perfection and the imperfection of the creatures become clearly evident. This is also clear in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>كُلُّ مَنْ عَلَيْهَا فَانٍ</strong><br />
<strong>وَيَبْقَىٰ وَجْهُ رَبِّكَ ذُو الْجَلَالِ وَالْإِكْرَامِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Whatsoever on it </strong>(the earth)<strong> will perish. And the Face of your <em>Rabb</em>, full of Majesty and Honour will abide forever.</strong></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Ar-Rahmaan (55:26-27)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As far as the word ‘<em>ilm</em> (knowledge) in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <strong>عِلْمِهِ </strong>]<br />
“<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>His Knowledge</strong></span>,”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">it is an infinitive (verbal noun) denoting either</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) the ‘<em>ilm</em> of His <em>thaat</em> (Essence) and <em>sifaat</em> (Attributes), or<br />
(b) His <em>ma’loom</em> (What Allaah Knows).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, the meaning of the aayah: {<strong>وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلَّا بِمَا شَاءَ</strong>} &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills</strong></span>&#8220;, means either</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) that we do not know anything about Allaah, His <em>thaat</em>, and His <em>sifaat</em> except that which He willed for us to know, or</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) that we do not know of what Allaah knows except that which He willed to be known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The aayah implies both meanings, and both are correct since we do not know of Allaah’s <em>thaat</em> or <em>sifaat</em> except that which He willed for us to know. Indeed, He is the One Who made it known to us that He ascended upon the ‘<em>arsh</em> (Throne); and He is the One Who taught us on the tongue of His Messenger [Muhammad صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم] that He descends to the lowest heaven [in the last third of the night]; and this is the case with the rest of His <em>sifaat</em>: We have no knowledge of them except that He wills. Similarly, what Allaah knows regarding what is in the heavens and what is on the earth, our knowledge thereof is restricted to that which He willed for us to know. After all, He is the One Who informed us of the existence of the angels in the heavens and that there are seven heavens. So it is with respect to the rest of what Allaah knows, we are aware of that which He willed for us to know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even that which He has made known, many of us are unaware of it; the knowledge thereof are attained only if He wills. In the human being, there are many things which people [i.e. scientists] are not yet fully aware of. They gradually attained the knowledge that they knew not before. So, the aayah comprises both of the meanings discussed above.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus we do not know anything of what Allaah knows even that which concerns ourselves except that which He wills, and that we do not compass anything about Allaah’s <em>thaat</em> and <em>sifaat</em> except that which He wills. Therefore, whatever Allaah wills for His creatures to know, whether in relation to His <em>thaat</em>, <em>sifaat</em>, <em>asmaa</em>’ (Names), or Actions; or with respect to His creation or His legal ways which He revealed to His Messengers, then He (تعالى) will make it known for them.</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Decsription of the Names are transcribed from above Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1<sup>st</sup> Name: </strong><strong>الله</strong><strong> </strong><strong> <em>Allaah</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the name <em>Allaah,</em> Ibn ul-Qayyim said in <em>Midaarij us-Saalikeen:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The name <em>Allaah</em> indicates all of the perfect names and lofty attributes in all three ways of indication since it indicates His Divinity, which indicates affirmation of all the characteristics of divinity for Him along with negation of their opposites for Him. So, the attributes of divinity are the attributes of perfection being free from any likeness with the creation and free of any deficiency or imperfection.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the author of the explainer of <em>Kitaab at-Tawheed</em> in <em>Tayseer ul-`Azeez al-<u>H</u>ameed</em>, brings a quote from Ibn ul-Qayyim also with regard to the excellent qualities of the name <em>Allaah</em> that Ibn ul-Qayyim <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the particular virtues of the meaning of this name <em>Allaah</em> then in this regard the most knowledgeable of the creation <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> himself said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“I could not praise You enough as You deserve, You are as You have praised Yourself.”</span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, so how could we enumerate the special virtues of the name of the One Who comprises every perfection unrestrictedly and every praise and commendation and every laudation and exaltation and all splendour and all perfection and all glory and all beauty and all good and all eminence and all generosity, excellence and goodness is for Him and is from Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this name <em>Allaah</em> is not mentioned upon a small amount of something except that it causes it to increase. Nor is it mentioned in a state of fear except that it removes it. Nor is it mentioned upon any misfortune except that it relieves it. Nor in any state of anxiety and distress except that it brings relief. Nor upon any state of difficulty except that it brings ease to it. None who is weak resorts to it except that it brings strength to him. Nor anyone in a state of humiliation except that it brings honour to him. Nor anyone in poverty except that he is enriched. Nor anyone who feels estranged and uneasy except that it causes him to feel at ease. Nor is it mentioned by one who has been overcome except that it brings aid and victory for him. Nor by one who is in straitened circumstances except that his difficulty is removed. Nor is it mentioned by a fugitive except that he finds refuge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is the name, meaning Allaah’s name <em>Allaah</em>, it is the name through which distress is removed through which the descent of blessings is sought and through which supplications are answered. Through it slips are corrected, sins are warded away and good deeds are brought closer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the name with which the earth and heavens were established and with which the revealed books were sent down and with which the messengers were sent. With it the legislated laws were prescribed, through it the prescribed punishments were established and with it <em>jihaad</em> was prescribed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Through this name the creation will become divided into the fortunate and the wretched. With it the true and tremendous day is established and with it, the scales of justice are set up, the bridge laid down and the Paradise and the Fire established. With it, the Lord of all creation is worshipped and praised, for its right the messengers were sent and it will be asked about in the grave and for it, there will be the resurrection. Dispute is regarding it and judgement is to it and alliance and enmity are for it. Through it those who know it and establish its rights will be the fortunate ones and through it those who are ignorant of it and leave its rights will be the wretched ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is the reason for creation and command and through it, they are established and confirmed and to it they arrive at a conclusion. So, the creation comes about through it, returns to it and exists because of it. So, there is nothing in creation and no command nor reward and no punishment except that it starts from it and ends with it. That is what brings it about and its reason. Then he quotes the <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">رَبَّنَا مَا خَلَقْتَ هَٰذَا بَاطِلًا سُبْحَانَكَ فَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O our Lord, You have not created all of this without purpose, free and far removed are You from that. So save us from the punishment of the Fire. </strong></span> (Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah</em> 191)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then with regard to the name <strong>الله</strong>  <em>Allaah</em>, brief indication of the meaning which is &#8211; <strong>t</strong><strong>he One Who is truly venerated and worshipped, the One deserving that He be singled out with all worship because of His perfect attributes of divinity. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to the <strong>2<sup>nd</sup> name</strong> that the Shaykh quotes, <strong>الأحَد</strong>  <em>Al-A<u>h</u>ad</em> (the Unique), the One Who is alone and unique in every sense, the One alone in His oneness, in His self and in His attributes, alone in His divinity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 3<sup>rd</sup> name;</strong> <strong>الأعْلَى</strong><strong> </strong> <em>Al-A’laa</em> (the Most High), the One Who is above everything, having power and control over everything and the One Who is exalted above every deficiency.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 4<sup>th</sup> name;</strong>  <strong>الأكْرَم</strong> <em>Al-Akram</em> (the Most Generous), the One unequalled in His perfect generosity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 5<sup>th</sup> name;</strong> <strong>الإله</strong> <em>Al-Ilaah, </em>the One Who alone deserves to be worshipped.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 6<sup>th</sup> name; </strong><strong>الأوَّل</strong>  <em>Al Awwal</em> (the First) and this name, <strong>the 6<sup>th</sup></strong> and <strong>the 7<sup>th</sup></strong> and <strong>the 8<sup>th</sup></strong> and <strong>the 9<sup>th</sup></strong> <em>Al-Awwalu</em>, <em>W`al Aakhiru W`al Dhaahiru W`al Baatin</em>, the Shaykh has put most of the names as you can see in alphabetical order. These 4 names are out of alphabetical order and put together because they are all explained in an authentic <u>h</u>adeeth in <u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> Muslim explained by Allaah’s Messenger himself <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>Al Awwal</em> (the First), is the One Who was before everything without any beginning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 7<sup>th</sup> name;</strong>  <strong>الآخِر</strong> <em>Al-Aakhir</em> (the Last), the One who remains after everything else without any end.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 8<sup>th</sup> name;</strong> <strong>الظاهِر</strong> <em>Adh-Dhaahir</em> (the Uppermost One), the One such that nothing is above Him, He is above everything and He encompasses everything with His Knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 9<sup>th</sup> name; </strong> <strong>البَاطِن</strong>  <em>Al-Baatin</em> (the Innermost One), the One Who encompasses and knows the innermost secrets of everything.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 11<sup>th</sup> name;</strong>   <strong>البَرّ</strong>  <em>Al-Barr</em> with a <em>baa</em> and a <em>raa</em> and a <em>shaddah</em> on the <em>raa</em>, <em>Al-Barr</em> (the Most Benign and Kind), the One Who treats the creation in an excellent and kind manner, Who does not interrupt His fine treatment of them and Who rectifies their affairs for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 12<sup>th</sup> name;  </strong><strong>البَصِير</strong> <em>Al-Ba<u>s</u>eer</em> (the All-Seeing), the One Who sees everything such that nothing whatsoever is hidden from Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 13<sup>th</sup> name; </strong> <strong>التَّوَّاب</strong>  <em>At-Tawwaab</em> (the One Who guides His servants to repent and accepts their repentance), the One Who guides the servants that they should repent to Him, grants to them that they should repent and accepts their repentance again and again.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 14<sup>th</sup> name;</strong>  <strong>الجَبَّار</strong> <em>Al-Jabbaar</em> (the Exalted and Almighty Compeller), the One to Whose might everything in the creation submits and the exalted One Who rectifies the affairs of His creation for them and Who restores the weak and the broken-hearted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 15<sup>th</sup> name;  </strong><strong>الحافِظ</strong>  <em>Al-<u>H</u>aafidh</em> (the Protector), the One Who alone guards and protects the heavens and the earth and whatever they contain and Who protects His servants from destruction and from evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 16<sup>th</sup> name;</strong>  <strong>الحَسِيب</strong>  <em>Al-<u>H</u>aseeb</em> (the Reckoner Who suffices), the One Who preserves the deeds of the creation and will bring them to account for them and the One Who suffices and protects His servants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 17<sup>th</sup> name;  </strong><strong>الحَفِيظ</strong>  <em>Al-<u>H</u>afeedh</em> (the Guardian), the One Who protects the servants from harm and Who perfectly preserves whatever deeds His servants have done, not losing any of their deeds and the One Who preserves and protects His beloved servants from falling into sins and from Satan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 18<sup>th</sup> name;</strong>  <strong>الحَفِيُّ</strong>  <em>Al-<u>H</u>afiyy</em> (the Benevolent), the One Who is ever kind to His servants and ever responding to supplication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 19<sup>th</sup> name;  </strong><strong>الحقّ</strong> <em>Al-<u>H</u>aqq</em> (the True One), the One true and certain in His existence in His self, in His attributes, in His sayings and in His actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 20<sup>th</sup> name;</strong>  <strong>المُبِين</strong>  <em>Al-Mubeen</em> (the Clear and Manifest One), the One Whose sole Lordship and right to worship is clear and manifest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 21<sup>st</sup> name;</strong>  <strong>الحَكِيم</strong>  <em>Al-<u>H</u>akeem</em> (the All-Wise), the One fully wise in everything He decrees and fully wise in His sayings and in His actions. There is no deficiency or error in anything He decrees, says or does.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 22<sup>nd</sup> name;</strong>  <strong>الحَلِيم</strong>  <em>Al-<u>H</u>aleem</em> (the forbearing), the One Who does not immediately punish His servants for their sins, their shirk and their unbelief but rather He gives them the opportunity to repent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 23<sup>rd</sup> name;</strong>  <strong>الحَمِيد</strong>  <em>Al-<u>H</u>ameed</em> (the One Who is deservedly praised), the One Who is praised and fully deserves to be praised for His self, for His perfect names, for His attributes and for His perfect actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>He 24<sup>th</sup> name;</strong>  <strong>الحَيّ</strong> <em>Al-<u>H</u>ayy</em> (the Everliving), the Everliving Who always remains without any beginning and any end with perfect and everlasting life Who never dies nor passes away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 25<sup>th</sup> name;</strong>  <strong>القَيُّوم</strong>  <em>Al-Qayyoom</em> (the Self-Subsisting One), upon Whom everything depends, the One Who sustains everything that exists, the One Who has no need whatever of anything but rather everything in existence has total need of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 26<sup>th</sup> name;</strong>  <strong>الخَبِير</strong>  <em>Al-Khabeer</em> (the Fully Aware), the One knowing fully everything that is, has been or will be, knowing whatever will bring harm or benefit, knowing the true condition of everything and the outcome of everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 27<sup>th</sup> name;</strong>  <strong>الخَالِق</strong> <em>Al-Khaaliq</em> (the Creator and Maker of everything), the One Who brought everything into existence after it had previously not existed, the One Who has always had the attribute of being the Creator even when there was no creation in existence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That’s a fine point that Shaykh ul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah brings out and makes clear, “This was Allaah’s attribute always that He did not become the Creator when the creation came into existence, rather He has always been the Creator. This has always been His attribute.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 28<sup>th</sup> name;</strong>  <strong>الخَلاّق</strong> <em>Al Khallaaq</em> (the Creator) who creates again and again, the One for Whom it is not difficult to create anything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 29<sup>th</sup> name;</strong>  <strong>الرَّؤُوف</strong> <em>Ar-Ra’oof</em> (the Compassionate and Kind), the One Who is kind and compassionate to His servants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 30<sup>th</sup> name;</strong>  <strong>الرَّحْمَان</strong> <em>Ar-Rahmaan</em> (the Extremely Merciful), the Merciful One Who has as His attribute mercy, the One possessing tremendous and extensive mercy.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Five]: Then Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى ) said in the Fifth Statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And Allaah Knows what happens to them (His creatures) in this world, and what will happen to them in the Hereafter.<br />
</strong></span>[Qur’aan, Aayatul-Kursi , Surah Al-Baqarah 2:255]<span style="color:#008000;"><strong><br />
</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowledge, according to the scholars of <em>usool</em> (the fundamental principles of <em>deen</em>), is the definitive comprehension of a thing in conformity with its true nature.Thus, the lack of comprehension is ignorance, the indecisive comprehension is doubt, and the assertive comprehension that does not concur with reality is compounded ignorance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, if you were asked, “When did the expedition of Badr [59] take place?” And you say, “I do not know,” then this is <strong>ignorance</strong>. If you were asked the same question and you said, “It happened in the second or the third year of <em>hijrah</em>,” then this is <strong>doubt</strong>.[60] And if your answer to the same question was, “The fifth year,” then this is <strong>compounded ignorance</strong>.[61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most Mighty and Most Majestic, knows things comprehensively and with perfection, overall and in detail. His knowledge is unlike the knowledge of ‘<em>ibaad</em>. That is why He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</strong></span><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And Allaah knows what happens to them [the creatures] in the future and what happened to them in the past.</span></strong>[62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The conjunctive noun {<strong>ما</strong>} is a form of generalization (gram.) This comprises everything be it small or great, or whether it is from the actions of Allaah or from the creatures’ deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowing what happens to them in the future implies that Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) is not unaware of the future, and that His knowledge of the past necessitates that He does not forget the past. That is why when Fir’awn said to Mûsa (<em>alaihissalam</em>):</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#008000;">قَالَ فَمَا بَالُ الْقُرُونِ الْأُولَىٰ</span><br />
</strong><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“What about the generations of the old?”</strong> </span>[Qur’aan, Soorat Taha (20:51)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mûsa (<em>alaihissalam</em>) replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>قَالَ عِلْمُهَا عِندَ رَبِّي فِي كِتَابٍ ۖ لَّا يَضِلُّ رَبِّي وَلَا يَنسَى</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The knowledge thereof is with my Rabb, in a Record. My Rabb is neither unaware nor He forgets.</strong></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Taha (20:52)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) is neither unaware of the future nor does He forget the past.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[59] The Battle of Badr occurred between the army of the believers lead by Prophet Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and the polytheists of Quarysh and it took place on the 17th of Ramadaan of the second year of Hijrah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[60] Because you give another answer, which you think has the same possibility of being the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[61] This is known as <em><strong>al-jahlul-murakkab</strong></em>, which is to comprehend something in a way contrary to its true reality. [See Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Sharh Thalaathat Al-Usool</em> (Burmingham, UK: Al-Hidaayah Publication, 1st. ed. 1418/1997)], p. 37.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[62] This is one of the meanings of this great aayah. It signifies that Allaah’s knowledge encompasses everything in the past, present, and the future; nothing escapes Allaah’s knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Note</strong>: One of the Names of Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>العليم</strong> </span><strong>al-&#8216;Aleem</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The One Who knows what has been and what will be; Who ever has known, and ever will know, what has been and what will be; His knowledge comprehends all things, the covert and the overt, the small thereof and the great, the possible and the impossible, the lofty and lower spheres, etc. in the most complete manner. Nothing is concealed from Him in the earth or in the heavens.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Seven]: Then Allaah, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong> وَسِعَ كُرْسِيُّهُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ ۖ وَلَا يَئُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا ۚ وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْعَظِيمُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>His kursi extends over the heavens and the earth encompassing them all, He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>kursi</em> [literally: footstool] is <em>mawdi’ul qadamayn</em> (place of the Feet) of Allaah, Most Mighty and Most Majestic, and it is before the ‘<em>arsh</em> like a front to it. This was authentically related by ibn ‘Abbaas (رضي االله عنهما) in a <em>mawqoof</em> [63] type of narration. This is agreed upon by the majority of <em>ahlussunnah wal jamaa’ah</em>. In fact, this is asserted by Shaykh-ulIslam Ibn Taymeeyah, [Imaam] Ibnul Qayyim, and others from the people of knowledge and from the verifying scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some have said that <em>al-kursi</em> is the ‘<em>arsh</em> itself. However, this is not true because the ‘<em>arsh</em> is greater, more spacious, and more profound in its extent of encompassing than <em>al-kursi</em>. It has also been narrated on the authority of ibn ‘Abbaas (رضي االله عنهما) that <em>al-kursi</em> represents Allaah’s Knowledge. But I do not think that this narration is authentic because this meaning (i.e. knowledge) is not the true meaning for the word al-kursi in the classical Arabic language nor in the common (‘urfi) language. In fact, it is very unlikely that this transmission from ibn ‘Abbaas (رضي االله عنهما) is an authentic one [64]. Hence, <em>al-kursi</em> is <em>mawdi’ul qadamayan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The greatness of <em>al-kursi</em> is clearly stated in the hadeeth in which the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The seven heavens and the seven earths by the side of <em>al-kursi</em> are naught but as a ring thrown down in a desert land, and such is <em>al-kursi</em> with respect to <em>al-’Arsh</em> (the Throne).”</strong></span> [65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth indicates the vastness of these immense creations and which are, with respect to us, from the world of <em>al-ghayb</em>. That is why Allaah سبحانه و تعالى says:</p>
<p><strong>أَفَلَمْ يَنظُرُوا إِلَى السَّمَاءِ فَوْقَهُمْ كَيْفَ بَنَيْنَاهَا وَزَيَّنَّاهَا وَمَا لَهَا مِن فُرُوجٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Have they not looked at the heavens above them, how We have made it and adorned it, and there are no rifts in it.</strong></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Qaaf (50:6)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He سبحانه و تعالى did not say: “<strong>Have they not looked at al-kursi (or al- ‘arsh)&#8230;</strong>,” because this is something that is not seen by us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Had it not been that Allaah had informed us about it (<em>al-kursi</em> or <em>al-‘arsh</em>), we would not have known of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>His kursi extends over and encompasses the heavens and the earth&#8221;</strong></span>, supports the opinion held by Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymeeyah and by other verifying scholars that the heavens and the earths all have a spherical shape, because this is a matter acknowledged by sensory perception, and through information, though the latter method may have been hidden from many of the preceding people. The proof for this from the Qur’aan is in the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>إِذَا السَّمَاءُ انشَقَّتْ</strong><br />
<strong>وَأَذِنَتْ لِرَبِّهَا وَحُقَّتْ</strong><br />
<strong>وَإِذَا الْأَرْضُ مُدَّتْ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">When the heaven is split asunder [on the Day of Resurrection], and listens and obeys its Rabb,—and it must do so; And when the earth is stretched forth&#8230;</span></strong>[Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Inshiqaaq (84:1-3)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s saying: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And when the earth is stretched forth,&#8221;</span> </strong>necessitates that it is now unstretched. In addition, the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said that on the Day of Resurrection, the earth will be stretched forth like stretched leather, the example of which is drawn for emphasis. [66]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another proof is the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p><strong>يُكَوِّرُ اللَّيْلَ عَلَى النَّهَارِ وَيُكَوِّرُ النَّهَارَ عَلَى اللَّيْلِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong><em>Yukawwiru</em> the night around the day </strong>[making it to be a covering upon the day]<strong> and <em>Yukawwiru</em> the day around the night.</strong></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Az-Zumar (39:5)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Yukawiru</em> means: “to wind round,”[67] like in our saying, “the <em>akwaar</em> (singl. <em>kawr</em>) of the turban,” meaning the turns of the turban upon the head.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We know that the day and night succeed each other upon earth and in doing so, this entails that the earth is spherical, because a thing would not be wound around in a round form except upon something ball-shaped. Nowadays, it is witnessed that the earth is spherical in form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fact that <em>al-kursi</em> extends over and encompasses the heavens and the earth is evidence that it is wound round in a round form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding <em>al-‘arsh</em>, it has been reported that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) described it as being like a dome above the heavens.[68] The dome-shape being round but neither fully spherical nor flat, and its middle is high like that of a tent. [69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, Allaah, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَلَا يَئُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He</strong> [Allaah سبحانه و تعالى]<strong> feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them </strong>[i.e. the heavens and the earths]<strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This attribute of Allaah [feeling no fatigue] is an Attribute of negation. So, what are the Attributes required for guarding and preserving [the heavens and the earths] such that we know that this negation [of fatigue] is in fact an affirmation of their perfection? It is essential that the guarding and preserving require Life, Knowledge, Ability, Might, Mercy, and possibly other attributes. What is important is that the negation implies the perfection of Allaah’s Knowledge, Ability, Might, and Mercy as well as the other related Attributes that are entailed by His (سبحانه و تعالى) preserving and guarding.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[63] <em>Mawqoof</em>: lit. “stopped”. It is a narration from a companion only. The hadeeth attributed to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) is called <em>marfoo</em>’. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) commented, “Had it not been that Ibn ‘Abbaas (رضي االله عنهما) is one whom it is said that he takes from the Israelite transmissions (<em>israa’eeliyyaat</em>: narrations from the traditions of the People of the Book), we would have said that this transmission (regarding <em>al-kursi</em>) takes the form of <em>marfoo</em>’ tradition, because it deals with knowledge of <em>al-ghayb</em> (the world of unperceived realities). When it comes to this kind of knowledge, there is no room for <em>ijtihaad</em> (scholarly deductions). When a <em>sahaabi</em> (companion) says or does something which is not within the scope of <em>ijtihaad</em>, then it takes the <em>marfoo</em>’ type of tradition. The exception, however, is that if the narration from the <em>sahaabi</em> is of the form of <em>akhbaar</em> (news telling, relating information), then, if it is known that a <em>sahaabi</em> narrates from Bani Israa’eel, his transmission would not be <em>marfoo</em>’ because of the possibility that its source may be from Bani Israa’eel (an Israelite transmission). Knowing that the scholars are scrupulous in their inspection of what is attributed to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), they do not rule that a particular transmission is <em>marfoo</em>’ except when all of the possibilities that may hinder this ruling are ruled out.” Tafseer Aayat Al-Kursi, pp. 19-20.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Note: This report from Ibn ‘Abbaas is related by ‘Abdullaah Ibn al-Imaam Ahmad (As-Sunnah: 586), Ibn Abee Shaybah (al-&#8216;Arsh: 61), Ibn Khuzaymah (At-Tawheed: 248), and by alHaakim (Al-Mustadrak: 2:282) who said it is saheeh according to the conditions of alBukhaari and Muslim. Imaam ath-Thahabi agreed to the authentication of al-Haakim. Ad-Daaraqutni reported it in his book As-Sifaat (36) as mawqoof from Ibn ‘Abbaas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani said: “Its <em>isnaad</em> is <em>saheeh</em>, and its narrators are all reliable.” (Mukhtasar Al-’Uluw: 45).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[64] Shaykeh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymeeyah (Al-Fataawaa, 6:584), and Shaykh al-Albaani (AsSilsilah As-Saheehah, no. 109), stated the weakness of this narration from Ibn ‘Abbaas (رضي االله عنهما).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[65] Reported by Ibn Abee Shaybah (Al-&#8216;Arsh, 58), and by Al-Baihaqi (Al-Asmaa’ wasSifaat, 862) with both narrations being from the way of Abee Thar (radhi Allaahu anhu). Shaykh al-Albaani (As-Silsilah As-Saheehah, no. 109) stated that there is no single authentic hadeeth attributed to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) regarding <em>al-kursi</em> except this one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[66] Reported by Ibn Jareer at-Tabari (Tafseer at-Tabari, 30:115-116) on the authority of ‘Ali Ibn al-Hussain. The transmission, however, is mursal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Note: A hadeeth is categorized as <em>mursal</em> when the link between the <em>taabi’ee</em> (successor of the <em>sahaabah</em>) and the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) is missing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[67] The infinitive noun is <em>takweer</em>, which means to round a thing in a round form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[68] This has been reported in Sunan Abee Daawood (English Translation), no. 4708 and in the Sunnah by Ibn Abee ‘Aasim, no. 575, and by others. There is disagreement regarding the authenticity of its isnaad. Imaam ath-Thahabai and other scholars of hadeeth including al-Albaani graded its isnaad as weak. Imaam Ibn al-Aye supported its authenticity. The text describing al-&#8216;Arsh as a dome over the heavens is supported by the context of an authentic narration reported by Imaam al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh (Arabic/English), vol. 9, no. 519 and in which the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“There are one-hundred degrees in al-Jannah which Allaah has prepared for those who carry on jihaad in His Cause. The distance between every two degrees is like the distance between the sky and the earth, so if you ask Allaah for anything, ask Him for the Firdaws for it is the middle and highest part of al-Jannah and at its top is al-&#8216;Arsh of ar-Rahmaan (Allaah), and from it gush forth the rivers of al-Jannah.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The &#8216;Arsh being the roof of the Firdaws, which is the middle and highest part of alJannah, indicates that it has a dome-shape because a thing cannot be at the middle and at its highest point (peak) unless it is round. [See Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymeeyah’s <em>Al-Fataawaa</em>, vol. 5, pp. 150-155, and the book of <em>Al-&#8216;Arsh</em> by Muhammad Ibn ‘Uthmaan Ibn Abee Shaybah (Riyadh, KSA: Maktabat ar-Rushd (checked by Dr. Muhammad Ibn Khaleefah at-Tameemi), 1418/1998), p. 333].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[69] This is based upon additional explanation of the translated text which the author, Shaykh Ibn ’Uthaymeen, may Allaah&#8217;s Mercy be upon him, directly related to me on Wednesday the 16th of Safar 1419Hj, corresponding to the 10th of June 1998. He stated that this explanation fits with that of the hadeeth on the Firdaws as mentioned above. And Allaah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen’s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <i>aayah</i> contains <i>ismullaahi al-aa’tham</i> (Allaah’s Most Greatest Name) affirmed in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> الحيُّ الَقيُّوم</b> ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>Allaah, there is no god worthy of worship except He, the one who possesses the perfect living, and Who is established on His Own, Self-subsisting, and by Whom all things subsist.</b></span>[88]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These two Names were mentioned in three places in the Qur’aan, in the two soorahs known as <i>az-zahraawayn</i> [89] (AlBaqarah and Aal-’Imran), and in Soorat <i>Taha</i>.[90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of <i>‘ilm</i> (<i>ahlul-‘ilm</i>) said: The Most Great Name of Allaah is only in these two Names since they comprise the Most Beautiful Names in their entirety, and hence the attribute of Perfection is implied in the Name [ <b>الحيُّ </b>]and the attribute of <i>ihsaan</i> (beauty) is entailed in the Name: [ <b>الَقيُّوم</b>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[88] Allaah is the one who sustains, protects, prepares, and runs the affairs of all things as He wills in accordance with His Knowledge, Wisdom, and Justice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[89] <em>Zahraawayn</em> (dual form of <em>zahra</em>): The bright ones. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><b>“Recite the Qur’aan, for on the Day of Resurrection it will come as an intercessor for those who recite it. Recite the two bright ones, Al-Baqarah and Soorat Aal-’Imraan, for on the Day of Resurrection they will come as two clouds or two shades, or two flocks of birds in ranks, pleading for those who recite them. Recite Soorat Al-Baqarah, for to take recourse to it is a blessing and to give it up is a cause of grief, and the magicians cannot confront it.”</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported in <em>Saheeh Muslim</em> (English Translation), vol. 2, no. 1757.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[90] In Al-Baqarah (2:255), in Aal-’Imraan (3:2), and in Taha (20:111).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Umaamah (رضي االله عنه) reported that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><b>“Allaah’s Most Great Name is in three soorahs in the Qur’aan, in Soorat Al-Baqarah and in Aal-’Imraan and in Soorat Taha.”</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qaasim bin ‘Abdur-Rahmaan, one of the narrators of this hadeeth, searched the Qur’aan and found</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Aaytul-Kursi in Soorat Al-Baqarah (2:255):<br />
<strong>[ االلهُ لا إله إلاَّ ُ هوَ الحَيُّ القَيُّوم ]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">And in Soorat Aal-’Imraan (3:2):<br />
<strong>[ اللَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الْحَيُّ الْقَيُّومُ ]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">And in Soorat Taha (20:111)<br />
<strong>[ وَعَنَتِ الْوُجُوهُ لِلْحَيِّ الْقَيُّومِ ]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by al-Haakim, Ibn Maajah, at-Tabarani, at-Tahaawi, and others. Shaykh al-Albaani authenticated its isnaad (<i>As-Silsilah As-Saheeha</i>), vol. 2, no. 746.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[FOURTH]: In the fourth statement, Allaah, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>مَن ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ<br />
Who is it that can intercede with Him except with His Permission?</strong></span><br />
[Qur’aan, Aayatul-Kursi , Surah Al-Baqarah 2:255]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word { ْ<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>مَن</strong></span> } &#8220;Who” is an interrogative noun [46] and the intended use of the interrogation in the sentence is to assert the <strong>negation</strong> [that there is none who can intercede] as evident in the <strong>affirmation</strong> phrase which followed it: { ِ<span style="color:#008000;"><strong> إإِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</strong> </span> } “<strong>Except with His Permission</strong>.” Whenever a negation takes the form of an interrogative construct, then the statement is infused with the meaning of challenge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Intercession (<em>Ash-Shafaa’ah</em>):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">{ <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>يَشْفَعُ </strong> </span>}<br />
“<strong>Intercedes</strong>,”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">know that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 . Linguistically, the term “<em>shafaa’ah</em>” means to make an odd number an even one.[47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 . Traditionally, it refers to the laying of a petition (interceding, mediating) with someone in favor of another, in procuring a benefit or warding off harm. Thus the <em>shafaa’ah</em> of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) for <em>ahlul-mawqif</em> [48] after the worry and distress which befalls them and which they are unable to bear is an intercession to ward off a harm. On the other hand, the Prophet’s <em>shafaa’ah</em> for <em>ahlul-Jannah</em> [49] to enter <em>al-Jannah</em> is aimed at procuring a benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. None can intercede except by Allaah’s Permission: { <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</strong></span> } His Leave is <em>kawni</em>. [50] Even Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) who has the greatest rank with Allaah cannot intercede except with the prior leave from Allaah. He will be granted this permission after he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) prostrates before Allaah and praises Him with the great praises and glorifications which Allaah guides him to it on that day. Then it will be said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;ارفع رأسك وقل يُسمَع واشفَعْ تُشَف َّع.&#8221;<br />
<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Raise your head and speak; you will be listened to, intercede and your intercession will be accepted.”</strong> </span>[51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[It is known] that no one have a rank with Allaah greater than that of the Messenger [Muhammad صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم], nevertheless, he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) cannot intercede except with the prior leave of Allaah. It is so because of Allaah, Most Majestic and Most High’s, perfection of Authority and <em>hayybah</em>.[52] The more a king’s authority becomes fully established, the more reverent and respected he becomes. People would not even speak in his court unless he speaks. Consider the Prophet’s (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) relation with his companions and which Quraysh’s [53] emissary [‘Urwah bin Mas’oud] described [after finalizing the treaty of AlHudaybiyah]: &#8220;<em>And when they spoke to him they would lower their voices</em>.&#8221; [54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this is out of respect. You find that if a king is revered by his flock, then no one can speak in his court and in his presence because of the might of his authority. [55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[The Conditions of Confirmed Intercession]:</strong></span> [56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, (تعالى ), has made it clear that He does not permit intercession except for the one whom He approves of and whose word is acceptable to Him, and for the one He is pleased with and on whose behalf intercession shall be made. It is inevitable that Allaah is pleased with <em>ash-shaafi</em>’, the intercessor, and al-<em>mashfoo’i lahu</em>, the one on whose behalf intercession is sought.[57] Consequently, the idols of the polytheists could not intercede on their behalf with Allaah because Allaah does not approve of them. The Prophets and the righteous do not intercede on behalf of the polytheists because the latter are not approved with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, the conditions for the confirmed <em>shafaa’ah</em> are three:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Allaah’s permission of it.<br />
2. Allaah being pleased with the <em>shaafi</em>’.<br />
3. His approval of the one on whose behalf intercession is sought (<em>al-mashfoo’i lahu</em>).[58]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[46] In the grammatical sense, the noun { ْ<strong>مَن</strong> ] is the subject, and the term { <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>ذَا</strong> </span>] is omitted for being redundant. The term { <strong>الَّذِي</strong> } &#8220;<em>he that</em>&#8221; is a relative pronoun standing as the predicate of the subject {مَن } &#8220;<em>Who</em>.” [Author’s note].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[47] Allaah (تعالى) said: { <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>وَالشَّفْعِ وَالْوَتْرِ </strong></span> }, [which means], <strong>And by the <em>shaf’a</em></strong> (even) <strong>and the <em>witr</em> </strong>(odd) [of all the creations of Allaah]. [Qur’aan <em>Soorat Al-Fajr</em> (89:3)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[48] <strong>Ahlul-Mawqif:</strong> All human beings gathered on one plane on the Day of Resurrection awaiting their accounts to be taken by Allaah. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said, “<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The sun will come so close to the people that they will suffer such distress and trouble as they will not be able to tolerate it or to bear it</strong></span>.” The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) intercedes with Allaah to pronounce His Judgment among the people of <em>al-Mawqif</em>. They will be relieved from their long standing by virtue of his interceding with Allaah on their behalf. [See <em>Saheeh alBukhaari</em> (Arabic/English)], vol. 6, no. 236.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[49] <em>Ahlul-Jannah:</em> The believers who will be admitted to reside forever in <em>al-Jannah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[50] <em><strong>Kawni</strong></em>: Pertaining to the Universal Will of Allaah, the Most Majestic and Most Magnificent, and which is in accordance with His Foreknowledge and Wisdom. Creation, provisions, life, death, permission to intercede, and so forth exists by the Will of Allaah. Everything that Allaah Wills is certain to occur. He Willed that <em>eemaan</em> (belief in Allaah) and <em>kufr</em> (disbelief) occur, although He Loves <em>eemaan</em> and Hates <em>kufr</em>. On the other hand, the Legislative Decree (<em>al-hukm ash-shar’i</em>) comprises the Revealed Laws (<em>sharee’ah</em>) which the Messengers came with and what is stated in the Revealed Scriptures. Under this Decree, Allaah Loves that mankind believe in Him (<em>eemaan</em>) and does not Love for them to commit <em>kufr</em>. Mankind, however, may or may not believe in Allaah. In short, under His Universal Will, everything Allaah Wills is certain to pass while under the Legislative Will, what is beloved to Allaah may or may not take place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[51] Part of a long and agreed upon <em>hadeeth</em>. [See <em>Saheeh al-Bukhaari</em> (Arabic/ English)], vol. 6, no. 3 and no. 236.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[52] <em>Hayybah</em>: An attribute inspiring reverence, or veneration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[53] Quraysh is the tribe of the Prophet Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[54]This is part of a long hadeeth detailing the story of the treaty of Al-Hudaybiyah. [See <em>Saheeh al-Bukhaari</em>, vol. 3, hadeeth 891 (English/Arabic).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[55] Kings are in need of intercessors because of the imperfection of their knowledge, might and authority. Allaah, Most Perfect in His Might, Knowledge, and Authority, is in no need for intercessors. That is why intercession with Allaah takes place only if He permits it. With kings, however, intercession is permitted with or without a king’s permission. Those close to the king, for example, may intercede without permission. [See Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s<em> Al-Qawlul Mufeed ‘Alaa Kitaabit-Tawheed</em> (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: Daarul ‘Aasimah, 1st ed. 1415/1994)], vol. 1, p. 330, 332.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[56]The intercessions permitted by Allaah تعالى are six. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) will have the privilege of making three of these intercessions. They are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The Prophet’s intercession for <em>ahlul-mawqif</em>. This is known as the Prophet’s greatest <em>shafaa’ah</em> and it is part of the highest station of praise and honour (<em>almaqaam al-mahmood</em>) with which the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) is distinguished, and for which he will be praised by all creatures. It is mentioned in the Qur’aan [17:78].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The Prophet’s intercession for <em>ahlul-Jannah</em> to enter <em>al-Jannah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The Prophet’s (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) intercession with Allaah تعالى to reduce the punishment of his uncle, Abu Taalib because of his protection and support of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). He will be placed in a shallow part of Hell-Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other intercessions are not restricted to the Prophet Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). They include:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The Prophet’s intercession with Allaah تعالى that He does not cast into Hell the one who deserves it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. His intercession of taking out from Hell those admitted to it because of their sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. The intercession to raise the ranks of the believers. This is the du’aa of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to believers and by the believers for each other.</p>
<p>[See (1) Shaykh bin Baaz’s commentary on Ibn Taymeeyah’s <em>Al-’Aqeedah Al-Waasitiyyah</em> which Shaykh ‘Ali Hasan ‘Abdul Hameed compiled in his verification of Shaykh ‘AbdurRahmaan As-Sa’di’s book <em>At-Tanbeehaat Al-lateefah ‘Ala Al-Waasitiyyah</em> (Dammaam, Saudi Arabia: Daar Ibnul Qayyim, 1409/1989), p. 73, and (2) Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Al-Qawlul-Mufeed</em>, pp. 332-335].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The intercessions mentioned above are the ones approved by Allaah (تعالى). The annulled intercession is any intercession not approved by Allaah(تعالى ).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[57] The conditions are stated in the following aayaat:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Allaah (تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>مَن ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Who is he that will intercede with Him except by His permission.</strong> </span><br />
[Qur’aan, <em>Soorat Al-Baqarah</em> (2:255)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Allaah (تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>يَوْمَئِذٍ لَّا تَنفَعُ الشَّفَاعَةُ إِلَّا مَنْ أَذِنَ لَهُ الرَّحْمَٰنُ وَرَضِيَ لَهُ قَوْلًا</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>On that day, no intercession shall avail, except the one for whom ar-Rahmaan has given permission and whose word is acceptable to Him.</strong> </span>[Qur’aan, <em>Soorat Taha</em> (20:109)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Allaah (تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> وَلَا يَشْفَعُونَ إِلَّا لِمَنِ ارْتَضَىٰ</strong></span><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is pleased.</span> </strong>[Qur’aan,<em>Soorat Al-Anbiyaa’</em> (21:28)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[58] The case of intercession on behalf of the Prophet’s uncle, Abu Taalib, is excluded and in a very limited sense from the ruling stated in Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>فَمَا تَنفَعُهُمْ شَفَاعَةُ الشَّافِعِينَ</strong></span><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">No intercession of intercessors will be of any use to them</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> [unbelievers, polytheists]</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">.</span></strong>[Qur’aan, <em>Soorat Al-Muddathir</em> (74:48)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Taalib stood in support of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and protected him from his enemies of Quraysh. The intercession on behalf of Abu Taalib is special for the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). Other than this special intercession, none is allowed to intercede for a kaafir. Even Abu Taalib is not saved from the Fire of Hell. Had it not been for the intercession of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), Abu Taalib “<strong>would have been in the bottom of the (Hell) Fire</strong>,” as the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said. “<strong>Perhaps my intercession will be helpful to him on the Day of Resurrection so that he may be put in a shallow fire reaching only up to his ankles with which his brain will boil</strong>,” he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) added. [See <em>Saheeh al-Bukhaari</em>, vol. 5, no. 222 and no. 224, and Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Al-Qawlul Mufeed</em>, vol. 1, p. 334].</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[THIRD]: In the Third statement, Allaah (تعالى) said:</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>To Him belongs whatever </strong>(maa)<strong> is in the heavens </strong></span>[44]<span style="color:#008000;"><strong> and whatever is on the earth. </strong></span>[Qur’aan, Aayatul-Kursi , Surah Al-Baqarah 2:255]<span style="color:#008000;"><strong><br />
</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The name {<strong>ما</strong>} &#8220;maa&#8221; here is a conjunctive noun (gram. <em>ism mawsool</em>) taking a form of generalization. The term is used in this form in order to indicate that it comprises both the beings and their states. The meaning, therefore, is that Allaah is the One Who masters the affairs of everything in existence in the heavens and the earth: <strong>creating</strong>, <strong>sovereignty-kingship,</strong> and <strong>management</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sentence <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<strong>لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ</strong> &#8221; <strong>&#8220;To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth&#8221;</strong></span> is a declarative clause in which the predicate (gram. khabar) { <strong>له</strong> } “To Him” has preceded the subject (gram. <em>mubtada</em>’) which is the conjunctive noun {ما} &#8220;Whatever”. In this way, there is a grammatical state of <em>hasr</em> (exclusivity, restriction) which signifies that to Him (Allaah) alone belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. Accordingly, since creating, sovereignty-kingship, and management of affairs belong to Allaah alone, it is incumbent that we should surrender to Him alone because we are His slaves, and a slave must surrender to the One Who Owns and Masters him, Allaah, the One free of all imperfection, the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, we must stand to <strong>persevere Allaah’s pre-decree</strong> because we are His possession and anything that is owned by Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, then it follows that is His right to administer its affairs as He Wills. This right is the same whether His pre-decree applies to the person himself, his family, wealth, friends, country, or the rest of mankind. The important thing is that since the dominion belongs to Allaah, then it is His exclusive right to do whatever He Wills.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the saying of Allaah (which means),<span style="color:#008000;"> <strong>“To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth,”</strong> </span>the term “heavens” came in the <strong>plural form</strong> [45] while the word “earth” was stated in the <strong>singular</strong> though what is meant is the plural. In this regard, the intended usage of the term “earth” refers to the <em>jins</em> (kind).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[44] From the angels, jinn, and all that which exists, including which we have no knowledge of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[45] The Qur’aan has stated that there are seven heavens:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>قُلْ مَن رَّبُّ السَّمَاوَاتِ السَّبْعِ وَرَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْعَظِيمِ</strong><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: Who is the Rabb of the seven heavens and the Rabb of the great &#8216;Arsh?</strong></span><br />
[Qur’aan, <em>Soorat Al-Mu’minoon</em> (23:86)].</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">[ <strong>لَا تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلَا نَوْمٌ </strong>]<strong><br />
</strong></span><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him,<br />
</strong></span>[Qur’aan, Aayatul-Kursi , Surah Al-Baqarah 2:255]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah did not say (what means): “<strong>He does not sleep</strong>,” instead He said<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/asma-wa-sifaat-com/">:</a><span style="color:#008000;">{<strong> لَا تَأْخُذُهُ</strong> }</span> (which means) “<strong>does not overtake Him</strong>” in order to comprise the sleep that overcomes and that arising by choice. If you say, “Does not sleep,” it would imply that He does not sleep by choice. However, Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, does not sleep neither by <em>ghalabah</em> (overcoming) nor by choice, because sleep is an imperfect attribute which contradicts both the perfection of the Self and the perfection in relation to others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The person who is given to sleep misses a lot of his work because of His sleeping. Consider, for example, the case of a person who has many people working for him and he sleeps a lot. He is unable to neither reckon with nor manage the business or other related matters. This is an imperfection with respect to others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regard to self-perfection, sleep is a deficiency because it indicates that the person’s body got tired and thus he needed the sleep as a rest from what has passed, as well as a means to renew his activity to engage in what will come ahead. That is the why <strong>the people of <em>al-Jannah</em> do not sleep</strong>—because of the perfection of their lives and bodies. No illness or the like touches them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone says, <span style="color:#993300;">“We know that the person who does not sleep is unable to do so because of some kind of sickness or a defect, while you say that the lack of sleep is perfection. Explain.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We say, “This applies to the creature, and in this case perfection is a relative matter [with respect to Allaah it is perfection]. There is no doubt that the person who does not sleep because of an illness has a defect, and that is why he stays always in a state of languor and exhaustion. Thus, his welfare will not be established. This is evident from the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <strong>وَجَعَلْنَا نَوْمَكُمْ سُبَاتًا </strong>]<br />
<strong style="color:#008000;font-size:1rem;">And have made your sleep as a thing for rest<br />
</strong>[Qur’aan, Soorat An-Naba’ (78:9)],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">meaning that sleep is something that will discontinue the hardship and tiredness. If Allaah would sleep, and far is He above such imperfection, then this would necessitate that He needs to rest. In addition, the creation will be ruined because they are in need of Him; even the sleeping person is in need of Allaah. In fact, the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) used to invoke Allaah at night when he was about to sleep:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>فَإِنْ أَمْسَكْتَ نَفْسِي فَارْحَمْهَا، وَإِنْ أَرْسَلْتَهَا فَاحْفَظْهَا، بِمَا تَحْفَظُ بِهِ عِبَادَكَ الصَّالِحِين</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“If You take my soul, bestow mercy on it [and forgive it, as in another narration], and if You release it then protect it as You protect your righteous slaves.”</strong></span> [38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In short, it is impossible that Allaah, the One free of all imperfections and the Most High, sleeps. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَنَامُ وَلاَ يَنْبَغِي لَهُ أَنْ يَنَامَ</strong><br />
<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>&#8220;Verily Allaah does not sleep and it does not befit Him to sleep.&#8221;</strong></span> [39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word [ ”<strong>لا يَنبَغِي</strong> &#8220;] does not befit] when used in the Qur’aan and sunnah means “the thing which is absolutely impossible to be,” as Allaah (تعالى ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <strong>وَمَا يَنبَغِي لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَدًا </strong>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>But it is not befitting for </strong>(the Majesty of) <strong>ar-Rahmaan </strong>(Allaah)<strong> that He should beget a son </strong>(or offspring or children)<strong>.</strong></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Maryam (19:92)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[It should be noted] that Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <strong>لَا تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلَا نَوْمٌ</strong> ]<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">signifies <em><strong>as-sifaat as-salbiyyah</strong></em> (attributes of negation: negating any imperfection and implying perfection). The rule with respect to the Names and Attributes of Allaah, the Most High, is that there is no such thing as a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">pure</span> attribute of negation.[40] Indeed, when <em>as-sifaat as-salbiyyah</em> are mentioned, it is because they imply the perfection of the attributes that are in contradiction to those of negation.[41] So, because of the Perfection of Allaah’s Life and <em>qayyoumiyyah</em>,[42] then neither slumber nor sleep overtake Him.[43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[38] Saheeh al-Bukhaari (Arabic/English), vol. 8, no. 332.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[39] Saheeh Muslim (English Translation), vol. 1, no. 343.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[40] This is because mere negation does not denote any attribute, and therefore it is not considered praise. In addition, the attributes of negation are of two kinds:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. General, and<br />
2. Specific.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of generality in negation is that Allaah, Most High, negates all imperfections implicitly denoting that all Perfection is His. For example: Allaah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ <strong>لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ</strong> ], [which means], “<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is nothing like unto Him</strong></span>.” So, there is nothing unto Him in His Knowledge, Ability, Hearing, Seeing, Might, Wisdom, Mercy, and so forth. In this general negation, Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) did not specify the negation. Accordingly, all imperfections are denied and all perfections are denoted, and it is stated that there is <strong>nothing like unto Him</strong> in all of His Perfection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, the specificity in negation is to negate specific allegations of imperfection. For example to deny that defects and drawbacks like forgetfulness, sleep, ignorance, having son or partner, etc. are associated with Allaah, the Exalted. Again, the Perfection is implied as against the negation. [See Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Sharhul Waasitiyyah</em>], vol. 1, pp. 145-146.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[41] For example, the negation of ignorance stands for the affirmation of Allaah’s unlimited knowledge. The negation of death, which is in contradiction of life, implies the perfection of Allaah’s attribute of Life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[42] <em>Qayyoumiyyah</em>: The Attribute denoted by Allaah’s Name <em>al-Qayyoum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[43] The Perfection of His Life negates that Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) needs to sleep and the same is due to the Perfection of His <em>qayyoumiyyah</em>, as the created living creatures due to their imperfection need sleep. Although sleeping and eating may be considered as attributes of perfection with respect to man, as a person who does not sleep or eat is considered ill, they are perfection from one angle and defects from another. They are perfection in the sense that they indicate that the body is sound and healthy, and are defects because the body needs them to function. In reality, therefore, they are defects. Accordingly, the &#8220;perfection&#8221; in the created is only relevant, i.e. particular to the created, not shared by the Most Perfect, i.e. Allaah. Eating, drinking and sleeping are relative “perfections” with respect to the created and negated defects with respect to Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why Allaah, the Most High, said about Himself:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <strong>وَهُوَ يُطْعِمُ وَلَا يُطْعَمُ </strong>]<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And it is He </strong>(Allaah) <strong>Who feeds and is not fed.</strong></span><br />
[Qur’aan, Soorat Al-An’aam (6:14)].</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#808080;"><i>Related Points of Benefit from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s Commentary on Imaam ibn Taymeeyah’s Sharhul ’Aqeedatil-Waasitiyyah, Prepared by Dr. Saleh As-Saleh (rahimahullah)</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Affirming Five Names of the Names of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Allaah</b></i><i>, </i><i><b>al-Hayy</b></i><i>, </i><i><b>al-Qayyoum</b></i><i>, </i><i><b>al-’Aliyy</b></i><i>, </i><i><b>al-’Atheem</b></i>. [85]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Affirming that Allaah is singled out with all worship (<i>al-uloohiyyah</i>): He is the One Who alone has the right to be worshipped, or that He is the One who is worshipped rightfully and deservingly:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">{<b> لا إلهَ إلاَّ ُ هوَ</b> }<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">None has the right to be worshipped but He [Allaah].</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Refuting the claim of the polytheists who affirm other gods beside Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Affirming the <i>sifah</i> (attribute) of <i>hayaat</i> (Life) for Allaah, and that His life is one of perfection, neither preceded by <i>‘adam</i> nor coming come to naught nor characterized by imperfection. On the contrary, our life originates in <i>‘adam</i> and will come to an end, and it is accompanied by imperfection. If fact, all of our life is imperfect, and that is why Allaah described it by <i>ad-dunya</i>. [86] The Life of Allaah, however, is perfection from all angles because of His saying: {<b><span style="color:#008000;">الْحَيُّ</span></b>}The Living, where the particle <b>ال</b> is for <i>al-istighraaq</i>, which comprises all the meanings of the qualities of the perfect life, as if He says, <b>“There is no one who is truly living except He.”</b> In fact, this is the case because there is none qualified with the life of perfection except Allaah, the Most Mighty and most Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Affirming the <i>al-qayyoumiyyah</i> [87] for Allaah (عزَّوجَلََّّ) because He said: {<b><span style="color:#008000;"> القَيُّوم </span></b>}. Such a description does not apply to the human being. There is not any person who is established on his own nor is there anyone who takes full charge of others by whom they subsist, because there is no human being except that he is in need of others. We need workers, and they need us. We need [our] women and they need us. We need our sons and daughters and they need us. There is no one who is absolutely in full charge (giving them care, maintenance, providing for them, etc.) of others. I may be able to take charge of someone else, but in a limited sense. That is why Allaah تعالى said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> أَفَمَنْ هُوَ قَائِمٌ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ </b>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>Is He </b>[Allaah]<b> Who takes charge </b>(guards, maintains, provides, etc.) <b>of every person and knows all that he has earned </b>(like any other deities who know nothing)<b>?</b></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Ar-Ra’d (13:33)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. The <i>aayah</i> contains <i>ismullaahi al-aa’tham</i> (Allaah’s Most Greatest Name) affirmed in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> الحيُّ الَقيُّوم</b> ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah, there is no god worthy of worship except He, the one who possesses the perfect living, and Who is established on His Own, Self-subsisting, and by Whom all things subsist.</span></b>[88]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These two Names were mentioned in three places in the Qur’aan, in the two soorahs known as <i>az-zahraawayn</i> [89] (AlBaqarah and Aal-’Imran), and in Soorat <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><i>Taha</i></span>.[90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of <i>‘ilm</i> (<i>ahlul-‘ilm</i>) said: The Most Great Name of Allaah is only in these two Names since they comprise the Most Beautiful Names in their entirety, and hence the attribute of Perfection is implied in the Name [ <b><span style="color:#008000;">الحيُّ </span></b>]and the attribute of <i>ihsaan</i> (beauty) is entailed in the Name: [ <b><span style="color:#008000;">الَقيُّوم</span></b>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. The perfection of Allaah’s Life and qayyoumiyyah such that they are free from the slightest imperfection. The evidence is in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> لَا تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلَا نَوْمٌ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perfection may be generalized considering what is predominant or more numerous although it may be deficient in certain aspects. However, negation of imperfection means that the perfection is absolute and in every respect is free from deficiency. In this sense, the negation occurred in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> لَا تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلَا نَوْمٌ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. Affirming <i>as-sifaat as-salbiyyah</i> for Allaah because of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> لَا تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلَا نَوْمٌ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَلَا يَئُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <i>sifaat as-salbiyyah</i> are those attributes that Allaah has denied for His Self and which imply affirming the perfection of their opposites.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. Affirming that Sovereignty of Allaah comprehends everything. The evidence is in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. This Sovereignty is exclusively His. The evidence lies in the same aayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ</b> ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">To Him</span></b><b> belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth</b>, in which the predicate (gram. <i>khabar</i>) { <b>له</b> } &#8220;To Him” has preceded the subject (gram. <i>mubtada</i>’) which is the conjunctive noun { ما } &#8220;Whatever”. In this way, there is a grammatical state of <i>hasr </i>(exclusivity, restriction) which signifies that: “<b>To Him (Allaah) </b><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">alone </span></b><b>belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth</b>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. Affirming the heavens and the earth, as in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The “<b>heavens</b>” is a number. They are seven in number and similarly is the number of the earths as proven from other texts.[91]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. The Perfection of the Kingship of Allaah, as evident in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>مَن ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His Permission?</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Kingship of Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى ) is not the same as His all comprehensive Sovereignty. In fact, power and full kingship are more perfect than just all-comprehensive sovereignty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. Affirming the intercession that is approved by Allaah as evident in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</b> ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[None can intercede] <b>except by Allaah’s Permission</b>, otherwise, the exception would not be correct. Hence, had the approved intercession been not affirmed, the exception would not be correct.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. Affirming the “Permission” which is His Command:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</b> ]<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">[None can intercede]<b> except by Allaah’s Permission.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15. Affirming the ‘<i>ilm</i> (Knowledge) for Allaah and that His Knowledge comprehends the past, the present, and the future. The evidence is in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</b> ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>And Allaah Knows what happens to them</b></span><span style="color:#008000;"> (His creatures)</span><span style="color:#008000;"><b> in the future and what happened to them in the past.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16. Refuting the claims of the extremists from the <i>Qadariyyah</i>[92] by affirming Allaah’s all-encompassing Knowledge as in the statement. This constitutes a rebuttal of the extremist from the <i>Qadariyyah</i> who say that Allaah knows the actions of His salves only after they are carried out, denying that Allaah knowledge comprehends everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17. The rebuttal of the two sects, the <i>Khawaarij</i> [93] and the <i>Mu’tazilah</i> [94] by affirming the <i>shafaa’ah</i>. Both sects deny the general intercession approved for the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and for others and which applies to the people who committed sin. This negation is based upon their doctrine that the person who commits a major sin and die without repenting from it will be punished in the Fire forever. The two sects differed, however, as to whether such a person is considered a <i>kaafir</i>, or neither a believer nor a <i>kaafir</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <i>Kharijites</i>, courageous against the truth and for it, said, “<i>The one who commits a major sin is kaafir and no longer belongs to the fold of Islam</i>.” The <i>Mu’tazilites</i> were fearful to oppose the people of <i>ahlus-sunnah</i> and the <i>kharijites</i>. They took a cowardly position and said, “<i>We will sit in the middle of the road and say that the one who has committed a grave sin is in a position somewhere between the two; we neither say he is a believer nor a kaafir!</i>” Both sects, however, agreed that in the hereafter he would be in the Fire of Hell forever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why they denied the <i>shafaa’ah</i> (intercession). The generality of the aayah refutes the position held by both sects:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>مَن ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِه</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">Who is he that can interceded with Him except with His Permission?</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18. None will ever encompass anything of Allaah’s knowledge nor of His Hearing or His Sight:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلَّا بِمَا شَاءَ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19. We comprehend no knowledge about Allaah or about His creation except that which He wills for us to know.[95]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20. Forbidding the <i>takyeef</i> (assigning a manner or a “how”) to the Attributes of Allaah, because He did not inform us of the how they are. So if we claim the knowledge of the <i>kayfiyyah</i> (i.e. the condition or the “how”) of His Attributes, then we are lying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21. Rebutting the <i>Mu’attilah</i>, due to His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ </b>]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is evidence against the <i>Mu’attilah</i> because they say, for example, that Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) has no real Hand. This necessitates that they encompass the negation of one of His Attributes. In this respect, both sects, the <i>Mu’attilah</i> and the people of <i>takyeef</i> (<i>Mukayyifah</i>) lied because Allaah affirmed this Attribute (i.e. the Hand) to Himself. Accordingly, their claim that the true and real Attributes like the Hand, the Face, the Eyes, and so forth do not befit Allaah is false and void. The basis for this fact is that knowledge is of two kinds: (a) Affirmation, and (b) Negation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, you cannot negate anything as being a quality of someone (something) except with knowledge, just like you cannot affirm anything for someone (something) except with knowledge. So if those sects would deny the realities of the aforementioned Attributes of Allaah then they must bring forth their proofs, if they are truthful. For example, Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) did not negate that the Attribute of the Hand from His Self, not even in one single aayah in the Qur’aan, nor did the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) negate this Attribute in any hadeeth, nor did the righteous predecessors (<i>as-salaf-us-saalih</i>). Those sects, however, utter the negation of Allaah’s true and real Hand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">22. Rebutting the position of the <i>Mumathilah</i> (those who liken Allaah to His creation). Since the aayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ</b> ]<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><b>And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">implies a rebuttal of the <i>Mukayyifah</i>, then by all reason it is a rebuttal of the <i>Mumathilah</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">23. Affirming the <i>mashee’ah</i> (Will) for Allaah because of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>إِلَّا بِمَا شَاءَ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">Except that which he Wills.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">24. Rebutting the <i>Qadariyyah</i> and the <i>Mu’tazilah</i> who say that Allaah, the Most High, does not Will anything as far as man is concerned.[96] This is evident in Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ</b> ]<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><b>And they will never compass&#8230;</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowing that man’s compassing of something is from his qualities and his qualities are a creation of Allaah, [and hence man’s will is not independent from the Will of Allaah].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">25. The greatness of the <i>kursi</i>, for His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَسِعَ كُرْسِيُّهُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">His </span></b><b><i>kursi</i></b><b> extends over and encompasses the heavens and the earth.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">26. The Greatness of the Creator of the <i>kursi</i> because the greatness of the created implies the Greatness of the Creator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">27. The <i>kufr</i> of the person who denies the heavens and the earth because this necessitates accusing Allaah of lying. As far as the earth is concerned, I believe that no one denies it [its existence]. However, as regard to the heavens, there are those who deny them saying that what is above us is boundless and limitless space, and that there is only stars and diffused dust (<i>sadoom</i>) or the like. There is no doubt that the one who holds to this belief is a <i>kaafir</i>, whether he himself believes in this or he imitates those whom he reveres from the people who hold to this belief—while knowing the truth implied from the proofs of the Qur’aan and the sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">28. Affirming the Strength of Allaah, and the proof is His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَلَا يَئُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29. Denying the <i>mashaqah</i> (fatigue) from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, because of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَلَا يَئُودُهُ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">He feels no fatigue.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is one of the <i>sifaat as-salbiyyah</i> just like saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> وَلَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا فِي سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ وَمَا مَسَّنَا مِن لُّغُوبٍ </b>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#008000;">And indeed We created the heavens and the earth and all between them in six Days and nothing of fatigue touched us.</span></b> [Qur’aan, Soorat Qaaf (50:38)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">30. Affirming what is implied by the above statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:1rem;">[ <b>وَلَا يَئُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them,</span></b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:1rem;">from the attributes of Knowledge, Ability, Life, Mercy, Wisdom, and Strength.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">31. Affirming that the heavens and the earth are in need for someone who guards them, as stated in Allaah’s saying (which means): He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them. Had it not been for the guarding and preserving of Allaah, they would have been ruined. Allaah Says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>وَلَوْلَا دَفْعُ اللَّهِ النَّاسَ بَعْضَهُم بِبَعْضٍ لَّهُدِّمَتْ صَوَامِعُ وَبِيَعٌ وَصَلَوَاتٌ وَمَسَاجِدُ يُذْكَرُ فِيهَا اسْمُ اللَّهِ كَثِيرًا</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#008000;">Had it not been that Allaah checks one set of people by means of another, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and masaajid (mosques), wherein the Name of Allaah is mentioned much would surely have been pulled down.</span></b><b> </b>[Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Hajj (22:40)].[97]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>وَيُمْسِكُ السَّمَاءَ أَن تَقَعَ عَلَى الْأَرْضِ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</b><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><b>He withholds the heavens from falling on the earth except by His Leave.</b></span><br />
[Qur’aan, Sooart Al-Hajj (22:65)].</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُمْسِكُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ أَن تَزُولَا ۚ وَلَئِن زَالَتَا إِنْ أَمْسَكَهُمَا مِنْ أَحَدٍ مِّن بَعْدِهِ</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>Verily! Allaah grasps the heavens and the earth lest they move away from their places, and if they were to move away from their places, there is not one that can grasp them after Him.</b></span> [Qur’aan, Sooart Faatir (35:41)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">32. Affirming <i>al-’uluw ath-thaati</i> (the Transcendence of Allaah in His Essence) and <i>al-’uluw as-sifaati</i> (the Transcendence of Allaah’s Attributes) because of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">And He [Allaah] is the Most High, above everything.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">33. Rebutting both the <i>Hulooliyyah</i> [98] and the <i>Mu’atilah</i> who negate this Attribute of Allaah تعالى. The Hulooliyyah say, “<i>Allaah is not above everything but rather He is everywhere</i>.” And the Mu’attilah, the people who deny Allaah’s Attributes, say, “<i>He cannot be described as being High or low, to the left or the right, or as being separated from or associated with His creation</i>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">34. Warning against transgression upon others because of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْعَظِيمُ</b> ]<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><b>And He is the Most High, above everything, and He is the Most Great.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why Allaah (تعالى) said in Soorat An-Nisaa’ [(4:34)]:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>فَإِنْ أَطَعْنَكُمْ فَلَا تَبْغُوا عَلَيْهِنَّ سَبِيلًا ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيًّا كَبِيرًا</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>And if they </b>[women] <b>return to obedience </b>[to their husbands]<b>, then seek not against them means </b>[of annoyance]<b>. Surely, Allaah is ever Most High, above everything, Most Great.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you think proudly of yourself, then remember the Highness of Allaah above everything, the Most Mighty and Majestic. And if you think of yourself as being great, then remember the Greatness of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">35. Affirming the Greatness of Allaah because of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>الْعَظِيمُ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">The Most Great.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">36. Affirming the Attribute of Perfection that is implied in the combined Attribute of Transcendence and Greatness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">37. Knowing that the <i>mulk</i> (Sovereignty) belongs to Allaah then:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We must not behave or act in His kingdom except in accordance with that which He is pleased, because of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ</b> ]<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><b>To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The judicial rulings and decreeing amongst the people must be based upon the Judgment of Allaah. Indeed the reliance of man upon the judicial decrees laid by the created and the system of laws laid down by man is one kind of setting up rivals with Allaah (<i>shirk billaah</i>)[99], the Most Mighty and Most Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Contentment with the Pre-decree of Allaah, the Most Mighty and Most Majestic, because if you know that the Sovereignty exclusively belongs to Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى ) then you would say, “This is the disposal of affairs by a Sovereign in His Kingdom, and He has the right to do whatever He wants.”</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>لَا يُسْأَلُ عَمَّا يَفْعَلُ وَهُمْ يُسْأَلُونَ</b> ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#008000;">He cannot be questioned as to what He does, while they [the creation] will be asked</span></b>. [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Anbiyaa’ (21:23)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, this understanding was part of the condolence of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to his daughter [following the death of her child] when he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><b>“Whatever Allaah takes belongs to Him, and to Him belongs what He grants, and everything with Him has an appointed fixed term </b>[in this world]<b>.”</b> </span>[100]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man should not act conceitedly upon accomplishing something because this accomplishment is from Allaah and the Sovereignty is exclusively His.</p>
<p><b><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></b></p>
<p>[85]The Shaykh Uthaymeen also stated that he is in doubt whether the word إله is a Name of Allaah because it is an indefinite noun (gram. nakirah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[86] Ad-Dunya (fem. of adna): Denoting what is low or inferior.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[87] Qayyoumiyyah: One of Allaah’s Attributes implied in His Name Al-Qayyoum.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[88]Allaah is the one who sustains, protects, prepares, and runs the affairs of all things as He wills in accordance with His Knowledge, Wisdom, and Justice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[89] Zahraawayn (dual form of zahra): The bright ones. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><b>“Recite the Qur’aan, for on the Day of Resurrection it will come as an intercessor for those who recite it. Recite the two bright ones, Al-Baqarah and Soorat Aal-’Imraan, for on the Day of Resurrection they will come as two clouds or two shades, or two flocks of birds in ranks, pleading for those who recite them. Recite Soorat Al-Baqarah, for to take recourse to it is a blessing and to give it up is a cause of grief, and the magicians cannot confront it.” </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported in Saheeh Muslim (English Translation), vol. 2, no. 1757.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[90] In Al-Baqarah (2:255), in Aal-’Imraan (3:2), and in Taha (20:111).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Umaamah (رضي االله عنه) reported that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><b>“Allaah’s Most Great Name is in three soorahs in the Qur’aan, in Soorat Al-Baqarah and in Aal-’Imraan and in Soorat Taha.” </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qaasim bin ‘Abdur-Rahmaan, one of the narrators of this hadeeth, searched the Qur’aan and found</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Aaytul-Kursi in Soorat Al-Baqarah (2:255):<br />
<span style="font-size:1rem;">[<b> االلهُ لا إله إلاَّ ُ هوَ </b><span style="color:#008000;"><b>الحَيُّ القَيُّوم </b></span>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">And in Soorat Aal-’Imraan (3:2):<br />
<span style="font-size:1rem;">[ ال<b>لَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ</b><b><span style="color:#008000;"> الْحَيُّ الْقَيُّومُ</span></b></span> <span style="font-size:1rem;">]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">And in Soorat Taha (20:111)<br />
<span style="font-size:1rem;">[<b> وَعَنَتِ الْوُجُوهُ</b><span style="color:#008000;"><b> لِلْحَيِّ الْقَيُّومِ</b></span><b> </b></span><span style="font-size:1rem;">]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by al-Haakim, Ibn Maajah, at-Tabarani, at-Tahaawi, and others. Shaykh al-Albaani authenticated its isnaad (<i>As-Silsilah As-Saheeha</i>), vol. 2, no. 746.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[91] The Shaykh (رحمه االله) made the above statement in his explanation of Soorat Al-Kahf, in the month of Rabee’ al-Awwal,1419. Evidence from the Qur’aan is in Soorat AtTalaaq (65:12) and from the sunnah as in the agreed upon hadeeth, &#8220;<b><span style="color:#808000;">Whoever usurps the land of somebody unjustly, his neck will be encircled with seven earths [on the Day of Resurrection].</span></b>&#8221; [See Saheeh Al-Bukhaari (Arabic/English)], vol. 3, no. 632.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[92] Those who say that whatever man does it is entirely of his own ability and free will, and that Allaah’s <i>mashee’ah</i> (Will) and <i>qudrah</i> (Ability) have no influence whatsoever on what man does. They also claim that the knowledge of Allaah does not comprehend the actions of the creation until after they are executed.</p>
<p>[93] Khaarijites (Ar.<i>Khawaarij</i>, sing. <i>Khaariji</i>). See <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/01/19/brief-overview-of-the-khaarijites-khawaarij/">Appendix B</a>.</p>
<p>[94] The <i>Mu’tazilah</i> (from <i>i’tazala</i>: “to remove oneself” or “to withdraw”). See <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/06/the-mutazilites/">Appendix C</a>.</p>
<p>[95] See both interpretations of this <i>aayah</i> (which means): <b>And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills</b>, pp. 60-61.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[96] Meaning that man has a totally independent free will and that Allaah’s Will and Power has no effect in this.</p>
<p>[97] See <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2015/02/11/the-call-for-the-unity-of-religions-wahdatul-adyaan-a-false-and-dangerous-call-dr-saleh-as-saleh/">Appendix D</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[98] <i>Hulooliyyah</i> [from <i>hulool</i> (lit. “settling,” “alighting,” “lodging,” “descent,” and by extension “incarnation”]. The most common definition is that it refers to the doctrine of Divine incarnation in the human form. In mystic <i>sufism</i>, it refers to the Divine incarnation in the <i>sufi</i> saints.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Taymeeyah classified the <i>Hulooliyyah</i> into two kinds. The first is the <b>specific hulool</b> like the claim of the Christians that Allaah is incarnated in ‘Eesa (alaihissalam) and like that of the extremist <i>raafidah</i> and <i>sufi</i> mystics who claim that Allaah is incarnated in ‘Ali Ibn Abee Taalib (رضي االله عنه) and in special <i>sufi</i> saints, respectively. The second kind is the <b>general hulool</b> and it is the saying that “Allaah, in His Essence, is everywhere.” [See <i>Al-Fataawaa</i>], vol. 2, pp. 171-172.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[99] It could be a major or a minor form of <i>shirk</i> depending upon the motive behind his reliance. <i>Al-Hamdullilaah</i>, the author, Shaykh Muhammad bin ‘Uthaymeen (رحمه االله ) personally affirmed this explanation to me in Jamaada Al-Aakhirah, 1419Hj.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Before you is a translation of the book: &#8220;<em><strong>Talkhees Ahkaam-ul-Udhiyah wadh-Dhakaat</strong> </em> [<strong>The Rules of Sacrificial Offerings and Slaughtering &#8211; Abridged</strong>] which is a condensed version of a larger book written by Imaam Muhammad bin Saalih Al-Uthaimeen [D. 1421H].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his introduction, he states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I had previously written a rather lengthy book on the rules of sacrificial offerings and slaughtering, which was published in 93 pages and contained discussions on some issues of difference. However, foreseeing that the book might be too long for the average reader, I felt that I should abridge that book and leave out unnecessary discussions while adding to it what needed to be added.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author has divided his discussion into ten solid and informative chapters in which he covers the various rules and regulations of sacrificial offerings and slaughtering. So this treatise serves as a valuable guide for those intending to perform the sacrifice on the day of Eid. It is hoped that it will serve as a source of benefit and guidance to English-speaking Muslims throughout the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Based upon the work of Shaykh Ibn Al-‘Uthaymeen</strong><br />
<strong>Explained by Dr Saleh As-Saleh, rahimahumaa Allaah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most honorable and greatest knowledge is the knowledge of Allaah, whom there is no God except Him, the true God, the Lord of all that exists. And the knowledge of Allaah is the basis of every other knowledge, for the one who knows of Allaah knows other than Him.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The one who knows of Allaah knows other than Him, and the one who is ignorant of Allaah is therefore by all means ignorant of every other thing.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَلَا تَكُونُوا كَالَّذِينَ نَسُوا اللَّـهَ فَأَنسَاهُمْ أَنفُسَهُمْ ۚ أُولَـٰئِكَ هُمُ الْفَاسِقُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘And be not like those who forgot Allaah, so He made them forget themselves. Those are the defiantly disobedient.’</span> {Suraah Anfaal 8: 47}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And don’t be like those who forgot Allaah- because of their disobedience, so He let them forget their own selves- for they were not able to do righteous deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you contemplate this aaayah, you will find a noble and honourable meaning and a great one implicated in this verse that anyone who forgets Allaah, Allaah will make him forget his own self, and therefore will not realise his reality nor would he realise that which benefits or harms him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he will be crippled like cattle, even cattle could be more knowledgeable of its benefits in this sense. What is meant is that<strong> the knowledge of Allaah is the basis and foundation of every other knowledge and it is the basis of the slave of Allaah to know of his happiness, and to perfect his affairs and to work for his other life</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore he would properly estimate Allaah, the proper estimation He deserves. And it will lead him to be shy of Allaah, out of love and magnification- his heart being attached to Him, yearning to meet Allaah and be close to Him, turning His affairs to Him and having awe and fear of Him. And mankind, with this respect, differ in such an estimation of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet  said in invocation to Allaah,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8230;لا أحصي ثناء عليك أنت كما أثنيت على نفسك</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[صحيح مسلم و غيره]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘I cannot enumerate praising You, as You (o Allaah) are as You have praised Yourself’</span> [Muslim and others]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet  indicating those most knowledgeable of Allaah, even invoke Allaah with this saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;لا أحصي ثناء عليك أنت كما أثنيت على نفسك</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘I cannot enumerate praising You, as You are as You have praised Yourself (O Allaah)’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Love and eagerness</strong> are matters that follow the knowledge of Allaah, so the knowledge of Allaah brings forth and leads to love of Him and yearning to meet Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefor the knowledge of Allaah, is the most great and honorable knowledge and this leads to the proper estimation of Allaah, loving Him and eagerness to meet Him. The more a person is knowledgeable of Allaah, the more perfection he is in his love of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ad therefore ‘<strong>whoever believes in Allaah and His names and attributes</strong>’ and knows of Him in this respect will love Him more, and then he would achieve a state of sweetness in his heart, and this sweetness puts him in a state whereby he will always love to meet Allaah and be close to Him, and to sense and look at His Face, and listen to Him and to His words.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The knowledge itself leads to the proper estimation of Allaah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Maalik ibn Dinaar rahimahullaah said ‘<span style="color:#993300;">the people of this life they left it and didn’t take the best of it</span>,’ they said to him, ‘and what is it o Abaa Yahya?’ He said, ‘knowing  of Allaah The Most Mighty and Majestic.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who know of Allaah are the ones who have really tasted what is best in this life, and that is the knowledge of Allaah in this life as Maalik bin Dinaar stated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَمَا قَدَرُوا اللَّـهَ حَقَّ قَدْرِهِ إِذْ قَالُوا مَا أَنزَلَ اللَّـهُ عَلَىٰ بَشَرٍ مِّن شَيْءٍ ۗ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘And they did not appraise Allaah with true appraisal when they said, &#8220;Allaah did not reveal to a human being anything.&#8221;’</span> {Suraah Al-An’aam 6: 91}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘They (kuffar) did not estimate Allaah with the estimation due to Him’ when they said that Allaah sent nothing down to the human being- so what is meant by saying what is due to Him is what is meant by the proper estimation of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>When the knowledge of Allaah is strengthened then his eagerness for Allaah also strengthens.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah ibn Masoud radhi Allaahu anhu said, ‘the believer will not feel at rest without the meeting of his Lord Allaah, therefore anyone who sets his resting coat in this life in the meeting of Allaahسبحانه و تعلى, then it is as if He has reached that.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the believer would not have any real rest without being keen about the matter of meeting Allaah, yearning so that he can reach Him. As Allaah سبحانه و تعلى says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَتَطْمَئِنُّ قُلُوبُهُم بِذِكْرِ اللَّـهِ ۗ أَلَا بِذِكْرِ اللَّـهِ تَطْمَئِنُّ الْقُلُوبُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Those who have believed and whose hearts are assured by the remembrance of Allaah. Unquestionably, by the remembrance of Allaah hearts are assured.&#8221;</span> {Suraah Ar-Ra’ad 13: 28}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what ibn Masoud was speaking about in his saying that there will be no real rest for the believer unless he meets Allaahسبحانه و تعلى; therefore this matter should be alive, as mentioned in the aayah in Suraatur Ra’ad, they will achieve that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah gave the prophets عليهم السلام the choice between increasing their stay on earth or death, and they would choose the meeting with Allaah the most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Imaam Bukhaari entitled the chapter in his saheeh &#8211; &#8220;the one who loves to meet Allaah, Allaah will love to meet Him&#8221;. Under this chapter he gave the situation with the prophet  from his wife,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">حدثنا بشر بن محمد حدثنا عبد الله قال يونس قال الزهري أخبرني سعيد بن المسيب في رجال من أهل العلم أن عائشة قالت كان النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم يقول وهو صحيح إنه لم يقبض نبي حتى يرى مقعده من الجنة ثم يخير فلما نزل به ورأسه على فخذي غشي عليه ثم أفاق فأشخص بصره إلى سقف البيت ثم قال اللهم الرفيق الأعلى فقلت إذا لا يختارنا وعرفت أنه الحديث الذي كان يحدثنا وهو صحيح قالت فكانت آخر كلمة تكلم بها اللهم الرفيق الأعلى</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">موطأ مالك, صحيح البخاري, صحيح مسلم, مسند أحمد</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Aisha (رضي الله عنها) who said, ‘Rasoolullah صلى الله عليه وسلم used to say, ‘no prophets soul will be taken by Allaah until he sees his seat in Paradise then he will be given the choice’ so when he صلى الله عليه وسلم  became ill and the moment of death approached and his head was on my thigh, when he صلى الله عليه وسلم used to go into the state of unconsciousness and woke up, finally I saw him gaze in the direction of the roof and said ‘O Allaah, the Highest companionship.’ Aisha said, ‘so I knew he didn’t choose us, and I remember the statement he  صلى الله عليه وسلم used to say to us and it is true. And the last words he spoke was ‘Allaahumma rafeequl a’laa.’ (O Allaah, the Highest companionship)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Muwatta of Maalik, Bukhaari, Muslim and Ahmed (with slight difference in wording)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how is it that these rough hearts and stone hearts are able to accuse other Muslims when they speak about knowing Allaah’s names and attributes and defending them in the proper way, as Allaah intended and as Allaah affirmed for Himself, and by the prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم .</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Question 27</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Question: </b>What is your opinion concerning people who sleep throughout the day in Ramadaan? Some of them pray in congregation while others do not. Is their fast valid?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer: </b>The fast of these types of people is valid and they have fulfilled their responsibility. However, it is very deficient and in opposition to what Allaah’s objective is behind fasting. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“O you who believe. Fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you in order that you may gain Taqwaa (fear and dutifulness to Allaah).”</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 183]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“Whoever does not abandon false speech, acting upon that (falsehood) and ignorance, then Allaah has no need of him abandoning his food and drink.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">It is well known that missing the prayer and not showing any concern for it is not from Taqwaa (dutifulness to Allaah) nor is it from abandoning acting on falsehood.</span> <span style="color:#ff0000;">So it contradicts what Allaah and His Messenger intended by the obligation of fasting.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is strange that these people sleep the entire day and then spend the whole night awake. Perhaps they may even spend the night engaged in vain pastimes that have no benefit or in doing something unlawful by which they would be acquiring sin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So my advice to these individuals and their likes is that they fear Allaah and ask Him to help them observe the fast in the manner that He is pleased with, which is <span style="color:#333300;"><strong>spending the fast engrossed in dhikr (remembrance) of Allaah, recitation of the Qur’aan, praying and showing kindness to the creation as well as doing other things mandated in the Religion</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) was the most generous of people, and the most generous that he would be was in the month of Ramadaan when Jibreel would meet him and teach him the Qur’aan. So during this time, the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) would be more generous in spreading good than a pleasant breeze. [2]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Question 23</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Question: </b>Should children below the age of fifteen be ordered to fast as in the case with prayer?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer: </b>Yes, children who have not yet reached the age of puberty should be ordered to fast if they are able to do it. This is what the Companions would do with their children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars have stated that a guardian should order whichever youth he possesses guardianship over to fast so that they could practice it and become attached to it, and so that the foundations of Islaam could become instilled in their souls to the point that it becomes like second-nature to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, they are not required to fast if doing so will be difficult on them or bring harm to them. I would like to point out here an issue that some fathers or mothers do, and that is preventing their children from fasting, in direct opposition to what the Companions used to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They claim that they are preventing their children from fasting out of mercy and compassion for them. But the reality is that mercy for one’s children is in ordering them to practice the rites of Islaam and to grow accustomed and attached to them. This without a doubt is from the best and most complete forms of raising and cultivating one’s children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is authentically reported that the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“Verily a man is a guardian for the members of his household and he will be questioned as to his flock.”</b> [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree (no. 2409) and Muslim (no. 1829)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That which is required for guardians with respect to those whom Allaah has given them authority over, such as family members and youth, is that they fear Allaah with regard to them and order them with what they were commanded to order them, such as implementing the rites of Islaam.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Question 14</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Question: </b>What is the ruling on fasting in Ramadaan when one does not pray?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer: </b>The one who fasts but does not pray, his fasting is of <strong>no use</strong> to him, <strong>nor will it be accepted</strong> from him, <strong>nor will it free him from his indebtedness (of prayer)</strong>. In fact, fasting is not required on him so long as he does not pray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is since one who does not pray <strong>is like a Jew and a Christian</strong>. So what do you think about a Jew or a Christian that fasts but yet remains upon his religion – is it accepted from him? No. Therefore, we say to this individual: “<strong>Repent to Allaah by praying, and (then) fast</strong>.” And whoever turns to Allaah in repentance, Allaah will accept his repentance.</p>

<p><strong>Transcription of the Text from the Video:</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Question</span></strong>:</p>
<p>Esteemed Shaikh, there has appeared in [recent] times the mobile phone device, and it has been used a lot by women, especially young women, and it has been misused to adverse effect, there being no person to watch over or keep track [of its use]. So could there be some advice to fathers and young women because it has really become one of the most dangerous traps of the Devil.</p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Shaykh Muhammad b. Salih AI-‘Uthaimin:</strong></span></p>
<p>[My] Advice: Indeed, the means to evil in our time have become many, and they are temptations one whom Allah wants to test is tested by. They are a trial from Allah, Almighty and Majestic, since Allah the All-High at times tries slaves by making easy the means to commit sins. Allah the AII-H lgh at times tries slaves by making easy the means to commit suns.</p>
<p>That which the person with the question mentioned is [really] happening: indeed, mobile phones are ready, accessible means for young women to get in contact with young men because they use it everywhere, even if it were in the toilet-the bathroom-and because if anyone calls, his number shows up on the phone, [so] it&#8217;s easy to call him [back], so it&#8217;s dangerous.</p>
<p>And for that reason, <strong>firstly</strong>, I advise our young men and women to stay away from this disgraceful behavior, and I hope that the future of Islam at their hands will be the best of futures.</p>
<p><strong>Secondly</strong>, I advise fathers and guardians to stay informed and have a deep look: how is the young woman using this mobile phone, and how is the young man using it? And I&#8217;ve said to you: indeed, Allah sometimes tries slaves by making easy the means to sin, in order to test them, almighty and majestic is He.</p>
<p>And we have two examples: the first example is found in the nations before us. The second example is found at the beginning of this nation. The Jews were prohibited from catching fish on Saturday.</p>
<p>So when it was Saturday, the fish would come to the surface of the water: when their fish would come to them on their Sabbath day in the open, everywhere, while on non-Sabbath days they would not come to them. [Meaning of Al-A&#8217;raf:163, extract]</p>
<p>During the remaining days of the week they wouldn&#8217;t come, and [it] went on for a long time for them. So they said: There must be some way out-and it&#8217;s that we lay out the nets on Friday; then the fish will come and fill them in great numbers. And when it&#8217;s Sunday, collect it.</p>
<p>So what dld Allah do With them?</p>
<p>Allah Almighty and Majestic says:</p>
<p>And you have most certainly come to know [0 Jews] those who transgressed from you with regard to the Sabbath, so We said to them: Become monkeys, cast out. [Meaning of AI-Baqarah: 65]</p>
<p>And those who came at the beginning of this nation:</p>
<p>Allah the Almighty and Majestic tested them when they were in a state of ihram [during pilgrimage] with the [wild] game that is forbidden for those in a state of ihram [to hunt].</p>
<p>So game was within reach of their hands and spears Reptiles [that they could catch to eat] were within reach; rabbits, easy to catch with one&#8217;s hands; gazelles, easy to catch with one&#8217;s hands; birds, within spear range-given that birds are never except within the range of arrows and that spears, as you know, consists of a stick or the like with a sharpened metal point at the head of it-one could have got them with his spear.</p>
<p>So the Companions? They held themselves back from this. Not one of them hunted game despite it being [so] easy [to catch].</p>
<p>And now sins have become easy to commit by way of these devices, so it&#8217;s upon us to pay attention. And I fear Allah the All-High may send us all a punishment and that He might replace this feeling of security [we have] with fear; this feeling of being fully satisfied, with hunger; this being clothed, with having no clothes, since Allah the Almighty and Majestic says:</p>
<p>And if only the townspeople had believed [and followed what the messengers of Allah had come with] and protected themselves [from His wrath by obeying Him and avoiding sins], We would have then released blessings [of rain and vegetation] upon them; instead, they disbelieved [in them], so We punished them for what they had earned [of sins]. Is it that the [disbelieving] townspeople have come to feel safe from Our punishment coming down upon them at night while they are asleep? Is it that they feel safe from Allah&#8217;s [gradual] plan [leaving them to continue sinning in good health and living until they are suddenly taken by punishment]? And no one feels safe from Allah&#8217;s [gradual] plan except people headed for complete loss [and destruction]. [Meaning of AI-A‘raf: 96-99]</p>
<p>May Allah protect us and you all from this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Title: “I Have Forbidden Oppression”<br />
شرح األربعني النبوييه :Title Original<br />
Author: Muḥammad Ibn Ṣāliḥ al-‘Uthaymīn</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Ḥadīth</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abū Dharr al-Ghifārī (رضي الله عنه) reported that the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) narrated that his lord said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Oh my servants, I have forbidden oppression even for myself, and I have made it forbidden among you as well, so do not oppress one another.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Explanation</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says, <strong>“Oh my servants, I have made oppression forbidden even for myself,”</strong> and He (Azza wa Jal) may make something forbidden upon himself because the decision is His. As for us, we make nothing forbidden for Him, but He may forbid something upon Himself as he wishes just as He may obligate and decree something upon Himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Read the statement of Allah (تعالى ) :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “To who belongs whatever is in the heavens and earth?” Say, “To Allah.” He has decreed upon himself mercy.</span></strong>[4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he pledged upon himself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“My mercy surpasses my anger.”</strong></span> [5]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah has also made oppression forbidden among us as he says, “And I have made it forbidden among you as well.” This includes a person oppressing himself or others. However, the second meaning is more apparent as he then says, “So do not oppress one another.” Meaning: None of you may oppress another individual. Still, it is known that oppression may occur against oneself or against another;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;And we did not oppress them, but they oppressed themselves.&#8221;</strong></span> [6]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic word for oppression, ظُلْم ẓulm, often revolves around failing to give someone else his or her rights or it could linguistically mean “shortcomings” as in the following verse as Allah says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Each of the two gardens produced its fruit and did not fall short thereof in anything.&#8221;</strong></span>[7]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This understanding of oppression—failing to give others their rights—is of two types: 1) refusing to fulfill an obligation to another person, and 2) unlawfully forcing another person to do something which he should not have to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of the first type would be if you were to refuse to repay a debt to someone or to even postpone payment based on the prophet’s statement (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;A rich person’s (one with means to repay) postponement (of repaying) is oppression.&#8221;</strong></span> [8]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And an example of the second type would be if you claimed someone owed you something and you deceitfully produced evidence of the claim so that the individual was forced to pay – this is oppression.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <strong><span style="color:#993300;">By Allah’s command, “So do not oppress one another,” is there any exception to this order?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: No, oppression is forbidden under all circumstances, no exceptions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Is it permissible for us to take the wealth or possessions of the Muā’had?</strong></span> [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: No, it is neither permissible for us to take the wealth and possessions of those with whom we have an understood agreement of peace, nor is it permissible for us to take their blood. The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Whoever murders a Muā’had will not even smell the fragrance of Paradise although its fragrance can be smelled from forty years away</span></strong>. [10]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah for his help.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By this, we know the extent of the aggression, oppression, and utter misguidance of those arrogant individuals who hostilely transgress in taking the wealth and possessions of Muā’had unbelievers regardless of whether they are non-Muslims living peacefully with you in your land or if you were in their lands. We hear of some youths in non-Muslim lands claiming there is nothing wrong with taking wealth or ruining the possessions of disbelievers. You find them breaking street lights, destroying shops, and smashing cars. This is impermissible in Islam. Glorified is Allah! A nation of people accepts you as guests into their lands, you are under their authority and their agreement of trust and yet you betray them. This is the severest form of misrepresenting and dishonoring Islam; it is slandering and disgracing Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But the dishonor and disgrace is not actually against Islam. Rather it is against those individuals themselves – those who claim ascription to Islam. For that, it is incumbent to know that the wealth of non-Muslims under a trust or agreement of peace is sacred regardless of whether they are living peacefully among you or you with them in their lands. It is forbidden to show aggression and hostility against them because that is oppression.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]This article is taken from selected parts of Muḥammad Ibn Ṣāliḥ al-‘Uthaymīn’s explanation of ḥadīth twenty-four of the famous forty-two ḥadīth collection by Imām an-Nawawī known as “al-‘Arba’īn al-Nawawī” or “Nawawī’s Forty (Ḥadīth).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] This ḥadīth is actually much longer but only this portion is explained herein for brevity and for the article’s focus on the topic of oppression.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Recorded by Muslim (no. 2577), Aḥmad (5/153, 160, 177), al-Tirmidhī (no. 2495), and Ibn Mājah (no. 4257).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] The Quran, Sūrah al-An’ām, 6:12.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] This is a ḥadīth qudsī recorded by Muslim, al-Bukhārī, al-Nasāī, and Ibn Mājah. In the text of Muslim, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah created the creation, He pledged upon Himself in his book which is with him over his throne, “My mercy certainly overcomes my anger.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] The Quran, Sūrah Hūd, 11:101.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] The Quran, Sūrah al-Kahf, 18:33.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] Recorded by al-Bukhārī (no. 2166) and Muslim (no. 1564).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] Translator’s Note: Muā’had refers to non-Muslims with whom Muslims have a stated or understood agreement of peace. This may be in the form of official documents (such as entry visas into one another’s countries) or the lack of any official, government-sponsored declaration of war. Thus, the actions of today’s Muslim terrorists, as they declare whole groups or nations of non-Muslims as enemy combatants as they see fit, are neither Islamic nor are they in conjunction with the ḥadīth above (and many other Islamic texts), and Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Recorded by al-Bukhārī (no. 3166).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><b>THE FOURTH LEGACY</b></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I advise you all to safeguard your time and to occupy yourselves in that which is beneficial. You should know that time is more precious than wealth, as Allaah – the Most Blessed, the Most High – said:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Until, when death comes to one of them, he says:&#8221;My Lord! Send me back, That I might do righteousness in that which I left behind.&#8221;</span></strong> [Surah Al-Mu&#8217;minoon: Aayahs 99-100]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Time is such that when it departs it does not return, whereas wealth, when it departs, then it is possible to replace it. So time is of the utmost importance. This is why I advise you to safeguard your time, and to occupy yourselves in that which benefits. Keep away from <i>qeela wa qaal</i> (gossiping) – that so and so said such and such about this and that person – because the Prophet <i>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i> said in an authentic narration: <i>“Indeed Allaah hates qeela wa qaal (gossip mongering), asking too many questions, and wasting one’s wealth.” </i>[4] Unfortunately, many of the youths – after returning to the correct path, and uniting their hearts and unifying their word – have become disunited and fragmented into many factions, and this is due to the whisperings of Shaytaan amongst them and the disuniting of their word. So I advise the brothers to utilise your time in beneficial matters, and to keep away from <i>qeela wa qaal</i>. Indeed, time is like a sword; either you strike it, or it will strike you!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[4] Related by Muslim (no.1715), from Abu Hurayrah <i>radiallaahu ‘anhu</i>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">A FRIDAY SERMON BY: Muḥammad Ibn Ṣāliḥ al-‘Uthaymīn [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh Muslims, there is a certain well known pastime of tribulation and temptation into which many people fall today. Unfortunately, this issue does not negatively affect only the individuals who fall into it. Rather, its consequences affect others as Allah (تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Beware of a trial which will not afflict only those who have transgressed among you exclusively, and know that Allah is severe in penalty.</strong></span> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslims, the tribulations to which I refer are temptations pertaining to (the unlawful admiration of) women, and it is such trials about which the messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">I will not leave behind a trial more harmful to men than (the temptations of) women.</span></strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a trial which the shameful ones readily partake in, one that affects their desires, blinds their eyes, and destroys their judgment. This eventually leads them to following women around in the streets and shopping malls, flirting with them, whistling at them and whispering to them. They may even go so far as to touch or grope women in public as if they are completely unconcerned with others around them. Perhaps they see others as insignificant as if they were cattle. This is because such people are immersed in their own lust. They belittle morality and they defy societal norms. They are fearless before Allah (Azza wa Jal) as they choose ways (to support their desires) other than the respectable ways of sensible people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We must, as a believing Muslim people, renounce these activities perpetrated by such immoral individuals. We detest these types of behaviors because they contradict the characteristics and qualities of believers in Allah and the last day. We disapprove of such actions because they are means leading one closer to adultery or fornication about which Allah (تعالى)  says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And do not approach adultery, fornication. Certainly, it has always been immoral and an evil way</span></strong>.[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We condemn this behavior (of chasing after women, watching them desirously, flirting with them, etc.) because it infringes upon personal safety and security, and it could lead to community fear, panic (among women), and societal disorder. And we criticize it because it may inevitably bring about a swift, overwhelming and inclusive punishment. Allaah (azza wa jal) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">When we intend to destroy a town, we command its affluent ones, but they defiantly disobey. So the word comes into effect upon it, and we destroy it with complete destruction.</span></strong> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here, <strong>&#8220;We command&#8221;</strong> is a type of universal responsibility befitting those of affluence and power (to enforce change in society). Allah mentions the <strong>&#8220;affluent ones&#8221;</strong> because it is often the rich and powerful who immerse themselves in sin. And if they refuse to change, <strong>&#8220;The word comes into effect upon it, and we destroy it with complete destruction.&#8221;</strong> After mentioning His punishment for adultery and fornication (among other sins), Allah then speaks about the exception, those who will avoid punishment, the true worshippers of the Most-Merciful:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Whoever does that incurs sin. The punishment will be multiplied upon him and he will abide therein disgraced, except for those who repent, believe, and do righteous deeds. For them, Allah will replace their bad deeds with good ones and Allah is ever forgiving, merciful.</span></strong> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh Muslims, You who try to safeguard your dignity and protect the women in your care, immoral qualities and shameful behaviors such as these to which some people degenerate—and such behavior was not prevalent in our society until recently—weaken your religion, weaken your honorable protectiveness of women, and spread the means leading to tribulations and societal problems.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Weakening of One’s Religion</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the weakening of one’s religion, these people who follow women around, being tested with admiring and flirting with them, had they been strong in religion, they would not dare do the kinds of things they do with women. Such actions result in their sinning against Allah (azza wa jal)  and preoccupying themselves with and giving preference to the creation instead of the creator. Allah (azza wa jal) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Tell the believing men to lower their gazes and protect their private parts. That is purer for them. Allah is certainly aware of everything they do.</span></strong> [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">The Weakening of One’s Honorable Protectiveness of Women</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the weakening of one’s honorable protectiveness – the praiseworthy type of respectful jealousy one should have of women – individuals afflicted with this temptation to “chase women,” had they had the complete respectful honor for women, they would not dare chase after the women of their brothers (in faith), the women (sisters, daughters, mothers) of their fellow citizens, thereby putting those women into the same types of temptations and tribulations. The type of religious brotherhood we have obliges men to respect and honor his brothers’ womenfolk and those of his fellow citizens, having the same kind of commendable jealousy for their honor and chastity as he has for his own female relatives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I would ask these men: Would you be happy to know that someone chases after your own wife out of desire for her? Or your daughter, your sister, or other female relatives? Would you like people flirting with them? If he would hate such behavior with his own women, why would he allow his own desires to tempt him into doing the same things with other women? I warn these individuals who have been afflicted with such admiration of women from the very actions which would allow another man to gain influence over his own women. I advise them to prevent his relatives from becoming afflicted with such trials.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Spreading of Tribulations &amp; Societal Problems</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tribulations and temptations to admire and chase after women are many. Such behavior (because of its popularity and influence) leads to various forms of widespread media, including audio, visual, and written publications, being placed in the hands of our young men and women. They have newspapers and magazines filled with images and articles that arouse their desires, stimulate their emotions, and kindle the fires of passion. Even worse than this media is that which comes to our land from abroad, or sometimes even from our own citizens. We ask Allah to guide them and to protect us from their evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another way this tribulation may spread is by the very blessings which Allah has bestowed on this land: the comfort of its society, its excess wealth, good food, and the overall security and prosperity of our society. Oftentimes, such luxuries lead one’s heart to become empty and the body to become idle from inactivity or unemployment. This is why you almost always find these young men to be one of two types. They are often unsuccessful men who have no careers to occupy their time or attention. They live off the prosperity of other wealthy, successful men. They neither know a skill, nor try to learn one. They do not work towards a specific occupation or official career. Thus, his desires get the better of him and leave him in a perpetual downfall.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or they may often be men who may work but they waste the results of their labor, wasting their earnings, unconcerned with its value or what results from the bad consequences of their actions. But as for a dignified, determined believer, he does not allow his personality to deteriorate to the point of such shallow yet despicable behavior. Other ways these temptations spread is what some women of immoral conduct themselves perpetrate in their choice of clothing, their appearance, and lustful behaviors. By these choices, they are inclined to promote this type of tribulation. Such conduct was foreign to our righteous predecessors. Some women go to shopping centers to flaunt themselves, to exhibit their beauty with the most attractive clothing they own. They may then throw over it a thin cloak but one that might be shortened or raised up so that her attractive clothing underneath is displayed. They are dressed yet still appear naked, wearing the types of garments the women of Hell wear. The prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are two types of the people of Hell that I have never seen: (1) People with whips like the tails of cattle with which they beat people, and (2) women who are dressed but appear naked, walking with an enticing strut with their heads looking like the humps of camels. They will never enter Paradise, nor even smell its fragrance although its scent can be perceived from such and such a distance. [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some women also frequent shopping centers adorned with gold jewelry or elegant watches, walking in such a manner and revealing her hands (in an attractive, seductive way) to entice those who see her even though Allah (Azza wa Jal) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They (believing women) should not strike their feet in such a manner that the adornment they hide may be known</strong></span>. [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Other women go out perfumed, sometimes choosing to wear the strongest, most fragrant perfume so that almost every man she passes who smells her scent, she allures him with it. The prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said about this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Any woman who has been around incense should not join us in the last evening prayer.</span></strong> [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>A woman, if she wears perfume and then passes by a gathering (of men), she is this and that (meaning: a type of adulterer, fornicator).</strong> </span>[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Other women frequent the malls unveiled or wearing a thin veil that barely conceals her face. Perhaps it is even worn as a way of beautifying her face, or just to hide some blemish on her face. Still other women may cover their faces yet they wear the veil so tightly that their nose, eyebrows, and cheeks are shown. These are no doubt temptations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You also find women roaming shopping centers in a strutting, swaying manner and joke and giggle with their girlfriends. Sometimes they visit shops, with or without need, to chat with the salesman, prolonging their conversation. Perhaps she requests an item stored in the back of the shop that she actually does not want; she just wants to keep chatting with the salesman. Yet Allah (Azza wa Jal) told the prophet’s wives and they were considered the “mothers of the believers,” they were the most pure and farthest from any behaviors or situations of temptation – Allah told them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do not be soft in speech (to men) for fear that he in whose heart is a disease should desire (you), but speak in an honorable manner.</strong></span> [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslims, we have described some things regarding the sickness but is there a cure? The answer is yes and there are several types of medicine thanks to Allah. We are a Muslim nation practicing the religion of Islam, and Allah (Azza wa Jal) has clarified the general responsibilities a man has regarding his family members and the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) has spoken about this as well. As for Allah (Azza wa Jal) He says in His noble book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You who believe, protect yourselves and your families from a fire whose fuel is people and stones over which are (appointed) angels, stern and severe. They do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do as they are commanded.</strong></span>[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Sunnah, the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock. The leader is a shepherd and responsible for his flock (i.e., citizens). A man is a shepherd over his family and responsible for his flock. A woman is a shepherd in her husband’s home and responsible for her flock. And a servant, worker is a shepherd over the property of his master, boss. So each of you is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock.</strong></span>[14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Worshippers of Allah, fear Allah and fulfill your responsibilities. Continuously prevent and discourage the women in your care from visiting shopping centers to behave in manners that contradict religious rulings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allah to help us and you with regards to the medicine of integrity and honor, to guide us and guide others with us for He is capable of all things. All thanks are for Allah, the lord of the worlds, and may Allah send peace and prayers on our prophet, Muhammad, and upon his family and companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Ibn al-‘Uthaymīn continues in the second part of his Friday sermon…</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh Muslim brothers. You, men who are caretakers of women, men who are responsible for your families, fear Allah with respect to yourselves and families. Cultivate in them respectable manners and praiseworthy characteristics, and discourage them from becoming the very means which lead to temptations and tribulations. You are men and they are women and men have been charged with taking care of women because of what Allah has given one over the other and because men (are obliged to) spend their wealth to support them. [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man should neither be (helpless, having no influence) as if he were simply a rock in his house, nor should he be as if he is one of the women. Rather, he must act like a man in every sense of the word. Be shepherds; be responsible and influential so that you live among your families as men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people go to great measures to ensure their financial stability, carefully watching their expenses, their checkbooks and bookkeeping. Yet they neglect their family members for whom they are personally and immediately responsible. Such a man, were he to lose a single sheep from his flock (a single coin, for example), he would search right and left for it until it is found. All the while, he remains unconcerned that his family members, his sons and daughters, are losing their manners and good character.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Men are protectors and maintainers of women by what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend (to support them) from their wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fulfill the obligations Allah has placed over you. This is my advice I present to you as I remind you that you are responsible for your families because Allah told you this and the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) has charged you with this. Do you want to waste this trust you have been given? Do you want to be unable to answer when you are made to stand in front of Allah and asked about this trust?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fear Allah and take seriously the obligations Allah has placed on you. Do not neglect and waste your chances at raising your family. If you fail in the upbringing of your family and this man fails his family and that man fails, soon the entire society becomes corrupt. Society is a conglomeration made up of individuals, so when the individuals become corrupt the entire population is corrupt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I conclude this speech of mine asking Allah (Azza wa Jal) to assist us and you all in fulfilling our responsibilities we have regarding the safeguarding of our families. Oh Allah, help us care for our families, providing the best care for them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fifth Provision: The Caller must destroy the obstacles that stand between him and the people</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Caller must destroy the obstacles that stand between him and the people. This is since many of our brothers who are Callers, when they see people committing some evil, their over-protectiveness and hatred for this evil causes them to not go to these people and advise them. This is an error and it is not from wisdom at all. Rather, wisdom mandates that you go to them and invite them (i.e. give them da’wah), that you convey to them the truth, inciting them and intimidating them (with the Qur’aan and the Sunnah). Do not say that these people are sinners and that I cannot walk amongst them. O Muslim Caller, if you can’t walk amongst these people and go to them to call them to Allaah, then who will take charge of them? Won’t one of those individuals take charge of them? Won’t people who have no knowledge take charge of them? This should never be. This is why the Caller must have patience. And doing this is part of the patience that we talked about previously that the Caller must have. He must have patience and hate these evils. However, he must break the barriers between him and the people, such that he is able to bring his da’wah (call) to those who are in need of it. But as for him being haughty, then this is in opposition to what the Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) used to do. As is well known, the Prophet would go to the polytheists in their gathering places and call them to Allaah. And it has been reported on the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) that he said: “<em><strong>Will not someone take me so that I may convey the words of my Lord, for indeed Quraish has prevented me from conveying the Words of my Lord</strong></em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the habit of our Prophet, our Imaam and our role model Muhammad <em>(sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>). So it is obligatory upon us to be like him when calling (Da’wah) to Allaah.</p>

<p class="videodescription" style="text-align:center;">The Virtues of the Ten Days of Dhul-Hijjah &#8211; Shaykh Muhammad bin Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaymeen رحمه الله. Translated by Abu &#8216;Abdullah Naasir Hussain حفظه الله.</p>
<p class="videodescription" style="text-align:left;"><strong>Transcription of the Video:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Shaykh Muhammad bin Saalih Al-‘Uthaymeen:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praises, abundant and blessed, are for Allah. I testify that none deserves to be worshipped except Allah alone, who has no partners a testimony which saves the one who says it from the punishment of Allah, and I testify that indeed Muhammad is His true worshipper and messenger. May the praise of Allah and peace be upon him, his family, his companions and everyone who follows them correctly until the Day of Judgment. As for what proceeds, O worshippers of Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You are indeed coming upon the ten blessed days, which Allah swore by in His statement:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">وَالْفَجْرِ وَلَيَالٍ عَشْرٍ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;By the dawn. By the ten nights.&#8221;</strong></span> [Soorah AI-Fajr: 1-2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is intended by the ten nights, as is held by many of the commentators, is that they are the ten days of Dhul-Hijjah. And the Prophet, may the praise of Allah and peace be upon him and his family, said about them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">There are no days in which the righteous actions are more beloved to Allah than these ten days.” They (the companions) said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, not even Jihad in the path of Allah?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;Not even Jihad in the path of Allah, except the one who goes out with his self and his wealth and returns with none of them</span>.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning that he went out and was martyred and didn’t return with anything. So, increase in these ten days, O brothers, increase in actions of righteousness: prayer and recitation of the Qur’aan, remembrance of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, giving charity, fasting&#8230; Indeed the Prophet, may the praise of Allah and peace be upon him, did not make this statement except as an encouragement to hasten towards righteous actions. Audibly, and in abundance, say the takbeer (Allah is the Greatest). Abundantly utter the statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><i>Allaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar, laa ilaaha ill-Allaah, Allaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar, wa Lillaahi’l-hamd</i> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest, None deserves to be worshipped except Allah, Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest, and to Allah belongs all praise). </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So that you can &#8216;join’ the pilgrims, who have filled the horizons with the raising of their voices with the talbiya. So, fill the horizons, by raising your voices with the glorification and praise of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allah is the Most Wise, the Most Merciful. When he legislated for the pilgrims to say the talbiya and to raise their voices with it and He legislated for them the sacrifice of an animal, He legislated for the people in their countries, to raise their voices with the <em>takbeer</em> (Allahu Akbar), the <em>tahleel</em> (Laa ilaaha ilIa-Allah) and <em>tahmeed</em> (Alhamdulillah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, that they should offer a sacrificial animal because it is one of the <em>nusuk</em> (rites of Hajj) by which one seeks a means of nearness to Allah, the Mighty and Majestic. So, sacrifice for yourself and for your families.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One sacrificial animal suffices a man and his family and there is no need for every individual (in a family) to offer a sacrifice even if they have the financial means. This is because, even though the Prophet, may the praise of Allah and peace be upon him, was the most generous of creation, he didn’t sacrifice for himself and his family except one sacrificial animal. Even though his family comprised nine women, he only sacrificed one sacrificial animal, may the praise of Allah and peace be upon him. As for the second sacrificial animal that he offered, it was for his nation &#8211; may Allah reward him for that with the best of rewards.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who intends to offer a sacrifice and the ten days have commenced, he should not remove any of his hair, his nails or any of his skin because the Prophet, may the praise of Allah and peace be upon him, prohibited this. For this reason, anybody who wants to act upon the Sunnah by trimming his moustache, plucking his armpits, clipping his nails, or shaving his private parts should do so before the commencement of these ten days because when the ten days begin, he should not remove anything from these things due to the prohibition of the Prophet, may the praise of Allah and peace be upon him and his family.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah , says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Oh, you People of the Book! Commit not excesses in your religion, nor say of Allah anything but the truth. The Messiah, `Eisa, the son of Maryam is no more than a Messenger of Allah, and His Word, which He bestowed upon Maryam, and a Spirit proceeding from Him: So believe in Allah and His Messengers. Say not &#8220;Three&#8221;-desist: It will be better for you: For Allah is one God, glory be to Him [Far exalted is He] above having a son. To him belong all things in the heavens and on earth. And enough is Allah as a Disposer of affairs&#8221;</span> </strong>(Qur&#8217;an 4:171)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported on the authority of `Umar (ra) that the Messenger of Allah <img src="https://i0.wp.com/web.archive.org/web/20081202232709im_/http%3A//abdurrahman.org/tawheed/KTwahab/images/saws.gif" alt="(may Peace Be Upon Him)" width="14" height="13" border="0" /> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Do not extoll me as the Christians extolled the son of Maryam (as ); I am no more than a slave (of Allah) and so (instead), say: Allah&#8217;s Slave and His Messenger.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhari.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah <img src="https://i0.wp.com/web.archive.org/web/20081202232709im_/http%3A//abdurrahman.org/tawheed/KTwahab/images/saws.gif" alt="(may Peace Be Upon Him)" width="14" height="13" border="0" /> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Beware of exaggerated praise, for it was only this which led those before you to destruction.&#8221; </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Ahmad, An-Nassa&#8217;I and Ibn Majah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari and Muslim report that `Aa`ishah said: &#8220;When the Messenger of Allah <img src="https://i0.wp.com/web.archive.org/web/20081202232047im_/http%3A//abdurrahman.org/tawheed/KTwahab/images/saws.gif" alt="(may Peace Be Upon Him)" width="14" height="13" border="0" /> was close to death, he covered his face with a cloth, and then when it became difficult for him to breathe, he uncovered his face and said:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;May Allah curse the Jews and Christians who took the graves of their Prophets as places of worship &#8211; do not imitate them.&#8221;</strong></span></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">If a person shows off in his worship, then this falls under four categories.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. If showing off is the driving force behind doing the act of worship, then the worship is invalid. It is reported in the hadeeth qudsi that Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“I am the One, One Who does not stand in need of a partner. If anyone does anything in which he associates anyone else with Me, I shall abandon him with one whom he associates with Allaah.”</span></strong> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. If a person begins his worship sincerely and showing off occurs later at which point he tries to stop showing off, then his worship is valid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Otherwise, if he continues and does not attempt to ward it off, inclining towards it, then one examines whether the latter part of this worship depends on its earlier part or vice verse. For example, with salaah and wudhu, these worships would become invalid in this case.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, if the worship is distinguished such that the parts are independent, then whatever occurred before showing off is valid, and whatever occurred after the person began to show off is invalid. For instance, a person gives $50 in charity sincerely. Later, he gives $500 to show off. His first donation is valid while the $500 are invalid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. If a person begins to show off after concluding the worship, then the worship is valid. However, this nullifies the reward for the worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) said (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O you who believe! Do not render in vain your Sadaqah (charity) by reminders of your generosity or by injury, like him who spends his wealth to be seen of men, and he does not believe in Allaah, nor in the Last Day. His likeness is the likeness of a smooth rock on which is a little dust; on it falls heavy rain which leaves it bare. They are not able to do anything with what they have earned. And Allaah does not guide the disbelieving people.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Surah al-Baqarah (2:264)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The showing off is in the descriptive manner of the worship, not its origin. As such, the person initiates the action for the sake of Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) but shows off in its description.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For instance, someone begins his salaah sincerely, but he hears someone come, at which point he begins to perfect his salaah more than normal. In this situation, all of that which he added to the sincere part of the salaah will have no reward.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Interview with Umm ‘Abdullaah Wife of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaimeen (rahimahullaah)</strong></p>

Abu Abdullah Al-Amreeki, Reviewed and finalized by Dr. Saleh As-Saleh January 7, 2007</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions, and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is an interview with Umm ‘Abdullaah, the wife of our Shaykh, Muhammad ibn Saleh al-‘Uthaimeen (رحمه الله : rahimahullaah). The interview was conducted by Sis. Maha bint Husein Ash-Shammari &amp; Published in &#8220;AlMutamayyizah Magazine,&#8221; Riyadh, KSA; Issue No. 45, Ramadhan, 1427.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 1: Was there any change in the motivation of the Shaykh regarding ‘ilm (knowledge), dawah, and worship between his youth and his elder years?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: I did not find any diminishing or weakness in his motivation (رحمه الله ) in knowledge, dawah, and worship despite his progress in age. On the contrary, his busy schedule continued to increase with time, as was the case with his worship and call to the extent that during his intense illness, he (رحمه الله ) was not negligent with one moment; he would spend every second in remembrance of Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى), worshipping Him, teaching, or directing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 2: What did you see that was amazing in the Shaykh’s (رحمه الله ) life?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: His life was an example to follow, especially his patience and motivation to seek the knowledge as well as teach and dissipate it. Also, his piety (رحمه الله ) was something that those who were not close to him may not have known about.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 3: How did the Shaykh interact with his children in their private lives?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>s: His dealings with his sons and daughters fell into two stages.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First, in their childhood, he (رحمه الله ) was keen to be close to them, take care of them, raise some of the Islamic principles in them, and follow their educational achievements. In addition, he made sure to direct, admonish, and incite them. For instance, he would sometimes take the children with him to the masjid to perform some of the fard prayers. Also, he would encourage them to fast some of the days of Ramadan. Furthermore, he would incite them to memorize some of the short surahs of the Qur’aan and reward them on that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the stage of youth and maturity, he (رحمه الله ) was firm concerning their fulfilling of the religious obligations and in discipline in cases of negligence. He would couple that with direction and leniency. At certain times, he was not hesitant to do what was sufficient to change or correct their mistakes. In addition, he (رحمه الله ) used to put full trust in them to do certain things so they could learn to depend upon themselves; he used to continuously encourage them on righteousness and check on them regarding that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 4: Why did the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) not use henna on his beard?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: Maybe he did not have the time to do that. I think I heard him saying something to this effect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 5: When did the Shaykh anger intensify, and how did he deal with your anger?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: His anger used to intensify if the inviolable matters of Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) were violated. Regarding my anger with the children, he would try to calm me down first and then give the admonition to the one that was mistaken. In general, he (رحمه الله ) was quiet and did not anger quickly; when he (رحمه الله ) did, his anger would quickly dissipate, and this is from the favors of Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) upon him, something which I wished for the like of his condition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 6: How did he (رحمه الله ) get up from his sleep? Did he depend on an alarm clock, or would he ask someone to wake him?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He used to depend upon Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى), then the alarm clock and then us. Usually he awoke before the alarm and before I would go to wake him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 7: Would the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) ever go outside with his family for a picnic?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes, the family used to have a weekly picnic on Fridays after salaat aljumu’ah; we would go to an area in the wilderness close by and bring our lunch. He utilized this time to share in some activities with the children, like foot racing and solving puzzles. Also, he would bring a small rifle and compete with his children in aiming and shooting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 8: How did the Shaykh fast during the year?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The Shaykh (رحمه الله ) consistently fasted three days each month throughout his life. In addition, he would fast six days in Shawwal, the ten days of Dhul-Hijjah, and the day of ‘Aashooraa’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 9: How did the Shaykh select the names of his children?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He used to choose names like ‘Abdullaah and ‘Abd ar-Rahman [1]; he left the rest for consultation amongst us. We would pick a name and present it to him; he would either agree or ask us to select another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 10: What were some of the things that would please the Shaykh (رحمه الله )?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: There is no doubt that the Shaykh’s (رحمه الله ) happiness used to increase whenever he saw the strength of Islam and Muslims. Regarding happiness at home, it was manifested in meetings with his family and children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You would also see the signs of pleasure and happiness on him upon receiving his grandchildren. He used to open his cloak to allow them to enter underneath and then inquire about them a few times before reopening it; he would do this several times. Later, he would take them to his library where he kept a special kind of sweets they used to call “halawat abooye” (my father’s sweets). We were keen to ensure that they would not find it, except with him. In addition, despite his busy schedule, he made sure to visit his grandchildren at their homes or in the hospital if any of them were ill; this would have a great influence on them and their patents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 11: How many children did the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) have?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The Shaykh had five sons and three daughters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 12: Who amongst his children was the closest to his heart?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The Shaykh used to deal justly with his children in all affairs, major and minor. If he found any kind of distinction between them, he would never declare it openly because this is not from justice. If he was keen to be just in matters lighter than this, then what should we expect here?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 13: Who amongst his children was most affected by his death?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: All of them were, and the reality of the matter is that I used to feel that we were not alone in this as he was a father to Muslims around the world, who all felt a great shock by his death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 14: Who is his youngest child?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The youngest is a daughter who is 21 years old.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 15: What were the steps the Shaykh took in seeking knowledge, and what was your role in that?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The Shaykh (رحمه الله ) began teaching in the Grand Mosque in Unayzah following the death of his Shaykh, ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Naasir as-Saa’di (رحمه الله ) even before I married him. At that time, he used to consider himself a student of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning my assistance, it was manifested in not distracting him from seeking knowledge and propagating it. I used to serve and make available to him what would support his efforts. I would also follow the children and take care of them, except in matters that required his notification so that he could direct, admonish, and seek a solution.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 16: How did he reconcile between the dawah, which took most of his time, and his familial and social responsibilities?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He used to organize his time and gave this great attention. For instance, he would dedicate time for teaching, fatawa, dawah, worship, the family, the children, social responsibilities, and upholding the ties of kinship. If he, at certain times, was unable to directly share in some of these responsibilities, he was still keen to share even by phone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 17: What was his policy regarding educating and directing his children?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: His policy was education; however, he did not force his children to seek a specialty but instead used to consult with them regarding this decision. The obvious proof is that his children graduated from different types of colleges, some sharee’, others military, and also educational.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 18: Taking into consideration the Shaykh’s work and commitments, this inevitably led to him being away from home and the family. What was your role regarding this matter, and how did you cover for his absence (رحمه الله )?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: Even if he was away from home whether for teaching and propagating inside Unayzah or while traveling, he used to follow up with his children through phone calls and by checking on their affairs upon his return. My role is not even worth mentioning because we always felt his presence with us. In general, I used to make the children feel their father’s responsibilities were great and his works many. As such, I would incite them to be patient on that, and he (رحمه الله ) used to compensate them on his return.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 19: Could you tell us about his worship at home?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He was keen to perform the as-sunan ar-rawatib (regular sunnah prayers), except in limited circumstances. He (رحمه الله ) used to wake up in the latter part of the night as much as possible and then make the witr before fajr, in addition to the remembrances and istighfar that he did not discontinue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 20: What was his daily program? For example, when did he sleep and wake, and when did he eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The Shaykh used to get up in the last third of the night, praying as much as Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) wished and then make the witr before the adhan of fajr. Following the adhan, he would pray the regular sunnah of fajr. Next, he would wake his family before going to perform salaat al-fajr at the masjid. He would then return home to read his daily remembrances in the courtyard as well as some of the Qur’aan until about sunrise. He would then sleep till about 8 am. This was on the days that he was not teaching at the university.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After waking again, he would eat some breakfast and then finish his work and readings in his study. He would also pray salaat ad-duhaa before going to the masjid for salaat adh-dhuhr. Upon his return, he would eat lunch with his family at about 1:30. Next, he would take phone calls until about 20 minutes before ‘asr. He would then rest for fifteen minutes or less before going to the masjid to pray ‘asr and meet the needs of people who went to the masjid knowing he would be there. He would return to his study after addressing the people’s needs to read before going again to the masjid for maghrib and his daily classes that would last until isha. Usually he would return home after that to eat a light dinner before going to his study to either give lectures outside of the Kingdom via telelink or hold meetings. This was almost his regular schedule throughout most the year, although it would change during some seasons such as Ramadan, Hajj, and the summer break.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There were also some weekly commitments, and these would take place either at home or outside. Some of his weekly commitments included: Wednesday night meetings with the judges, meetings with the imaams that were scheduled to give the khutbah of jumu’ah in the masajid, meetings with university staff and professors, and meetings with the people of hisbah (those that enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong) until 11 or 12 pm then he would go to sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 21: What was his schedule during Ramadan, especially after iftaar?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: During Ramadan, the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) had a different schedule. He would spend most of the time at the masjid reciting Qur’aan and meeting the needs of the people. Also, he would invite some of the students of knowledge and the poor to eat iftaar at our home. After salaat al-isha, he would return home for dinner and to give fatawa over the phone. In addition, many people would visit our house to either say salaam to the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) or seek a fatwa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 22: Where did the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) like to spend his rest time?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: In reality, the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) did not know rest time; all of his time was busy. Even when he was sitting with us, the phone sometimes would ring, and he would spend a long time addressing the call. His rest time was in propagating the knowledge, meeting people’s needs, and fatawa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 23: How many hours a day did the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) sleep?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The connected time did not exceed 3 to 4 hours. In total, it did not exceed 6 hours daily.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 24: Who amongst the students of the Shaykh did he praise, mention often, and was pleased with their visits?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He (رحمه الله ) looked the same upon all of his students. All of them were like his sons, and he did not praise any of them in particular, but he looked upon them equally when he would meet or welcome them to the house. Also, he would share in their special occasions, meetings, trips, or support them if they were in need of something.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 25: How did the Shaykh’s (رحمه الله ) family deal with his asceticism and piety?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: We used to see him (رحمه الله ) as an example in all things, and we used to revere his asceticism and piety, which would comfort us since he (رحمه الله ) did not like any unnatural mannerisms nor did he want that around him. He was a simple person who liked ease in all of his matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 26: Did he (رحمه الله ) cry upon the death of Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baaz (رحمه الله )?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He was greatly affected by the death of his Shaykh, from whom he took knowledge. Everyone around him felt the extent of the profound impact it had. May Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) make us meet them all in the Paradise of bliss.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 27: Did he travel for other than seeking knowledge?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: No, he did not travel except to seek knowledge. He used to travel to Makkah for ‘Umrah, where he would dedicate times for duroos (talks). In addition, he went to Riyadh and Ta’if to attend the meetings of the Grand Scholars Committee, where he would also schedule duroos and lectures.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 28: Can you tell us about the apparent generosity of the Shaykh with those in need?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: We used to feel his care (رحمه الله ) for the people in need, whether they were distant or close. For instance, he used to check on the affairs of his family and relatives that were in need. Also, he would do the same with his neighbors, helping them in all that they needed, comforting them concerning their worries, and sharing in their joyous occasions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 29: What did you learn from the Shaykh? Did you learn matters of fatawa? Did you ever give fatawa?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: I learned from the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) everything that relates to the affairs of this life, whether from the social or legal aspects. Concerning giving fatawa, I would not even dare to do this. I only used to present the Questions I received to him and then relate the Answers and fatawa to those that had asked.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 30: Before the Shaykh’s (رحمه الله ) death, what did he admonish his household and beloved ones with?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The Shaykh (رحمه الله ) did not give a specific direction before his death, but throughout his life, he would direct everyone to that which benefited them in their life and in their deen (religion).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 31: We would like an admonition from you to the wives of the callers and students of knowledge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: They should preserve their husbands, openly and secretly. In addition, they should prepare for them the best situations and conditions to continue providing their duties of dawah and knowledge. Also, I incite them that they should not be bothered by the busy schedule of their husbands and their time spent traveling, seeking knowledge, reading, and doing dawah. By Allaah’s (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) Will, they are sharing in the reward.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 32: Could you tell us about the way the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) used to receive his guests?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He (رحمه الله ) would receive his guests with simplicity and a real sense of welcoming. He ensured that they felt like guests, and no day passed, except that he brought a guest either for lunch, dinner or in between. We were pleased with his guests and would honor them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 33: What about a rare and pleasing encounter he had with his children or neighbours?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The Shaykh (رحمه الله ) acted with simplicity towards his children and neighbors and all those surrounding him. And one of those rare and nice occasions is that the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) used to record some short recitations and nasheed [2] for his children and sometimes in the presence of one of the neighbors&#8217; kids. He then would re-play the cassette to them during some meeting with them at older ages. We even still keep some of these recording to this date.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 34: What is your advice to those that spread mischief in our Kingdom?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: We ask Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) to preserve our land and to continue to bestow upon us the favor of security and safety. The Shaykh (رحمه الله ) would often repeat and mention that he does not know any nation on the face of the earth that applies the sharee’ah and holds to the correct creed like this one. Similarly, he (رحمه الله ) used to incite us to deal with affairs using wisdom, good admonition, and leniency instead of resorting to violence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 35: Is there anything that the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) asked you to do that seemed strange and made you feel hesitant?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: It may be unknown to most that I was illiterate and did not receive any kind of formal education. When I first married the Shaykh (رحمه الله ), I was fully busy in his service and in providing him the correct, comfortable environment to seek knowledge and teach. After we had our children, I was busy with them, and it took all my time to raise them, in addition to the time I used to spend to help and support the Shaykh ( rahimahullaah) in seeking knowledge. After the children grew up and my responsibilities began to ease slightly, I was surprised that the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) began to incite me to join the schools for the elderly. Although hesitant at first, I decided to join. During this period, he followed my achievements and would not accept for any of my sons to sign my transcripts of record. He (رحمه الله ) would say, “I am the one to sign for all that relates to your academic achievements.” This moment of learning is a period that can not be forgotten because of the great, innumerable benefits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 36: What kinds of gifts would the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) give you, his children, and people in general?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: During his lifetime, he (رحمه الله ) would not withhold anything from those that were close and those that were distant, to the best of his ability. The greatest gift he used to give us was his dawah and du’aa; I ask Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) to accept his du’aa, hold them for him in his good record, and bestow upon us the ability to be righteous to him after his death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 37: Did the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) relate to you anything nice that occurred in the masjid?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He (رحمه الله ) would always tell us those things that he thought were fit to mention.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 38: When did the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) travel for dawah, and how would you deal with him concerning that?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: I used to incite and encourage him as well as make things easy for him by providing him what he needed. In general, his trips were few, and I used to join him on most of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning travel outside of the Kingdom, he did not leave the country, except to seek treatment in America for ten days, and I joined him during that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 39: Could you tell us about the Shaykh’s use of the internet when it was first introduced to the Kingdom?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He was one of the earliest to hasten to benefit from this service and tried to utilize it to dissipate, propagate, and serve the Islamic knowledge. There is nothing more evident of this than the establishment of his website, which contains all of his works. His site is currently supervised by the charitable organization that was setup after his death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 40: When did the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) buy the automatic, telephone <strong>Answer</strong>ing machine?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: From the things that are unknown to many is that the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) was keen and had interest in modern electronic instruments. There were those that used to provide him with the newest technology, such that you would often find with him some electronics that had not yet been released to the open market; examples include: electronic watches, instruments that could determine the direction of the qiblah, audio recording devices, mobile phones, and automatic telephone Answering machines among many other gadgets. He (رحمه الله ) acquired the automatic Answering machine as soon as it became available in the Kingdom. He used it a great deal, often programming it and recording the messages himself, to the extent that when he would travel, he would leave a detailed message on how to contact him while he was away. He was in that, a reference to all of us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 41: Did the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) buy newspapers, and how did he learn about local and national news?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: We used to receive one of the newspapers at our home as a gift, and he ( rahimahullaah) would look at it if he had time. Sometimes he would ask us for scissors to clip out important articles or news so he could keep it. Also, he would hear the news on the radio, especially during breakfast around 7 or 8 in the morning when he would listen to either the Qur’aan broadcasting station from Riyadh or the BBC. In addition, he would listen sometimes at length to the analysis of the news if there were important developments.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 42: Was there ever an offer for the Shaykh to move to Riyadh?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: Several times he was asked to move to Riyadh, Madinah, and Makkah. He was even assigned as a judge in the eastern province of al-Ihsaa, but he used to see that his staying in Unayzah had a great benefit, so he (رحمه الله ) refused these offers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 43: During the visits of King Faisal (رحمه الله ), King Khaled (رحمه الله ), King Fahad (رحمه الله ), and other princes, what did the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) offer them?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: When he was at his home which is made of mud in Unayzah, he was visited by King Saud (رحمه الله ), King Khaled (رحمه الله ), and King Fahad (رحمه الله ); they were amazed by his humbleness, piety, simplicity, and asceticism.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 44: Did anyone offer to install any echo instruments for the microphone in the Shaykh’s masjid?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The Shaykh (رحمه الله ) did not see to that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 45: Was the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) married to anyone else other than you, and how many wives did he have?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: No, the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) was not married to other than me. He married two wives before me; his first wife died, and Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) did not intend for the second marriage to continue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 46: We need from you an admonition to men who have more than one wife. </span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Justice. Justice. Justice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 47: If one would ask the father (i.e. the Shaykh) to admonish me as a girl, what would you expect him?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He would admonish you as he would admonish one of his daughters and all of the daughters of the Muslims to fear Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) openly and secretly, to be righteous to the parents, uphold the ties of kinship, preserve the husband, and fear Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) regarding raising the children Islamically based on leniency and kindness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 48: Did the Shyakh (رحمه الله ) use to tell you about the Mujaahideen in Sheeshaan (Chechnya) and other places especially since it reached us that he was keen concerning their news and Fatwa?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He (رحمه الله ) was keen on following the status (affairs) of Muslims everywhere, in Palestine, Algeria, Afghanistaan, and Sheeshaan. [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 49: How did the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) receive the news of his illness, and how did he tell you about it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He (رحمه الله ) received the news with patience, anticipating the reward. One of my sons reported to me that after they (رحمه الله ) received the news, he instructed them not to mention anything to their brothers, sisters, or me and that the matter should be left to him. He (رحمه الله ) related the news to us gradually. We ask Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) to forgive him and give him a spacious residence in Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 50: We came to know that the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) during his illness refused to call his cancer the “evil disease,” choosing instead to simply refer to it as dangerous. Would you tell us about this and his patience?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: This was not only after his illness, but rather he had this opinion before because he disliked using the term “evil” for this disease.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his patience, this was manifested in his illness, and I knew that he suffered greatly from it. The pain would wake him many times during the night; whenever he was asked about it, he would confirm that it existed, adding that he only told them this as information and not as a complaint, since he (رحمه الله ) knew the reward for those that were patient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions, and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Book of Purification</strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Second Hadeeth</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Hurayrah (May Allaah be pleased with him): Allaah&#8217;s Apostle (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;The prayer of a person who does hadath (passes, urine, stool or wind) is not accepted till he performs (repeats) the ablution.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 1, Book 4, Number 137 and Sahih Muslim Kitaab at-Taharah #559]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">The Narrator</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narrator is Abu Hurayrah (radiyallaahu ‘anhu). His name is ‘Abdur-Rahmaan bin Sakhir ad-Dawsee. He accepted Islaam in the year of the battle of Khaybar (6 AH), and he witnessed the battle. He was in the company of the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam), and was very much interested in the hadeeth of the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam), testified to Abu Hurayrah’s keenness regarding the hadeeths.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Umar (May Allaah be pleased with him and his father) said: <em>“You were closest to the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam), being with him, and most knowledgeable in hadeeth”</em>. The same had been reported from ‘Umar (radiyallaahu ‘anhu) himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Imaam al- Bukhaaree (rahimahullaah) said: <em>“Abu Hurayrah was the most diligent one in preserving the narrations of the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam), in his time”</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of knowledge related that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) narrated 5,374 hadeeths. He died in the year 57 AH in the city of Madeenah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Subject and Overall Explanation</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The subject of this hadeeth is “The ruling concerning salaah without wudhuu’”. In this hadeeth it is clear that the importance of salaah ranks high with Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa), because it is the best of worship after the shahaadah. And it is the relation between the slave and his Lord. And for this reason, the believer is not permitted to indulge in the salaah until he is pure, as this hadeeth illustrates. So Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa), does not accept the salaah of the slave and will not reward him for it if he breaks the wudhuu’ until he repeats the ablution.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>From the Benefits of this Hadeeth</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The hadeeth tells that from the salaah, there is the salaah which is accepted and the salaah which is rejected. The salaah which is in accordance with the shari’ah is accepted. And the salaah which is in opposition to the shari’ah is rejected. This applies to all types of worship, because the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam) said: “Whoever does an action which is not in accordance with our matter, then it is rejected.” [Al- Bukhaaree and Muslim]. So it must comply with the shari’ah to be accepted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Whether the salaah is an obligatory one or an optional one (even the salaatul-janaazah i.e. funeral prayer), it is not accepted if the person performs it while in a state of ritual impurity, even if he forgets being in such a state. It is only accepted when he repeats the wudhuu’. Similarly, the salaah of one in a state of sexual defilement is not accepted if he performs the salaah before taking the ghusl – the complete bath.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The salaah of the muhdith (the one in a state of ritual impurity), is forbidden until he makes the wudhuu’, because Allaah does not accept it. And offering means of nearness to Allaah, knowing that Allaah does not accept them, is like mocking at Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. If a person makes wudhuu’ to perform a certain salaah then the second salaah approaches and he attains the time of the second salaah while in a state of purity then it is not an obligation on him to redo the wudhuu’. He or she can pray on the same wudhuu’ done for the previous salaah. And this is very important because some people think that it is an obligation to make wudhuu’ for each salaah. It is not an obligation as long as the state of wudhuu’ is maintained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Ritual purity is a condition for the correctness and acceptance of the salaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. Breaking the wudhuu’ during salaah invalidates the salaah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The invalidators of wudhuu’ are:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a. Responding to the call of nature or passing wind</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b. Intoxication, unconsciousness, deep sleep and insanity</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">c. Touching the genitals skin to skin, and some scholars conditioned that it must be with a sexual desire</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">d. Sexual activity which necessitates a ghusl</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">e. Eating camel’s meat</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">f. Apostasy (ar-Ridda)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">g. Washing a dead body or carrying it. There is a difference of opinion on this, but to be on the precautionary side, one does that. The Prophet (sallallaahu `alayhi was-sallam) said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“He who washes the dead let him take a bath, and he who carries the dead let him make wudhuu’.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Ahmed, Abu Daawood and at-Tirmidhee, and Al-Albani graded it as saheeh as in saheeh sunan Abi Daeeod, 2:609)].</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Questions for this Hadeeth</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. What is the full name of Abu Hurayrah?<br />
2. When did he accept Islaam?<br />
3. How many Hadeeths did he report?<br />
4. When did he die?<br />
5. If someone prayed without having wudhuu’ due to forgetfulness, is his salaah acceptable or not?<br />
6. Is it a must to have (make) wudhuu’ for each salaah?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q. 393. There are some people who call for the uniting of moon sightings everywhere with that of Makkah, in order to unite the Muslim community over the start of the blessed month of Ramadan and other months. What is Your Eminence’s opinion on this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. From the point of view of astronomy, this is impossible, because the appearance of the new crescent, as Shaikhul-Islam Ibn Tairniyyah, may Allah have mercy on him, said, differs (from place to place) according to the consensus of those who are knowledge- able in this field. Since it differs, then what is necessitated by the evidence from the Qur’an and the Sunnah, and scientific evidence, is that every country must have its own ruling.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the evidence from the Qur’an and the Sunnah, Allah, the Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadan, i.e. is present at his home), he must observe Scrum (fasts) that month&#8221;</strong> </span>[Al-Baqarah 2:185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if it happened that a people in the farthest part of the earth did not witness the month, i.e. the new crescent, while the people of Makkah had seen the new crescent, how could the address in this Verse be applied to those who had not witnessed the new crescent?! The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Fast when you see it and break the fast when you see it&#8221;</strong></span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the people of Makkah see it, how can we oblige the people of Pakistan and those Asians who live beyond it to fast, when we know that the new crescent has not appeared in their region, and the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم: made fasting conditional upon the sighting of the new crescent?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scientific evidence is the correct analogy, which it is not possible to refute, for we know that the dawn appears in the eastern corner of the earth before the western side. So if the dawn appears on the eastern side, is it incumbent upon us to fast while we are still in the night? The answer is no. If the sun sets in the east, while were still in daylight, is it permissible for us to break our fast? The answer is no. Therefore, the new crescent is exactly like the sun, except that the timing of the new crescent is monthly and the timing of the sun is daily, and He Who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;It is made lawful for you to have sexual relations with your wives on the night of As-Saum (the fasts). They are Lihas [i.e. body- cover, or screen, or Sakan (i.e. you enjoy the pleasure of living with them) for you and you are the same for them. Allah knows that you used to deceive yourselves, so He turned to you (accepted your repentance) and forgave you. So now have sexual relations with them and seek that which Allah has ordained for you (offspring), and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete your Saum (fast) till the nightfall. And do not have sexual relations with them (your wives) while you are in I ’tikaf (i.e. confining oneself in a mosque for prayers and invocations leaving the worldly activities) in the mosques. These are the limits (set) by Allah, so approach them not. Thus does Allah make clear His Ayat (proofs, evidences, lessons, signs, revelations, verses, laws, legal and illegal things, Allah’s set limits, orders, etc.) to mankind that they may become Al-Muttaqun.”</span></strong> [Al-Baqarah 2:187]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">is the One Who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadan, i.e. is present at his home), he must observe Saum (fasts) that month&#8221;</strong></span> [Al-Baqarah 2:185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, What is necessitated by the evidence from the Qur’an and the Sunnah, as well as scientific evidence, is to make a special judgement for each place regarding fasting and breaking the fast, and to link them on the base of the perceptible sign which Allah has declared in His Book, and His Prophet, Muhammad fig has declared in his Sunnah, and that is the sighting of the moon and the sighting of the sun or the dawn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808080;">[1] Reported by Al-Bukhari in the Book of Fasting, in the Chapter: The Words of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم: When you see the new crescent (1909); and by Muslim in the Book of Fasting, in the Chapter: The Obligation to Fast the Month of Ramadan Upon Sighting the New crescent (1081).</span></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Second Ayah: His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Had We sent down this Qur&#8217;an upon a mountain, you would surely have seen it humbling itself and rending asunder by the fear of Allah&#8221;</strong></span> (Al-Hashr 59:21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A mountain is among the hardest of what there is, the rocks by which the mountain becomes firm are exemplary in hardness. Allah, Exalted is He, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;When, after that, your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness&#8221;</strong></span> (Al- Baqara 2:74)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this Qur&#8217;an were to be sent down upon the mountain, you would surely see this mountain humbling itself and cleaving out of the fear of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Humbling&#8221; &#8211; that is, submissively.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from its severe fright of of Allah, &#8220;Rending asunder&#8221; it cleaves and tears apart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is sent down upon our hearts, and our hearts &#8211; except as Allah wills &#8211; contract and become hard, neither opening nor accepting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who believe, when the Ayat (of the Qur&#8217;an) are sent down to them, it increases their faith; but as for those who have a disease in their hearts; it adds filth to their filth; and it is Allah whose refuge is sought!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of that is that their hearts become more inflexible and hardened and it adds filth to their filth. We seek refuge in Allah from that</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this Qur&#8217;an were to be sent down to the mountain, it would cleave and humble itself due to the greatness of Allah&#8217;s Words sent down upon it</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this, there is evidence that the mountains have senses, because it humbles itself and cleaves. The matter is like that. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said concerning Uhud: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>This is Uhud, a mountain that loves us, and which we love</strong></span>.&#8221; [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With this Hadith, we also recognize the refutation against those who affirm that there are metaphors in the Qur&#8217;an. Those who always raise their flag, using this Ayah as proof:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Then they found therein a wall wanting to collapse&#8221;</strong></span> (Al-Kahf 18:77)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saying: &#8220;How can the wall want?&#8221; We say: Subhan Allah! The Knowing, and The Aware says : &#8220;Wanting to collapse&#8221; and you are saying that it does not want! Is this sensible?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not your right, after this, that you sav: &#8220;How could it want?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This makes us ask ourselves: Are we given the knowledge of everything?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer is that we are not given knowledge, except a little.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not possible for us to object to the statement of the One Who knows the hidden and the witnessed: &#8220;Wanting to collapse&#8221; by saying: &#8220;The wall does not have an Iradah (a want)! And It does not want to collapse!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is one of the evils of metaphors, because it implies a negation of what the Qur&#8217;an affirms.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it not Allah, Exalted is He, Who says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#000000;">The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify Him and there is not a thing but glorifies His Praise. But you understand not their glorification</span></strong>&#8221; {Al-Israa&#8217; 17: 44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do they glorify Him, without wanting to?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He says: &#8220;<strong>Tusabbih Lahu (they glorify Him)</strong>&#8220;: the Lam is to specify. Thus, it means sincerely. Is it imaginable to have sincerity without an Iradah (volition, objective, will)? Therefore, they will, and everything wills, for Allah says: &#8220;<strong>And there is not a thing but glorifies His Praise</strong>.&#8221; I think it is clear to all of us that this is one of the ways of expressing generality, because In (here) means Ma (not), which negates. Also, &#8220;<strong>A thing</strong>&#8221; is an indefinite pronoun used in the context of negation. &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>But glorifies His Praise</strong></span>&#8221; by that, it includes everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O my Muslim brother, if you see that your heart is not moved by the Qur&#8217;an, accuse yourself, because Allah has informed that if this Qur&#8217;an were to be sent down upon a mountain, it would cleave, and the Qur&#8217;an is recited to your heart, yet and it is not moved. We ask Allah to aid us, and you.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Translator: Mikail ibn Mahboob Ariff حفظه الله</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Esteemed Shaikh, what is the guiding principle with regard to the difference between texts concerning greater and lesser shirk?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This [is a] question a lot of people ask about, saying: what is the difference between lesser shirk and greater shirk?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Greater shirk is that which, when it takes place from a person, he leaves the religion [of Islam, becoming a disbeliever]; lesser is that which is less than that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So directing worship to other than Allāh is greater shirk, and revering [any of] creation as Allāh is due reverence, such that one [of creation] is given a right of divine lordship or revered as the Creator is revered, is greater shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whatever is less than that is lesser shirk, for example: the issue of swearing by other than Allāh is lesser shirk as an initial assumption. However, if there were in the heart of the one swearing, that the one he swore by was like Allāh, it becomes greater shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the guiding principle is that whatever the Shāri‘ [the One who lays down Islāmic law] calls shirk [that] does not [at the same time] take [one] out of the religion, is lesser shirk, [while] that which takes [one] out of the religion is greater shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And another question [still] remains for us: what is it that takes [one] out of the religion? And what is it that does not take [one] out?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This depends on the given text, so whoever gives one of creation a right that is only for the Creator, then this is greater shirk, and whatever is less than that is lesser shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will give you an example: If a person respects his father greatly–every time he comes, he kisses his hand or kisses his forehead; sets his sandals down before him [to wear] and brings the car close to him [to save him having to walk]–this is showing great respect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he were to come to another person and did the same for him as he had done for his father, then this [person] has put other than his father [on] the same [level] as his father.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, had he only presented [this person other than his father] sandals [for him to wear], would he then be treating this other one as one equal to his father? Of course not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://tasfiyah.com/ibn-uthaimin-the-difference-between-lesser-and-greater-shirk-2/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://tasfiyah.com/ibn-uthaimin-the-difference-between-lesser-and-greater-shirk-2/</a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Say: Tell me then, the things that you invoke besides Allah, -if Allah intended some harm for me, could they remove His harm, or if He (Allah) intended some mercy for me, could they withhold His Mercy? Say: Sufficient for me is Allah; in Him those who trust (i.e. believers) must put their trust.&#8221;</strong> </span>(39:38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imran bin Husain (May Allah be pleased with him) narrated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Prophet (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) once saw a man with a brass ring on his hand and asked him, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; The man replied, &#8220;To overcome the weakness of old age.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Remove it, for, it can only add to your weakness. Should death overtake you while you are wearing it, you would never succeed.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[This Hadith was recorded by Ahmad (bin Hanbal) (May Allah be pleased with him) with a good chain of narrators.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also recorded a Marfu’ Hadith; Uqbah bin Aamir (May Allah be pleased with him) narrated that Prophet Muhammad (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Whoever wears talisman or an amulet would never see his wish fulfilled by Allah. And whoever hangs a sea shell would never get peace and rest.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In an another version the Prophet (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) is reported to have said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Whoever wears a talisman has committed Shirk (polytheism).&#8221; </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Hatim reported about Hudhaifah (May Allah be pleased with him):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> He saw a man with a piece of twine on his hand (as a protection or cure from fever) so he cut the twine and read the verse: &#8220;Most of them believe in Allah and still practise Shirk (polytheism).&#8221;</strong></span> (12: 106)</p>

<p>On the authority of Abu Abbas Abdullah bin Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) who said:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify text_details">One day I was behind the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) [riding on the same mount] and he said, <strong>“O young man, I shall teach you some words [of advice]: </strong></p>



<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Be mindful of Allah and Allah will protect you. </strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Be mindful of Allah and you will find Him in front of you. </strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>If you ask, then ask Allah [alone]; and if you seek help, then seek help from Allah [alone]. </strong></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that if the nation were to gather together to benefit you with anything, they would not benefit you except with what Allah had already prescribed for you. And if they were to gather together to harm you with anything, they would not harm you except with what Allah had already prescribed against you. The pens have been lifted and the pages have dried.”</strong></span></p>



<p class="text_details"><span style="line-height:1.5;">It was related by at-Tirmidhi, who said it was a good and sound hadeeth.</span></p>



<p class="text_details">Another narration, other than that of Tirmidhi, reads:</p>



<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Be mindful of Allah, and you will find Him in front of you. </strong></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Recognize and acknowledge Allah in times of ease and prosperity, and He will remember you in times of adversity.</strong></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> And know that what has passed you by [and you have failed to attain] was not going to befall you, and what has befallen you was not going to pass you by. </strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that victory comes with patience, relief with affliction, and hardship with ease.</strong></span></p>

<p>&#8211;</p>
<p><strong>Posted from</strong> : <a title="Book of Ar-Riqaaq – Softening of the Heart – Al-Bukhaari – Dr. Saleh as Saleh" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2014/11/08/book-of-ar-riqaaq-softening-of-the-heart-al-bukhaari-dr-saleh-as-saleh/">Al-Bukhari Book of Ar-Riqaaq</a> – Based upon the explanation of Shaykh Ibn Al-‘Uthaymeen</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The below is from Tafseer Ibn Kathir, darussalam publication</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>O mankind! Verily, the promise of Allah is true. So, let not this present life deceive you, and let not the chief deceiver deceive you about Allah. Surely, Shaytan is an enemy to you, so take (treat) him as an enemy. He only invites his followers that they may become the dwellers of the blazing Fire.</strong> [Surah Fatir ver 5-6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(O mankind! Verily, the promise of Allah is true.)</strong> meaning the Resurrection will undoubtedy come to pass.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(So, let not this present life deceive you,)</strong> means, `this life is as nothing in compare to the great good that Allah has promised to His close friends and the followers of His Messengers, so do not let these transient attractions distract you from that which is lasting.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(and let not the chief deceiver deceive you about Allah.)</strong> This refers to Shaytan, as stated by Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him. Meaning, do not let the Shaytan tempt you and divert you away from following the Messengers of Allah and believing what they say, for he is the chief deceiver and arch-liar. This Ayah is like the Ayah that appears at the end of Surah Luqman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(let not then this (worldly) present life deceive you, nor let the chief deceiver deceive you about Allah) (31:33). Then Allah tells us of the enmity of Iblis towards the sons of Adam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Surely, Shaytan is an enemy to you, so take (treat) him as an enemy.)</strong> meaning, `he has declared his enmity towards you, so be even more hostile towards him, oppose him and do not believe the things with which he tries to tempt you.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(He only invites his followers that they may become the dwellers of the blazing Fire.)</strong> means, `he only wants to misguide you so that you will enter the blazing Fire with him.&#8217; This is a manifest enemy, and we ask Allah, the All-Powerful and Almighty to make us enemies of Shaytan and to make us followers of the Book of Allah and of the way of His Messengers. For He is able to do whatever He wills and He will respond to all supplication. This is like the Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And (remember) when We said to the angels: &#8220;Prostrate yourselves unto Adam.&#8221; So they prostrated themselves except Iblis. He was one of the Jinn; he disobeyed the command of his Lord. Will you then take him (Iblis) and his offspring as protectors and helpers rather than Me while they are enemies to you What an evil is the exchange for the wrongdoers.) (18:50)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira ( رضي الله عنه ) : The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Allah will not accept the excuse of any person whose instant of death is delayed till he is sixty years of age.&#8221;</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;The heart of an old man remains young in two respects, i.e., his love for the world (its wealth, amusements and luxuries) and his incessant hope.&#8221;</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;The son of Adam (i.e. man) grows old and so also two (desires) grow old with him, i.e., love for wealth and (a wish for) a long life.&#8221;</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">O Brothers, know that the Muslim ummah is divided into three groups with respect to Allaah’s Pre-Decree:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The First Group:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They went <strong>overboard</strong> in their affirmation of Allaah’s Pre-Decree, denying that the human being has any ability or choice in the matter. They hold that “<strong>A person has no ability or choice – he is controlled and has no free will, just like a tree when it is blown by the wind</strong>.” They do not distinguish between a person’s action that occur as a result of his choice and an action of his that occurs without him choosing so. No doubt, these people are astray, because what is known from the Religion by necessity, and from the intellect and customs, is that a human being knows the difference between an action he chooses to do and an action he is forced into doing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Second Group:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They went to <strong>extremes in their affirmation of a person’s ability and choice</strong>, such that they negated Allaah having any part in Willing or Choosing or Creating what action a person does. And they claimed that a person is independently responsible for producing his action. This is such that a group amongst them went too far, saying: “<strong>Allaah does not know what actions His servants will do until after it occurs from them</strong>.” These people have also gone to extremes and shown great radicalism in affirming a human being’s ability and choice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Third Group:</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the ones who truly believe, and so Allaah has guided them concerning that which is disagreed upon from the truth. They are Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah. They have treaded the moderate path and the middle course, which is based on religious and logical proofs and evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they say: The actions that Allaah introduces into existence are divided into two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: The actions from Allaah that He causes to occur in His Creation. No one has any choice in regard to these actions, and they are such as when rain descends, when the earth produces vegetation, when life or death occurs, when health or sickness befalls and so on and so forth – from the many things that can be observed occurring within the creation. Without doubt, no one has any part in choosing or willing for these things to transpire, but rather it is only Allaah who wills that to happen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: The actions that the creation, i.e. all of the various types of creatures that possess a willingness, do. These actions occur as a result their choosing and wanting to do them, since Allaah gave them the ability to do that, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“To whoever amongst you wills to go straight.”</strong> [Surah At-Takweer: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Among you is he who desires the worldly life and among you is he who desires the Hereafter.”</strong> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 152]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So whoever wishes, then let him believe, and whoever wishes then let him disbelieve.”</strong> [Surah Al-Kahf: 29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A human being knows the difference between what occurs from him as a result of his own free will and what occurs from him as a result of being compelled and forced. So for example, when a human being climbs a ladder to get to the roof of a house, he ascends the ladder out of his own free will, and while knowing that he freely chose to do so. But when he trips and falls down from the roof, he knows that he did not choose to do that. So he can tell the difference between these two actions – that he freely chose to do the former, while he was compelled to do the latter. Every human being knows this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, when a person is stricken with a sickness in which his urine constantly flows out, this urine comes out from him without his desiring or choosing that. But when he is in a healthy state and free from this sickness, the urine comes out from him when he wills and chooses. So he knows the difference between this and that. No one can deny the difference between the two.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the same goes with everything else that occurs to a person – he can tell the difference between what occurs due to his free will and what occurs due to his being coerced and forced. As a matter of fact, due to Allaah’s Mercy there are some actions a person may do on his own free will, yet not be held accountable for any of them, as is the case with a person when he sleeps or forgets. In the story of the people of the Cave, Allaah tells us:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And you would have thought them to be awake whereas they were asleep. And We turned them on their right and on their left sides.”</strong> [Surah Al-Kahf: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were the ones who turned around in their sleep, yet Allaah ascribes the action to Himself. This is because when a person sleeps, he has no choice or free will in his actions, and he will not be held accountable for actions done in this state, so the act is attributed to Allaah. The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>“Whoever forgets while fasting, and eats or drinks, then he should complete his fast because it was only Allaah who fed him and gave him to drink.”</strong> [2] So he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) attributed this act of feeding and quenching thirst to Allaah, because the action occurred from the individual without him being aware of it, so it is as if it happened without him choosing to do it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of us know the difference between when a person experiences pain or joy within himself at times without choosing so, and not knowing the reason why and between him experiencing these pains or these joys as a result of an act that he did himself. This matter, all praise be to Allaah is clear and there is no confusion over it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers: If we were to take the view of the first group (i.e. the Jabariyyah) who went to extremes in affirming the Divine Pre-Decree, the Religion would be invalidated from its very foundation. This is since the belief that a person has no choice or free will in his actions necessitates that he not be praised for a praiseworthy act or that he be blamed for a blameworthy act, since in reality they were not done by his choice or free will. So then this would mean that Allaah, may He be far removed from it, is oppressing those who sin when He punishes and recompenses them for their acts because He has punished them for something they had no free choice or free will in! This no doubt clearly contradicts the Qur’aan. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And his companion (angel) will say: ‘Here is (his record) ready with me!’ (Allaah will say to the angels): ‘Both of you, throw into the Hellfire every stubborn disbeliever, hinderer of good, transgressor, doubter, he who set up another god with Allaah. So both of you cast him into the Severe Torment.’ His (devil) companion will say: ‘Our Lord! I did not push him to transgress, but rather it was he himself who was in error, far astray. Allaah will say: ‘Do not dispute in front of Me, I had already sent the threat to you in advance. The Word (Ordainment) that comes from Me cannot be changed, and I am not unjust to the slaves.’”</strong> [Surah Qaaf: 23-29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah clarifies that this punishment is not oppression from Him, but rather that it is complete justice since He had previously given them a warning and clarified to them the various paths and explained the truth and falsehood to them, but they chose for themselves the path of falsehood. So there didn’t remain any proof for them before Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if we were to take this false view, it would invalidate Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Messengers, bearing glad tidings and warning in order that mankind would not have any argument (i.e. proof) against Allaah after the (coming of) Messengers.”</strong> [Surah An-Nisaa: 165]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah denies that mankind should have any excuses after the sending of Messengers because the proof has been established against them with that. So if the Divine PreDecree was an excuse for them, this excuse would be infinite even after the advent of the messengers since Allaah’s Pre-Decree did not cease and will not cease to exist before and after the sending of messengers. So therefore, this view is invalidated by the religious texts, and it is invalidated by reality, as we have explained in the previous examples.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who hold the second view, then the religious texts and reality also refute them since the texts clearly state that a person’s will is subject to Allaah’s Will:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“To whoever amongst you wills to go straight. However, you cannot will unless Allaah, Lord of the Universe, wills.”</strong> [Surah At-Takweer: 28-29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And your Lord creates whatever He wills and chooses.”</strong> [Surah Al-Qasas: 68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> “And Allaah calls (you) to the Abode of Peace, and guides whomever He wills to the Straight Path.”</strong> [Surah Yoonus: 25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who hold this view (i.e. the Qadariyyah) are in reality invalidating one of the aspects of Allaah’s Lordship, and they are also claiming that there can be found in Allaah’s dominion that which Allaah did not will or create, when in fact Allaah wills everything, creates everything and has pre-decreed everything. They also contradict that which is known by necessity, which is that everything that is created belongs to Allaah, their essence as well as their attributes, there being no distinction between the attribute and the essence. Therefore, everything belongs to Allaah so it is not possible for there to be anything in His dominion that He did not desire. So what path should a person take and what is his solution if Allaah has pre-decreed that He go astray and not be guided?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We say: The answer to this is that Allaah only guides those who deserve to be guided, and He leads astray only those who deserve to be led astray. Allaah says:<strong> “So when they turned away, Allaah turned their hearts away.”</strong> [Surah As-Saff: 5] And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So because they breached their covenant, We cursed them and made their hearts grow hard. They change the words from their (right) places and have abandoned a good part of the Message that was sent to them.”</strong> [Surah AlMaa’idah: 13] So Allaah clarified that what caused the person to go astray was himself. A person, as we have explained previously, doesn’t know what Allaah has pre-decreed for him since he doesn’t know what has been pre-decreed until after it occurs. So he doesn’t know if Allaah has decreed for him to be astray or guided. So if this is the case, how can he take the path of misguidance, then use as an excuse the argument that this is what Allaah willed for him? Wouldn’t it be more befitting for him to tread the path of guidance and then say that Allah has guided me to the Straight Path?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it right for him to be a Jabaree, i.e. claim that he is forced, when he is misguided, and a Qadaree, i.e. that Allaah has no part in his deeds, when he obeys?! Never! II does not befit a person to claim that he was forced when he finds himself upon misguidance and sin. So when he goes astray and disobeys Allaah, he says: “This is something that has been written and pre-decreed for me, and I am not able to remove myself from what Allaah has ordained for me.” Yet when he does good deeds and Allaah grants him obedience and guidance, he claims that this came solely from himself, saying: “I attained this by myself.” So he becomes a Qadaree when it comes to guidance and a Jabaree when it comes to disobedience. This is not possible ever. So in reality, a person has ability and will. The door to guidance is not any more hidden than the door to sustenance and the door to seeking knowledge. A person, as is well known to everybody, has pre-decreed for him whatever he has from sustenance. But yet in spite of this, he strives for the means of sustenance in his country and outside of it, on the right and on the left. He doesn’t just sit at home and say: “Provision has been pre-decreed for me and it will come to me.” On the contrary, he strives for the means of sustenance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet sustenance itself goes hand and hand with actions/works, as has been authentically reported on the Prophet, in the narration of Ibn Mas’ood, who said that he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said:<strong> “Verily, the creation of each of you is brought together in his mother’s womb for forty days in the form of a seed. Then he becomes a clot of blood for the same amount of time, then a morsel of flesh for the same amount of time. Then an angel is sent to him and commanded with four things: to record his sustenance, his lifespan, his actions, and whether he will be miserable or happy.”</strong> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this sustenance is written just as the good and evil actions are written. So how is it that you can go here and there, traversing land and sea, seeking the sustenance of the world and yet you don’t perform any righteous deed seeking the sustenance of the Hereafter or the success of Paradise? Indeed, these two aspects are one and the same. There is no difference between the two of them. So likewise, you strive for your sustenance and you strive for your livelihood and to prolong your lifespan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But when you become ill with a sickness, you travel through all the regions of the world looking for a skilled doctor who will cure your sickness. This is even though whatever has been pre-decreed for you as your lifespan will come to be and it will not increase or decrease. Yet you do not rely on this and say: “I will remain sick and bedridden at home, and if Allaah has decreed that my lifespan will be prolonged, then it will be prolonged.” Rather, we will find you striving with all of your might and energy to find a doctor whom you regard will be the best one at whose hands Allaah will ordain your recovery. So why don’t you do acts for the Hereafter and righteous deeds the same way you do acts for this worldly life?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We stated previously that: The Divine Pre-Ordainment is a hidden secret, you have no way of finding out about it. So right now, you are between two paths – a path that will take you to salvation and success, and a path that will take you to destruction and regret. So right now, you are standing between these two paths with a free choice. There is no one in front of you preventing you from taking the right path or the left path. If you wish, you can go here, and if you wish, you can go there. So how can you take the left path and say: “This has been pre-decreed for me!” Isn’t it more befitting for you to take the right path and say: “This has been pre-decreed for me?!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you want to go on a journey to some other country and before you lies two roads, one of which is paved, short and safe, while the other is unpaved, long and dangerous, we would find you choosing the short, paved and safe road and not the other one. So this figurative road is similar to it and doesn’t differ from it at all. However, it is the souls and desires that sometimes govern and take over the mind. The believer must take over and control his desires. And when his mind judges, the mind, according to its correct meaning, should prevent a person from what harms it and lead it to what benefits and pleases it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With this it becomes clear that people have a free choice when it comes to their actions, and that they are not coerced. And just as he has a free choice in the acts of his worldly affairs, if he wills he will put out this product or make that his business, then likewise he has a free choice with regard to the affairs of the Hereafter. In fact, the paths of the Hereafter are clearer by far than the paths of this worldly life, because the One who clarifies the paths of the Hereafter is Allaah, in His Book and upon the tongue of His Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). So the paths of the Hereafter are clearer and more lucid than the paths of the worldly life. But in spite of this, people still tread the paths of the worldly life, which have no guaranteed results and abandon the paths of the Hereafter, whose results are guaranteed and known since they are affirmed by Allaah’s promise, and Allaah does not break His promises.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having said this, we say that Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah affirm all of this and make it their Creed and Belief that: A person acts on his own free will and says what he wants. However, his desire and choosing are subject to Allaah’s Will and Desire. Furthermore, Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah believe that Allaah’s Will is subject to His Wisdom, and that it is not a pure and absolute Will, but rather a will that is dependent on His Wisdom. This is because one of Allaah’s Names is Al-Hakeem (The MostWise), and the Most-Wise is the One who judges matters precisely realistically and religiously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And based on His Wisdom, He decrees guidance for the one who desires it and for the one whom He knows wants the truth and whose heart is upon steadfastness. And He decrees misguidance for the one who is not like this – the one who when Islaam is presented to him, his heart becomes constricted as if he were being forced to ascend to the sky. So Allaah’s Wisdom refuses to let this person be from among the guided, unless Allaah renews his determination for him and changes his desire to another desire. And Allaah is Able to do all things. However, Allaah’s Wisdom insists that the causes be closely linked to the effects.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Fourth Provision: The Caller must adorn himself with noble characteristics</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Caller must adorn himself with noble characteristics, such that the effect of knowledge reflects in his beliefs, his worship, his attitude, and all of his procedures, so that he can properly play the role of a Caller to Allaah. But as for him being in opposition to this, then his da’wah will fail. And if he does succeed, then his success will be minimal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So it is upon the Caller to abide by that which he is calling to from acts of worship or daily interactions or manners or methodology, so that his da’wah may be accepted and so that he won’t be from those who will be the first to be thrown into the Hellfire.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers: Indeed if we look at our conditions we will find in reality that we may call to something that we don’t implement ourselves. And this no doubt is a big defect, O Allaah, unless we deny ourselves from looking at what is better since for every place there is a saying. This is since a noble thing may be considered noble due to a number of things that make it superior. This is why the Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) would call to some characteristics, but at times he would preoccupy himself with things more important than them. At times he would fast to the point that it would be said that he wouldn’t stop fasting. And at times he would eat and drink to the point that it would be said that he would not fast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers! I would like every Caller to abide by the characteristics that befit the Caller, so that he can be a true Caller and so that his statements can be closer to being accepted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Sixth Provision : The Caller’s heart must be open towards the one who opposes him</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Caller’s heart must be open towards the one who opposes him, especially if he knows that his opponent has a good intention and that he only opposes him in things that require that the proof be established to him. People must be flexible in these matters and not allow these differences to incite hatred and enmity. This is except for a man that opposes and stubbornly rejects, such that the truth is explained to him but yet he continues to persist upon his falsehood Such an individual must be dealt with according to how he deserves to be treated, such as calling people away from him and warning the people from him. This is since his enmity has manifested itself, such that the truth was made clear to him, yet he did not act on it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there are some <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>subsidiary issues</strong></span>, which the people differ on. In reality, these are from the matters that Allaah allowed His servants to differ in. I mean issues that are not from the fundamental ones, which can cause a person that opposes in them to be considered a disbeliever. Rather, these (subsidiary) issues are from those that Allaah has permitted differing in for His servants, and for which He made the error committed in that regard to be allowable. The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>“When the (legal) judge makes a judgement, exerting himself (Ijtihaad), and he attains the truth, then he gets two rewards. And if he errs then he gets one reward.”</strong> So the Mujtahid does not leave from the fold of being rewarded at all – either he gets two rewards for being correct or one reward for being wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you don’t like others opposing you, then likewise, those same other people don’t like for others to oppose them. So just as you want people to accept your view (on an issue), then likewise, those who oppose you want the people to take their views also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reference point during these times of dispute is what Allaah has explained in His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And whatever you differ in, then its final decision is with Allaah. Such is Allaah, my Lord, in whom I put my trust, and to Him I turn in repentance.”</strong> [Surah Ash-Shooraa: 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O you who believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger, and those in authority amongst you. And if you differ in anything, then return it to Allaah and the Messenger, if you truly believe in Allaah and the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination.”</strong> [Surah An-Nisaa: 59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So everyone that is in disagreement and dispute with one another must return to these sources: The Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger. And it is not lawful for anyone to turn away from the words of Allaah and His Messenger in favor of someone else’s words, regardless of who he may be. So if the truth becomes manifest to you, it is an obligation upon you to throw the view of the one who opposes it against the wall. And you must not turn towards that individual, regardless of what position he holds in knowledge and religion. This is since humans make errors, whereas the words of Allaah and His Messenger are free from errors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">It saddens me to hear that there are some people that look hard into seeking the truth and arriving at it, but in spite of this we find them divided. Each one of them has a particular name and a particular description. And this in reality is a mistake</span></strong>. <strong><span style="color:#993300;">Allaah’s religion is one and the ummah of Islaam is one.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And indeed this ummah (nation) of yours is one ummah. And I am your Lord so be dutiful to Me.”</strong> [Surah Al-Mu’minoon: 52]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah said to His Prophet Muhammad;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily, those who split up their Religion and became sects, you have nothing to do with them in the least. Their affair is only with Allaah. Then He will inform them of what they used to do.”</strong> [Surah Al-An’aam: 159]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“He has ordained for you the same religion which He ordained for Nooh, and that which We have revealed to you (O Muhammad), and that which We ordained for Ibraaheem, Moosaa and ‘Eesaa saying: You should establish the religion and make no divisions in it. Intolerable to the polytheists is that which you call them to. Allaah chooses for Himself whom He wills, and guides unto Himself those who turn to Him in repentance and obedience.”</strong> [Surah Ash-Shooraa: 13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if these are Allaah’s instructions to us, then what is obligatory upon us is to accept these instructions, and gather together upon putting forth an issue and discussing it with one another, in order to bring about rectification not in order to criticize or take revenge. For indeed, any person that debates with someone else intending to give victory to his view and to debase his opponent’s view, or intending to critique and not to correct, then for the most part, they will come out with a result that is not pleasing to Allaah and His Messenger. So it is obligatory on us, in matters such as these, to be one ummah (nation).</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I am not saying that no one errs – everyone either makes mistakes or is correct. Rather, I am talking about the way to correct this error. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The way to correct this error is not by me talking about him behind his back and accusing him. Rather, the way to correct this error is to gather with him and discuss it with him</span>. So if it becomes clear after this that this man will persist on his rejection of the truth, and that he will continue to remain upon the falsehood that he is on, then at this point I have the excuse and the right, rather I am obligated to expose his error, and to warn the people about his error. And this way, the affairs will be rectified. As for splitting up and creating parties, then no one is pleased with this except for someone that is an enemy to Islaam and the Muslims.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah to unite our hearts upon obedience to Him, and that He make us from those who seek judgement from Allaah and His Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). And we ask Allaah to make our intentions sincere and that He clarify to us what is obscure from his Sharee’ah. Verily, He is the Most Magnanimous, Most Generous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allaah, Lord of the worlds, and may the peace and blessings be on our Prophet Muhammad, his family and all his Companions</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Third Provision: Wisdom</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Caller must invite to Allaah with wisdom. And how bitter is wisdom upon the one who doesn’t have it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Da’wah (the Call) to Allaah must occur with (1) wisdom, then with (2) fair admonition, then with (3) debating in the best of manners against someone that is not oppressive, then with (4) debating in not the best of manners against someone that is oppressive. So there are four levels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Call to the Way of your Lord with wisdom and fair admonition. And debate them in a way that is better. Verily, your Lord knows best who has gone astray from His path and He knows best those who are guided.”</strong> [Surah An-Nahl: 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And do not debate with the People of the Scripture (i.e. the Jews and the Christians) except in a manner that is best – except for those who are oppressive amongst them, and say (to them): ‘We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you. Our God and your God is One, and to Him we have submitted.’”</strong> [Surah Al-‘Ankaboot: 46]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Wisdom means: Treating affairs with accuracy and precision, rather it means placing matters in their due place. It is not from wisdom to rush things and expect people to change from the condition they are in to the condition that the Companions were upon overnight. And whoever expects this then he has a foolish mind, and he is far removed from wisdom. This is because the wisdom of Allaah is not like this.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What proves this is that Allaah sent the Qur’aan down to Muhammad, the Messenger of Allaah, in stages so that it may become firm and settled in the souls.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The prayer</strong> was made obligatory during the Mi’raaj, three years before the Hijrah. Some say it was a year and a half, and some hold that it was five. There is differing amongst the scholars about this. But in spite of this it was not made obligatory in the manner that it is performed today. When the prayer was first made obligatory, it used to be two rak’ahs for Dhuhr, ‘Asr, ‘Ishaa and Fajr. And the Maghrib prayer used to be three rak’aat, so that it could be the Witr (odd-number) for the day. But after the Hijrah and after the Prophet had spent thirteen years in Makkah, the prayer of the resident was increased, and so it became four rak’aat for Dhuhr, ‘Asr and ‘Ishaa. And Fajr remained the way it was (i.e. two rak’aat) because the recitation of the Qur’aan is prolonged in it. And Maghrib stayed the same because it was the Witr of the day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, <strong>Zakaat</strong> was made obligatory in the second year after Hijrah. Or (some say) it was made obligatory in Makkah, but that it was not assigned its final estimate in terms of its dividend and obligation. And the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) did not send out envoys to collect the Zakaat until the ninth year after Hijrah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the development of Zakaat progressed in three stages:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. In Makkah: “But pay its due (i.e. Zakaat) on the day of its harvest.” [Surah Al-An’aam: 141] However, its obligation was not clarified nor the amount that was mandated to give for that obligation. This matter was left entrusted to the people.<br />
2. In the second year after Hijrah, Zakaat was clarified with its rightful dividends.<br />
3. And in the ninth year after Hijrah, the Prophet started to send envoys to the people of yields and profits to collect Zakaat from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So look at the careful consideration that was given to the conditions of the people with regard to Allaah’s legislation. And He is the best of judges.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same goes for fasting, as there was a stage-by-stage development with regard to its legislation. What was first made obligatory, was that a person had a choice between fasting or feeding a needy person. Then fasting was prescribed specifically, and feeding needy people was only allowed for those who weren’t able to fast for numerous consecutive days.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Therefore I say that wisdom denounces that the world change over in one night. There must be endurance and tolerance. Accept from your brother whom you are calling what he has from truth for today, and proceed with him step by step until he is able to eventually free himself from falsehood. And this is so that you may see that people are not of equal standing. So there is a difference between one is ignorant and one who stubbornly rejects.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps it is proper that I now mention some examples of the Da’wah of Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The First Example:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Bedouin man once entered the masjid, while the Prophet was sitting down with his Companions. The Bedouin man then urinated in one area of the masjid, so the people reprimanded him, meaning they scolded him angrily using harsh words. However, the Prophet, who was the one whom Allaah gave wisdom, forbade them from this. So when the man had finished urinating, the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) ordered that a bucket of water be thrown over his urine. So the harm was removed and Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) called the Bedouin to him, saying to him: “<strong>Indeed it is not proper to have any harmful object or filth in these masaajid. They are only for prayer and the reciting of the Qur’aan</strong>.” Or it is as he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said. So the Bedouin’s heart opened up to this kind treatment. This is why I have seen some of the scholars quote this Bedouin man as saying: “<strong>O Allaah, have mercy on me and Muhammad and do not have mercy on anyone else besides us</strong>.” This was because the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) treated him in such an excellent manner. But as for the Companions, they rushed to remove this evil act, without having properly weighed the condition of this man, who was (obviously) ignorant. [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Second Example:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One time Mu’awiyah bin Al-Hakam, may Allaah be pleased with him, came while the Prophet was leading the people in prayer. So one man sneezed and said: “AlHamdulillaah.” <span style="color:#808080;">(<strong>Note</strong>:) If one of you sneezes while in prayer then he should say AlHamdulillaah, regardless of whether he is in the standing position or the bowing position or in prostration</span>. This man (in prayer) said “Al-Hamdulillaah, so Mu’awiyah responded: “YarhamukAllaah.” But this is considered speaking and it invalidates the prayer. So the people began to stare and look at him. So Mu’awiyah said: “May my mother be bereaved of me.” This means for the mother to be lost. This is a statement that is said but for which it’s meaning is not intended. Then Mu’awiyah continued to pray. After he finished praying, the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) called him. Mu’awiyah said: “By Allaah, I did not see a teacher better at instructing than him.” May Allaah send His peace and blessings on him. He said: “By Allaah, he was not harsh with me nor did he scold me, he only said: ‘Speaking to people is not correct while in the prayer. It is only for tasbeeh (saying SubhaanAllaah), takbeer (saying Allaahu Akbar) and reciting of the Qur’aan.’” Or it is as he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) even said it to Mu’aadh bin Jabal when he told him: “Shall I not inform you of what controls all of that?” He (i.e. Mu’aadh) said: “Of course O Messenger of Allaah.” He (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Restrain this on yourself.” And he took hold of his tongue, saying: “Restrain this.” So Mu’aadh said: “Will we be held accountable for what we say with it?” He (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “May your mother be bereaved of you O Mu’aadh. What else will cause the people to be dragged on their faces – or he said on their noses – into the Hellfire except for the harvests of their tongues.” Look at the da’wah that is beloved to the souls, which people accept and by which the hearts become open.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We derive from the Fiqh point of benefits of this hadeeth that: Whoever speaks while in prayer, while not knowing that speaking invalidates the prayer, his prayer is still valid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Third Example:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and said: “O Messenger of Allaah, I am ruined!” So he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) asked: “And what caused you to be ruined?” He said: “<strong>I had intercourse with my wife during Ramadaan while I was fasting</strong>.” So the Messenger of Allaah ordered him to free a slave, but he said: “I cannot find one (i.e. unable).” Then he commanded him to fast two consecutive months, but he said; “I am not able to.” Then he commanded him to feed sixty needy people, but he said: “I am not able to.” At this the man sat down. So the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) brought some dates to him saying: “Take this and give it away in charity.” But the man became desirous of the Prophet’s generosity, which was the greatness of kindness shown towards creation. This was since the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) was indeed the most generous of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the man said: “Am I to give this to someone poorer than myself O Messenger of Allaah? By Allaah there is no family poorer than mine between the two lava plains of Madeenah?” At this, the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) laughed to the point that his molar teeth became visible. This was because this man had come in fear, saying: “I am ruined” but yet he left successful. So the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) then said: “Feed your family with it.” So the man left peaceful, prosperous</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and joyful with this religion of Islaam and with this ease from the first Caller to this religion of Islaam, may the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him. [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fourth Example:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let us now look at how the Prophet dealt with one who had committed a sin. The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) once saw a man that had a gold ring on his finger. So the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) seized the ring from him with his noble hand and threw it on the ground. And he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Would any of you intentionally tale a coal of fire and place it on his hand?” So the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) did not treat him the way he treated the people in the first examples. Rather, he snatched it from his hand and threw it at the floor. So when the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) left, it was said to the man: “Take your ring and benefit from it (i.e. by selling it).” The man said: “By Allaah, I will never take a ring that the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) threw away.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaahu Akbar! This was the magnificent way the Companions would execute the Commandments of Allaah and His Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So what is important is that the Caller to Allaah must invite with wisdom, because the one who is ignorant is not like the one who has knowledge. And the one who rejects is not like the one who readily accepts. So for every place there is a saying and for every position there is a condition.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Muḥammad Ibn Ṣāliḥ al-‘Uthaymīn’s Explanation: [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>[10] The selections here are from Ibn al-‘Uthaymīn’s explanation of Riyāḍ al-Ṣāliḥīn. Since the chapter in Riyāḍ al-Ṣāliḥīn where the ḥadīth under discussion appears includes preceding verses of the Quran related to lowering one’s gaze, his explanation of those verses have also been included here for the benefit it contains and its relevancy to this translated work.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The chapter in al-Nawawī’s Riyāḍ al-Ṣāliḥīn (in which the ḥadīth under discussion appears) begins with the following verses.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>&#8220;Tell the believers to lower their gaze.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[Sūrah al-Nūr (24:30)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Looking at non-relative women is forbidden as the author رحمه الله says and that is because Allah commanded that we lower our gaze as He says &#8220;<strong>Tell the believers to lower their gaze and preserve their private parts. That is purer for them. Allah is certainly aware of what you do</strong>.&#8221; He instructs us to lower our gaze and guard our private parts, and this indicates that when someone does not restrain his gaze, that becomes the very means by which he may fail to preserve his private parts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a person is liberal with his eyes, allowing them to roam freely, his heart becomes infatuated with women. He continues to look at them until he may approach a woman, speak to her, carry on a conversation with her, arrange a date with her, and then finally the immorality (of adultery) happens. We seek protection with Allah from this. This is why the look has been called “the messenger” or “delivery” of adultery; it invites to illegal sexual activity, and this is why Allah commands us to lower our gaze.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He عز وجلalso says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>&#8220;He knows the eyes’ deceit and what the breasts conceal&#8221;</strong><br />
[Sūrah al-Ghāfir (40:19)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The &#8220;eyes’ deceit&#8221; is the visions a person’s sight may steal (when looking at impermissible things). In other words, a person may secretly look at something forbidden when people cannot observe him. However, Allah certainly knows what he is doing because &#8220;He knows the eyes’ deceit&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah جل وعلى also knows &#8220;what the breasts conceal&#8221; of both good and bad intentions. He even knows the ideas a person’s own soul may inwardly suggest to him and what he accepts of those suggestions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah تعالى also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>&#8220;Surely the hearing, the sight, and the heart – of each of those one will be questioned&#8221;</strong><br />
[Sūrah al-Isrā (17:36)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A person is accountable for his hearing and will be questioned about it. What did he listen to with his ears? Did he listen to impermissible speech or to a woman, enjoying the sound of her voice? Likewise an individual is accountable for his sight and heart so it is critical that a person safeguards himself (regarding his senses). As for a woman relative or someone to whom it would be forbidden for him to marry anyway, there is no problem with looking at her. He may see her face, her head, her hands, her arms, her legs and feet; there is no problem with any of this unless there is some sort of temptation he fears for himself. If he feels there would be some temptation for him, then he should not even look at women that are religiously considered as his female kin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, if a man had a “sister” because his mother breastfed another girl in infancy who was originally unrelated to him, if such a woman was considered beautiful in his eyes, then looking at her would not be permissible even though a sister of breastfeeding is considered by the religion to be of the same status of an actual, related sister. If he feels some kind of temptation by looking at her, he must then lower his gaze when with her. She must also cover up when she is with him because the origin and purpose behind the ḥijāb (the religious covering) is to prevent temptations. So if she finds some sort of temptation, then she too must cover her face even in front of related men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if there is no such temptation present and a person is chaste with a normal, sound and un-perverted heart, then he is only forbidden to look at nonrelative women not in his immediate family, for example his cousins, his sisters-inlaw, etc. In conclusion, the important point is that a man may look at women religiously considered to be his immediate relatives as long as no sort of temptation is there. As for looking at unrelated women, they are never permissible for him to look at.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following ḥadīth, with the wording from Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim, is the one mentioned in Riyāḍ al-Ṣāliḥīn (and the same one mentioned on pg. 2-3 of this work).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abū Hurayrah رضي الله عنه narrated that the prophet صلّى الله عليه وسلّم said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It has been written upon the Son of Adam his share of adultery which he will indulge in; there is no escaping it. The two eyes, their adultery is looking (at what is forbidden). The two ears, their adultery is listening. The tongue, its adultery is speaking. The hand, its adultery is the touching, and the foot, its adultery is walking (toward adultery). The heart desires and hopes (for adultery) but the private parts either confirm that or deny it. » which he will indulge in; there is no escaping it « means every individual will carry out and realize his inevitable share of adultery, and there is no escape from it unless Allah protects him from doing so.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet صلّى الله عليه وسلّم then mentioned some examples such as,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>» The two eyes, their adultery is looking « When a man looks at unrelated women, even if it is without desire, it is a form of adultery – adultery of the eye.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>» The two ears, their adultery is listening « A man may listen to a woman speaking and become moved by her voice; this is the adultery of the ear. Similarly,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>» The hand, its adultery is the touching « which is anything physically done with the hand like touching or similar physical actions.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>» the foot, its adultery is walking « and this includes when someone walks to any place wherein immorality and sexual activity is being committed. It could also be when a man hears a woman’s voice and he walks over to her or sees a woman whom he then approaches. These are all types of adultery – adultery of the foot.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>» The heart desires « and may be inclined toward adultery, becoming infatuated with women and this is the adultery of the heart.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>» but the private parts either confirm that or deny it « In other words, if a person commits adultery with his private parts—we seek protection with Allah from that—he has then actualized the adultery of all his other senses and limbs. In contrast, if he does not commit adultery with his private part, choosing instead to safeguard and preserve himself, he then denies his other senses their forms of adultery.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This ḥadīth shows the extreme caution required to prevent one’s heart from being attached to women. A man must avoid becoming obsessed with their voices, looking at them, touching them, or approaching them. He has to prevent his own heart’s infatuation with the allure of women as all of these are types of adultery, and we seek protection from Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every individual of sound intellect and chastity must beware and take precautions to ensure nothing of his senses or body parts become obsessed with women. Anytime a person senses himself being allured to any of that, he must retreat and keep far away (from actualizing any forms of adultery) because Satan courses through the Son of Adam like blood runs through him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, the initial glance can be a poisonous arrow from Iblīs. For example, a man may glance at a woman while unconcerned with her at first sight. However, with the second look then the third he finds his heart becoming attached to her, Allah forbid. He may become so in love with that woman that he thinks of nothing but her. Standing, sitting, when he sleeps and when he wakes up, he thinks of her. And this is how the evil and temptation begins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah for wellbeing and all success is from Him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Sixth : Menses &amp; Legal Sexual Intercourse</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is prohibited for a husband to have sexual intercourse with his menstruating wife, and it is not allowed for her to make it possible for him. Allah (Azza wa Jal) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{ويسألونك عن المحيض قُل هُوَ أذًى فاعتَزِلُوا النِّساءَ في المَحيض ولا تقربوهُنَّ حتى يطْهُرن }</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Surah Al-Baqarah 2:222]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;They ask you concerning menstruation. Say: that is an Adha (a harmful thing for a husband to have a sexual intercourse with his wife while she is having her menses), therefore keep away from women during menses and go not unto them till they have been purified (from menses and have taken a bath).&#8221;</strong> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 222).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Menses here refers to the period of menstruation and the private part of the woman is the prohibited place. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم) said: &#8220;<strong>Do everything except sexual intercourse</strong>.&#8221; [40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Muslims had Ijmaa&#8217; prohibiting sexual intercourse with a menstruating woman. It is not permissible for anyone who believes in Allah and in the Day of Judgment to practice this act. Anyone who does this then he had disobeyed Allah and His Messenger and followed a path other than the believers path [41].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related that Imam Ash-Shaafiee&#8217; had said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>Anyone who does such an act then he had committed a Great Sin</strong>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Other scholars of the same school said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>Anyone who sees it permissible to have sexual intercourse with a menstruating woman then a decree of his Kufr (rejection of Faith) should be made</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In order to break the intensity of sexual desire, it is permissible (and praise is due to Allah) to kiss, hug and fondle a menstruating woman in places other than her private parts. It is important, however, that the husband does not approach the area between the knees and the navel without laying a cover sheet as &#8216;Aisha ( رضي الله عنها) explained:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;He (صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم) used to order me to put an Izar (dress worn below the waist) and used to fondle me (during her menses)&#8221;</strong> [42].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[40] Saheeh Muslim (English) V 1. P.175, Hadeeth # 592.<br />
[41] Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) warns saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{ ومن يُشاققِ الرَّسول من بَعدِ ما تبينَ لهُ الهُدى ويتَّبِعُ غيرَ سبيل المؤمنين نُوَلِّهِ ما تَولَّى ونصلِهِ جَهَنَّم وساءتْ مَصيراً }<br />
&#8211; Surah an-Nisa 115</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger (Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم)) after the Right Path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers&#8217; way, We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell;&#8211;what an evil destination.&#8221;</strong> (Qur&#8217;an 4: 115)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter Six<br />
Nifass And Its Rulings</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Nifass</strong>: is the bleeding due to delivery by a pregnant woman. It may occur with delivery, after delivery (post-natal) or before delivery (by two or three days coupled to contractions).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shayekh Al-Islam Ibn Taymeeyah said: &#8220;The blood seen when the woman starts her contractions is Nifass and it is not limited to two or three days. These contractions are followed by delivery or otherwise the released blood is not Nifass&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars differed as to whether there is a limit on its duration. Shayekul Islam Ibn Taymeeyah said: &#8220;Nifass has no limit on the duration of its shorter or longer periods. Assuming that a woman sees a flowing of blood for more than forty, sixty, or seventy days and then the blood flow stops. This kind of bleeding is Nifass. Suppose, however, that the bleeding continues, then a limit of forty days is set as Nifass because this period is the common period encountered by most women&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This author said: &#8220;based upon the above, if the bleeding of a woman continues beyond forty days and if there are signs that indicate that it will come to a stop (based upon previous pregnancies or some other signs), then she should wait until the blood flow stops. If none of these signs are encountered by a woman, then she cleans herself (bath) upon the completion of forty days considering it the reference period for most women. On the other hand, if upon the completion of her forty days she gets her normal menses then she should wait until it ends. If the blood continues after her regular menses ends, then she is a Mustahadah and should apply the rules of Istihadah&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the Nifass bleeding stops before the forty day-reference period and she becomes clean, then she should take a bath, pray, fast and she may engage in sexual intercourse with her husband. The stopping of the flow of blood for less than a day does not qualify her to be clean (as mentioned in Al-Mughnee).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nifass is not confirmed unless the woman delivers a human being with clear features. If a small body is delivered but clearly does not show the developed features of a human being, then the associated bleeding is not Nifass and it is considered as Irq blood (blood from a blood vessel). The least period for which a human form can develop is eighty days starting from the day of conception and most often it is ninety days. Al-Mujid Ibn Taymeeyah [57] said: &#8220;If she sees blood coupled to contractions prior to the 80/90-days she should not give it any consideration (i.e., she continues to pray and fast) but if she sees blood after this period she should then refrain from praying and fasting. If, however, she delivers her load and the new born has developed human features, then her bleeding (prior the 80/90 days) should be considered as Nifass and she should correct for her missed prayers and fasting. If on the other hand the newborn does not show developed human features then her bleeding should still not to be considered as Nifass and does not have to make up for her prayers and fasting.&#8221;</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">The Laws of Nifass</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The laws of Nifass are the same as the laws governing menses, except in the following cases:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) <strong>The Idda is not related to Nifass, but rather to the rules of divorce</strong>. For example: if Talaq (divorce) was declared prior to delivery, then the Idda ends upon delivery and is not related to the Nifass period. If Talaq was declared after delivery, she waits for the return of her menses and accordingly calculates her Idda as explained earlier.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) <strong>The period of Eelaa&#8217;</strong>. The Eelaa&#8217; is when the husband makes an oath to indefinitely (or for more than four months) not to have sexual intercourse with his wife. If his wife demands sexual intercourse, a period of four months starting from the day he took his oath, will be set. If this period is completed he will be ordered (by a Muslim Judge) either to perform sexual intercourse with his wife or request of separation by his wife will be fulfilled. Nifass will not be counted against the Eelaa&#8217; period. An increment equal to the period needed for the wife&#8217;s Tahara from Nifass will be added towards the Eelaa&#8217; period. This is in contrast with menses (Haid), whereby its period is counted against the Eelaa&#8217; period.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) <strong>Puberty</strong>: It is clear that Nifass is related to pregnancy. A woman cannot get pregnant before she has her own sexual secretions. Haid (and not Nifass) indicates that puberty had been reached.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4) <strong>What if the flow of Nifass blood stops before the forty days period and then resumes on the fortyth day?</strong> In contrast with Haid blood [58], the state of this resumption is considered to be &#8220;doubtful&#8221; according to famous sayings by the Hanabilah scholars. She, according to them, must fast and pray on time . All that which is forbidden on the Haa&#8217;id is forbidden on her, except obligatory acts. She must compensate all that which the Haa&#8217;id must compensate for. This author, however, is with the opinion that: &#8220;If the blood resumes within a period that may be a Nifass period, then her blood is Nifass blood. If not, then it is a Haid blood unless it continues to flow and it will then be an Istihadah blood. This opinion is close to that reported in Al-Mughnee (V.1, P. 349) in which it is mentioned that Imam Malik have said: &#8220;If she sees blood two or three days after its flow had stopped, then it is Nifass blood or otherwise it is a Haid blood.&#8221; This is also the choice of Shayekul Islam Ibn Taymeeyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Realistically, there can be no &#8220;doubt&#8221; about blood. It is, however, a relative matter in which peoples&#8217; opinions may vary depending upon their knowledge and understanding. The Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) are sources of clarification for everything. Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) did not make it mandatory for someone to fast twice or make Tawaff twice except when there is something done wrong during the performance of these acts for the first time and that it cannot be corrected without actually making it up. However, in the case when someone performs a certain act to the best of his/her ability then he/she is relieved from any responsibility as Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">( { لا يُكَلِّفُ الله نفساً إلاَّ وُسعَها } (البقرة، 286<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope&#8221;</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 286)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">( { فاتَّقوا الله ما استَطَعتُم } (التغابن، 16<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;So keep your duty to Allah as much as you can&#8221;</strong> </span>(Qur&#8217;an 64: 16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5) <strong>What about sexual intercourse with a woman who becomes clean prior to the forty days-reference period of Nifass?</strong> In the case of the Haa&#8217;id, sexual intercourse is permissible if she becomes clean prior to her &#8220;normal&#8221; duration of her cycle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the case of Nifass and in accordance with the well known opinion of the Hanbali school of thought, sexual intercourse is disliked. The right opinion, however, is that it is not disliked and this is also the saying of the majority of Muslim Scholars, because to make something disliked requires a supporting evidence from Islamic Law. In this case there is no evidence except that which Imam Ahmad related: &#8220;the wife of Uthman the son of Abi Al-&#8216;Aass approached him before the end of the forty -day period and he told her: &#8216;do not!'&#8221;. This does not necessitate that he disliked what she did because it is possible that he was acting cautiously being afraid that she was not certain that she was Tahira (clean from Nifass) or that bleeding may be re-activated following intercourse with her or for some other reason- and Allah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">by Shaykh Allaama Muhammad bin Salih al-Uthaymeen (d.1421 A.H.)<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Getting married with the intention of divorce is <em>Haraam</em> because it is cheating the wife and her family</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Esteemed Shaykh Muhammad bin Salih al-Uthaymeen may Allaah have mercy upon him was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">A person wanted to travel outside this country because he had been delegated to do so, and he wanted to protect himself by getting married from that country for a specific time, then after that he will divorce this wife, he would have married her without informing her that he will divorce her, so what is the verdict regarding his action?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Shaykh answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This marriage with the intention of divorce is of two situations: either he makes it a condition in the contract, that he marries her for a month or a year, or until he completes his studies, then this is a marriage of <em>Muta’</em> (temporary marriage) and this is <em>Haraam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or either, he intends that without making it a condition, so what is well-known from the <em>Madhab</em> of the Hanabila, that this is <em>Haraam</em>, and that the marriage contract is invalid because they say that the one who makes this intention is similar to the one who makes a condition (i.e. specific period of time), due to the saying of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed actions are but by intentions and indeed every person will have what they intended.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a man marries a woman from someone who has pronounced a divorce from her three times, and he marries her to make her <em>Halaal</em> for her previous husband so he can re-marry her, and then he divorces for this reason then this type of  <em>Nikah</em> (Marriage contract) is invalid, even if this <em>Nikah</em> was without the condition of divorcing her, since the one who makes the intention of doing this is like the one who makes it a condition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, if getting married with the intention of making the wife permissible for her previous husband invalidates the marriage contract then the intention of <em>Muta’</em> also invalidates the marriage contract,  this is the opinion of the Hanabila.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second opinion of the people of knowledge regarding this issue is: that it is correct for a man to marry a woman and he has the intention to divorce her, if he leaves that  country, like those foreigners who go abroad for education, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their reasoning is that the man has not made a condition (of a specific period of time), and the difference between this and <em>Muta’</em> is, that in <em>Muta’</em> if the time period finishes then a separation takes place between the husband and wife, whether the husband likes it or not, this is contradictory to the other way, since it is possible for him to want and have interest in the wife and she continues to remain with him, and this is one of the two sayings of Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What I say is, that this is correct, it is not <em>Muta’</em> since the definition of <em>Muta’</em> (temporary marriage) cannot be applied to this, but marriage with the intention of divorce is <em>Haraam</em> from the angle that it is cheating the wife and her family.   Indeed the Prophet has made cheating and deception  <em>Haraam</em>, and if the wife came to know that this man did not want to marry her except for this period of time, she would not have married him, and her family would also not marry her to him since the man would not allow his daughter to marry a person who has the intention of divorcing her when he has finished with his need from her, so how can this man allow for himself to deal with others with that which he does not allow for them to deal with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This contradicts <em>Eemaan</em>, due to the saying of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘None of you truly believe until you love for your brother what you love for yourself.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since I have heard that some people have taken this verdict as a means which leads to a matter that no-one holds permissible which is that some people travel to countries only to get married (temporarily). They go to these countries so they can get married and then they stay with this wife, whom they marry with the intention of a temporary period, then they return however long Allaah wills.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is also seriously forbidden in this issue, so it is better to close this door, due to what is there from cheating, deception and dishonesty and because this opens the door and the people are ignorant, and most people are not prevented due to following their desires, transgressing against what Allaah has made <em>Haraam</em>.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Compiled &amp; Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Hadeeth</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Abu Hurairah who said the Messenger of Allaah<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>-SallAllaahu alayhi wa Sallam-</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">صنفان من أهل النار لم أرهما قوم معهم سياط كأذناب البقر يضربون بها الناس ونساء كاسيات عاريات مميلات مائلات رءوسهن كأسنمة البخت المائلة لا يدخلن الجنة ولا يجدن ريحها وإن ريحها ليوجد من مسيرة كذا وكذا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There are two types of the people of the Hell-Fire who I have not seen, a people who have whips like cows’ tails with which they are hitting the people, and women who will be naked in spite of being dressed, who are seduced (to wrong paths) and seduce others, their heads will be high like a camel with humps they will not enter Paradise, nor will they find its fragrance, even though its fragrance can be found from travelling such and such distance.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Imam Ahmad in ‘al-Musnad’ &amp; Muslim in ‘as-Saheeh’]<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Allaama, Muhadith</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Muhammad Nasir Deen al-Albaani<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></strong><strong>– May Allaah have mercy upon him.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Questioner:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">‘What is the ruling of a woman gathering her hair above her neck at the back of the head whereby it is shaped like a ball, taking into consideration that when a woman covers herself with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Hijaab</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>the shape of her hair would be apparent from her<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Hijaab</em>?’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Albaani said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This is a mistake many women who wear<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Hijaab</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>fall into, whereby they gather their hair at the back of the head and it bulges out from the back of their head, even though they have covered it with covering<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Hijaab</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>over it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed this opposes a condition from the conditions of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Hijaab</em>, which I had gathered in my book ‘<em>Hijaab Al-Marata Al-Muslimah min Al-Kitab wa Sunnah</em>‘. From these conditions is that the clothing should not show the shape of the limb or anything from the woman’s body,  this is why it is not permissible for a woman to put her hair in a circular shape at the back of her head or at the side of her head whereby it bulges out, so that it appears to the one who sees her, even unintentionally that she has shaggy hair or that she has little hair.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory that it is left hanging and not piled up/crumpled up.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From the cassette collection ‘Silsilah al-Huda wa Noor’ No.386, see<a href="http://albanyimam.com/play.php?catsmktba=13094" rel="nofollow">http://albanyimam.com/play.php?catsmktba=13094</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Ruling of  a Woman Winding up her Hair at the Top of her head</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Allaama</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Muhammad bin Salih al-Uthaymeen – May Allaah have mercy upon him.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">‘Some women gather their hair in the shape of a bun at the back of the head,  does this enter into the warning mentioned in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Hadeeth</em>: ‘Women whose  heads will be like the inclined hump of a camel they will not enter Paradise’.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Uthaymeen said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If a woman gathers her hair for when she is busy working away, then afterwards she lets it down,  then there is no harm in this, since she does not do this as an adornment or beautification but rather out of necessity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for gathering her hair and raising it up for the purpose of beautification, and it is facing upwards then it enters under the prohibition, due to the saying of the Prophet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>-sallAllahu alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Their heads will be like the hump of a camel.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A camel hump is at the top, and if the hair is above the neck then it does not enter under the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Hadeeth</em>. However, it is warned against doing so if a woman wants to go out to the market, since if she goes out to the market and gathers her hair on her head then it will appear from within her<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Abaya</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>(outer garment), and it will cause attention, so she is prohibited from having this hair-style if she goes out to the market places.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q. 504. After completing his &#8216;Umrah, a man found some filth in his Ihram garments; what is the ruling on this?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. If a person performed Tawaf and Say for &#8216;Umrah, and after that, he found some filth in his Ihram garments, then his Tawaf is valid, his Say is valid and his &#8216;Umrah is valid. This is because if a person has some filth on his garment, and he does not know about it, or he knew about it but he forgot to wash it, and then he prayed in that garment, then his prayer is valid. Similarly, if he made Tawaf in this garment, then his Tawaf is valid. The evidence for that is the Saying of Allah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error&#8221;</strong> [Al-Baqarah 2:286]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This evidence is general, and it is considered a great rule from among the rules of Islamic Law. There is a specific evidence in the matter, and that is that one day, the Messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه و سلم) led his Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, in prayer and it was his practice to pray in his shoes, but he removed his shoes and the people removed their shoes too. After he had finished praying, he said to them: What was wrong with you?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: &#8220;We saw you removing your shoes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8220;Jibril came to me and informed me that there was something harmful or some dirt on them&#8221;  [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is, some impurity. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not repeat the prayer, even though at the beginning of his prayer, he had worn shoes on which there was some impurity. This proves that if a person prayed in a garment in which there was impurity due to forgetfulness or ignorance, his prayer is valid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a question here: If a person eats camel meat and he stands up and prays without performing ablution, believing that he had eaten mutton, should he repeat his prayer if he found out? We say: He should repeat the prayer after performing ablution. If someone asked: Why do you say that a person who prayed in a polluted garment due to ignorance should not repeat the prayer, while one who eats camel meat due to ignorance, should repeat it? We say: Because we have a useful and important rule, which is, commands are not cancelled due to ignorance or forgetfulness, whereas prohibitions are cancelled due to ignorance and forgetfulness. The evidence for this rule is the saying of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Whoever slept through a prayer or forgot it, he must offer it as soon as he remembers it.&#8221;</strong> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when he made the Taslim after performing two Rak&#8217;at in one of his afternoon prayers and he forgot the remainder of the prayer, he completed it when he remembered it. This is an evidence that those things which are commanded are not cancelled due to forgetfulness, because the Prophet ordered the one who forgot his prayer to offer it as soon as he remembers it, and the obligation to pray it was not removed due to forgetfulness. Also, he completed the prayer and he did not cancel the remainder of it due to forgetfulness. The proof that commands are not cancelled due to ignorance, is that a man came and offered a prayer in which he was not at rest, then he came to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and greeted him and he said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Go back and offer prayer for you have not prayed.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He repeated it three times and the man kept praying and coming to him, but he would say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Go back and offer prayer, for you have not prayed.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">until the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) taught him to pray correctly. So,this man abandoned an obligatory act due to ignorance, because he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;By Him Who sent you with the truth, I cannot pray better than this, so teach me.&#8221; If an obligation was cancelled due to ignorance, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) would have excused him; and this rule is important and beneficial for the seeker of knowledge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise and thanks are to Allah, the Lord of the worlds, and I send prayers and blessings on our Prophet, Muhammad and upon all his family and Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>How Should a Person Pray in an Airplane?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 . He should offer the voluntary prayers in an airplane while he is sitting in his seat in whatever direction the airplane was facing, indicating the bowing and prostrating (by inclining his head), making the prostration lower than the bowing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. He should not offer the obligatory prayers in an airplane, unless he is able to face towards the Qiblah throughout the whole of the prayer and he is also able to bow, prostrate, stand and sit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. If he is unable to do that, he should delay the prayer until he lands at the airport and then pray on the ground. If he fears that the time for the prayer will expire before the airplane lands, he should delay it until the time of the next prayer. This is the case if it is one of those prayers that may be combined with another, such as Zuhr with &#8216;Asr or Maghrib with &#8216;Isha&#8217;. If he fears that the time for the next prayer will expire, he should pray them both in the airplane before the time ends and perform whatever conditions, pillars and obligations of the prayer he is able to. For example: If the airplane took off just before sunset and the sun set while he was in the air, then he should not offer the Maghrib prayer until the airplane lands at the airport, he disembarks, and then prays on the ground. But if he fears that the time for offering the Maghrib prayer will expire, he should delay it until the time of &#8216;Isha&#8217; and offer them both together, combining them and delaying the Maghrib prayer until the time of the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer after he descends. But if he fears that the time for the isha prayer will expire &#8211; and it expires at midnight &#8211; he should offer them before the time expires in the airplane.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The manner of performing the obligatory prayer in the airplane is to stand facing the Qiblah and make the Takbir. Then he recites Sural Al-Fatihah and the words which it is prescribed to recite before it, such as the opening supplication (Du&#8217;a Al- Istiftah) and some Qur&#8217;anic Verses after it. Then he should bow, then straighten up from bowing, and relax in a standing position, then prostrate, then straighten up from prostration, and relax in a sitting position, then prostrate again, then do likewise in the remainder of the prayer. If he is unable to prostrate, he should sit and indicate the prostration while sitting, and if he does not know the Qiblah, and no one reliable can inform him of it, he should use his judgement and try to ascertain it, then pray according to his judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. The prayer of the traveller in an airplane is shortened, so he performs the four Rak&#8217;ah prayer as two Rak&#8217;ahs like other travellers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#993300;">How Should a Person Who is Travelling by Airplane Assume Ihram for Hajj and &#8216;Umrah?</span></p>
<p>1 . He should perform Ghusl in his house and remain in his normal clothing, or if he wishes, he may don the garments of Ihram.</p>
<p>2. Once the airplane is close to passing over the starting point, he should don the garments of Ihram, if he has not done so already.</p>
<p>3. When the airplane passes over the starting point, he should make the intention for commencing the rites and say the Talbiyyah according to his intention either Hajj or &#8216;Umrah.</p>
<p>4. If he assumes Ihram before passing over the starting point as a precaution, being fearful of remissness or forgetfulness, then there is no objection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a very regrettable thing with regard to this matter which is the carelessness of some women concerning travelling by airplane without a Mahram.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are very negligent in this matter: One finds women travelling by airplane alone, and their <strong>justification</strong> for doing this is that they say that her Mahram escorted her in the airport from which the airplane took off and the other Mahram will meet her in the airport at which the airplane lands, and that in the airplane she is safe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This justification is weak in reality, because the Mahram who accompanies her does not admit her onto the airplane, he only admits her to the departure lounge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It may also be that the airplane is delayed in taking off and so this woman remains lost, or the airplane might take off and then be unable to land at the intended airport due to some reason or another, and so it lands at some other place, else and so this woman will be lost. Or, the airplane might land at the intended airport, but the Mahram who is supposed to meet her does not arrive due to one reason or another, such as illness, sleep or a car accident which prevents him from getting there, or something else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even if all of these things did not happen, and the airplane landed at the correct time of arrival and the Mahram who was supposed to meet her was present, there might be some man sitting next to her on the airplane who does not fear Allah, the Most High and does not respect the worshippers of Allah, and he might be attracted to her and she to him, which might lead to Fitnah (temptation, trial) and unlawful deeds, as is well known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is incumbent upon a woman to fear Allah, the Almighty, the All-Powerful and not to travel except with a Mahram. It is also incumbent upon women&#8217;s male guardians whom Allah has made protectors and maintainers of women to fear Allah, the Almighty, the Ail-Powerful, and to avoid being negligent to those they are Mahrim for, and losing their zeal and their religion, for a person is responsible for his family. Because Allah, the Most High has made them a trust for him; He, the Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O you believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey not, (from executing) the Commands they receive from Allah, but do that which they are commanded.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Ruling on Speaking while the Quraan is being Recited from a tape/CD/recorder</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is the legislative ruling for talking during the recitation of the Qur&#8217;an in general gatherings, like if the Qur&#8217;an is recited from a tape and a group of people are talking, what is the ruling on this action?</span></p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih Al-‘Uthaymeen:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Most High states, {<strong><span style="color:#008000;">So when the Qur&#8217;an is recited, then listen to it and give it due attention so that you may receive mercy</span></strong>}. [Soorah Al-‘Araaf: 204]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, if we have a recorder playing the sound of a reciter (while we are talking); either we turn off the recorder or we listen to him. However. remaining in our chatter and talking as if we only hear the sounds of humans, then this is contrary to having manners with the Quran.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So here I say, that either we turn off the recorder or listen to it. Even if one of them was listening and the others continued to chat, then that one individual lowers the sound so that no one hears it except him.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Translated by Mikail ibn Mahboob Ariff حفظه الله<br />
Video Courtesy: Bilal Nahim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question [Reader]:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Someone with a question is saying: Esteemed Shaikh, I miss the Fajr prayer often, and I don&#8217;t pray [it] except after sunrise at the time I want to go to work. And this matter might happen again and again, so is there any [sin] upon me? And What should I do in order to stick to my prayer on time?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih Al-‘Uthaymeen:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do a number of things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The first thing</strong> </span>is that you sleep early. That you sleep early. And it is for this reason the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam used to hate [one&#8217;s] sleeping before Eshaa’ and enganging in discussions after it so that a person may go to sleep early in order to wake up early. This is one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Second</span> </strong>is that you have an intention at the time of going to sleep. a resolve, and determination that you are going to wake up for Fajr prayer. Then waking up will be easy for you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Third</span> </strong>is that you use an alarm clock you put by your head that sets off an alarm for you. And if you&#8217;re afraid that when it goes off, you&#8217;ll switch it off, turn off the sound, and keep sleeping, keep it away from you a bit. And someone, out of concern for the prayer, would put the alarm clock in a tin can [words unclear] and keep it at a distance from himself, so that it would have a powerful sound, so he would wake up. Do this. There&#8217;s nothing prohibiting [it].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this weren&#8217;t easy for you, put a telephone by your head, if you have a telephone, and tell one of your brothers, &#8220;When the Adhaan for Fajr is given, give me a ring.&#8221; What&#8217;s important is that a person can do things which result in his waking up so that he can perform Fajr in its time. And one who makes laziness a habit for himself will remain upon laziness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(voices too faint to hear requesting further clarification from the Shaikh)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for prayer in other than its time, if one intended [that], then the prayer is not accepted. It is rejected from him, even if he were to pray it a thousand times, due to the saying of the Prophet , Whoever does an act that is not under our legislation, it will be rejected,“ meaning it is returned back to him [unaccepted].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant you good. The questioner from Yemen, Hasan Saalih asks, &#8216;Regarding the day of &#8216;Eid, Eid al Fitr or &#8216;Eid al Adha, if it coincides with the day of al Jumu&#8217;ah, what are the legislative rulings concerning this?</p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Muhammad bin Saalih Al-‘Uthaymeen:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the &#8216;Eid coincides with al-Jumu&#8217;ah, whether it be &#8216;Eid al Fitr or Eid al Adha, then it is obligatory that the &#8216;Eid prayer is prayed and that Jumu&#8217;ah is prayed. Then it is said to whoever prayed &#8216;Eid prayer and was not the imam, if he wishes he may pray Jumu&#8217;ah or if he wishes he may pray Dhuhr in his home instead. This is the summary of the issue.</p>
