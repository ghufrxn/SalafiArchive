She came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and (informed him about it). Thereupon, he (the Holy Prophet) said: Did you squeeze it? She said: Yes.

He then went in and (later on) came out and then after that offered the sunset and night prayers together and then said: God willing, you would reach by tomorrow the fountain of Tabuk and you should not come to that until it is dawn, and he who amongst you happens to go there should not touch its water until I come. We came to that and two persons (amongst) us reached that fountain ahead of us. It was a thin flow of water like the shoelace. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) asked them whether they had touched the water. They said: Yes. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) scolded them, and he said to them what he had to say by the will of God. The people then took water of the fountain in their palms until it became somewhat significant and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) washed his hands and his face too in it, and then, took it again in that (fountain) and there gushed forth abundant water from that fountain, until all the people drank to their fill. He then said: Mu&#8217;adh, it is hoped that if you live long you would see its water irrigating well the gardens.</p>

So we proceeded on until we came to Tabuk and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: The violent storm will overtake you during the night, so none amongst you should stand up and he who has a camel with him should hobble it firmly. A violent storm blew and a person who had stood up was carried away by the storm and thrown between the mountains of Tayy. Then the messenger of the son of al &#8216;Alma&#8217;, the ruler of Aila, came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) with a letter and a gift of a white mule. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) wrote him (the reply) and presented him a cloak. We came back until we halted in the Wadi al-Qura. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) asked that lady about her garden and the price of the fruits in that. She said: Ten wasqs. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: I am going to depart, and he who amongst you wishes may depart with me but he who wants to stay may stay. We resumed the journey until we came to the outskirts of Medina. (It was at this time) that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: This is Taba, this is Uhud, that is a mountain which loves us and we love it, and then said: The best amongst the houses of the Ansar is the house of Bani Najjar. Then the house of Bani Abd al-Ashhal, then the house of Bani Abd al-Harith b. Khazraj, then the house of Bani Sa&#8217;ida, and there is goodness in all the houses of the Ansar. Said b. Ubada came to us and Abu Usaid said to him: Did you not see that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has declared the houses of the Ansar good and he has kept us at the end. Said met Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, you have declared the house of the Ansar as good and have kept us at the end, whereupon he said: Is it not enough for you that you have been counted amongst the good.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Uqba b. &#8216;Amir reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) one day went out and he offered prayer over the martyrs of Uhud just as prayer is offered over the dead. He then came back and sat on pulpit and said: I shall be present there (at the Cistern) before you. I shall be your witness and, by Allah, I perceive as if I am seeing with my own eyes my Cistern at this very state and I have been given the keys of the treasures of the earth or the keys of the earth and, by Allah, I am not afraid concerning you that you would associate anything (with Allah after me), but I am afraid that you would be vying with one another (for the possession of) the treasures of the earth.</p>

I am not afraid that you would associate anything with Allah after me, but I am afraid that you may be (allured) by the world and (vie) with one another (in possessing material wealth) and begin killing one another, and you would be destroyed as were destroyed those who had gone before you. &#8216;Uqba said that that was the last occasion that he saw Allah&#8217;s Massenger on the pulpit.</p>

He had come in a land inhabited by haughty and cruel men along with Sara. She was very good-looking amongst the people, so he said to her: If these were to know that you are my wife they would snatch you away from me, so if they ask you tell that you are my sister and in fact you are my sister in Islam, and I do not know of any other Muslim in this land besides I and you. And when they entered that land the tyrants came to see her and said to him (the king): &#8216;there comes to your land a woman, whom you alone deserve to possess, so he (the kings sent someone (towards her) and she was brought and Ibrahim (peace be upon him) stood in preyer, and when she visited him (the tyrant king came) he could help but stretch his hand towards her and his hand was tied up. He said: Supplicate Allah so that He may release my hand and I will do no harm to you. She did that and the man repeated (the same highhandedness) and his hand was again tied up more tightly than on the first occasion and he said to her like that and she again did that (supplicated), but he repeated (the same highhandedness and his hands were tied up more tightly than on the previous occasion). He then again said: Supplicate your Lord so that He may set my hand free; by. @ llah I shall do no harm to you. She did and his hand was freed. Then he called the person who had brought her and said to him: You have brought to me the satan and you have not brought to me a human being, so turn them out from my land, and he gave Hajira as a gift to her. She returned (along with Hajira) and when Ibrahim (peace be upon him) saw her, he said: How have you returned? She said: With full safety (have I returned). Allah held the hand of that debauch and he gave me a maid-servant. Abu Hiaraira said: O sons of the rain of the sky, she is your mother.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa&#8217;id b. jubair reported: I said to Ibn Abbas that Nauf al-Bikali was of the opinion that Moses (peace be upon him), the Apostle of Bani Isra&#8217;il, was not the same who accompanied Khadir, whereupon he said: The enemy of Allah tells a lie. I heard Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b say: Moses (peace be upon him) stood up to give sermon to the people of Isra&#8217;il. He was asked as to who amongst the people has the best knowledge, whereupon he said: I have the best knowledge. Thereupon Allah was annoyed with him that he did not attribute (the best knowledge) to Him. He revealed to him: A servant amongst My servants is at the junction of two rivers who has more knowledge than yours. Moses said: How can I meet him? It was said to him: Carry a fish in the large basket and the place where you find it missing there you will find him. Thereupon Moses proceeded forth along with a young man (Yusha&#8217;). Joshua b. Nan and Moses (peace be upon him) put the fish in the basket and there went along with him the young man (Yusha&#8217;) until they came to a certain rock and Moses and his companion went to sleep and the fish stirred in that basket and fell into the ocean and Allah stopped the current of water like a vault until the way was made for the fish. Moses and his youn. companion were astonished and they walked for the rest of the day and the night and the friend of Moses forgot to inform him of this incident. When it was morning, Moses (peace be upon him) said to the young man: Bring for us the breakfast for we are dead tired because of this journey, and they did not feel exhausted until they had passed that place where they had been commanded (to stay). He said: Don&#8217;t you know that when we reached the Sakhra (rock) I forgot the fisii and noth ng made me forget it but the satan that I. could nit remember it? How strange is it that the fish found a way in the river? Moses said: That was what we had been aiming at. Then both of them retraced their steps until they reached Sakhra; there they saw a man covered with a cloth. Moses greeted him. Khadir said to him: Where is as-Salam in our country.? He said: I am Moses, whereupon he (Khadir) said: You mean the Moses of Bani Isra&#8217;il? He said: Yes. He (Khadir) said: You have a knowledge out of the knowledge of Allah which in fact Allah imparted to you and about that I know nothing and I have knowledge out of Allah&#8217;s knowledge which He imparted to me and about that you do not know. Moses (peace be upon him) said to him: May I follow you so that you may teach me that with which you have been taught righteousness. He said: You will not be able to bear with me; how you will be able to bear that about which you do not know? Moses said: Thou wilt find me patient, nor shalt I disobey you in aught. Khadir said to him: If you were to follow me, then do not ask me about anything until I myself speak to you about it. He said: Yes. So Khadir and Moses set forth on the bank of the river that there came before them a boat. Both of theni talked to them (the owners of the boat) so that they might carry both of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They had recognised Khadir and they carried them free. Khadir thereupon took hold of a plank in the boat and broke it away. Moses said: These people have carried us without any charge and you attempt to break their boat so that the people sailing in the boat may drown. This is (something) grievous that you have done. He said: Did I not say that you would not bear with me? He said: Blame me not for what I forgot and be not hard upon what I did. Then both of them got down from the boat and began to walk along the coastline that they saw a boy who had been playing with other boys. Khadir pulled up his head and killed him. Moses said: Have you killed an innocent person who is in no way guilty of slaying another? You have done something horrible. Thereupon he said: Did I not say to you that you will not be able to bear with me? He (Moses) said: This (act) is more grievous than the first one. He (Moses) further said. If I ask you about anything after this, keep not company with me, then you would no doubt find (a plausible) excuse for this. Then they both walked on until they reached the inhabitants of a village. They asked its inhabitants for food but they refused to entertain them as their guests. They found in it a wall which had been bent on one side and was about to fall. Khadir set it right with his own hand. Moses, said to him: It is the people to whom we came but they showed us no hospitality and they did not serve us food. If you wish you can get wages for it. He (Khadir) said: This is the parting of ways between mt and you. Now I wish to reveal to you the significance of that for which you could not bear with me. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said. May Allah have mercy upon Moses! I wish if Moses could show patience and a (fuller) story of both of them could have been told. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said that the first thing which Moses said was out of forgetfulness. Then there came a sparrow until it perched on the wall of the boat and took water from the ocean. Thereupon, Khadir said: My knowledge and your knowledge in comparison with the knowledge of Allah is even less than the water taken by the sparrow in its beak in comparison to the water of the ocean, and Sa&#8217;id b. jubair used to recite (verses 79 and 80 of Sura Kahf) in this way: There was before them a king who used to seize every boat by force which was in order, the boy was an unbeliever.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Book 030, Number 5865:</p>
<p><em><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="030.5865"></a></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="030.5865"></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa, id b. jubair reported that it was said to Ibn &#8216;Abbas that Nauf al-Bikali was of the opinion that Moses who went in search of knowledge was not the Moses of Bani Isra&#8217;il. He said: Sa&#8217;id, did you hear it from him? I said: Yes. Thereupon he said that Nauf had not stated the fact. Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b narrated to us that he had heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Moses had been delivering sermons to his people. And he made this remark: No person upon the earth has better knowledge than I or nothing better than mine. Thereupon Allah revealed to him: I know one who is better than you (in knowledge) or there is a person on the earth having more knowledge than you. Thereupon he said: My Lord, direct me to him. It was said to him: Keep a salted fish as a provision for journey. The place where that fish would be lost (there you will find that man). So he set forth and a young slave along with him until they came to a place Sakhra. but he did not find any clue. So he proceeded on and left that young man there. The fish began to stir in water and the water assumed the form of an ark over the fish. The young man said: I should meet Allah&#8217;s Apostle (peace be upon him) and inform him, but he was made to forget and when they had gone beyond that place, he (Moses) said to the young man: Bring breakfast. We have been exhausted because of the journey, and he (Moses) was not exhausted until he had crossed that (particular) place (where he had) to meet Khadir, and the youth was reminded and said: Did you not see that as we reached Sakhra I forgot the fish and it is satan alone who has made me forgetful of it&#8217;? It is strange that he has been able to find way in the ocean too. He said: This is what we sought for us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They returned retracing their steps, and he (his companion) pointed to him the location (where) the fish (had been lost). Moses began to search him there. He suddenly saw Khadir wrapped in a cloth and lying on his back. He said to him: As-Salamu-&#8216;Alaikum. He removed the cloth from his face and said: Wa &#8216;Alaikum-us-Salam! Who are you? He said: I am Moses. He said: Who Moses? He said: Moses Of Bani Isra&#8217;il. He said: What brought you here? He said: I have come so that you may teach me what you have been taught of righteousness. He said: You shall have to bear with me, and how can you have patience about a thing of which you have no comprehensive knowledge? You will not have patience when you see me doing a thing I have been ordered to do. He said: If Allah pleases, you will find me patient, nor shall I disobey you in aught. Khadir said: If you follow me, don&#8217;t ask me about anything until I explain it to you. So they went on until they embarked upon a boat. He (Khadir) made a hole in that. Thereupon he (Moses) said: You have done this so that you may drown the persons sitting in the boat. You have done something grievous. Thereupon he said: Did I not tell you that you will not be able to bear with me? Thereupon he (Moses) said: Blame me not for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for what I did. (Khadir gave him another chance.) So they went on until they reached a place where boys were playing. He went to one of them and caught hold&#8217;of one (apparently) at random and killed him. Moses (peace be upon him) felt agitated and said: You have killed an innocent person not guilty of slaying another. You have done something aboininable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: May Allah have mercy upon us and Moses. Had he shown patience he would have seen wonderful things, but fear of blame, with respect to his companion, seized him and he said: If I ask anything after this, keep not company with me. You will then have a valid excuse in my case, and had he (Moses) shown patience he would have seen many wonderful things. He (the narrator) said: Whenever he (the Holy Prophet) made mention of any Prophet, he always said: May there be mercy of Allah upon us and upon my brother so and so. They, however, proceeded on until they came to the inhabitants of a village who were very miserly. They went to the meeting places and asked for hospitality but they refused to show any hospitality to them. They both found in that village a wall which was about to fall. He (Khadir) set it right. Thereupon he (Moses) said: If you so liked. you could get wages for it. Thereupon he said: This is the partince, of ways between me and you, and, taking hold of his cloth, he said: Now I will explain to you the real significance (of all these acts) for which you could not show patience. As for the boat, it belonged to the poor people working on the river and I intended to damage it for there was ahead of them (a king) who seized boats by force. (When he came) to catch hold of it he found it a damaged boat, so he spared it (and later on) it was set right with wood. So far as the boy is concerned, he has been, by very nature, an unbeliever, whereas his parents loved him very much. Had he grown up he would have involved them in wrongdoing and unbelief, so we wished that their Lord should give them in its place one better in purity and close to mercy. And as for the wall it belonged to two orphan boys in the city and there was beneath it a (treasure) belongin to them,&#8230; up to the last verse. This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Abu Ishaq.</p>

Ibn &#8216;Abbas said that he was Khadir. There happened to pass Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b Ansari. Ibn Abbas called him and said: Abu Tufail, come to us. There has been a difference of opinion between me and my friend about the companion of Moses whom he wanted to meet on the way. Did hear anything from Allah&#8217;s meesenger (may peace be upon him) making a mention of anything? Ubayy said: I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may Peace be upon him) as saying: As Moses was amongst the group of Bani Isra&#8217;il, there came to him a person and he said to him: Do you know anyone having better knowledge than you? Moses said: No. Thereupon Allah revealed to Moses: Of course, there is amongst Our servants Khadir (who has better knowledge) than you. Moses asked the way of meeting him. Allah made the fish a sign and it was said to him: Where you miss the fish return to that (place) and you will soon find him. So Moses moved on as Allah wished him to move on. He then said to his young companion: Bring for us the breakfast. Thereupop that young man said to Moses. when he asked him for the breakfast: Don&#8217;t you see that as we had reached the Sakhra I forgot the fish and nobody made it forget (in our mind) but the satan that I should remind you of it? Mosed said to that young man: This was what we wanted. So they retraced their steps and met Khadir and the events which followed have been described in His Book except that Yunus (the narrator) said that he followed the traces of fish in the ocean.</p>

I have created My servants as one having a natural inclination to the worship of Allah but it is Satan who turns them away from the right religion and he makes unlawful what has been declared lawful for them and he commands them to ascribe partnership with Re, although he has no justification for that. And verily, Allah looked towards the people of the world and He showed hatred for the Arabs and the non-Arabs, but with the exception of some remnants from the People of the Book. And He (further) said: I have sent thee (the Holy Prophet) in order to put you to test and put (those to test) through you. And I sent the Book to you which cannot be washed away by water, so that you may recite it while in the state of wakefulness or sleep. Verily, Allah commanded me to burn (kill) the Quraish. I said: My Lord, they would break my head (like the tearing) of bread, and Allah said: You turn them out as they turned you out, you fight against them and We shall help you in this, you should spend and you would be conferred upon. You send an army and I would send an army five times greater than that. Fight against those who disobey you along with those who obey you. The inmates of Paradise are three: One who wields authority and is just and fair, one who Is truthful and has been endowed with power to do good deeds. And the person who is merciful and kind hearted towards his relatives and to every pious Muslim, and one who does not stretch his hand in spite of having a large family to support. And He said: The inmates of Hell are five: the weak who lack power to (avoid evil), the (carefree) who pursue (everything irrespective of the fact that it is good or evil) and who do not have any care for their family or for their wealth. And those dishonest whose greed cannot be concealed even in the case of minor things. And the third. who betray you. morning and evening, in regard to your family and your property.

Qatada said: Abu Abdullah, would this happen? Thereupon he said: Yes. By Allah, I found this in the days of ignorance that a person grazed the goat of a tribe and did not find anyone but their slave-girl (and he did not spare her) but committed adultery with her.</p>

As Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) was going along with us towards the dwellings of Bani an-Najjar, riding upon his pony, it shied and he was about to fall. He found four, five or six graves there. He said: Who amongst you knows about those lying in the graves? A person said: It is I. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: In what state did they die? He said: They died as polytheists. He said: These people are passing through the ordeal in the graves. If it were not the reason that you would stop burying (your dead) in the graves on listening to the torment in the grave which I am listening to, I would have certainly made you hear that. Then turning his face towards us, he said: Seek refuge with Allah from the torment of Hell. They said: We seek refuge with Allah from the torment of Hell. He said: Seek refuge with Allah from the torment of the grave. They said: We seek refuge with Allali from the torment of the grave. He said: Seek refuge with Allah from turmoil, its visible and invisible (aspects), and they said: We seek refuge with Allah from turmoil and its visible and invisible aspects and he said: Seek refuge with Allah from the turmoil of the Dajjal, and they said We seek refuge with Allah from the turmoil of the Dajjal.</p>

I met Abu Qatada and made a mention of that to him. He said: I heard Allali&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: A good vision comes from Allah and a (bad) dream (hulm) from devil. So when one of. you sees a bad dream (hulm) which he does not like, he should spit on his left side thrice and seek refuge with Allah from its evil; then it will not harm him.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Qatada reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: A good vision is from Allah and a bad dream (hulm) is from the satan; so if one of you sees anything (in a dream which he dislikes, he should spit on his left side thrice and seek refuge with Allah from its evil, and then it will never harm him. Abu Salama said: I used to see dreams weighing more heavily upon me than a mountain; but since I heard this hadith I don&#8217;t care for it (its burden).</p>

I saw Abu Qatada who also said: I used to see dreams which made me sick until I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Good dreams are from Allah, so if any one of you sees which he likes he should not disclose it to one but whow he loves, but if he sees something which he does not like he should spit on his left side thrice and seek refuge with Allah from the mischief of the satan and its mischief (i. e. of the dream), and he should not relate it to anyone, then it would not harm him.</p>

And the truest vision will be of one who is himself the most truthful in speech, for the vision of a Muslim is the forty-fifth part of Prophecy, and dreams are of three types: one good dream which is a sort of good tidings from Allah; the evil dream which causes pain is from the satan; and the third one is a suggestion of one&#8217;s own mind; so if any one of you sees a dream which he does not like he should stand tip and offer prayer and he should not relate it to people, and he said: I would love to see fetters (in the dream), but I dislike wearing of necklace, for the fetters is (an indication of) one&#8217;s steadfastness in religion. The narrator said: I do not know whether this is a part of the hadith or the words of Ibn Sirin.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Huraira, narrated that he heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There were three persons in Bani Isra&#8217;il, one suffering from leprosy, the other bald-headed and the third one blind. Allah decided to test them. So He sent an angel who came to one who was suffering from leprosy and said: Which thing do you like most? He said: Beautiful colour and fine skin and removal of that which makes me detestable in the eye of people. He wiped him and his illness was no more and he was conferred upon beautiful colour and beautiful skin. He (the angel) again said: Which property do you like most? He said: Camels, or he said: The cow the narrator is, however, doubtful about it, but (out of the persons) suffering from leprosy or baldness one of them definitely said: The came]. And the other one said: Cow. And he (one who demanded came]) was bestowed upon a she-camel, in an advanced stage of pregnancy, and while giving he said: May Allah bless you in this I Then he came to the bald-headed person and said: Which thing do you like most? He said: Beautiful hair and that (this baldness) may be removed from me because of which people hate me He wiped his body and his illness was removed and he was bestowed upon beautiful hair, and the angel said: Which wealth do you like most? He said: The cow. And he was given a pregnant cow and while handing it over to him he (the angel) said: May Allah bless you in this I Then he came to the blind man and he said: Which thing do you like most? He said: Allah should restore my eyesight so that I should be able to see people with the help of that. He wiped his body and Allah restored to him his eyesight, and he (the angel) also said: Which wealth do you like most? He said. The flock of sheep. And he was given a pregnant goat and that gave birth to young ones and it so happened that one valley abounded in camels and the other one in goats and the third one in sheep. He then came to one suffering from leprosy in his (old) form and shape and he said: I am a poor person and my provision has run short in my journey and there is none to take me to my destination except with the help of Allah and your favour. I beg of you in His name Who gave you fine colour and fine skin, and the camel in the shape of wealth (to confer upon me) a camel which should carry me in my journey. He said: I have many responsibilities to discharge. Thereupon he said: I perceive as if I recognise you. Were you not suffering from leprosy whom people hated and you were a destitude and Allah conferred upon you (wealth) He said: I have inherited this property from my forefathers. Thereupon he said: If you are a liar may Allah change you to that very position in which you had been. He then came to the one who was bald-headed in his (old) form and said to him the same what he had said to him (one suffering from leprosy) and he gave him the same reply as he had given him and he said: If you &#8216;are a liar, may Allah turn you to your previous position in which you had been. And then he came to the blind man in his (old) form and shape and he said: I am a destitute person and a wayfarer. My provision have ran short and today there is no way to reach the destination but with the help of Allah and then with your help and I beg of you in the (name) of One Who restored your eyesight and gave you the flock of sheep to give me a sheep by which I should be able to make my provisions for the journey. He said: I was blind and Allah restored to me my eyesight; you take whatever you like and leave whatever you like. By Allah. I shall not stand in your way today for what you take in the name of God. Thereupon, he said: You keep with you what you have (in your possession). The fact is that you three were put to test and Allah is well pleased with you and He is annoyed with your companions.</p>

Ghazwan delivered us a sermon and he praised Allah and lauded Him, then said: Now coming to the point, verily the world has been given the news of its end and that too quite early. Nothing would be left out of it but only water left in the utensil which its owner leaves, and you are going to shift to an abode which knows no end, and you should shift with the good before you, for we have been told that a stone would be thrown at one side of the Hell and it would go down even for seventy years but would not be able to reach its bottom. By Allah, it would be fully packed. Do you find it something strange, and it has been mentioned that there yawns a distance which one would be able to cover in forty years from one end to another of Paradise, and a day would come when it would be fully packed and you must be knowing that I was the seventh amongst seven who had been with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and we had nothing to eat but the leaves of the tree until the corners of the mouth were injured. We found a sheet which we tore in two and divided between myself and Sa&#8217;d b. Malik. I made the lower garment with halt of it and so did Sa&#8217;d make the lower garment with half of it and today there is none amongst us who has not become the governor of a city from amongst the cities (of the Islamic Commonwealth) and I seek refuge with Allah that I should consider myself great whereas I am insignificant in the eye of Allah. Prophethood does not remain for ever and its impact fades with the result that it changes eventually into kingship, and you would soon come to know and experience those rulers who would come after us and see (how far they are from religion).</p>

I had been forbidding people to do what was disreputable, but practised it myself.</p>

He (the king) sent to him a young man so that he should train him (in magic). And on his way (to the magician) he (the young man) found a monk sitting there. He (the young man) listened to his (the monk&#8217;s) talk and was impressed by it. It became his habit that on his way to the magician he met the monk and set there and he came to the magician (late). He (the magician) beat him because of delay. He made a complaint of that to the monk and he said to him: When you feel afraid of the magician, say: Members of my family had detained me. And when you feel afraid of your family you should say: The magician had detained me. It so happened that there came a huge beast (of prey) and it blocked the way of the people, and he (the young boy) said: I will come to know today whether the magician is superior or the monk is superior. He picked up a stone and said: O Allah, if the affair of the monk is dearer to Thee than the affair of the magician, cause death to this animal so that the people should be able to move about freely. He threw that stone towards it and killed it and the people began to move about (on the path freely). He (the young man) then came to that monk and Informed him and the monk said: Sonny, today you are superior to me. Your affair has come to a stage where I find that you would be soon put to a trial, and in case you are put to a trial don&#8217;t give my clue. That young man began to treat the blind and those suffering from leprosy and he in fact began to cure people from (all kinds) of illness. When a companion of the king who had gone blind heard about him, he came to him with numerous gifts and said: If you cure me all these things collected together here would be yours. Be said: I myself do not cure anyone. It is Allah Who cures and if you affirm faith in Allah, I shall also supplicate Allah to cure you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He affirmed his faith in Allah and Allah cured him and he came to the king and sat by his side as he used to sit before. The king said to him: Who restored your eyesight? He said: My Lord. Thereupon he said: It means that your Lord is One besides me. He said: My Lord and your Lord is Allah, so he (the king) took hold of him and tormented him till he gave a clue of that boy. The young man was thus summoned and the king said to him: O boy, it has been conveyed to me that you have become so much proficient in your magic that you cure the blind and those suffering from leprosy and you do such and such things. Thereupon he said: I do not cure anyone; it is Allah Who cures, and he (the king) took hold of him and began to torment him. So he gave a clue of the monk. The monk was thus summoned and it was said to him: You should turn back from your religion. He, however, refused to do so. He (ordered) for a saw to be brought (and when it was done) he (the king) placed it in the middle of his head and tore it into parts till a part fell down. Then the courtier of the king was brought and it was said to him: Turn back from your religion. Arid he refused to do so, and the saw was placed in the midst of his head and it was torn till a part fell down. Then that young boy was brought and it was said to him: Turn back from your religion. He refused to do so and he was handed over to a group of his courtiers. And he &#8216;said to them: Take him to such and such mountain; make him climb up that mountain and when you reach its top (ask him to renounce his faith) but if he refuses to do so, then throw him (down the mountain). So they took him and made him climb up the mountain and he said: O Allah, save me from them (in any way) Thou likest and the mountain began to quake and they all fell down and that person came walking to the king. The king said to him: What has happened to your companions? He said: Allah has saved me from them. He again handed him to some of his courtiers and said: Take him and carry him in a small boat and when you reach the middle of the ocean (ask him to renounce) his religion, but if he does not renounce his religion throw him (into the water).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they took him and he said: O Allah, save me from them and what they want to do. It was quite soon that the boat turned over and they were drowned and he came walking to the king, and the king said to him: What has happened to your companions? He said: Allah has saved me from them, and he said to the king: You cannot kill me until you do what I ask you to do. And he said: What is that? He said: You should gather people in a plain and hang me by the trunk (of a tree). Then take hold of an arrow from the quiver and say: In the name of Allah, the Lord of the worlds; then shoot an arrow and if you do that then you would be able to kill me. So he (the king) called the people in an open plain and tied him (the boy) to the trunk of a tree, then he took hold of an arrow from his quiver and then placed the arrow in the bow and then said: In the name of Allah, the Lord of the young boy; he then shot an arrow and it bit his temple. He (the boy) placed his hands upon the temple where the arrow had bit him and he died and the people said: We affirm our faith in the Lord of this young man, we affirm our faith in the Lord of this young man, we affirm our faith in the Lord of this young man. The courtiers came to the king and it was said to him: Do you see that Allah has actually done what you aimed at averting. They (the people) have affirmed their faith in the Lord. He (the king) commanded ditches to be dug at important points in the path. When these ditches were dug, and the fire was lit in them it was said (to the people): He who would not turn back from his (boy&#8217;s) religion would be thrown in the fire or it would be said to them to jump in that. (The people courted death but did not renounce religion) till a woman came with her child and she felt hesitant in jumping into the fire and the child said to her: 0 mother, endure (this ordeal) for it is the Truth.</p>

<p><em><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="042.7149"></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ubadab. Walid b. Samit reported: I and my father set out in search of knowledge to a tribe of the Ansar before their death (i. e. before the Companions of the Holy Prophet left the world) and I was the first to meet Abu Yasar, a Companion of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and there was a young man with him who carried the record of letters with him and there was a mantle prepared by the tribe of Ma&#8217;afiri upon him. And his servant too had a Ma&#8217;afiri mantle over him. My father said to him: My uncle, I see the signs of anger or that of agony on your face. He said: Yes, such and such person, the son of so and so, of the tribe of Harami owed me a debt. I went to his family, extended salutations and said: Where is he? They said: He is not here. Then came out to me his son who was at the threshold of his youth. I said to him: Where is your father? He said: No sooner did he hear your sound than he hid himself behind my mother&#8217;s bedstead. I said to him: Walk out to me, for I know where you are. He came out. I said to him: What prompted you to hide yourself from me? He said: By God, whatever I would say to you would not be a lie. By Allah, I fear that I should tell a lie to you and in case of making promise with you I should break it, as you are the Companion of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). The fact is that I was hard up in regard to money. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. Then he brought his promissory note and he wrote off (the debt) with his hand and said: Make payment when you find yourself solvent enough to pay me back; if you are not, then there is no liability upon you. These two eyes of mine saw, and he (Abu&#8217;I-Yasar) placed his fingers upon his eyes and these two ears of mine heard and my heart retained, and he pointed towards his heart that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who gives time to one who is financially hard up (in the payment of debt) or writes off his debt, Allah will provide him His shadow. I said to him: My uncle, if you get the cloak of your servant and you give him your two clothes, or take his two clothes of Ma&#8217;afir and give him your cloak, then there would be one dress for you and one for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He wiped my head and said: O Allah, bless the son of my brother. O, son of my brother, these two very eyes of mine saw and these two ears of mine listened to and this heart of mine retained this, and he pointed towards the heart that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Feed them (the servants) and clothe them (the servants) what you wear, and if I give him the goods of the world, it is easy for me than this that he should take my virtues on the Day of Resurrection. We went on till we came to Jabir b. Abdullah in the mosque and he was busy in observing prayer in one cloth which he had joined at its opposite ends. I made my way through the people till I sat between him and the Qibla and I said: May Allah have mercy upon you. Do you observe prayer with one cloth on your body whereas your mantle is lying at your side? He pointed me with his hand towards my breast just like this and he separated his fingers and bent them in the shape of a bow. And (he said): I thought that a fool like you should come to me so that he should see me as I do and he should then also do like it. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to us in this very mosque and he had in his hand the twig of the palm-tree and he saw mucus towards the Qibla of the mosque and he erased it with the help of the twig. He then came to us and said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He then again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, none of us likes it. And he said: If one amongst you stands for prayer, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is before him he should not spit in front of him, or on his right side, but should spit on his left side beneath his left foot and if he is impelled to do so all of a sudden (in spite of himself) he should then spit in his cloth and fold it in some part of it. (and he further said: ) Bring some sweet-smelling thing. A young man who belonged to our tribe stood up, went and brought scent in his palm. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) took that and applied it to the end of that twig and then touched the place where there had been mucus. Jabir said: This is why you should apply scent to your mosques.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported on the same authority: We set out along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) on an expedition of Batn Buwat. He (the Holy Prophet) was in search of al-Majdi b. &#8216;Amr al-Juhani. (We had so meagre equipment) that five. six or seven of us had one camel to ride and so we mounted it turn by turn. Once there wan. the turn of an Ansari to ride upon the camel. He made it kneel down to ride over it (and after having. mounted it), he tried to raise it up but it hesitated. So he said. May there be curse of Allah upon you! Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is there to curse his camel? He said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, it&#8217; is I. Thereupon he said: Get down from the camel and let us not have in our company the cursed one. Don&#8217;t curse your own selves, nor your children. nor your belongings. There is the possibility that your curse may synchronies with the time when Allah is about to confer upon you what you demand and thus your prayer may be readily responded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported on the same authority: We set out on an expedition along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) until it was evening, and we had been near a. water reservoir of Arabia. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who would be the person who would go ahead and set right the reservoir and drink water himself and serve us with it? Jabir said: I stood up and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, it is I who am ready to do that. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is the person to accompany Jabir? And then Jabbar b. Sakhr stood up. So we went to that well and poured in that tank a bucket or two of water and plastered it with clay and then began to fill it (with water) until it was filled to the brim. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was the first who appeared before us, and he said: Do you (both) permit me to drink water out of it? We said: Yea, Allah&#8217;s Messenger. He led his camel to drink water and it drank. He then pulled its rein and it stretched its legs and began to urinate. He then took it aside and made it kneel down at another place and then came to the tank and performed ablution. I then got up and performed ablution like the ablution of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and Jabbar b. Sakhr went in order to relieve himself and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) got up to observe prayer and there was a mantle over me. I tried to invert its ends but it was too short (to cover my body easily). It had its borders. I then inverted it (the mantle) and drew its opposite ends and then tied them at my neck. I then came and stood upon the left side of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). He caught hold of me and made me go round behind him, until he made me stand on his right side. Then Jabbar b. Sakhr came. He performed ablution and then came and stood on the left side of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) caught hold of our hands together, pushed us back and made us stand behind him. Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) began to look upon me with darting looks, but I did not perceive that. After that I became aware of it and he pointed with the gesture of his hand that I should wrap my loin-cloth. When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had finished the prayer, he said: Jabir! I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, at thy beck and call. He said: When the cloth around you is inadequate, then tie the opposite ends but when it is small, tie it over the lower body.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and the only means of sustenance for every person amongst us was only one date for a day and we used to chew it. And we struck the leaves with the help of our bow and ate them until the sides of our mouths were injured. It so happened one day that a person was overlooked and not given a date. We carried that person and bore witness to the fact that he had not been given that date so he was offered that and he got up and received that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) until we got down at a spacious valley and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) went to relieve himself. I followed him with a bucket full of water and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) looked about and he found no privacy but two trees at the end of the valley and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may. peace be upon him) went to one of them and took hold of one of its twigs and said: Be thou under my control by the permission of Allah, and so it came under his control like the camel who has its nosestring in the hand of its rider, and then he came to the second tree and took hold of a twig and said: Be thou under my control with the permission of Allah, and it came under his control, and when he came in the middle of the two trees he joined together the two twigs and said: join with the permission of Allah. Jabir said: I was afraid lest Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) should be aware of my nearness and go still farther. And Muhammad b. Abbad has used the word&#8221; faitab&#8217;d&#8221; and I began to talk to myself. And as I saw, I suddenly found Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) before me and the two trees were separated and each one of them was standing at its place. I saw Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) standing for a short time, nodding his head towards right and left. Isma&#8217;il pointed towards the right and left with the help of his head (in order to demonstrate how the Holy Prophet had pointed). Then he (the Holy Prophet) came to me and said: Jabir did you see my place where I was standing? I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, yes. He then said: Then you should go to those two trees and cut a twig from each of them and go to that place with them where I was standing and stand there where I was standing and place a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Jabir said: I set out and took hold of a stone and broke it and sharpened it and then I came to those trees and cut a twig from each one of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I then came dragging them until I stood at the place where Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had been standing and placed a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Then I met him and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I have done that, but (kindly) explain to me the reason for it. Thereupon he said: I passed by two graves the occupants of which had been undergoing torment. I liked to make intercession for them so that the might be relieved of this torment y as long as these twigs remain fresh. Jabir said: We came back to the (camp of the) army and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, call people for per- forming wudu. I cried: Come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, there is not even a drop of water in the army camp, and there. was a person who used to cool the water for Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in the old water-skin which kept hanging by the twig. He asked me to go to such and such Ansari and ask him to see if there was any water in that skin. I went to him and cast a glance in it but did not find anything but a drop in the mouth of that water-skin and if I were to draw that, the water-skin&#8217;s,. dried part would suck it up. I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I have not found anything in it but a drop of water in the mouth of the water-skin and now if I were to draw that, it would be absorbed. He said: Go and bring that to me. I brought that to him. He took hold of it -and began to utter something which I could not understand and then pressed it with his hand and gave that to me and said: Jabir, announce for the tub to be brought. So I announced that the tub of the army (be brought). It was brought accordingly and I placed it before him (the Holy Prophet). Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) placed his hands in the tub like this: with his fingers stretched out, and then he placed his fingers at the bottom of the tub and said: Jabir, take it (that waters-skin) and pour water over me, by reciting Bismillah, and I poured water and I said: Bismillah, and found water sprouting out between the fingers of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then that tub gushed forth until it was filled up and the Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, make an announcement to the effect: He who needs water should take that. Jabir said: The people came and got water until they were all satiated. I said: Is there anyone left who wants to get it? And Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) then lifted up his hand from that tub and it was still full. Then the people made a complaint to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) about hunger and he said: May Allah provide you food! We came to the bank of the ocean and the ocean was tossing and it threw out a big animal and we lit fire and cooked it and took it until we had eaten to our heart&#8217;s content. Jabir said: I and such and such five persons entered Its socket and nobody could see us until we had come out, and we took hold of one of its ribs and twisted it into a sort of arch, then we called the tallest of the persons of the army and the hugest of the camels of the army and it had the big saddle over it, and it could easily pass through it without the rider having need to bend down.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bara&#8217; b. &#8216;Azib reported that Abu Bakr Siddlq came to the residence of my father (&#8216;Azib) and bought a haudaj from him and said to &#8216;Azib: Send your son to my residence (to carry this haudaj), and my father said to me: Carry it (for him). So I carried it and there went along with him (with Abu Bakr) my father in order to fetch its price and he (&#8216;Azib) said to Abu Bakr: Abu Bakr, narrate to me what you both did on the night when you set out on a journey along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). He said: We set out during the night and went on walking until it was noon, and the path was vacant and so none passed by that (until) there appeared prominently before us a large rock. It had its shade and the rays of the sun did not reach that place. So we got down at that place. I then went to the rock and levelled the ground with my hands at the place where the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) would take rest under its shade. I then set the bedding and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, go to sleep and I shall keep a watch around you. I went out and watched around him. There we saw a shepherd moving towards that rock with his flock and he intended what we intended (i. e. taking rest). I met him and said to him: Young boy, to which place do you belong? He said: I am a person from Medina. I said, is there any milk in the udders of your sheep and goats? He said: Yes. He took hold of a goat, and I said to him: Clean the udder well so that it should be free from hair, dust and impurity. I saw al-Bara&#8217; striking his hand upon the other (to give an indication) how he did that. He milked the goat for me in a wooden cup which he had with him and I had with me a bucket in which I kept water for drinking and for performing ablution. I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and did not like to awaken him from sleep but he was accidentally startled from the sleep. I poured water upon the milk (till It was cold) and I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, take this milk. He then took It and I was delighted and he (the Holy Prophet) said: Is now not the time to march on? I said: Of course. So he marched on after the sun had passed the meridian and Suraqa b. Malik pursued us and we had been walking on soft, level ground. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, we are about to be overtaken by them. Thereupon he said: Be not grieved. Verily, Allah is with us. Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) cursed him and his horse sank into the earth. I think he also said: I know you have hurled curse upon me. So supplicate Allah for me and I take an oath that I shall turn everyone away who would come in search of you. So he (Allah&#8217;s Messenger) supplicated Allah and he was rescued and he came back and to everyone he met, he said: I have combed all this side. In short, he diverted everyone whom he met and he in fact fulfilled his promise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bara&#8217; reported: Abu Bakr purchased a saddle from me for thirteen dirhams; the rest of the hadith is the same, and in the narration of Uthman b. &#8216;Umar, the words are: He (Suraqa b. Malik) drew near Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and he (the Holy Prophet) cursed him and his camel sank in the earth up to the belly and he jumped from that and said: Muhammad, I am fully aware of It that it is your doing. Supplicate Allah that He should rescue me from it in which I am (pitchforked) and I give you a solemn pledge that I shall keep this as a secret from all those who are coming after me. Take hold of an arrow out of it (quiver) for you will find my camels and my slaves at such and such place and you can get whatever you need (on showing this arrow). He (the Holy Prophet) said: I don&#8217;t need your camels. And we (the Holy Prophet and Abu Bakr) came to Medina during the night and the people began to contend as to where Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) should reside and he encamped in the tribe of Najjar who were related to &#8216;Abd ul-Muttalib from the side of mother. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) honoured them, then people climbed upon house-top and women also and boys scattered in the way, and they were all crying: Muhammad, Messenger of Allah, Muhammad, Messenger of Allah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 26: </font></p>
<p>    </p>
<h3 align="center"><font><em>The Book on Salutations and Greetings  (Kitab As-Salam) </em></font>    </h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><br></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Just as the face is the index to the mind, in the same way  the words of greetings which are exchanged amongst people indicate the spiritual role of a  society. The gestures, and the expressions of salutations are, therefore, the indicators  of the ideals for which a particular society stands. The common practice with the  pre-Islamic Arabs and thi modern West is to greet one another with Good Morning and Good  Evening accompanied by a gesture of the hand or the nodding of head. These words have no  spiritual and moral significance, but just a wish that one should find one&#8217;s mornings and  evenings happy. The words of greeting which Islam has exhorted its followers to use at the  time of meeting are as-Salam-u-&#8216;Alaikum which have a deep spiritual and moral significance  behind them Since the predominant feature of Islamic faith and practice is peace within  and peace without, it has, therefore, been made a watchword which should be repeated on  every occasion when two Muslims meet so that the utmost importance of peace should be  constantly inculcated in the mind of every Muslim, and he should have full consciousness  of the great reality that he lives in this world as a messenger of peace for mankind.  peace amongst individuals and nations. -The second important feature of words of greeting  in Islam is that they convey the message of peace not only to the person who is greeted  but to the whole of the Muslim society as it is the plural pronoun that is used for the  blessing of peace. (The pronoun&#8217;Alaikum has a evry wide range and all the Muslims come  within its orbit.) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The two words as-Salam-u-&#8216;Alaikum may be called the  irreducible minimum which are essential for greeting one another. The Muslims have been  commanded to add to this expression some other words with a view to excelling one another  in showering blessing upon the Muslims. The words as-Salam-u-&#8216;Alaikum are generally  suffixed with these words Rahmat Allah wa Barakaatuh (mercy of Allah and His bleasings).  These three words:&#8221; peace&#8230;, mercy&#8221; and&#8221; blessings of Allah&#8221; in fact  form the sum and substance of Islam and the Muslims are asked to shower upon one another  these benedictions. so that they may be able to live in this world and the Hereafter in  perfect peace and tranquillity and blessings and mercy of Allah around him. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>According to Imam Nawawl, greeting with the words of  as-Salam-u-&#8216;Alaikum is a Sunnah, and responding to it is Wajib (obligatory), but this  essentiality is of the nature of Kifaya, meaning thereby that if a few persons out of the  whole assembly or group respond to the greeting it will absolve all of the responsibility  of response but if no response comes forth from any quarter all are held responsible for  it. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Talha reported: While We were sitting in front of the    houses and talking amongst ourselves, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) happened    to come there. He stood by us and said: What about you apd your meetings on the paths?    Avoid these meetings on the paths. We said: We were sitting here without (any intention of    doing harm to the passers-by) ; we are sitting to discuss matters and to hold conversation    amongst ourselves. Thereupon he said: If there is no help (for you but to sit on these    paths), then give the paths their rights and these are lowering of the gaze, exchanging of    greetings and good conversation.</font></p>

Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: If you insist on    holding meetings, then give the path its due right. They said: What are its due rights?    Upon this he said: Lowering the gaze, refraining from doing harm, exchanging of greetings.    commanding of good and forbidding from evil.</font></p>

Nothing was more burdensome for me than    looking after the horse I used to bring grass for it and looked after it, then I got a    servant as Allah&#8217;s Apustle (may peace be upon him) had some prisoners of war in his    possession. He gave me a female servant. She (the female servant) then began to look after    the horse and thus relieved me of this burden. A person came and he said: Mother of    &#8216;Abdullah, I am a destitute person and I intend that I should start business under the    shadow of your house. I (Asma&#8217;) said: If I grant you permission, Zubair may not agree to    that, so you come and make a demand of it when Zubair is also present there. He came    accordingly find said: Mother of &#8216;Abdullah. I am a destitute person. I intend to start t    mall business in the shadow of your house. I said: Is there not in Medina (any place for    starting the business) except my house? Zubair said: Why is it that you prohibit the    destitute man to start business here? So he started business and he (earned so much) that    we sold our slave-girl to him There came Zubair to me while the money was in my lap. He    said: Give this to me. I said: (I intend) to spend it as charity.</font></p>

He (Hadrat &#8216;Umar) sought their    advice, and they told him that the scourge had broker, out in Syria. There was a    difference of opinion (whether they should proceed further or go back to their homes in    such a situation). Some of them said: You (&#8216;Umar) have set forth for a task, and,    therefore, we would not advise you to go back, whereas some of them said: You have along    with you the remnants (of the sacred galaxy) of men and (the blessed) Companions of    Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), so we would not advise you to go forth towards    this calamity (with such eminent persons and thus expose them deliberately to a danger).

So I called    them to him, and he consulted them, and they trod the same path as was trodden by the    Muhajirin, and they differed in their opinions as they had differed. He said: Now, you can    go. He again said: Call to me the old persons of the Quraish who had migrated before the    Victory (that is the Victory of Mecca), so I called them (and Hadrat &#8216;Umar consulted them)    and not even two persons differed (from the opinion held by the earlier delegates). They    said: Our opinion is that you better go back along with the people and do not make them go    to this scourge, So &#8216;Umar made announcement to the people: In the morning I would be on    the back of my side. So they (set forth in the morning), whereupon Abu &#8216;Ubaida b. Jarrah    said: Are you going to run away from the Divine Decree? Thereupon &#8216;Umar said: Had it been    someone else to say this besides you! &#8216;Umar (in fact) did not approve of his opposing    (this decision) and he said: Yes, we are running from the Divine Decree (to the) Divine    Decree. You should think if there had been camels for you and you happened to get down in    a valley having two sides, one of them covered with verdure and the other being barren,    would you not (be doing) according to the Divine Decree if you graze them in verdure? And    in case you graze them in the barren land (even then you would be grazing them) according    to the Divine Decree.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Salama h. &#8216;Abd al-Rahman b. &#8216;Auf reported Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There is no transitive disease, but he is    also reported to have said: A sick person should not be taken to one who is healthy. Abu    Salama said that Abu Huraira used to narrate these two (different ahadith) from Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him), but afterwards Abu Huraira became silent on these    words:&#8221; There is no transitive disease,&#8221; but he stuck to this that the sick    person should not be taken to one who is healthy. Harith b. Abu Dhubab (and he was the    first cousin of Abu Huraira) said: Abu Huraira, I used to hear from you that you narrated    to us along with this hadith and the other one also (there is no transitive disease), but    now you observe silence about it. You used to say that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be    upon him) said: There is no transitive disease. Abu Huraira denied having any knowledge of    that, but he said that the sick camel should not be taken to the healthy one. Harith,    however, did not agree with him, which irritated Abu Huraira and he said to him some words    in the Abyssinian language. He said to Harith: Do you know what I said to you? He said:    No. Abu Huraira said: I simply denied having said it. Abu Salama sad: By my life, Abu    Huraira in fact used to report Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) having said:    There is no transitive disease. I do not know whether Abu Huraira has forgotten it or he    deemed it an abrogated statement in the light of the other one.</font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: What did you    say in the pre-Islamic days when there was such a shot (of meteor)? They said: Allah and    His Messenger know best (the actual position), but we, however, used to say that that very    night a great man had been born and a great man had died, whereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may    peace be upon him) said: (These meteors) are shot neither at the death of anyone nor on    the birth of anyone. Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, issues Command when He decides to do    a thing. Then (the Angels) supporting the Throne sing His glory, then sing the dwellers of    heaven who are near to them until this glory of God reaches them who are in the heaven of    this world. Then those who are near the supporters of the Throne ask these supporters of    the Throne: What your Lord has said? And they accordingly inform them what He says. Then    the dwellers of heaven seek information from them until this information reaches the    heaven of the world. In this process of transmission (the jinn snatches) what he manages    to overhear and he carries it to his friends. And when the Angels see the jinn they attack    them with meteors. If they narrate only which they manage to snatch that is correct but    they alloy it with lies and make additions to it.</font></p>

So Ibn &#8216;Umar used to kill every snake that he found. Abu    Lubaba b. &#8216;Abd al-Mundhir and Zaid b. Khattab saw him pursuing a snake, whereupon he said:    They were forbidden (to kill) those snakes who live in houses.</font></p>

I looked towards it and found a snake. I    jumped up in order to kill it, but he (Abu Sa&#8217;id Khudri) made a gesture that I should sit    down. So I sat down and as he finished (the prayer) he pointed to a room in the house and    said: Do you see this room? I said: Yes. He said: There was a young man amongst us who had    been newly wedded. We went with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) (to participate    in the Battle) of Trench when a young man in the midday used to seek permission from    Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) to return to his family. One day he sought    permission from him and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) (after granting him the    permission) said to him: Carry your weapons with you for I fear the tribe of Quraiza (may    harm you). The man carried the weapons and then came back and found his wife standing    between the two doors. He bent towards her smitten by jealousy and made a dash towards her    with a spear in order to stab her. She said: Keep your spear away and enter the house    until you see that which has made me come out. He entered and found a big snake coiled on    the bedding. He darted with the spear and pierced it and then went out having fixed it in    the house, but the snake quivered and attacked him and no one knew which of them died    first, the snake or the young man. We came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and    made a mention to him and said: Supplicate to Allah that that (man) may be brought back to    life. Thereupon he said: Ask forgiveness for your companion and then said: There are in    Medina jinns who have accepted Islam, so when you see any one of them, pronounce a warning    to it for three days, and if they appear before you after that, then kill it for that is a    devil.</font></p>

He climbed down into the well, filled    his shoe with water, then caught it in his mouth until he climbed up and made the dog    drink it. So Allah appreciated this act of his and pardoned him. Then (the Companions    around him) said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, is there for us a reward even for (serving) such    animals? He said: Yes, there is a reward for service to every living animal.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu al-Sa&#8217;id Khudri reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying that the earth would turn to be one single bread on the Day of Resurrection and the Almighty would turn it in His hand as one of you turns a loaf while on a journey. It would be a feast arranged in the honour of the people of Paradise. He (the narrator) further narrated that a person from among the Jews came and he said: Abu al-Qasim, may the Compassionate Lord be pleased with you! May I inform you about the feast arranged in honour of the people of Paradise on the Day of Resurrection? He said: Do it, of course. He said: The earth would become one single bread. Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) looked towards us and laughed until his molar teeth became visible. He then again said: May I inform you about that with which they would season it? He said: Do it, of course. He said: Their seasoning would be balim and fish. The Companions of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: What is this balam? He said: Ox and fish from whose excessive livers seventy thousand people would be able to eat.</p>

Thereupon Abdullah got up and said in anger. O people, fear Allah and say only that which one knows amongst you and do not say which he does not know and he should simply say: Allah has the best knowledge for He has the best knowledge amongst all of you. It does not behove him to say that which he does not know. Allah has the best knowledge of it. Verily Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said to His Prophet (may peace be upon him) to state:&#8221; I do not ask from you any remuneration and I am not the one to put you in trouble,&#8221; and when Allah&#8217;s Mesqenger (may peace be upon him) saw people turning back (from religion) he said: O Allah, afflict thern with seven famines as was done in the case of Yusuf, so they were afflicted with famine by which they were forced to eat everything until they were obliged to eat the hides and the dead bodies because of hunger, and every one of them looked towards the sky and he found a smoke. And Abu Sufyan came and he said: Muhammad, you have come to command us to obey Allah and cement the ties of blood- relation whereas your people are undone; supplicate Allah for tlicm. Thereupon Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said:&#8221; Wait for the day when there would be clear smoke from the sky which would envelop people and that would be grievous torivent&#8221; up to the words:&#8221; you are going to return to (evil).&#8221; (if this verse implied the torment of the next life) could the chastisement of the next (life) be averted (as the Qur&#8217;an states): On the day when We seize (them) with the most violent seizing; surely We shall exact retribution&#8221; (xliv. 16)?

This reflects the understanding of a person that he should say about that which he does not know that it is Allah who knows best. The fact is that when the Quraish disobeyed Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) he supplicated Allah that they should be afflicted with famine and starvation as was done in case of Yusuf. And they were so much hard pressed that a person would ace the sky and he would see between him and the sky something like smoke and they were so much hard pressed that they began to cat the bones, and a person came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger. seek forgiveness for the tribe of Mudar for (its people) have been undone.

They (the Companions of the Holy Prophet) said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, not even thou? Thereupon he said: Not even I, but that Allah wraps me in His Mercy, and bear this in mind that the deed loved most by Allah is one which is done constantly even though it is insignificant.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><br></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Supplication is in fact not only the spontaneous  outpourings of man&#8217;s heart before his Lord, but it is an expression of his sense of  nearness to Him, of His Might and Power, of his confidence in His mercy, grace and  blessings. If one were to know how much a man supplicates, and what he supplicates about,  and how he supplicates, one would be able to see how much spirituality is there in his  soul. When a man without any witness speaks with Allah, the soul stands unveiled before  its Creator. The higher the note he strikes in his outpouring, the higher is the quality  of the faith that is imprinted upon his soul, and serves as a background to all his  thought and activity. Thus to understand the spirit of any religion and appraise its value  to life and society, supplications serve as the key. The Prophet (may peace be upon him)  was a great believer in supplication and prayer. He made supplications to his Lord with  zeal and fervour, rarely to be found in the religious literature of the world. One who  cares to read them cannot but be overwhelmed with the depth of feelings with which the  Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) approaches his Lord, his intense love for the Great  Master, his deep faith in His unbounded Favours, his unshakeable confidence in His Divine  Mercy and unflinching faith in His Might and Power, and his sense of deep humility before  Him. These are in fact the multi-coloured threads with which is woven the delicate pattern  of the Prophet&#8217;s (may peace be upon him) supplications. In Islam the supplication which a  Muslim has been instructed to make whether singly or in congregation, whether at the  appointed hour of ritual prayer or at any sudden call or urge to His Lord, reflects the  one single attitude of submission, humility and closeness to God. Whatever is the state of  spiritual elevation of the supplication he is made to keep this fact constantly in his  mind that he is a humble servant of the Lord. That is the reason why most of the  supplications in Islam open with an invocation of the Divine Being; either the personal  name of God, i. e. Allah, is used or the descriptive title of His Attributes are called  out in order to make the worshipper conscious of his own weak and dependent self before  his Master. In Islam man seeks to move God to help and grant him what he desires, and at  the same time he seeks unconsciously to work upon himself through the realisation of what  God means to him, to strengthen, to renew and to refresh his own inner life. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While the expression of dependence and trust is in reality  a prerequisite of supplication in Islam, it covers the whole range of human life with all  its needs, longings and problems. Supplication finds expression in a deep and urgent  longing for self preservation and deliverance from the oppressive situation, forgiveness  of sins, elevation of the soul, goodness of the worldly life and that of the Hereafter.  This consciousness of one&#8217;s absolute dependence upon Him, which pervades the entire stock  of the Prophet&#8217;s (may peace be upon him) supplications, shows man&#8217;s attitude of perfect  resignation before the Mighty Will of the Master, but this resignation has nothing of the  spirit of despondence and despair in it; it rather illuminates hope out of conviction that  the Being Who is the Lord of man&#8217;s fate can also help him and save him even in the most  trying circumstances. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The supplications of Muhammad (may peace be upon him)  eminently combine in themselves the mystical and the religious traits. While the Muslim  supplicates, he, like a mystic, beholds undisturbed with concentrated gaze one Supreme  Spiritual Reality Who is the Embodiment and Repository of all values. But, unlike mystics,  he, in the hour of contemplation in supplication, does not lose himself but realises  himself to be a humble servant of God and therein lies his spiritual strength and  unwavering confidence in God. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The one more distinguishing feature of the supplications  taught by Muhammad (may peace be upon him) is that these are all permeated with the spirit  of social fellowship. They do not urge man to stand face to face with God in absolute  loneliness, isolated from all other human beings. Herein the suppliant begs his Lord with  the full consciousness of human brotherhood and with a feeling that the distress which  vexes him is not his only, it is that of his brethren. The graces of God and the salvation  for which he longs are also the longings of all believers, nay, of the entire humanity.  There is no doubt a deep touch of intimate personal and individual contact with God in  these supplications, but this contact is not of the nature of a non-Muslim mystic in which  the soul is supposed to be unified with God losing all its individual identity. Here the  soul has a communion with Allah with full consciousness of man&#8217;s own self, his social  surroundings and responsibilities. That is why most of the supplications have been  expressed in the form&#8221; We&#8221; and Us&#8221;. </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Did you    supplicate for anything or beg of Him about that? He said: Yes. I used to utter (these    words): Impose punishment upon me earlier in this world, what Thou art going to impose    upon me in the Hereafter. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said:    Hallowed be Allah, you have neither the power nor forbearance to take upon yourself (the    burden of His Punishment). Why did you not say this: O Allah, grant us good in the world    and good in the Hereafter, and save us from the torment of Fire. He (the Holy Prophet)    made this supplication (for him) and he was all right.</font></p>

Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: O people, sh mercy to    yourselves for you are not calling One Who is deaf or absent. Verily, you are calling One    Who is All-Hearing (and) Near to you and is with you. Abu Musa told that he had been    behind him (the Holy Prophet) and reciting:&#8221; There is neither might nor power but    that of Allah.&#8221; He (the Holy Prophet), while addressing &#8216;Abdullah b.

Thereupon he (the Holy    Prophet) said: Then recite:&#8221; There is no might and no power but that of Allah.&#8221;</font></p>

When he draws near Me by the span of his hand. I draw near him by the length of a cubit and when he draws near Me by the length of a cubit. I draw near him by the length of a fathom and when he draws near Me walking I draw close to him hurriedly.</p>

He sleeps (being disappointed of its recovery) and then gets up and goes in search for that, until he is stricken with thirst. then comes back to the place where he had been before and goes to sleep completely exhausted placing his head upon his hands waiting for death. And when he gets up, lot there is before him his riding beast and his provisions of food and drink. Allah is more pleased with the repentance of His servant than the recovery of this riding beast along with the provisions (of food and drink).</p>

He went on until he came to a waterless desert and he felt like sleeping. So he got down under the shade of a tree and was overcome by sleep and his camel ran away. As he got up he tried to see (the camel) standing upon a mound. but did not find it. He then got upon the other mound, but could not see anything. He then climbed upon the third mound but did not see anything until he came back to the place where he had been previously. And as he was sitting (in utter disappointment) there came to him the camel, till that (camel) placed its nosestring in his hand. Allah is more pleased with the repentance of His servant than the person who found (his lost camel) in this very state. Simak reported that Sha&#8217;bi was of the opinion that Nu&#8217;min traced it to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). Simak, however, did not hear that himself.</p>

He took a pledge from them and they did as he commanded thein to do. Allah said: What prompted you to do this? He said: My Lord. Thine fear, and Allah did not punish him at all.</p>

He then asked about the learned persons of the earth and he was directed to a scholar, and he told him that he had killed one hundred persons and asked him whether there was any scope for his repentance to be accepted. He said: Yes; what stands between you and the repentance? You better go to such and such land; there are people devoted to prayer and worship and you also worship along with them and do not come to the land of yours since it was an evil land (for you). So he went away and he had hardly covered half the distance when death came to him and there was a dispute between the angels of mercy and the angels of punishment. The angels of mercy said: This man has come as a penitant and remorseful to Allah and the angels of punishment said: He has done no good at all. Then there came another angel in the form of a human being in order to decide between them. He said: You measure the land to which he has drawn near. They measured it and found him nearer to the land where he intended to go (the land of piety), and so the angels of mercy took possession of it.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Burda reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There would come people amongst the Muslims on the Day of Resurrection with as heavy sins as a mountain, and Allah would forgive them and He would place in their stead the Jews and the Christians. (As far as I think), Abu Raub said: I do not know as to who is in doubt. Abu Burda said: I narrated it to &#8216;Umar b. &#8216;Abd al-&#8216;Aziz, whereupon he said: Was it your father who narrated it to you from Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him)? I said: Yes.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Safwan b. Muhriz reported that a person said to Ibn &#8216;Umar: How did you hear Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying something about intimate conversation? He said: I heard him say: A believer will be brought to his Lord, the Exalted and Glorious, on the Day of Resurrection and He would place upon him His veil (of Light) and make him confess his faults and say: Do you recognise (your faults)? He would say: My Lord, I do recognise (them). He (the Lord) would say: I concealed them for you in the world. And today I forgive them. And he would then be given the Book containing (the account of his) good deeds. And so far as the non-believers and hypocrites are concerned, there would be general announcement about them before all creation telling them that these (people, i. e. non-believers and hypocrites) told a lie about Allah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Shihab reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) made an expedition to Tabuk and he (the Holy Prophet) had in his mind (the idea of threatening the) Christians of Arabia in Syria and those of Rome. Ibn Shihab (further) reported that &#8216;Abd al-Rahman b. &#8216;Abdullah b. Ka&#8217;b informed him that Abdullah b. Ka&#8217;b who served as the guide of Ka&#8217;b b. &#8216;Malik as he became blind that he heard Ka&#8217;b b. Malik narrate the story of his remaining behind Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) from the Battle of Tabuk. Ka&#8217;b b. Malik said: I never remained behind Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) from any expedition which he undertook except the Battle of Tabuk and that of the Battle of Badr. So far as the Battle of Badr is concerned, nobody was blamed for remaining behind as Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and the Muslims (did not set out for attack but for waylaying) the caravan of the Quraish, but it was Allah Who made them confront their enemies without their intention (to do so). I had the honour to be with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) on the night of &#8216;Aqaba when we pledged our allegiance to Islam and it was more dear to me than my participation in the Battle of Badr, although Badr was more popular amongst people as compared with that (Tabuk). And this is my story of remaining back from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) on the occasion of the Battle of Tabuk. Never did I possess means enough and (my circumstances) more favourable than at the occasion of this expedition. And, by Allah, I had never before this expedition simultaneously in my possession two rides. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) set out for this expedition in extremely hot season; the journey was long and the land (which he and his army had to cover) was waterless and he had to confront a large army, so he informed the Muslims about the actual situation (they had to face), so that they should adequately equip themselves for this expedition, and he also told them the destination where he intended to go. And the Muslims who accompanied Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) at that time were large in numbers but there was no proper record of them. Ka&#8217;b (further) said: Few were the persons who wanted to absent themselves, and were under the impression that they could easily conceal themselves (and thus remain undetected) until revelations from Allah, the Exalted and Glorious (descended in connection with them).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) set out on an expedition when the fruits were ripe and their shadows had been lengthened. I had weakness for them and it was during this season that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) made preparations and the Muslims too along with them. I also set out in the morning so that I should make preparations along with them but I came back and did nothing and said to myself: I have means enough (to make preparations) as soon as I like. And I went on doing this (postponing my preparations) until people were about to depart and it was in the morning that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) set out and the Muslims too along with him, but I made no preparations. I went early in the morning and came back, but I made no decision. I continued to do so until they (the Muslims) hastened and covered a good deal of distance. I also made up my mind to march on and to meet them. Would that I had done that but perhaps it was not destined for me. After the departure of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as I went out amongst people, I was shocked to find that I did not find anyone like me but people who were labelled as hypocrites or the people whom Allah granted exemption because of their incapacity and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) took no notice of me until he had reached Tabuk. (One day as he was sitting amongst the people in Tabuk) he said: What has happened to Ka&#8217;b b. Malik? A person from Banu&#8217; Salama said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, the (beauty) of his cloak and his appreciation of his sides have allured him and he was thus detained. Mua&#8217;dh b. Jabal said: Woe be upon that what you contend. Allah&#8217;s Messenger, by Allah, we know nothing about him but good. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), however, kept quiet. It was during that time that he (the Holy Prophet) saw a person (dressed in all white (garment) shattering the illusion of eye (mirage).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: May he be Abu Khaithama and, lo, it was Abu Khaithama al-Ansari and he was that person who contributed a sa&#8217; of dates and was scoffed at by the hypocrites. Ka&#8217;b b. Malik farther said: When this news reached me that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was on his way back from Tabuk I was greatly perturbed. I thought of fabricating false stories and asked myself how I would save myself from his anger on the following day. In this connection, I sought the help of every prudent man from amongst the members of my family and when it was said to me that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was about to arrive, all the false ideas banished (from my mind) and I came to the conclusion that nothing could save me but the telling of truth, so I decided to speak the truth and it was in the morning that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) arrived (in Medina). And it was his habit that as he came back from a journey he first went to the mosque and observed two Rak&#8217;ahs of nafl prayer (as a mark of gratitude) and then sat amongst people. And as he did that, those who had remained behind him began to put forward their excuses and take an oath before him and they were more than eighty persons. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) accepted their excuses on the very face of them and accepted their allegiance and sought forgiveness for them and left their secret (intentions) to Allah, until I presented myself to him. I greeted him and he smiled and there was a tinge of anger in that. He (the Holy Prophet) then said to me: Come forward. I went forward until I sat in front of him. He said to me: What kept you back? Could you not afford to go in for a ride? I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, by Allah, if I were to sit in the presence of anybody else from amongst the worldly people I would have definitely saved myself from his anger on one pretext (or the other) and I have also the knack to fall into argumentation, but, by Allah, I am fully aware of the fact that if I were to put forward before you a false excuse to please you Allah would definitely provoke your wrath upon me, and if I speak the truth you may be annoyed with me, but I hope that Allah would make its end well and, by Allah, there is no valid excuse for me. By Allah, I never possessed so good means, and I never had such favourable conditions for me as I had when I stayed behind you (failed to join the expedition).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereupon, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: This man told the truth, so get up until Allah gives a decision in your case. I stood up and some people of Banu&#8217; Salama followed me in hot haste, and they said to me: By Allah, we do not know about you that you committed a sin prior to this. You, however, showed inability to put forward an excuse before Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as those who stayed behind him have put forward excuses. It would have been enough for the forgiveness of your sin that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) would have sought forgiveness for you. By Allah, they continued to incite me until I thought of going back to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and contradict myself. Then I said to them: Has anyone else also met the same fate? They said: Yes, two persons have met the same fate as has fallen to you and they have made the sane statement as you have made, and the same verdict has been delivered in their case as it has been delivered in your case. I said: Who are they? They said: Murara b. ar-Rabi&#8217;a &#8216;Amiri and Hilal b. Umayya al-Waqafi. They made a mention of these two pious persons to me who had participated in the Battle of Badr and there was an example for me in them. I went away when they named these two persons. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) forbade the Nluslims to talk with three of us from amongst those (persons) who had stayed behind him. The people began to avoid us and their attitude towards us underwent a change and it seemed as if the whole atmosphere had turned (hostile) against us and it was in fact the same atmosphere ot which I was fully aware and in which I had lived (for a fairly long time). We spent fifty nights in this very state and my two friends confined themselves withen their houses and spent (most of the) time in weeping, but as I was young and strong amongst them I got (out of my house), participated in congregational prayers, moved about in the bazar; but none spoke to me. I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as he sat amongst (people) after the prayer, greeted him and asked myself whether his lips stirred in response to my greetings (or not).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I observed prayer beside him and looked at him with stealing glances and when I attended to my prayer, he looked at me and when I cast a glance at him he turned away his eyes from me. And when the harsh treatment of the Muslims towards me extended to a (considerable) length of time, I walked until I climbed upon the wall of the garden of Abu Qatada, and he was my cousin, and I had the greatest love for him. I greeted him but, by Allah, he did not respond to my greetings. I said to him: Abu Qatada, I adjure you by Allah, arn&#8217;t you well aware of the fact that I love Allah and His Messenger (may peace be upon him) the most. He kept quiet. I again repeated saying: I adjure you by Allah. arn&#8217;t you well aware of the fact that I love Allah and His Messenger (may peace be upon him) the most. He kept quiet. I again adjured him, whereupon he said: Allah and the Messenger (may peace be upon him) are best aware of it. My eyes began to shed tears and I came back climbing down from the wall and as I was walking in the bazar of Medina a Nabatean from amongst the Nabateans of Syria, who had come to sell foodgrains in Medina, asked people to direct him to Ka&#8217;b b. Malik. People gave him the indication by pointing towards me. He came to me and delivered to me a letter of the King of Ghassan and as I was a scribe I read that letter and it was written like this:&#8221; Coming to my point, it has been conveyed to us that your friend (the Holy Prophet) is subjecting you to cruelty and Allah has not created you for a place where you are to be degraded and where you cannot find your right place, so you come to us that we should accord you honour. As I read that letter I said: This is also a calamity, so I burnt it in the oven. When out of the fifty days, forty days had passed and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) received no revelation, there came the messenger of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) to me and said: Verily, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has commanded you to remain separate from your wife. I said: Should I divorce her or what (else) should I do? He said: No, but only remain separate from her and don&#8217;t have sexual contact with her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same message was sent to my companions. So I said to my wife: You better go to your parents and stay there with them until Allah gives the decision in my case. The wife of Hilal b. Umayya came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, Hilal b. Umayya is a senile person, he has no servant. Do you disapprove of my serving him? He said: No, but don&#8217;t go near him. She said: By Allah, he has no such instinct in him. By Allah, he spends his time in weeping from that day to this day. Some of the members of my family said to me: Were you to seek permission from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in regard to your wife as he has granted permission to the wife of Hilal b. Umayya to serve him. I said: I would not seek permission from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), for I cannot say what Allah&#8217;s Apostle may say in response to seeking my permission. Moreover, I am a young man. It was in this state that I spent ten more nights and thus fifty nights had passed that (people) had observed boycott with us. It was on the morning of the fiftieth night that I observed my dawn prayer and was sitting on one of the roofs of our houses. And I was in fact sitting in that very state which Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, has described about us in these words:&#8221; Life had become hard for myself and the earth had compressed despite its vastness,&#8221; that I heard the noise of an announcer from the peak of the hill of Sal&#8217; saying at the top of his voice: Ka&#8217;b b. Malik, there is glad tidings for you. I fell down in prostration and came to realise that there was (a message of) relief for me. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had informed the people of the acceptance of our repentance by Allah as he offered the dawn prayer. So the people went on to give us glad tidings and some of them went to my friends in order to give them the glad tidings and a person galloped his horse and came from the tribe of Aslam and his horse reached me more quickly than his voice. And when he came to me whose sound I heard, he gave me the glad tidings. I took off my clothes and clothed him with them because of his bringing good news to me and, by Allah, I possessed nothing else (in the form of clothes) than these two on that occasion, and I asked one to lend me two clothes and dressed myself in them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and on my way I met groups of people who greeted me because of (the acceptance of) repentance and they said: Here is a greeting for you for your repentance being accepted by Allah. (I moved on) until I came to the mosque and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had been sitting there amongst persons. So Talha b. &#8216;Ubaidullah got up and rushed towards me and he shook hands with me and greeted me and, by Allah, no person stood up (to greet me) from amongst the emigrants except he. Ka&#8217;b said that he never forgot (this good gesture of) Talha. Ka&#8217;b further said: I greeted Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) with Assalam-o-&#8216;Alaikam and his face was glistening because of delight, and he said: Let there be glad tidings and blessings for you, the like of which (you have neither found nor you will find, as you find today) since your mother gave your birth. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger. is this acceptance of repentance from you or from Allah? He said: No, (it is not from ma), it is from Allah, and it was common with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) that as he was happy his face brightened up and it looked like a part of the moon and it was from this that we recognised it (his delight). As I sat before him, I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, am I allowed to give in charity my wealth for Allah&#8217;s sake and for the sake of His Messenger (may peace be upon him)? Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Keep some property with you as it is better for you. I said: I shall keep with me that part (of my property) which fell to my lot (on the occasion of the expedition of) Khaibar. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, verily, Allah has granted me salvation because of truth and, therefore, (I think) that repentance implies that I should not speak anything but truth as long as I live. He said: By Allah, I do not know whether anyone amongst the Muslims was put to more severe trial than I by Allah because of telling the truth. And since I made a mention of this to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) up to this day I have not told any lie and, by Allah, I have decided not to tell a lie and I hope that Allah would save me (from trials) for the rest of my life and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed these verses:&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certainly, Allah has turned in Mercy to the Prophet and the emigrants and the helpers who followed him in the hour of hardship after the hearts of a part of them were about to deviate; then He turned to them in mercy. Surely, to them He is Compassionate, Merciful and (He turned in Mercy) to the three who were left behind until the earth despite its vastness became strait for them and their souls were also straitened to them.&#8221; And this revelation reached up to the (words):&#8221; O you who believe, develop God consciousness, and be with the truthful&#8221; (ix. 117-118). Ka&#8217;b said: By Allah, since Allah directed me to Islam there has been no blessing more significant for me than this truth of mine which I spoke to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and if I were to tell a lie I would have been ruined as were ruined those who told lies, for in regard to those who told lies Allah used harshest words used for anyone as He descended revelation (and the words of Allah are):&#8221; They will swear by Allah to you when you return to them so that you may leave them alone. So leave them alone. Surely, they are unclean and their resort is Hell, recompense for what they earned. They will swear to you that you may be pleased with them but if you are pleased with them, yet surely Allah is not pleased with the transgressing people&#8221; (ix. 95-96). K&#8217;ab said that the matter of us three persons was deferred as compared with those who took an oath in the presence of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and he accepted their allegiance and sought forgiveness for them and Allah did not give any decision in regard to us. It was Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, Who gave decisions in our case, three who remained behind. (The words of the Qur&#8217;an)&#8221; the three who were left behind&#8221; do not mean that we remained back from Jihad but these imply that He kept our matter behind them who took oath and presented excuse before Him. This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zuhri with the same chain of transmitters.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa&#8217;id b. Musayyib, &#8216;Urwa b. Zubair, &#8216;Alqama b. Waqqas and &#8216;Ubaidullah b. Abdullah b. &#8216;Utba b. Mas&#8217;ud&#8211;all of them reported the story of the false allegation against &#8216;A&#8217;isha, the wife of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). And they (the slanderers) said what they had to say, but Allah exonerated her of this charge and all of them reported a part of the hadith and some of them who had better memories reported more and with better retention, and I tried to retain this hadith (listening) from every one of them that they reported to me and some of them attested the other. (The sumaried substance of the false allegation is this): &#8216;A&#8217;isha said: Whenever Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) intended to set out on a journey he cast lots amongst his wives and he took one with him in whose favour the lot was cast. It so happened that he cast lots amongst us while setting out on a battle and it was cast in my favour, so I set out along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). This relates to the period when the revelation concerning the commands of veil had been made. I was carried in a haudaj and I was brought down where we had to stay. In short, when we set out for return journey from the expedition and our caravan was near Medina, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanded one night to march forward. I also got up when the command for the march was given and moved on until I went out of the encampments of the army and after relieving myself I came to my place. I touched my chest and found that my necklace which had been made of the stones of zafar had been broken. I retraced my steps and tried to search my necklace and this detained me there. The group of people who saddled my ride and placed my haudaj carrying me upon the camels marched on. They were under the impression that I was in it. The women in those days were light of weight and they did not wear much flesh, as they ate less food; so they did not perceive the weight of my haudaj as they placed it upon the camel as I was a young girl at that time. So they drove the camel and Eet out and I found my necklace after the army had marched. I came to my place and there was none to call and none to respond (the call).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I waited at my place under the impression that when the people would riot find me they would come back. So I kept sitting at my place. I was overpowered by sleep and slept. Safwan b. Mu&#8217;attal Sulami Dhakwini, who had lagged behind the army because of taking rest came to my place walking in the latter part of the night and he saw the body of a person who was asleep. He came to me and recognised me as he had seen rue before it was enjoined to observe purda. I got ap by his voice as he recited Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raji&#8217;un [we are for Allah and to Him we have to return. ] and I covered my head with my headdress. By Allah, he did not speak to me a word and I did not hear a word from him except Inna lillahi. He made his camel kneel down and I amounted the camel as he pressed tLe camel&#8217;s foreleg and he moved on leaning the camel by the nose string on which I was riding until we came to the army where it had encamped for rest because of extreme heat. Woe be upon those who harboured doubts about me and the most notorious among them was &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy, the great hypocrite. We came to Medina and I fell sick for a month. The people had been deliberating over the statements of those who had brought these calumnies against me. I was absolutely unaware of anything concerning that. This, however, caused doubt in my mind that I did not see Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him.) treating me with such kindness with which he treated me as I fell ill before this. The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) would coome and greet me with Assalam-o-&#8216;Alaikum and only ask me how I was. This caused doubt in my mind, but I was unaware of the evil. I wept outside despite my failing health and there went along with me Umm Mistah and she said the daughter of Abu Rhm b. Muttalib b. &#8216;Abd Manaf and his mother was the daughter of Sakhr b. &#8216;Amir, the sister of the mother of Abu Bakr Sidiq and his son was Mistah b. Uthatha b. &#8216;Abbad b. Muttalib. I and the daughter of Abu Rahm set towards the direction of my house. Something got into the head dress of Umm Mistah and she said: Woe be upon Mistah. And I said. Woe be upon what you say. Do you curse people who had participated in Badr? She said: Innocent woman, have you not heard what he said? I said: What did he say? She conveyed to me the statement of those who had brought false allegations against me. So my illness was aggravated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I went to my house and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to me and he greeted me and then said: How is that woman? I said: Do you permit me to go to the (house) of my parents? She (further) said: I had at that time made up my mind to confirm this news from them. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) permitted me. So I came to (the house of) my parents and said to my mother: Mother, do you know what the people are talking about? She said: My daughter, you should not worry. By Allah, if there is a handsome woman who is loved by her husband and he has co-wives also they talk many a thing about her. I said: Hallowed be Allah, what are the people talking about? I wept during the whole night until it was morning and I did not have a wink of sleep and I wept even in the morning. As the revelation was delayed (in regard to this matter), so Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) called &#8216;Ali ibn Abi &#8216;Talib and Usama b. Zaid in order to seek their advice in regard to the separation of his wife. Usama b. Zaid told Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be apen him) about the innocence of his wives and what he knew about his love for them. He said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, they are your wives and we know nothing else about thembut goodness. And as for &#8216;Ali b. Abu Talib, he said: Allah has not put any unnecessary burden upon you (in regard to your wives). There are a number of women besides her and if you ask that maidservant (Barira) she will tell you the truth. So, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) called Bailra and said: Barira, did you see anything in &#8216;A&#8217;isha which can cause doubt about her? Barira said: By Him Who sent thee with the truth, I have seen nothing objectionable in her but only this much that she is a young girl and she goes to sleep while kneading the flour and the lamb eats that. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) mounted the pulpit and sought vindication against &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy b. Salul, and he further said: Who would exonerate me from imputations of that person who has troubled (me) in regard to my family? By Allah, I find nothing in my wife but goodness and the person whom the people have mentioned in this connection is, according to my knowledge, a thoroughly pious person, and he did never get into my house but along with me. Sa&#8217;d b. Mu&#8217;adh stood up and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I defend your honour against him. If he belong to the tribe of Aus we would strike his neck and if he belongs to the tribe of our brother Khazraj and you order us we would comply with your order.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Sa&#8217;d b. &#8216;Ubada stood up. He was chief of the Khazraj tribe. He was otherwise a pioas man but he had some what tribal partisanship in him and he said to Sa&#8217;d b. Mu&#8217;adh: By the everlasting existence of Allah. you are not stating the fact, you will not be able to kill him and you will not have the power to do so. Thereupon, Usaid b. Hudair stood up, and he was the first cousin of Sa&#8217;d b. Mu&#8217;adh and said to Sa&#8217;d b. &#8216;Ubada: By the everlasting existence of Allah, you are not stating the fact. We would kill him. You are a hypocrite and so you argue in defence of the hypocrites, and thus both the tribes Aus and Khazraj were flared up, until they were about to fall upon one another and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) kept standing upon the pulpit and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) tried to subside their anger until they became silent and thus there was silence. &#8216;A&#8217;isha further reported: I spent the whole day in weeping and even the night and could not have a wink of sleep even next night. My parents thought that this constant weeping of mine would break my heart. I wept and they sat beside me. In the meanwhile a woman of the Ansar came to see me. I permitted her to see me and she also began to weep. And we were in this very state that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came and he greeted me and then sat down. He had never sat with me since a month when this rumour was afloat, and there was no revelation (to clarity) my case. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) recited Tashahhud (there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said: Coming to the point, &#8216;A&#8217;isha, this is what has reached me about you and if you are innocent, Allah would Himself vindicate your honour, and if accidentally there has been a lapse on your part sock forgiveness of Allah; He will pardon thee for when a servant makes a confession of his fault and turns (to Him) penitently, Allah also turns to him (mercifully) accepting his repentance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) talked, my tears dried up and not even a single drop of tear was perceived by me (rolling out of my eyes). I said to my father: You give a reply to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) on my behalf. He said: By Allah, I do not know what I should say to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). I then said to my mother: Give a reply to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) on my behalf, but she said: By Allah, I do not know what I should say to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). I was a small girl at that time and I had not read much of the Qur&#8217;an (but I said): By Allah, I perceive that you have heard about this and it has settled down in your mind and you have taken it to be true, so if I say to you that I am quite innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would never believe me to be true, and if I confess to (the alleged) lapse before you, whereas Allah knows that I am completely innocent (and I have not committed this sin at all), in that case You will take me to be true and, by Allah, I, therefore, find no other alternative for me and for you except that what the father of Yousuf said:, (My course is) comely patience. And Allah it is Whose help is to be sought for in that (predicament) which ye describe&#8221; (xii 18). After this I turned my face to the other side and lay down on my bed. By Allah, I was fully aware of this fact that I was innocent but I did not expect that Allah would descend Wahy Matlu (Qur&#8217;anic Wahy) in my case as I did not think myself so much important that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, would speak in this matter in words to be recited. I only hoped that Allah would in vision give an indication of my innocence to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) during his sleep. And, by Allah, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had not moved an inch from where he had been sitting and none from the members of my family had gone that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, descended revelation upon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) there and then and he felt the burden which he used to feel at the time of receiving revelation. He began to perspire because of the burden of words of Allah as they descended upon him even during the winter season and there fell the drops of his sweat like silvery beads. When this state of receiving revelation was over, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) smiled and the first words which he spoke to me were that he said: &#8216;A&#8217;isha, there is glad tidings for you. Verily, Allah has vindicated your honour, and my mother who had been standing by me said: Get up (and thank him, i. e. the Holy Prophet). I said: By Allah, I shall not thank him and laud him but Allah Who has descended revelation vindicating my honour. She (&#8216;A&#8217;isha) said: Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed:&#8221; &#8216;Verily, those who spread the slander are a gang among you&#8221; (and) ten (subsequent) verses in regard to my innocence. She further said: Abu Bakr used to give to Mistah (some stipend) as a token of kinship with him and for his poverty and he (Abu Bakr) said: By Allah, now I would not spend anything for him. &#8216;A&#8217;isha said: It was upon this that Allah the Exalted and Glorious revealed this verse:&#8221; And let not those who possess dignity and ease among you swear to give to the near of the kin&#8221; up to&#8221; Yearn ye not that Allah may forgive you?&#8221; Hibban b. Musa&#8217; said that &#8216;Abdullah b. Mubarak used to say: It is a verse contained in the Book which most (eminently) brightens the hope.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr said: By Allah, I wish that Allah should pardon me. I shall never stop this stipend. So he continued to give him the stipend which he had withdrawn. &#8216;A&#8217;isha said that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (way peace be upon him) asked Zainab, daughter of Jahsh, the wife of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him), about me what she knew or what she had seen in me, and she said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I shall not say anything without hearing (with my ears) and seeing with my eyes. By Allah, I find nothing in her but goodness. (And she stated this in spite of the fact) that she was the only lady who amongst the wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) used to vie with me but Allah saved her in bringing false allegation against me because of her God-consciousness. Her sister Hamna bint Jahsh, however, opposed her and she was undone along with others.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zuhri through other chains of transmitters but with a slight variation of wording. In the hadith transmitters on the authority of &#8216;Urwa, there is an addition of these words:&#8221; &#8216;A&#8217;isha did not like that Hassan should be rebuked in her presence and she used to say: It was he who wrote this verse also:&#8221; &#8216;Verily, my father and my mother and my honour, those are all meant for defending the honour of Muhammad against you.&#8221; And &#8216;Urwa further reported that &#8216;A&#8217;isha said: By Allah, the person, about whom the allegation was trade used to say: Hallowed be Allah, by One, in Whose hand is my life, I have never unveiled any woman, and then he die, &amp; as a martyr in the cause of Allah, and in the narration transmitted on the authority of Ya&#8217;qub b. Ibrahim., the word is Mu&#8217;irin and in the narration transmitted on the&#8217;authority of &#8216;Abd al-Razzaq it is Mughirin. &#8216;Abd b. Humaid said: I said to &#8216;Abd al-Razzaq: What does this word Mughirin mean? And he said: Al- waghra means intense heat.</p>

<p><em><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="037.6675"></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;A&#8217;Isha reported: When I came under discussion what the people had to say about me, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) stood up for delivering an address and he recited tashahhud (I bear witness to the fact that iheie is no god but Allah) and praised Allah, lauded Him what He rightly deserves and then said: Coming to the point. Give me an advice about them who have brought false charge about my family. By Allah, I know no evil in the members of my family and the person in connection with whom the false charge is being levelled, I know no evil in him too. And he never entered my house but in my presence and when I was away on a journey, he remained with me even in that. The rest of the hadith is the same but with this change that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to my house and asked my maidservant and she said: By Allah, I know no fault in her but this that she sleeps, and goat comes and eats the kneaded flour. Some of the Companions (of the Holy Prophet) scolded her and said: State the fact before Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and they even made a pointed reference (to this incident). She said: gallowed be Allah. By Allah, I know about her as does the jeweller know about the pure piece of gold. And when this news reached the person in connection with whom the allegation was made he said: Hallowed be Allah. By Allah, I have never unveiled any woman. &#8216;A&#8217;isha said: He fell as a martyr in the cause of Allah, and there is this addition in this hadith that the people who had brought false allegation amongst them were Mistah and Hamna and Hassan. And so far as the hypocrite &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy is concerned, he was one who tried his best to gather the false news and then gave them the wind. And he was in fact a fabricator and there was Hamna, daughter of Jahsh with him.</p>

Hadrat &#8216;Ali refrained from striking his neck. He came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, he has not even the sexual organ with him.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Huraira reported that Juraij was one who was devoted to    (prayer) in the temple. His mother came to him. Humaid said that Abu Rafi&#8217; demonstrated    before us like the demonstration made by abu Huraira to whom Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace    be upon him) had demonstrated as his mother called him placing her palms upon the eyebrows    and lifting her head for calling him and said: Juraij, it is your mother, so talk to her.    She found him at that time absorbed in prayer, so he said (to himself): O Lord, my mother    (is calling me) (whereas I am absorbed) in my prayer. He opted for prayer. She (his    mother) went back, then came again for the second time and said: O Juraij, it is your    mother (calling you), so talk to me. He said: O Allah. there is my mother also and my    prayer, and he opted for prayer. She said: O Allah, this Juraij is my son. I pray to talk    to him but he refuses to talk to me. O Allah, don&#8217;t bring death to him unless he has seen    the prostitutes, and had she invoked the curse upon him (from the heart of her heart) he    would have been involved in some turmoil. There was a shepherd living near by his temple    (the temple where Juraij was engaged in prayer). It so happened that a woman of that    village came there and that shepherd committed fornication with her and she became    pregnant and gave birth to a child. It was said to her: Whose child is this? She said: He    is the child of one who is living in this temple. So there came persons with hatchets and    spades. They called Juraij. He was absorbed in prayer and he did not talk to them and they    were about to demolish that temple that he saw them and then came to them and they said:    Ask her (this woman) what she says. He smiled and then touched the head of the child and    said: Who is your father? He (the child) said: My father is the shepherd of the sheep, and    when they heard this, they said: We are prepared to rebuild with gold and silver what we    have demolished from your temple. He said: No, rebuild it with clay as it had been before.    He then went up (to his room and absorbed himself in prayer).</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Huraira reported Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon    him) as saying: None spoke in the cradle but only three (persons), Christ son of Mary, the    second one the companion of Juraij. Juraij had got constructed a temple and confined    himself in that. His mother came to him as he was busy in prayer and she said: Juraij. He    said: My Lord, my mother (is calling me while I am engaged in) my prayer. He continued    with the prayer. She returned and she came on the next day and he was busy in prayer, and    she said: Juraij. And he said: My Lord, my mother (is calling me while I am engaged) in    prayer, and he continued with the prayer and she went back, and then on the next day she    again came and he was busy in prayer and she said: Juraij. And he said: My Lord, my mother    (is calling me while I am engaged in my prayer, and he continued with the prayer, and she    said: My Lord, don&#8217;t give him death unless he has seen the fate of the prostitutes. The    story of Juraij and that of his meditation and prayer gained currency amongst Bani    Isra&#8217;il. There was a prostitute who had been a beauty incarnate. She said (to the people):    If you like I can allure him to evil. She presented herself to him but he paid no heed (to    her). She came to a shepherd who lived near the temple and she offered herself to him and    he had a sexual intercourse with her and so she became pregnant arid when she gave birth    to a child she said: This is from Juraij. So they came and asked him to get down and    demolished the temple and began to beat him. He said: What is the matter? They said: You    have committed fornication with this prostitute and she has given birth to a child from    your loins. He said: Where is the child? They brought him (the child) and he said: just    leave me so that I should observe prayer. And he observed prayer and when he finished, he    came to the child. He struck his stomach and said: O boy, who is your father? lie said: He    is such shepherd. So they turned towards Juraij, kissed him and touched him (for seeking    blessing) and said: We are prepared to construct your temple with gold. He said. No, just    rebuild it with mud as it had been, and they did that. Then there was a babe who was    sucking his mother that a person dressed in fine garment came riding upon a beast. His    mother said: O Allah, make my child like this one. He (the babe) left sucking and began to    see towards him, and said: O Allah, don&#8217;t make me like him. He then returned to the chest    and began to suck the milk of his mother. He (Abu Huraira) said: I perceived as if I am    seeing Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as he is explaining the scene of his    sucking milk with his forefinger in his mouth and sucking that. He (Abu Huraira) further    reported Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may be peace upon him) as saying: There happened to pass by him    a girl who was being beaten and they were saying: You have committed adultery and you have    committed theft and she was saying: Allah is enough for me and He is my good Protector,    and his mother said: O Allah, don&#8217;t make my child like her and he left sucking the milk,    and looked towards her and said: O Allah, make me like her, and there was a talk between    them. She said: O with shaven head, a good-looking person happened to pass by and I said:    O Allah, make my child like him, and you said: O Allah, don&#8217;t make me like him, and they    passed by a girl while they were beating her and saying: You committed fornication and you    committed theft, and I said: O Allah, don&#8217;t make my child like her, and you said: O Allah,    make me like her. Thereupon he said: That person was a tyrant, and I said: O Allah, don&#8217;t    make me like him, and they were saying about her: You committed fornication whereas in    fact she had not committed that and they were saying: You have committed theft whereas she    had not committed theft, so I said: O Allah, make me like her.</font></p>

O My servants, even if the first amongst you and the last amongst you and the    whole human race of yours and that of the Jinns too in unison become the most wicked (all    beating) like the heart of a single person, it would cause no loss to My Power. O My    servants, even if the first amongst you and the last amongst you and the whole human race    of yours and that of jinns also all stand in one plain ground and you ask Me and I confer    upon every person what he asks for, it would not. in any way, cause any loss to Me (even    less) than that which is caused to the ocean by dipping the needle in it.

Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) saw    that orphan girl and said: O, it is you; you have grown young. May you not advance in    years! That slave-girl returned to Umm Sulaim weeping. Umm Sulaim said: O daughter, what    is the matter with you? She said: Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) has invoked    curse upon me that I should not grow in age and thus I would never grow in age, or she    said, in my (length) of life. Umm Sulaim went out wrapping her head-dress hurriedly until    she met Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). He said to her: Umm Sulaim, what is the    matter with you? She said: Allah&#8217;s Apostle, you invoked curse upon my orphan girl. He    said: Umm Sulaim, what is that? She said: She (the orphan girl) states you have cursed her    saying that she might not grow in age or grow in life. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be    upon him) smiled and then said: Umm Sulaim, don&#8217;t you know that I have made this term with    my Lord. And the term with my Lord is that I said to Him: 1 am a human being and I am    pleased just as a human being is pleased and I lose temper just as a human being loses    temper, so for any person from amongst my Ummah whom I curse and he in no way deserves it,    let that, O Lord, be made a source of purification and purity and nearness to (Allah) on    the Day of Resurrection.</font></p>

And as for those who have a yearning for error    they go after the allegorical verses seeking (to cause) dissension, by seeking to explain    them. And none knows their implications but Allah, and those who are sound in knowledge    say: We affirm our faith in everything which is from our Lord. It is only the persons of    understanding who really heed&#8221; (iii. 6). &#8216;A&#8217;isha (further) reported that Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him) said (in connection with these verses): When you see    such verses, avoid them, for it is they whom Allah has pointed out (in the mentioned    verses).</font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him)    came to us (and) the (signs) of anger could be seen on his face.

I thus met him and asked him about things    which he narrated from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). And amongst these the    one he mentioned was that Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: Verily, Allah does    not take away knowledge from people directly but he takes away the scholars and    consequently takes away (knowledge) along with them and leaves amongst persons the    ignorant as their leaders who deliver religious verdicts without (adequate) knowledge and    themselves go astray and lead others astray. &#8216;Urwa said: When I narrated this to &#8216;A&#8217;isha,    she deemed it too much (to believe) and thus showed reluctance to accept that (as    perfectly true) and said to, &#8216;Urwa: Did he (&#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Amr) say to you that he had    heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) as saying: (&#8216;Urwa had forgotten to ask this    from &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Amr). So when it was the next year, she (&#8216;A&#8217;isha) said to him (&#8216;Urwa):    Ibn Amr has come (for Hajj), so meet him. talk to him and ask him about this hadith that    he narrated to You (last year on the occasion of the Hajj) pertaining to knowledge. He    (&#8216;Urwa), said: So I met him, and asked about it and he narrated to me exactly like one    that he had narrated (to me) for the first time. So when I informed her (&#8216;A&#8217;isha) about    that, she said: I do not think but this that he has certainly told the truth and I find    that be has neither made any addition to it, nor missed anything from it.</font></p>

He saw them in sad    plight as they had been hard pressed by need. He (the Holy Prophet) exhorted people to    give charity, but they showed some reluctance until (signs) of anger could be seen on his    face. Then a person from the Ansar came with a purse containing silver. Then came another    person and then other persons followed them in succession until signs of happiness could    be seen on his (sacred) face. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He    who introduced some good practice in Islam which was followed after him (by people) he    would be assured of reward like one who followed it, without their rewards being    diminished in any respect. And he who introduced some evil practice in Islam which had    been followed subsequently (by others), he would be required to bear the burden like that    of one who followed this (evil practice) without their&#8217;s being diminished in any respect.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Harith b Abi Rabi&#8217;a and &#8216;Abdullah b.

She reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had said that a seeker of refuge would seek refuge in the Sacred House and an army would be sent to him (in order to kill him) and when it would enter a plain ground, it would be made to sink. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, what about him who would be made to accompany this army willy nilly? Thereupon he said: He would be made to sink along with them buf he would be raised on the Day of Resurrection on the basis of his intention. Abu Ja&#8217;far said. &#8216; This plain, ground means the plain ground of Medina.</p>

An army would be sent to fight (and kill) them and when they would enter a plain ground the army would be sunk in it. Yiisuf (one of the narrators) said: It was a people of Syria (hordes of Hajjaj) who had been on that day comin. towards Mecca for an attack (on &#8216;Abdulllah b. Zubair) and Abdullah b.

And when they would reach the plain ground they would be sunk. We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, all sorts of people throng the path. Thereupon he said: Yes, there would be amongst them people who would come with definite designs and those who would come under duress and there would be travellers also, but they would all be destroyed through one (stroke) of destruction. though they would be raised in different states (on the Day of Resurrection). Allah would, however, raise them according to their intention.</p>

And I begged my Lord that my Ummah should not be destroyed by drowning (by deluge) and He granted me this.

They will fight until night will intervene them; both the sides will return without being victorious and both will be wiped out. The Muslims will again prepare a detachment for fighting unto death so that they may not return but victorious. When it would be the fourth day, a new detachment out of the remnant of the Muslims would be prepared and Allah will decree that the enemy should be routed. And they would fight such a fight the like of which would not be seen, so much so that even if a bird were to pass their flanks, it would fall down dead before reaching the end of them. (There would be such a largescale massacre) that when counting would be done, (only) one out of a hundred men related to one another would be found alive.

They were dressed in woollen clothes and they stood near a hillock and they met him as Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was sitting. I said to myself: Better go to them and stand between him and them that they may not attack him. Then I thought that perhaps there had been going on secret negotiation amongst them. I however, went to them and btood between them and him and I remember four of the words (on that occasion) which I repeat (on the fingers of my hand) that he (Allah&#8217;s Messenger) said: You will attack Arabia and Allah will enable you to conquer it, then you would attack Persia and He would make you to Conquer it. Then you would attack Rome and AllgLh will enable you to conquer it, then you would attack the Dajjal and Allah will enable you to conquer him. Nafi&#8217; said: Jabir, we thought that the Dajjal would appear after Rome (Syrian territory) would be conquered.</p>

<p><em><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="041.7015"></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nawwas b. Sam&#8217;an reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) made a mention of the Dajjal one day in the morning. He sometimes described him to be insignificant and sometimes described (his turmoil) as very significant rand we felt) as if he were in the cluster of the date-palm trees. When we went to him (to the Holy Prophet) in the evening and he read (the signs of fear) in our faces, he said: What is the matter with you? We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, you made a mention of the Dajjal in the morning (sometimes describing him) to be insignificant and sometimes very important, until we began to think as if he were present in some (near) part of the cluster of the datpalm trees. Thereupon he said: I harbour fear in regard to you in so many other things besides the Dajjal. If he comes forth while I am among on, I shall contend with him on your behalf, but if he comes forth while I am not amongst you, a man must contend on his own behalf and Allah would take care of every Muslim on my behalf (and safeguard him against his evil). He (Dajjal) would be a young man with twisted, contracted hair, and a blind eye. I compare him to &#8216;Abd-ul-&#8216;Uzza b. Qatan. He who amongst you would survive to see him should recite over him the opening verses of Sura Kahf (xviii.). He would appear on the way between Syria and Iraq and would spread mischief right and left. O servant of Allah! adhere (to the path of Truth). We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, how long would he stay on the earth? He said.. For forty days, one day like a year and one day like a month and one day like a week and the rest of the days would be like your days. We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, would one day&#8217;s prayer suffice for the prayers of day equal to one year? Thereupon he said: No, but you must make an estimate of time (and then observe prayer). We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, how quickly would he walk upon the earth? Thereupon he said: Like cloud driven by the wind. He would come to the people and invite them (to a wrong religion) and they would affirm their faith in him and respond to him. He would then give command to the sky and there would be rainfall upon the earth and it would grow crops. Then in the evening, their posturing animals would come to them with their humps very high and their udders full of milk and their flanks stretched. He would then come to another people and invite them. But they would reject him and he would go away from them and there would be drought for them and nothing would be lef t with them in the form of wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would then walk through the waste, land and say to it: Bring forth your treasures, and the treasures would come out and collect (themselves) before him like the swarm of bees. He would then call a person brimming with youth and strike him with the sword and cut him into two pieces and (make these pieces lie at a distance which is generally) between the archer and his target. He would then call (that young man) and he will come forward laughing with his face gleaming (with happiness) and it would at this very time that Allah would send Christ, son of Mary, and he will descend at the white minaret in the eastern side of Damscus wearing two garments lightly dyed with saffron and placing his hands on the wings of two Angels. When he would lower his head, there would fall beads of perspiration from his head, and when he would raise it up, beads like pearls would scatter from it. Every non-believer who would smell the odour of his self would die and his breath would reach as far as he would be able to see. He would then search for him (Dajjal) until he would catch hold of him at the gate of Ludd and would kill him. Then a people whom Allah had protected would come to Jesus, son of Mary, and he would wipe their faces and would inform them of their ranks in Paradise and it would be under such conditions that Allah would reveal to Jesus these words: I have brought forth from amongst My servants such people against whom none would be able to fight; you take these people safely to Tur, and then Allah would send Gog and Magog and they would swarm down from every slope. The first of them would pass the lake of Tibering and drink out of it. And when the last of them would pass, he would say: There was once water there. Jesus and his companions would then be besieged here (at Tur, and they would be so much hard pressed) that the head of the ox would be dearer to them than one hundred dinirs and Allah&#8217;s Apostle, Jesus, and his companions would supplicate Allah, Who would send to them insects (which would attack their necks) and in the morning they would perish like one single person. Allah&#8217;s Apostle, Jesus, and his companions would then come down to the earth and they would not find in the earth as much space as a single span which is not filled with their putrefaction and stench. Allah&#8217;s Apostle, Jesus, and his companions would then again beseech Allah, Who would send birds whose necks would be like those of bactrin camels and they would carry them and throw them where God would will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah would send rain which no house of clay or (the tent of) camels&#8217; hairs would keep out and it would wash away the earth until it could appear to be a mirror. Then the earth would be told to bring forth its fruit and restore its blessing and, as a result thereof, there would grow (such a big) pomegranate that a group of persons would be able to eat that, and seek shelter under its skin and milch cow would give so much milk that a whole party would be able to drink it. And the milch camel would give such (a large quantity of) milk that the whole tribe would be able to drink out of that and the milch sheep would give so much milk that the whole family would be able to drink out of that and at that time Allah would send a pleasant wind which would soothe (people) even under their armpits, and would take the life of every Muslim and only the wicked would survive who would commit adultery like asses and the Last Hour would come to them.</p>

Let us now kill those who are In the sky and they would throw their arrows towards the sky and the arrows would return to them besmeared with blood.

So he will alight at some of the barren tracts near Medina, and a person who would be the best of men or one from amongst the best of men would say to him: I bear testimony to the fact that you are Dajjal about whom Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had informed us. The Dajjal would say: What is your opinion if I kill this (person), then I bring him back to life; even then will you harbour doubt in this matter? They would say: No. He would then kill (the man) and then bring him back to life. When he would bring tha@ person to life, he would say: By Allah, I had no better proof of the fact (that you are a Dajjal) than at the present time (that you are actually so). The Dajjal would then make an attempt to kill him (again) but he would not be able to do that. Abu Ishaq reported that it was said: That person would be Khadir (Allah be pleased with him).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sa&#8217;id al-Khudri reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The Dajjal would come forth and a person from amongst the believers would go towards him and the armed men of the Dajjal would meet him and they would say to him: Where do you intend to go? He would say: I intend to go to this one who is coming forth. They would say to him: Don&#8217;t you believe in our Lord? He would say: There is nothing hidden about our Lord. They would say: Kill him. Then some amongst them would say: Has your master (Dajjal) not forbidden you to kill anyone without (his consent)? And so they would take him to the Dajjal and when the believer would see him, he would say: O people. he is the Dajjil about whom Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has informed (us). The Dajjal would then order for breaking his head and utter (these words): Catch hold of him and break his head. He would be struck even on his back and on his stomach. Then the Dajjal would ask him: Don&#8217;t you believe in me? He would say: You are a false Masih. He would then order him to be torn (into pieces) with a saw from the parting of his hair up to his legs. After that the Dajjal would walk between the two pieces. He would then say to him: Stand, and he would stand erect. He would then say to him: Don&#8217;t you believe in me? And the person would say: It has only added to my insight concerning you (that you are really the Dajjal). He would then say: O people, he would not behave with anyone amongst people (in such a manner) after me. The Dajjal would try to catch hold of him so that he should kill him (again). The space between his neck and collar bone would be turned into copper and he would find no means to kill him. So he would catch hold of him by his hand and feet and throw him (into the air) and the people would think as if he had been thrown in the Hell-Fire whereas he would be thrown in Paradise. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He would be the most eminent amongst persons in regard to martyrdom in the eye of the Lord of the world.</p>

Thereupon he said: Hallowed be Allah, there is no god but Allah (or the words to the same effect). I have decided that I would not narrate anything to anyone now. I had only said that you would see after some time an important event that the (sacred) House (Ka&#8217;ba) would be burnt and it would happen and definitely happen. He then reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: The Dajjal would appear in my Ummah and he would stay (in the world) for forty-I cannot say whether he meant forty days, forty months or forty years. And Allah would then send Jesus son of Mary who would resemble &#8216;Urwa b Mas&#8217;ud. He (Jesus Christ) would chase him and kill him. Then people would live for seven years that there would be no ran. cour between two persons. Then Allah would send cold wind from the side of Syria that none would survive upon the earth having a speck of good in him or faith in him but he would die, so much so that even if some amongst you were to enter the innermost part of the mountain, this wind would reach that place also and that would cause his heath. I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Only the wicked people would survive and they would be as careless as birds with the charactertistics of beasts. They would never appreciate the good nor condemn evil. Then the Satan would come to them in human form and would say: Don&#8217;t you respond? And they would say: What do you order us? And he would command them to worship the idols but, in spite of this, they would have abundance of sustenance and lead comfortable lives. Then the trumpet would be blown and no one would hear that but he would bend hfs neck to one side and raise it from the other side and the first one to hear that trumpet would be the person who would be busy in setting right the tank meant for providing water to the camels. He would swoon and the other people would also swoon, then Allah would send or He would cause to send rain which would be like dew and there would grow out of it the bodies of the people. Then the second trumpet would be blown and they would stand up and begin to look (around). Then it would be said: O people, go to your Lord, and make them stand there. And they would be questioned. Then it would be said: Bring out a group (out of them) for the Hell-Fire. And then it would be asked: How much? It would be said: Nine hundred and ninty-nine out of one thousand for the Hell-Fire and that would be the day which would make the children old because of its terror and that would be the day about which it has been said:&#8221; On the day when the shank would be uncovered&#8221; (lxviii. 42).</p>

Qais and she was the first amongst the emigrant women: Narrate to me a hadith which you had heard directly from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and there is no extra link in between them. She said: Very well, if you like, I am prepared to do that, and he said to her: Well, do It and narrate that to me. She said: I married the son of Mughira and he was a chosen young man of Quraish at that time, but he fell as a martyr in the first Jihad (fighting) on the side of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). When I became a widow, &#8216;Abd al-Rahman b. Auf, one amongst the group of the Companions of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), sent me the proposal of marriage. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) also sent me such a message for his freed slave Usama b. Zaid. And it had been conveyed to me that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (way peace be upon him) had said (about Usama): He who loves me should also love Usima. When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) talked to me (about this matter), I said: My affairs are in your hand. You may marry me to anyone whom you like. He said: You better shift now to the house of Umm Sharik, and Umm Sharik was a rich lady from amongst the Anqir. She spent generously for the cause of Allah and entertained guests very hospitably. I said: Well, I will do as you like. He said: Do not do that for Umm Sharik is a woman who is very frequently vizited by guests and I do not like that your head may be uncovered or the cloth may be removed from your shank and the strangers may catch sight of them which you abhor. You better shift to the house of your cousin &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Amr b. Umm Maktum and he is a person of the Bani Fihr branch of the Quraish, and he belonged to that tribe (to which Fatima) belonged. So I shifted to that house, and when my period of waiting was over, I heard the voice of an announcer making an announcement that the prayer would be observed in the mosque (where) congregational prayer (is observed).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I set out towards that mosque and observed prayer along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and I was in the row of the women which was near the row of men. When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had finished his prayer, he sat on the pulpit smiling and said: Every worshipper should keep sitting at his place. He then said: Do you know why I had asked you to assemble? They said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: By Allah. I have not made you assemble for exhortation or for a warning, but I have detained you here, for Tamim Dari, a Christian, who came and accepted Islam, told me something, which agrees with what I was-telling, yuu about the Dajjal. He narrated to me that he had sailed in a ship along with thirty men of Bani Lakhm and Bani Judham and had been tossed by waves in the ocean for a month. Then these (waves) took them (near) the land within the ocean (island) at the time of sunset. They sat in a small side-boat and entered that Island. There was a beast with long thick hair (and because of these) they could not distinguish his face from his back. They said: Woe to you, who can you be? Thereupon it said: I am al-Jassasa. They said: What is al-Jassasa? And it said: O people, go to this person in the monastery as he is very much eager to know about you. He (the narrator) said: When it named a person for us we were afraid of it lest it should be a Devil. Then we hurriedly went on till we came to that monastery and found a well-built person there with his hands tied to his neck and having iron shackles between his two legs up to the ankles. We said: Woe be upon thee, who are you? And he said: You would soon come to know about me. but tell me who are you. We said: We are people from Arabia and we embarked upon a boat but the sea-waves had been driving us for one month and they brought as near this island. We got Into the side-boats and entered this island and here a beast met us with profusely thick hair and because of the thickness of his hair his face could not be distinguished from his back. We said: Woe be to thee, who are you? It said: I am al- Jassasa. We said: What is al-Jassasa? And it said: You go to this very person in the monastery for he is eagerly waiting for you to know about you. So we came to you in hot haste fearing that that might be the Devil. He (that chained person) said: Tell me about the date-palm trees of Baisan. We &amp;aid: About what aspect of theirs do you seek information? He said: I ask you whether these trees bear fruit or not.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Zaid b. Arqam reported: We set out on a journey along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in which we faced many hardships. &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy said to his friends: Do not give what you have in your possession to those who are with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) until they desert him. Zubair said: That is the reciting of that person who recited as min haulahu (from around him) and the other reciting is man haulahia (who are around him). And in this case when we would return to Medina the honourable would drive out the meaner therefrom (lxiv. 8). I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and informed him about that and he sent someone to &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy and he asked him whether he had said that or not. He took an oath to the fact that he had not done that and told that it was Zaid who had stated a lie to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). Zaid said: I was much perturbed because of this until this verse was revealed attesting my truth:&#8221; When the hypocrites come&#8221; (lxiii. 1). Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) then called them in order to seek forgiveness for them, but they turned away their heads as if they were hooks of wood fixed in the wall (lxiii. 4), and they were in fact apparently good-looking persons.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Umar reported that when &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy b. Salul died. His son &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Abdullah (b. Ubayy) came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and begged him that he should give him his shirt which he would use as a coffin for his father, he gave him that. He then begged that he should conduct funeral prayer for him. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had hardly got up to observe the prayer for him that &#8216;Umar stood up and caught hold of the garment of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, are you going to conduct prayer for this man, whereas Allah has forbidden you to offer prayer for him? Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Allah has given me an option as He has said:&#8221; You may beg pardon for them or you may not beg pardon for them, and even if you beg pardon for them, seventy times&#8221; (ix. 80), and I am going to make an addition to the seventy. He was a hypocrite and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) offered prayer for him and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed this verse:&#8221; Do not offer prayer for any one of them at all and do not stand upon their graves for (offering prayer over them)&#8221; (ix. 84).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas&#8217;ud reported that there gathered near the House three persons amongst whom two were Quraishi and one was a Thaqafi or two were Thaqafis and one was a Quraishi. They lacked understanding but wore more flesh. One of them said: Do you think that Allah hears as we speak? The other one said: He does hear when we speak loudly and He does not hear when we speak in undertones, and still the other one said: If He listens when we speak loudly, He also listens when we speak in undertones. It was on this occasion that this verse was revealed:&#8221; You did not conceal yourselves lest your ears, your eyes and your skins would stand witness against you&#8221; (xli. 22).</p>

The Companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) were divided in two groups. One group said: We would kill them, and the other one said: No, this should not be done, and it was on this occasion that this verse was revealed:&#8221; Why should you, then, be two parties in relation to hypocrites?&#8221; (iv. 88).</p>

It was on this occasion that this verse was revealed:&#8221; Think not that those who exult in what they have done, and love to be praised for what they have not done-think not them to be safe from the chastisement; and for them is a painful chastisement&#8221; (iii. 18).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Humaid b. &#8216;Abd al-Rahman b. &#8216;Auf reported that Marwan said to Rafi&#8217;, his chamberlain, that he should go to Ibn &#8216;Abbas and ask him: If every one of us be punished for his being happy upon his deed and for his being praised for what he has not done, nobody would be saved from the torment. Ibn &#8216;Abbas said: What you have to do with this verse? It has been in fact revealed in connection with the people of the Book.&#8221; Then Ibn Abbas recited this verse:&#8221; When Allah took a covenant from those who had been given the Book: You shall explain it to people and shall not conceal this&#8221; (iii. 186), and then Ibn &#8216;Abbas recited this verse:&#8221; Think not that those who exult in what they have done and love to be praised for what they have not done&#8221; (iii. 186). Ibn &#8216;Abbas (further) said: Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) asked them about something and then they concealed that and they told him something else and they went out and they thought that they had informed him as lie had asked them and they felt happy of what they had concealed.</p>

Is it your personal opinion or something you got from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him)? &#8216;Ammar said: We have got nothing from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) which people at large did not get, but Hudhaifa told me that Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) had especially told him amongst his Companion, that there would be twelve hypocrites out of whom eight would not get into Paradise, until a camel would be able to pass through the needle hole. The ulcer would be itself sufficient (to kill) eight. So far as four are concerned, I do not remember what Shu&#8217;ba said about them.</p>

He said: It was not because of any covenant that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) got from us which he did get from other people, and he further said that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said:&#8221; In my Ummah.&#8221; And I think that Hudhaifa reported to me and according to Ghundar (the words are) that he said: In my Ummah, there would be twelve hypocrites and they would not be admitted to Paradise and they would not smell its odour, until the camel would pass through a needle&#8217;s hole. Dubaila (ulcer) would be enough to (torment them) -a kind of flame of Fire which would appear in their shoulders and it would protrude from their chest.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Tufail reported that there was a dispute between Hudhaifa and one from the people of Aqaba as it happens amongst people. He said: I adjure you by Allah to tell me as to how many people from Aqaba were. The people said to him (Hudhaifa) to inform him as he had asked. We have been informed that they were fourteen and If you are to be counted amongst them, then they would be fifteen and I state by Allah that twelve amongst them were the enemies of Allah and of His Messenger (may peace be upon him) in this world. The rest of the three put forward this excuse: We did not hear the announcement of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and we were not aware of the intention of the people as he (the Holy Prophet) had been in the hot atmosphere. He (the Holy Prophet) then said: The water is small in quantity (at the next station). So nobody should go ahead of me, but he found people who had gone ahead of him and he cursed them on that day.</p>

So the first to take their horses were the people of Banu Khazraj. Then there was a ceaseless flow of persons and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to them: All of you are those who have been pardoned except the owner of a red camel. We came to him and said to him: You also come on, so that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) may seek forgiveness for you. But he said: By Allah, so far as I am concerned, the finding of something lost is dearer to me than seeking of forgiveness for me by your companion (the Holy Prophet), and he remained busy in finding out his lost thing.</p>

He ran away as a rebel and joined the People of the Book. They gave it much importance and said: He is the person who used to transcribe for Muhammad and they were much pleased with him. Time rolled on that Allah caused his death. They dug the grave and buried him therein, but they found to their surprise that the earth had thrown him out over the surface. They again dug the grave for him and buried him but the earth again threw him out upon the surface. They again dug the grave for him and buried him but the earth again threw him out upon the surface. At last they left him unburied.</p>

Thereupon Abu Bakr wept and he wept bitterly and said: Let our fathers and our mothers be taken as ransom for you. It was Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) who had been given the choice and Abu Bakr knew it better than us, and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) is reported to have said: Behold, of all people the most generous toward me in regard to his companionship and his property was Abu Bakr and were I to choose anyone as my bosom friend, I would have chosen Abu Bakr as my dear friend, but (for him) I cherish Islamic brotherliness and love. There shall be left open no window in the mosque except Abu Bakr&#8217;s window.</p>

He took hold of the leathern bucket from my hand so that he should serve water to the people. He drew two bucketfuls and there was some weakness in his drawing (Allah may forgive him). Then there came Ibn Khattab and he took hold of that, and I did not see a person stronger than he (drawing water) until the people went away with their thirst quenched and the tank filled with water.</p>

He (Abu Musa Ash&#8217;ari) said: I followed his steps asking about him until I came to Bi&#8217;r Aris (it is a well in the suburb of Medina). I sat by its wooden door until Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had relieved himself and then performed ablution.

Thereupon he said: Admit him and give him glad tidings of Paradise. I came and I said to Abu Bakr to get in (and also told him) that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was giving him the glad tidings of Paradise. Abu Bakr got in and sat on the right side of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and dangled his feet in the well as Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had done, and he uncovered his shanks. I then returned and sat there and I had left my brother as he had been performing ablution and he was to meet me and I said: If Allah would intend goodness for such and such he would intend goodness for his brother and He would bring him. I was thinking this that a person stirred the door. I said: Who is it. He said: This is Umar b., Khattab. I said: Wait. Then I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), greeted him and said: Here is &#8216;Umar seeking your. permission to get in.

He got in and sat on the left side of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) with his feet dangling in the well. I then returned and sat and said: If Allah would intend goodness for such and such (that is for his brother), He would bring him. And I was contemplat- ing over it that a man stirred the door and I said: Who is it? He said: This is Uthman b. Affan. I said: Wait, please. I then came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and informed him. and he said: Admit him and give him glad tidings (and inform) him of the turmoil which he shall have to face. I came and said: Get in, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) gives you the glad tidings of Paradise along with the trial which you shall have to face. He got in and saw the elevated plan round the well fully occupied. He sat on the other side.

Abi Sufyin appointed Sa&#8217;d as the Governor and said: What prevents you from abusing Abu Turab (Hadrat &#8216;Ali), whereupon be said: It is because of three things which I remember Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) having said about him that I would not abuse him and even if I find one of those three things for me, it would be more dear to me than the red camelg. I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) say about &#8216;Ali as he left behind hrin in one of his campaigns (that was Tabuk). &#8216;All said to him: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, you leave me behind along with women and children. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to him: Aren&#8217;t you satisfied with being unto me what Aaron was unto Moses but with this exception that there is no prophethood after me. And I (also) heard him say on the Day of Khaibar: I would certainly give this standard to a person who loves Allah and his Messenger and Allah and his Messenger love him too. He (the narrator) said: We have been anxiously waiting for it, when he (the Holy Prophet) said: Call &#8216;Ali. He was called and his eyes were inflamed. He applied saliva to his eyes and handed over the standard to him, and Allah gave him victory. (The third occasion is this) when the (following) verse was revealed:&#8221; Let us summon our children and your children.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) called &#8216;Ali, Fitima, Hasan and Husain and said: O Allah, they are my family.</p>

Zaid, you have in fact earned a great virtue. Zaid, narrate to us what you heard from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him).

He exhorted (us) (to hold fast) to the Book of Allah and then said: The second are the members of my household I remind you (of your duties) to the members of my family. He (Husain) said to Zaid: Who are the members of his household? Aren&#8217;t his wives the members of his family? Thereupon he said: His wives are the members of his family (but here) the members of his family are those for whom acceptance of Zakat is forbidden. And he said: Who are they?

She passed three days in this state until she fainted because of extreme hunger and at that time her son whose name was Umara stood up and served her drink and she began to curse Sa&#8217;d that Allah, the Exalted and Glorions, revealed these verses of the Holy Qur&#8217;an:&#8221; And We have enjoined upon a person goodness to his parents but if they contend with thee to associate (others) with Me of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not&#8221; (xxix. 8) ; Treat thein with customary good in this world&#8221; (xxxi. 15).

I picked that up and came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Bestow this sword upon me (as my share in the spoils of war) and you know my state. Thereupon he said: Return it to the place from where you picked it up. I went back until I decided to throw it in a store but my soul repulsed me so I came back and asked him to give that sword to me. He said in a loud voice to return it to the place from where I had picked it up. It was on this occasion that this verse was revealed:&#8221; They asked about the spoils of war&#8221; (viii. 1). He further said: I once fell ill and sent a message to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). He visited me and I said to him: Permit me to distribute (in charity) my property as much as I like. He did not agree. I said: (Permit me to distribute) half of it. He did not agree. I said: (Permit me to distribute) the third part, whereupon he kept quiet and it was after this (that the distribution of one&#8217;s property in charity) to the extent of one-third was held valid. He further said: I came to a group of persons of the Ansir and Muhajirin and they said: Come, so that we may serve you wine, and it was before the use of wine had been prohibited. I went to them in a garden and there had been with them the roasted head of a camel and a small water-skin containing wine. I ate and drank along with them and there came under discussion the Ansr (Helpers) and Muhajirin (immigrants). I said: The immigrants are better than the Ansar, that a person picked up a portion of the head (of the camel and struck me with it that my nose was injured. I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and informed him of the situation that Aliah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed verses pertaining to wine:&#8221; Intoxicants and the games of chance and (sacrificing to) stones set up and (divining by) arrows are only an uncleanliness, the devil&#8217;s work&#8221; (v. 90).</p>

She ouaht permission to get in as he had been lying with me in my mantle.

She (&#8216;A&#8217;isha) said: I kept quiet. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to her (Fatima): 0 daughter, don&#8217;t you love whom I love? She said: Yes, (I do). Thereupon he said: I love this one. Fatima then stood up as she heard this from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and went to the wives of Allatt&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and informed them of what she had said to him and what Allah&#8217;s messenger (may peace be upon him) had said to her. Thereupon they said to her: We think that you have been of no avail to us. You may again go to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and tell him that his wives seek equity in case of the daughter of Abu Quhafa. Fitima said: By Allah, I will never talk to him about this matter. &#8216;A&#8217;isha (further) reported: The wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) then sent Zainab b. jahsh, the wife of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him), and she was one who was somewhat equal in rank with me in the eyes of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and I have never seen a woman more advanced in religious piety than Zainab, more God-conscious, more truthful, more alive to the ties of blood, more generous and having more. sense of self-sacrifice in practical life and having more charitable disposition and thus more close to God, the Exalted, than her. She, however, lost temper very soon but was soon calm. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) permitted her to enter as she (&#8216;A&#8217;isha) was along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in her mantle, in the same very state when Fatima had entered. She said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, your wives have sent me to you seeking equity in case of the daughter of Abu Quhafa. She then came to me and showed harshness to me and I was seeing the eyes of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) whether he would permit me. Zainab went on until I came to know that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) would not disapprove if I retorted. Then I exchanged hot words until I made her quiet.

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;A&#8217;isha reported that (one day) there sat together eleven women making an explicit promise amongst themselves that they would conceal nothing about their spouses. The first one said: My husband is a sort of the meat of a lean camel placed at the top of a hill, which it is difficult to climb up, nor (the meat) is good enough that one finds in oneself the urge to take it away (from the top of that mountain).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second one said: My husband (is so bad) that I am afraid I would not be able to describe his faults-both visible and invisible completely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third one said: My husband is a long-statured fellow (i. e. he lacks intelligence). If I give vent to my feelings about him, he would divorce me, and if I keep quiet I would be made to live in a state of suspense (neither completely abandoned by him nor entertained as wife).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth one said: My husband is like the night of Tihama (the night of Hijaz and Mecca), neither too cold nor hot, neither there is any fear of him nor grief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fifth one said: My husband is (like) a leopard as he enters the house, and behaves like a lion when he gets out, and he does not ask about that which he leaves in the house.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sixth one said: So far as my husband is concerned, he eats so much that nothing is left back and when he drinks he drinks that no drop is left behind. And when he lies down he wraps his body and does not touch me so that he may know my grief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The seventh one said: My husband is heavy in spirit, having no brightness in him, impotent, suffering from all kinds of conceivable diseases, heaving such rough manners that he may break my head or wound my body, or may do both.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eighth one said: My husband is as sweet as the sweet-smelling plant, and as soft as the softness of the hare.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ninth one said: My husband is the master of a lofty building, long-statured, having heaps of ashes (at his door) and his house is near the meeting place and the inn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tenth one said: My husband is Malik, and how fine Malik is, much above appreciation and praise (of mine). He has many folds of his camel, more in number than the pastures for them. When they (the camels) hear the sound of music they become sure that they are going to be slaughtered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eleventh one said: My husband is Abu Zara&#8217;. How fine Abu Zara&#8217; is! He has suspended in my ears heavy ornaments and (fed me liberally) that my sinews and bones are covered with fat. So he made me happy. He found me among the shepherds living in the side of the mountain, and he made me the owner of the horses, camels and lands and heaps of grain and he finds no fault with me. I sleep and get up in the morning (at my own sweet will) and drink to my heart&#8217;s content. The mother of Abu Zara&#8217;, how fine is the mother of Abu Zara&#8217;! Her bundles are heavily packed (or receptacles in her house are filled to the brim) and the house quite spacious. So far as the son of Abu Zara&#8217; is concerned, his bed is as soft as a green palm-stick drawn forth from its bark, or like a sword drawn forth from its scabbard, and whom just an arm of a lamb is enough to satiate. So far as the daughter of Abu Zara&#8217; is concerned, how fine is the daughter of Abu Zara&#8217;, obedient to her father, obedient to her mother, wearing sufficient flesh and a source of jealousy for her co-wife. As for the slave-girl of Abu Zara&#8217;, how fine is she; she does not disclose our affairs to others (outside the four walls of the house). She does not remove our wheat, or provision, or take it forth, or squander it, but she preserves it faithfully (as a sacred trust). And she does not let the house fill with rubbish. One day Abu Zara&#8217; went out (of his house) when the milk was churned in the vessels, that he met a woman, having two children like leopards playing with her pomegranates (chest) under her vest. He divorced me (Umm Zara&#8217;) and married that woman (whom Abu Zara&#8217;) met on the way. I (Umm Zara&#8217;) later on married another person, a chief, who was an expert rider, and a fine archer: he bestowed upon me many gifts and gave me one pair of every kind of animal and said: Umm Zara&#8217;, make use of everything (you need) and send forth to your parents (but the fact) is that even if I combine all the gifts that he bestowed upon me, they stand no comparison to the least gift of Abu Zara&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;A&#8217;isha reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to me: I am for you as Abu Zara&#8217; was for Umm Zara&#8217;.</p>

I said to him: No. He again said to me: Would you not give me the sword of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) for I fear that the people may snatch it from you? By Allah, if you give that to me, no one would be able to take it away, so long as there is life in me. Verily &#8216;Ali b. Abi Talib sent a proposal of marriage to the daughter of Abu Jahl in spite of (the fact that his wife) Fatima (had been living in his house). Thereupon I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) say while addressing the people on the pulpit. I was adolescing in those days. He said: Fatima is a part of me and I fear that she may be put to trial in regard to religion. He then made a mention of his son-in law who had been from the tribe of &#8216;Abd Shams and praised his behaviour as a son-in-law and said: Whatever he said to me he told the truth and whatever he promised he fulfilled it for me. I am not going to declare forbidden what is lawful and make lawful what is forbidden, but, by Allah, the daaghter of Allah&#8217;s Messenger and the daughter of the enemy of Allah can never be combined at one place.</p>

When Fatima heard about it, she came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and said: The people say that you never feel angry on account of your daughters and now &#8216;Ali is going to marry the daughter of Abu Jahl. Makhramah said: Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) rose up and I heard him reciting Tashahhud and say: Now to the point. I gave a daughter of mine (Zainab) to Abu&#8217;l-&#8216;As b. Rabi, and he spoke to me and spoke the truth. Verily Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad, is a part of me and I do not approve that she may be put to any trial and by Allah, the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Messenger cannot be combined with the daughter of God&#8217;s enemy (as the co-wives) of one person.

When he talked to me secretly for the first time he informed me that Gabirel was in the habit of reciting the Qur&#8217;an along with him once or twice every year, but this year it had been twice and so he perceived his death quite near, so fear Allah and be patient (and he told me) that he would be a befitting forerunner for me and so I wept as you saw me.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas reported that the son of Abu Talba who was born of Umm Sulaim died. She (Umm Sulaim) said to the members of her family: Do not narrate to Abu Talha about his son until I narrate it to him. Abu Talha came (home) ; she presented to him the supper. He took it and drank water. She then embellished herself which she did not do before. He (Abu Talha) had a sexual intercourse with her and when she saw that he was satisfied after sexual intercourse with her, she said: Abu Talha, if some people borrow something from another family and then (the members of the family) ask for its return, would they resist its return? He said: No. She said: I inform you about the death of your son. He was annoyed, and said: You did not inform me until I had a sexual intercourse with you and you later on gave me information about my son. He went to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and informed him what had happened. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: May Allah bless both of you in the night spent by you! He (the narrator) said: She became pregnant. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace he upon him) was in the course of a journey and she was along with him and when Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came back to Medina from the journey he did not enter (his house) (during the night). When the people came near Medina, she felt the pangs of delivery. He (Abu Talha) remained with her and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) proceeded on. Abu Talha said: O Lord, you know that I love to go along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger when he goes out and enter along with him when he enters and I have been detained as Thou seest. Umm Sulaim said: Abu Talha, I do not feel (so much pain) as I was feeling formerly, so better proceed on. So we proceeded on and she felt the pangs of delivery as they reached (Medina) and a child was born and my mother said to me: Anas, none should suckle him until you go to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) tomorrow morning. And when it was morning I carried him (the child) and went along with him to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace beupon him). He said: I saw that he had in his hand the instrument for the cauterisation of the camels. When he saw me. he said: This is, perhaps, what Umm Sulaim has given birth to. I said: Yes. He laid down that instrument on the ground. I brought that child to him and placed it in his lap and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) asked Ajwa dates of Medina to be brought and softened them in his month. When these had become palatable he placed them in the mouth of that child. The child began to taste them. Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: See what love the Ansar have for dates. He then wiped his face and named him &#8216;Abdullah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah b. Samit reported that Abu Dharr said: We set out from our tribe Ghafir who look upon the prohibited months as permissible months. I and my brother Unais and our mother stayed with our maternal uncle who treated us well. The men of his tribe fell jealous and they said: When you are anay from your house, Unais commits adultery with your wife. Our -naternal uncle came and he accused us of the sin which was conveyed to him. I said: You have undone the good you did to us. We cannot stay with you after this. We came to our camels and loaded (our) luggage. Our maternal uncle began to weep covering himself with (a piece of) cloth. We proceeded on until we encamped by the side of Mecca. Unais cast lot on the camels (we had) and an equal number (above that). They both went to a Kahin and he made Unais win and Unais came with our camels and an equal number along with them. He (Abu Dharr) said: My nephew, I used to observe prayer three years before my meeting with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). I said: For whom did you say prayer? He said: For Allah. I said: To which direction did you turn your face (for observing prayer)? He said: I used to turn my face as Allah has directed me to turn my face. I used to observe the night prayer at the time of the end of night and I fell down in prostration like the mantle until the sun rose over me. Unais said: I have a work in Mecca, so you better stay here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unais went until he came to Mecca and he came to me late. I said: What did you do? He said: I met a person in Mecca who is on your religion and he claims that verily it is Allah Who has sent him. I said: What do the people say about him? He said: They say that he is a poet or a Kahin or a magician. Unais who was himself one of the poets said. I have heard the words of a Kahin but his words in no way resemble his (words). And 1 also compared his words to the verses of poets but such words cannot be uttered by any poet. By Allah, he is truthful and they are liars. Then I said: you stay here, until I go, so that I should see him. He said: I came to Mecca and I selected an insignificant person from amongst them and said to him: Where is he whom you call as-Sabi? He pointed out towards me saying: He is Sabi. Thereupon the people of the valley attacked me with sods and bows until I fell down unconscious. I stood up after havin. regained my consciousness and I found as if I was a red idol. I came to Zamzarn and washed blood from me and drank water from it and listen, O son of my brother, I stayed there for thirty nights or days and there was no food for me but the water of Zamzarn. And I became so bulky that there appeared wrinkles upon my stomach, and I did not feel any hunger in my stomach. It was during this time that the people of Mecca slept in the moonlit night and none was there to eircumambulate the House but only two women who had been invoking the name of Isafa, and Na&#8217;ila (the two idols).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They came to me while in their circuit and I said: Marry one with the other, but they did not dissuade from their invoking. They came to me and I said to them: Insert wood (in the idols&#8217; private parts). (I said this to them in such plain words) as I could not express in metaphorical terms. These women went away crying and saying: Had there been one amongst our people (he would have taught a lesson to you for the obscene words used for our idols before us). These women met Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and Abu Bakr who had also been coming down the hill. He asked them: What has happened to you? They said: There is Sabi, who has hidden himself between the Ka&#8217;ba and its curtain. He said: What did he say to you? They said: He uttered such words before us as we cannot express. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came and he kissed the Black Stone and circumambulated the House along with his Companion and then observed prayer, and when he had finished his prayer, Abu Dharr said: I was the first to greet him with the salutation of peace and uttered (these words) in this way; Allah&#8217;s Messen- ger, may there be peace upon you, whereupon he said: It may be upon you too and the mercy of Allah. He then said: Who are you? I said: From the tribe of Ghifar. He leaned his hand and placed his finger on his forehead and I said to myself: Perhaps he has not liked it that I belong to the tribe of Ghifar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I attempted to catch hold of his hand but his friend who knew about him more than I dissuaded me f rom doing so. He then lifted his head and said: Since how long have you been here? I said: I have been here for the last thirty nights or days. He said: Who has been feeding you? I said: There has been no food for me but the water of Zamzam. I have grown so bulky that there appear wrinkles upon my stomach and I do not feel any hunger. He said: It is blessed (water) and it also serves as food. Thereupon Abu Bakr said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, let me serve as a host to him for tonight, and then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) proceeded forth and so did Abu Bakr and I went along with them. Abu Bakr opened the door and then he brought for us the raisins of Ta&#8217;if and that was the first food which I ate there. Then I stayed as long as I had to stay. I then came to Allah&#8217;s Messenaer (may peace be upon him) and he said: I have been shown the land abound- ing in trees and I think it cannot be but that of Yathrib (that is the old name of Medina). You are a preacher to your people on my behalf. I hope Allah would benefit them through you and He would reward you. I came to Unais and he said: What have you done? I said: I have done that I have embraced Islam and I have testified (to the prophethood of Allah&#8217;s Messenger). He said: I have no aversion for your religion and I also embrace Islam and testify (to the prophethood of Muhammad). Then both of us came to our mother and she said: I have no aversion for your religion and I also embrace Islam and testify to the prophethood of Muhammad. We then loaded our camels and came to our tribe Ghifir and half of the tribe embraced Islam and their chief was Aimi&#8217; b. Rahada Ghifirl and he was their leader and hall of the tribe said: We will embrace Islam when Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may p,. ace be upon him) would come to Medina, and when Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to Medina the remaining half also embraced Islam. Then a tribe Aslam came to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, we also embrace Islam like our brothers who have embraced Islam. And they also embraced Islam. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Allah granted pardon to the tribe of Ghifar and Allah saved (from destruction) the tribe of Aslam.</p>

Listen to his words and then come to me. So he rode on until he came to Mecca and he heard his words (the sacred words of the Holy Prophet) and then came back to Abu Dharr and said: I have seen him exhorting (people) to develop good morals and his expressions can in no way be termed as poetry. He (Abu Dharr) said: I have not been satisfied with it regarding that which I had in my mind (as I sent you). So he took up provisions for the journey and a small water-skin con- taining water (and set forth) until he came to Mecca. He came to the mosque (Ka&#8217;ba) and began to find out Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and he did not re- cognise him (the Holy Prophet) and he did not even like that he should ask about him from anyone until it was night, and he slept. &#8216;All saw him and found him to be a stranger. So he went with him. He followed hive but one did not make any inquiry from the other about anything until it was morning. He then brought the water and his provisions to the mosque and spent a day there, but he did not see Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) until it was night. He then returned to his bed that there happened to pass &#8216;Ali and he said: This man has not been able to find his destination until this time. He made him stand and he went with him and no one made an in- quiry from his companion about anything. And when it was the third day he did the same. &#8216;Ali made him stand up and brought him along with him. He said: By Him, besides Whom there is no god, why don&#8217;t you tell me (the reason) which brought you here to this town? He said: (I shall do this) provided you hold me promise and a covenant that you would guide me aright. He then did that. He (&#8216;Ali) said: Verily, he Is truthful and he is a Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and when it is morning, follow me and if I would say anything from which I would sense fear about you I would stand (in a manner) as if I was throwing water and if I move on, you then follow me until I get in (some house). He did that and I followed him until he came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). He entered (the house) of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) along with him and listened to his words and embraced Islam at his very place. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said to him: Go to your people and inform them until my command reaches you. Thereupon he said: By Him in Whose Hand is my life, I shall say to the people of Mecca this thing at the top of my voice So he set forth until he came to the mosque and then spoke at the top of his voice (saying): I bear testimony to the fact that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. The people attacked him and made him fall down when &#8216;Abbas came and he leaned over him and said: Woe be upon you, don&#8217;t you know that he is from amongst the tribe of Ghifar and your trad- ing route to Syria passes through (the settlements of this tribe), and he rescued him. He (Abu Dharr) did the same on the next day and they (the Meccans) again attacked him and Abbas leaned upon him and he rescued him.</p>

Some people said: He is a person from amongst the people of Paradise; he is a person from amongst the people of Paradise. He observed two short rak&#8217;ahs of prayer and then went out. I followed him and he got into his house and I also got in and we began to converse with each other. And when he became familiar (with me) I said to Him: When you entered (the mosque) before (your entrance in the house) a person said so and so (that you are amongst the people of Paradise), whereupon he said: It is not meet for anyone to say anything which he does not know. I shall (now) tell you why they (say) this. I saw a dream during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and narrated it to him. I seemed to be in a garden [he described its vastness, its rich fructification and its verdure]; in the midst of it, there stood an iron pillar, with its base in the earth and its summit in the sky: and upon its summit there was a handhold. It was said to me: Climb up this (pillar). I said to him (visitant in the dream): I am unable to do it. Thereupon a helper came to me, and he (supported) me (by catching hold of my) garment from behind and thus helped me with his hand and so I climbed up till I was at the summit of the pillar, and grasped the handhold. It was said to me: Ho d it tightly. It was at this that I woke up when (the handhold) was in fthe grip) of my hand. I narrated it (the dream) to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him), whereupon he said: That garden implies al-Islam and that pillar implies the pillar of Islam. And that handhold is the firmest faith (as refered to in the Qur&#8217;an). And you will remain attached to Islam until you shall die. And that man was &#8216;Abdullah b. Salim.</p>

I said to him: As you stood up, I heard people say about you: He who is desirous of seeing a person from among the people of Paradise should look at him. So I became desirous of accompanying you. He (&#8216;Abdullah b. Salim) said: It is Allah Who knows best about the people of Paradise. I would, however, narrate to you as to why they said like it.

(So I stood up) and he caught hold of my hand and I walked along with him, and, lo, I found some paths on my left and I was about to set out upon them. Thereupon he said to me Do not set yourself on (them) for these are the paths of the leftists (denizens of Hell-fire). Then there were paths leading to the right side, whereupon he said: Set yourself on these paths. We came across a hill and he said to me: Climb up, and I attempted to climb up that I fell upon my buttocks. I made several attempts (but failed to succeed). He led until he came to a pillar (so high) that its upper end touched the sky and its base was in the earth. And there was a handhold at its upper end. He said to me Climb over it. I said: How can I climb upon it, as its upper end touches the sky? He cought hold of my hand and pushed me up and I found myself suspended with the handhold. He then struck the pillar and it fell down, but I remained attached to that handhold until it was morning (and the dream was thus over). I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and narrated it to him. He said: So far as the paths which you saw on your left are concerned, these are paths of the leftists (denizens of Hell) and the paths which you saw on your right, these are the paths of the rightists (the dwellers of Paradise) and the mountain represents the destination of the martyrs which you would not be able to attain. The pillar implies the pillar of Islam. and so far as the handhold is concerned, it implies the handhold of Islam, and you would hold to it fastly until you would meet death.</p>

Satirise against the (non-believing amongst the) Quraish, for (the satire) is more grievous to them than the hurt of an arrow. So he (the Holy Prophet) sent (someone) to Ibn Rawiha and asked him to satirise against them, and he composed a satire, but it did not appeal to him (to the Holy Prophet). He then sent (someone) to Ka&#8217;b b. Malik (to do the same, but what he composed did not appeal to the Holy Prophet). He then sent one to Hassan b. Thabit. As he got into his presence, Hassan said: Now you have called for this lion who strikes (the enemies) with his tail. He then brought out his tongue and began to move it and said: By Him Who has sent you with Truth, I shall tear them with my tongue as the leather is torn. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Don&#8217;t be hasty; (let) Abu Bakr who has the best know- ledge of the lineage of the Quraish draw a distinction for you in regard to my lineage, as my lineage is thesame as theirs. Hassan then came to him (Abu Bakr) and after making inquiry (in regard to the lineage of the Holy Prophet) came back to him (the holy Prophet) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, he (Abu Bakr) has drawn a distinction in vour lineage (and that of the Quraish) By Him Who has sent you with Truth, I shall draw out from them (your name) as hair is drawn out from the flour. &#8216;A&#8217;isha said: I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying to Hassin: Verily Ruh-ul- Qudus would continue to help you so long as you put up a defence on behalf of Allah and His Messenger.

I invited her one day and she said to me something about Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) which I hated. I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) weeping and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I invited my mother to Islam but she did not accept (my invitation). I invited her today but she said to me something which I did not like. (Kindly) supplicate Allah that He may set the mother of Abu Huraira right. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: O Allah, set the mother of Abu Huraira on the right path. I came out quite pleased with the supplication of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and when I came near the door it was closed from within. My mother heard the noise of my footsteps and she said: Abu Huraira, just wait, and I heard the noiee of falling of water. She took a bath and put on the shirt and quickly covered her head with a headdress and opened the door and then said: Abu Huraira, I bear witness to the fact that there is no god but Allah and Mubammad is His bondsman and His Messenger. He (Abu Huraira) said: I went back to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and (this time) I was shedding the tears of joy. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, be happy, for Allah has responded to your supplication and He has set on the right path the mother of Abu Huraira. He (the Holy Prophet) praised Allah, and extolled Him and uttered good words. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, supplicate to Allah so that He may instil love of mine and that of my mother too in the believing servants and let our hearts be filled with their love, whereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: O Allah, let there be love of these servants of yours, i. e. Abu Huraira and his mother, in the hearts of the believing servants and let their hearts be filled with the love of the believing servants. (Abu Huraira said: This prayer) was so well granted by Allah that no believer was ever born who heard of me and who saw me but did not love me.</p>

I was hearing while I was engaged in extolling Allah (reciting Subhan Allah) constantly. He stood up before I finished my repetition of Subhan Allah. if I were to meet him I would have warned him in stern words that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) did not speak so quickly as you talk. Ibn Shihab transmitted on the authority of Ibn Musayyib that Abu Huraira said: People say that Abu Huraira transmits so many ahadith, whereas Allah is the Reckoner, and they say: How is it with Muhajirs and the Ansar that they do not narrate ahadith like him (like Abu Huraira)? Abu Huraira said: I tell you that my brothers from Ansar remained busy with their lands and my brothers Muhajirs were busy in transactions in the bazars, but I always kept myself attached to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) with bare subsistence. I remained present (in the company of the Holy Prophet), whereas they had been absent. I retained in my mind (what the Holy Prophet said), whereas they forgot it. One day Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who amongst you spreads the cloth and listens to my talk and would then press it against his chest would never forget anything heard from me. So I spread my mantle and when he had concluded his talk I then pressed it against my chest and so I never forgot after that day anything that he (the Holy Prophet) said.

Sufyan said: He was their ally but had no relationship with them. (Hatib further said): Those who are with you amongst the emigrants have blood-relationship with them (the Quraish) and thus they would protect their families. I wished that when I had no blood-relationship with them I should find some supporters from (amongst them) who would help my family. I have not done this because of any unbelief or apostasy and I have no liking for the unbelief after I have (accepted) Islam.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Musa reported: We were in Yemen when we heard of the migration of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). We also set out as immigrants to him. And I was accompanied by two brothers of mine, I being the youngest of them; one of them was Abu Burda and the other one was Abu Ruhm, and there were some other persons with them. Some say they were fifty-three or fifty-two persons of my tribe. We embarked upon a boat, and the boat sailed away to the Negus of Abyssinia. There we met Ja&#8217;far b. Abu Talib and his companions. Ja&#8217;far said: Allall&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has sent us here and has commanded us to stay here and you should also stay with us. So we stayed with him and we came back (to Medina) and met Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) when Khaibar had been conquered. He (the Holy Prophet) allocated a share to us and in the ordinary course he did not allocate the share to one who had been absent on the occasion of the conquest of Khaibar but conferred (a share) upon him only who had been present there with him. He, however, made an exception for the people of the boat, viz. for Ja&#8217;far and his companions. He allocated a share to them, and some persons from amongst the people said to us, viz. the people of the boat: We have preceded you in migration. Asma&#8217; bint &#8216;Umais who had migrated to Abyssinia and had come back along with them (along with immigrants) visited Hafsa, the wife of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). (Accordingly), Umar had been sitting with her (Hafsa). As &#8216;Umar saw Asma, he said: Who is she? She (Hafsa) said: She is Asma, daughter of &#8216;Umais. He said: She is an Abyssinian and a sea-woman. Asma said: Yes, it is so. Thereupon &#8216;Umar said: We preceded you in migration and so we have more right to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as compared with you. At this she felt annoyed and said: &#8216;Umar, you are not stating the fact; by Allah, you had the privilege of being in the company of the Messenger (may peace be upon him) who fed the hungry among you and instructed the ignorant amongst you, whereas we had been far (from here) in the land of Abyssinia amongst the enemies and that was all for Allah and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and, by Allah, I would never take food nor take water unless I make a mention to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) of what you have said. We remained in that country in constant trouble and dread and I shall talk about it to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (way peace be upon him) and ask him (about it). By Allah, I shall not tell a lie and deviate (from the truth) and add anything to that. So, when Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) came, she said: Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8216;Umar says so and so. Upon this Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: His right is not more than yours, for him and his companions there is one migration, but for you, i. e. for the people of the boat, there are two migrations. She said: I saw Abu Musa and the people of the boat coming to me in groups and asking me about this hadith, because there was nothing more pleasing and more significant for them than this. Abu Burda reported that Asma said: I saw Abu Musa, asking me to repeat this hadith to him again and again.</p>

And when you see two persons falling into dispute amongst themselves for the space of a brick, than get out of that. He (Abu Dharr) said: I saw Abd al-Rahman b. Shurahbil b. Hasana and his brother Rabi&#8217;a disputing with one another for the space of a brick. So I left that (land).</p>

He came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and narrated to him (the story of atrocities perpetrated upon him by the people of the tribe). Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: If you were to come to the people of &#8216;Uman, they would have neither reviled you nor beaten you.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Naufal reported: I saw (the dead body) of Abdullah b. Zubair hanging on the road of Medina (leading to Mecca). The Quraish passed by it and other people too, that Abdullah b. Umar happened to pass by it. He stood up there and said: May there be peace upon you, Abu Khubaib (the Kunya of Hadrat &#8216;Abdullah b. Zubair), may there be peace upon you Abu Khubaib, may there be peace upon you, Abu Khubaib! By Allah, I used to forbid you from this; by Allah, I used to forbid you from this, by Allah I used to forbid you from this. By Allah, so far as I know, you had been very much devoted to fasting and prayer and you had been paying very much care to cementing the ties of blood. By Allah, the group to which you belong (are labelled) as (a) wicked (person) is indeed a fine group. Then &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Umar went away. The stand &#8216;Abdullah (b. &#8216;Umar) took in regard to the inhuman treatment (meted out to &#8216;Abdullah b. Zubair) and his words (in that connection) were conveyed to Hajjaj (b. Yusuf) and (as a consequence of that) he (the body of Abdullah b. Zubair) was brought down from the stump (the scaffold) by which it was hanging and thrown into the graves of the Jews. He (Hajjaj) sent (his messenger) to Asma&#8217; (bint Abu Bakr, &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s mother). But she refused to come. He again sent the messenger to her with the message that she must come, otherwise he would bring her forcibly catching hold of her hair. But she again refused and said: By Allah, I will not come to you until you send one to me who would drag me by pulling my hair. Thereupon he said: Bring me my shoes. He put on his shoes and walked on quickly swollen with vanity and pride until he came to her and said: How do you find what I have done with the enemy of Allah? She said: I find that you wronged him in this world, whereas he has spoiled your next life. It has been conveyed to me that you used to call him (&#8216;Abdullah b. Zubair) as the son of one having two belts. By Allah, I am indeed (a woman) of two belts. One is that with the help of which I used to suspend high the food of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and that of Abu Bakr (making it out of the reach) of animals and, so far as the second belt is concerned, that is the belt which no woman can dispense with. Verily Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) told us that in Thaqif, there would be born a great liar and great murderer. The liar we have seen, and as far as the murderer is concerned, I do not find anyone else besides you. &#8216;Thereupon he (Hajjaj) stood up and did not give any reply to her.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Jabir reported that &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy b. Salul used to say to his slave-girl: Go and fetch something for us by committing prostitution. It was in this connection that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed this verse:&#8221; And compel not your slave-girls to prostitution when they desire to keep chaste in order to seek the frail goods of this world&#8217;s life, and whoever compels them, then surely after their compulsion Allah is Forgiving, Merciful&#8221; (xxiv. 33).</p>

Zaid reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (way peace be    upon him) said: I stood at the door of Paradise and I found that the overwhelming majority    of those who entered therein was that of poor persons and the wealthy persons were    detained to get into that. The denizens of Hell were commanded to get into Hell, and I    stood upon the door of Fire and the majority amongst them who entered there was that of    women.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Umar reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may    peace be upon him) said: Three persons set out on a journey. They were overtaken by rain    and they had to find protection in a mountain cave where at its mouth there fell a rock of    that mountain and thus blocked them altogether. One of them said to the others: Look to    your good deeds that you performed for the sake of Allah and then supplicate Allah, the    Exalted, that He might rescue you (from this trouble). One of them said: 0 Allah, I had my    parents who were old and my wife and my small children also. I tended the flock and when I    came back to them in the evening, I milked them (the sheep, goats, cows, etc.) and first    served that milk to my parents. One day I was obliged to go out to a distant place in    search of fodder and I could not come back before evening and found them (the parents)    asleep. I milked the animals as I used to milk and brought milk to them and stood by their    heads avoiding to disturb them from sleep and I did not deem it advisable to serve milk to    my children before serving them. My children wept near my feet. I remained there in that    very state and my parents too until it was morning. And (0 Allah) if Thou art aware that I    did this in order to seek Thine pleasure, grant us riddance from this trouble. (The rock    slipped a bit) that they could see the sky. The second one said: 0 Allah, I had a female    cousin whom I loved more than the men love the women. I wanted to have sexual intercourse    with her; she refused but on the condition of getting one hundred dinirs. It was with very    great difficulty that I could collect one hundred dinirs and then paid them to her and    when I was going to have a sexual intercourse with her, that she said: Servant of Allah,    fear Allah and do not break the seal (of chastity) but by lawful means. I got up. 0 Allah,    if Thou art aware that I did this in order to seek Thine pleasure, rid us from this    trouble. The situation was somewhat eased for them. The third one said: Allah, I employed    a workman for a measure of rice. After he had finished his work I gave him his dues (in    the form of) a measure of rice, but he did not accept them. I used these rice as seeds,    and that gave a bumper crop and I became rich enough to have cows and flocks (in my    possession). He came to me and said: Fear Allah, and commit no crueltv upon me in regard    to my dues. I said to him: Takeaway this flock of cows and sheep. He said: Fear Allah and    do not make a fun of me. I said: I am not making a fun of you. You take the cows and the    flocks. So he took them. 0 Allah, if Thou art aware that I did it for Thine pleasure, case    the situation for us. And Allah relieved them from the rest of the trouble.</font></p>

The rest of the hadith is the same and    the additional words are:&#8221; A person amongst them said: 0 Allah, I had my aged parents    and I served them milk before I (served that) to my wife, children and my servants.&#8221;    And in case of the second one, the words are:&#8221; She avoided me until she was hard    pressed because of famine and she came to me and I gave her one hundred and twenty    diiiirs&#8221; And in cease of the third one (the words are):&#8221; I invested his wages,    and it brought profit and, as a result thereof, the merchandise increased and there was    abundance of goods.&#8221; And he (the narrator said) that they got out of the cave and    began to walk.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Whether the fate of man is predestined or he himself is the architect of it, is a question which has been very often discussed by scholars of all times. This problem is significantly important as no sensible man. not even the man in the street, can afford to ignore it. Faith in Taqdir (Destiny) has a very deep impact upon our lives and we always find our lives oscillating between determinism and freewill. As a man looks around himself and looks to his own self and within himself, he finds that there are hundred and one things in shaping and reshaping of which he has no hand, e. g. in determining the climate of the land in which he is born, in canalising the courses of rivers which flow therein and in determining the nature of the soil thereof. He finds himself absolutely powerless. As he looks to himself he finds that there are so many things In him which are beyond his control, viz. the measure of intellect he has been endowed with, the shape and form of his physical structure with which he has been sent to this world, and the inclinations and so many other qualities of head and heart which are embedded in his very nature. In all these aspects of life he finds himself helpless before the Great and Mighty Power that created him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, there are so many things in which man finds himself quite empowered. As he looks to the marvellous achievements of man despite all odds, he finds it difficult to believe that he is a mere puppet in the mighty hand of Nature. This problem of predestination and freewill, in which man finds his life hanging, has been adequately solved by the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah. We give below a brief summary of their elucidations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first principle which Islam lays down in regard to Taqdir is that man is neither completely the master of his fate nor is he bound to the blind law of predestination. So far as the sovereignty of Allah&#8217;s Will is concerned, it is all-pervading and nothing falls outside its orbit. Not even a leaf, therefore, stirs without His Will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is His Will that prevails everywhere. To God belongs the sovereignty of Heavens and the Earth. He created what He pleaseth, giving to whom He pleaseth females and to whom He pleaseth males or conjoining them males and females, and He maketh whom He pleaseth barren, verify He hath knowledge and power (xlii. 48).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Men are, therefore, completely subordinate to the overruling power of God, they cannot do anything unless God wills so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; Whom God guideth he is the rightly-guided. Whom he sendeth stray, thou wilt not find a patron to set him right (xviii. 16).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His mighty grasp is, therefore, over everything. The Almighty Lord, Who has created everything and has determined its nature and course, has in His infinite wisdom and mercy conferred upon man a limited autonomy according to which a man is free to do or not to do a certain thing. It is because of this autonomy enjoyed by man that he is hold accountable for his deeds. The concept of human responsibility and that of his answerability for his deeds and misdeeds becomes meaningless if he is supposed to be deprived of this autonomy. There are, a large number of verses in the Holy Qur&#8217;an which make a pointed reference to the autonomy conferred upon man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man shall have nothing but that what he strives for (liii. 39).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah does not change the condition of a people until they change it themselves (viii. 53; xiii. 11).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who strive in His path, are guided in the right path, while those who persist in denial and sinful livifig have their hearts sealed against faith (ii. 7, 26; iv. 155; v;. i. 102).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah does not compel belief and leaves the people free to believe or disbelieve (vi. 35, 150; xvi-. 9).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever has done an atorn&#8217;s weight of good shall meet with its reward and whoever has done an atom&#8217;s weight of evil shall meet with its consequences (xcix. 7-8).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It should be borne in mind in this connection that the word Taqdir used in the Qur&#8217;an does not always signify something predestined. It at times implies a measure or the latent potentialities or possibilities with which Allali created man and all things of Nature. For example: He created everything for its Destiny (or its Measure) (xxv. 2). In Sura 54, verse 9 (the words are): We created everything according to a Measure or Destiny. In both these verses Destiny impiies the inward reach of things, their latent potentialities or possibilities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The idea of Destiny as we find in the hadith that God wrote down the decrees regarding the created world fifty thousand years before He created the Heavens and the Earth does not in any way mean that God created a block Universe, finished off and complete, bound to the iron formulae of Nature. Here the idea behind Taqdir is that the creation of this universe is not accidental but something preplanned and pre-conceived and it was shaped according to the Grand Design of the Greatest Designer. There is no element of chance in the creation of this Universe. Everything is well-set and well-planned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The idea that Allah has a foreknowledge of everything that He created and the events unfold themselves exactly according to it, does not imply that human beings have been completely deprived of the freedom of action. The foreknowledge of God is an acknowledged fact, but it should not be interpreter in the sense of predestination, for if we do so we shall have to conceive of eternity as a storehouse of ready-made events, from which they drop one by one like particles of sand in a glass hour. If we take the foreknowledge to be a reflecting mirror we shall have to deprive the Creator and the Controller of the Universe of His Creative activity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr Muhammad Iqbal has shed a good deal of light over this problem. He says:&#8221; Divine knowledge must be conceived as a living creative activity to which the objects that appear to exist in their own right are organically related. By conceiving God&#8217;s knowledge as a kind of reflecting mirror, we no doubt save His fore-knowledge of future events, but it is obvious that we do so at the expense of His freedom. The future certainly pre-exists in the organic whole of God&#8217;s creative life, but it pre-exists as an open possibility, not as a fixed order of events with definite outlines.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We should bear in mind that the idea of put, present and future is something relative and is conceived by the inite wind of man. It is. however, a great now in the eye of the All-Seeing God. The whole expanse of eternity lies before Him in the shape of now. Knowledge is, therefore, an act of creative activity and not the mere reflection of it. When He decrees a thing it happens and He knows it before it happens. God in Islam is not, therefore, a prisoner of necenity. He is a free Creator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The concept of predestination in Islam, therefore, does not in any way mean helpless abandonment of oneself to otherwise unwelcome fate. It means rather co-operation with God, studying His will and bringing oneself into unison with His Planning Will. Destiny as conceived by Islam is, thus, by no stretch of imagination, fatal to the freedom of conduct and unfoldment of one&#8217;s inherent possibilities; it is a source of inspiration and encouragement and opens up vast fields of human activity. It is not a message of despondency and despair, but a source of solace, comfort and inspiration and a powerful means of evoking a sense of piety and humility and self-surrender to the Will of God. It does not inculcate in mind frustration and pessimism, making his life dark and dreary, devoid of hope and promise for the future, but it teaches him to put his heart and soul in the sublime work as assigned to him by his Master.</p>

The constituents of one of you are collected for forty days in his mother&#8217;s womb in the form of blood, after which it becomes a clot of blood in another period of forty days. Then it becomes a lump of flesh and forty days later Allah sends His angel to it with instructions concerning four things, so the angel writes down his livelihood, his death, his deeds, his fortune and misfortune. By Him, besides Whom there is no god, that one amongst you acts like the people deserving Paradise until between him and Paradise there remains but the distance of a cubit, when suddenly the writing of destiny overcomes him and he begins to act like the denizens of Hell and thus enters Hell, and another one acts in the way of the denizens of Hell, until there remains between him and Hell a distance of a cubit that the writing of destiny overcomes him and then he begins to act like the people of Paradise and enters Paradise.</p>

And your Lord decides as He desires and the angel then puts down that also and then says: My Lord, what about his age? And your Lord decides as He likes it and the angel puts it down.

He would not be questioned as to what He does, but they would be questioned; thereupon he said to me: May Allah have mercy upon you, I did not mean to ask you but for testing your intelligence.

Thereupon, he said: Of course, it happens as it is decreed by Destiny and preordained for them, and this view is confirmed by this verse of the Book of Allah, the Exalted and Glorious:&#8221; Consider the soul and Him Who made it perfect, then breathed into it its sin and its piety&#8221; (xci. 8).</p>

You did us harm and caused us to get out of Paradise. Adam said to him: You are Moses. Allah selected you (for direct conversation with you) and wrote with His own Hand the Book (Torah) for you. Despite this you blame me for an act which Allah had ordained for me forty years before He created me. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said:. This is how Adam came the better of Moses and Adam came the better of Moses.</p>

Then you caused the people to get down to the earth because of your lapse. Adam said: Are you that Moses whom Allah selected for His Messengership and for His conversation with him and conferred upon you the tablets, in which everything was clearly explained and granted you the audience in order to have confidential talk with you. What is your opinion, how long Torah would haye been written before I was created? Moses said: Forty years before. Adam said: Did you not see these words: Adam committed an error and he was enticed to (do so). He (Moses) said: Yes.

He (the narrator) further said: Mention was made before him about monkeys, and Mis&#8217;ar (one of the narrators) said: I think that (the narrator) also (made a mention) of the swine, which had suffered metamorphosis. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Verily, Allah did not cause the race of those which suffered metamorphosis to grow or they were not survived by young ones. Monkeys and swine had been in existence even before (the metamorphosis of the human beings).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadith has been reported on the authority of Mis&#8217;ar with the same chain of transmitters but with this variation that the hadith transmitted on the authority of Ibn Bishr and Waki&#8217;, the torment of the Hell-Fire and the torment of grave have been mentioned together (and there is no conjunction&#8221; iw&#8221; or&#8221; between them).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas&#8217;dd reported that Umm Habiba said: 0 Allah, enable me to derive benefit from my husband, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and from my father Abu Sufyan, and from my brother Mu&#8217;awiya. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to her: Verily, you have asked Allah about the durations of life already set, and the steps which you would take, and the sustenances the share of which is fixed. Nothing would take place earlier than its due time, and nothing would be deferred beyond that when it is due. So, if you were to ask Allah about your safety from the torment of Hell-Fire and from the torment of the grave, it would have been better for you. A person said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, what about those apes and swine which suffered metamorphosis? Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: Verily, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, did not destroy a people or did not torment a people, and let their race grow. Apes and swine had been even before that (when the deniers of truth were tormented and suffered metamorphosis). This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Sufyin through another chain of transmitters but with a slight variation of wording.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 10: </font></p>
<p>    </p>
<h3 align="center"><font><em>The Book of Transactions (Kitab  Al-Buyu`) </em></font>    </h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><br></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Honesty in commercial dealings is more strictly enjoined by  Islam than by any other religion. It is because Islam is a religion which regulates and  directs life in all its departments. It is not to be regarded, like the modern man&#8217;s  religion. as a personal, private affair, which has nothing to do with his economic and  political life. It is not merely a body of dogmas or a bundle of rites and rituals; it is  a practical code which governs life in all its spheres. Its laws are as effectively  operative in our commerce and politics as in our domestic life and social relations. Islam  censures political chicanery and economic exploitation as strongly as social excesses and  individual dishonesty. Indeed, a true Islamic society is based upon honesty, justice and  fraternity, and is absolutely intolerant of dishonesty in all its various forms. That is  the reason why perfect honesty in business and truthfulness in trade are much emphasised  by the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him). It will not be an exaggeration to say that  absolute honesty in business and commerce is really an Islamic concept. The Hindus and  Jews were (and still, are) worshippers of the Mammon. Both of them have been mercenary  nations, notorious for their greed. The pre-Islamic Christians. too, did not possess any  high standard of business morality. It was Prophet Muhammad (may peace be upon him) who,  on the one hand, urged his followers to adopt trade as their profession, and, on the other  band, exhorted them to observe truthfulness and honesty in their business transactions. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam lays the greatest emphasis on Qat Haldl (food earned  through lawful means). The pious among us believe that just as nasty food spolis our  physical health, similarly. food earned through unlawful means spoils our spiritual and  moral health. A man who liver on income derived through illicit means and fraudulent  practices cannot be morally advanced and spiritually elevated. If we try to comprehend the  exact, implications of the term Haram (unlawful) we can form an idea of the high standard  of morality on which Islam wants us to conduct our business. And, if business is conducted  strictly in accordance with the Islamic principles of commerce, there can be absolutely no  scope for any kind of commercial dishonesty varying from the simplest and most glaring  type of business fraud to the most cunning and subtle type of profiteering which is often  masked under a semblance of honesty. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam is most vehement in its condemnation of commercial  dishonesty. It denounced, in the strongest possible terms, all sorts of deceitful dealings  and illegal profits. It has disallowed all transactions not based upon justice and  fairplay The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him), while reprimanding the dishonest  dealer, said:&#8221; Laisa minna man gashshdna&#8221; (Whosoever deceives us is not one of  us). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>According to Imam Ghazali, a Muslim who makes up his mind  to adopt trade as a profession or to set up his own business should first acquire a  thorough understanding of the rules of business transactions codified in the Islamic  Shari&#8217;ah. Without such understanding he will go astray and fail into serious lapses making  his earning unlawful. No people in the world have ever attached so much importance to  lawful trading as did the early Muslims, nor has any other nation evinced such a dread of  unlawful trading as they did. That is why al-Ghazali said stress on a clear understanding  of the rules and laws governing business transactions as a necessary prerequisite to  adopting trade or business as a profession. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Holy Qur&#8217;an has stressed the importance of fairness in  business:&#8221; And, O my people, give full measure and weight justly, and defraud not men  of their things, and act not corruptly in the land making mischief. What remains with  Allah is better for you, if you are believers&#8221; (xi. 85-86). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In these words addressed by Hadrat Shu&#8217;aib to his people,  the Holy Qur&#8217;an enunciates the fundamental principles of commerce as follows </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>To give just measure and weight. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Not to withhold from the people the things that are their  due. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Not to commit evil on the earth with the intent of doing  mischief. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>To be contented with the profit that is left with us by God  after we have paid other people their due. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We are told in these verses that commerce can flourish  under conditions of peace and security. The people are, therefore, warned not to disturb  the peace of the land so that there is a free and untrammelled trade between different  parts of the world. In commercial relations we are expected to be absolutely just and  honest, liberally giving other people their due. We are not to be guilty of selfish greed  and not to indulge in profiteering; and we are told that the lawful profit which has God&#8217;s  blessings is the one that we are able to make through perfectly honest dealings with  others. The injunctions contained in these Qur&#8217;anic verses and found elsewhere in the Holy  Book close the door of all dishonest and unjust transactions. We should not forget that  justice is a master virtue. If we give others just measure and just weight that  tantamounts to saying that we should be fair and just in our dealings. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A careful study of&#8221; Kitab al-Buyu`&#8221; (the book  pertaining to business transactions) will reveal the fact that the Holy Prophet (may peace  be upon him) based business dealings strictly on truth and justice. He has strongly  disapproved all transactions which involve any kind of injustice or hardship to the buyer  or the seller. He wanted that both, the buyer and the seller, should be truly sympathetic  and considerate towards each other. One should not take undue advantage of the simplicity  or ignorance of the other. The seller should not think that he has unrestricted liberty to  extort as much as possible from the buyer. He has to be just; he should take his own due  and give the buyer what is his. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam, which condemns every kind of injustice and  exploitation in human relations, wants its followers to conduct business in a sublime  spirit of justice tempered with human kindness. The conduct of the seller in a transaction  should be characterised not only by Insaf (justice), but also by Ihsan  (magnanimity).&#8221; God will forgive the sins of a Muslim who absolves a fellow-Muslim  from a sale-contract not liked by the latter,&#8221; says the Holy Prophet (may peace be  upon him). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>All transactions should be based on the fundamental  principle of&#8221; Ta&#8217;auanu ala birri wa&#8217;t-taqwa&#8221; (mutual co-operation for the cause  of goodness or piety). A transaction not based upon this sound principle is not lawful.  Unlawful transactions are motivated by lust for money and an ignoble desire to build up  prestige. Islam strikes at the root of the passion for money and suggests a different  yardstick to measure the prestige of a person. The Holy Qur&#8217;an, on the one hand, condemns  hoarding and the excessive love for wealth, and, on the other, declares virtue and piety  to be the criterion for determining a person&#8217;s worth.&#8221; Inna akramakum `ind-Allahi  atqakum&#8221; (The noblest in the eyes of God is the most pious among you). Thus does  Islam minimise in every possible way the temptation to illegal trade and traffic. Let us  now take note of the forms of business transactions which have been prohibited in Islam.  The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) has not only disapproved of certain forms of  business transactions, but has also laid down some basic conditions that should be  fulfilled in every transaction if it is to be lawful. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The following are some of these basic conditions: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Things sold and money offered as their price to be lawfully  acquired. The things sold and the money to be offered as their price should both be  lawfully acquired and clearly specified. This condition demands that the goods sold should  have been lawfully obtained. One has no business to sell goods which one has stolen or  which one has acquired in a fraudulent manner. nor should one purchase anything with the  money which one has accepted as illegal gratification or has aceuired in some other  deceitful way. This condition holds the buyer and the seller responsible for lawful  possession of the goods on the partof one and of the money on the part of other. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Goods not to be sold before obtaining their possession. The  Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) has warned the Muslims against indulging in forward  transactions which means selling goods before obtaining their possession.&#8221; Whoever  buys cereals shall not tell them until he has obtained their possession,&#8221; says the  Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him). According to Ibn &#8216;Abbas, what applies to cereals  also applies to other categories of goods. On another occasion the Holy Prophet (may peace  be upon him) has said:&#8221; Bargain not about that which is not with you.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Goods to be bought in the open market. Goods and  commodities for sale should go into the open market, and the seller or his agents must be  aware of the state of the market before proposals are made for the purchase by the buyers.  The seller should not be taken unawares lest the buyers should take undue advantage of his  ignorance of the conditions and prices prevailing in the market. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>No trade and traffic in things, the use of which is  prohibited by Islam. A Muslim can trade in those goods and commodities only the use of  which has been declared to be Halal (lawful). There can be no trade and traffic in things  the use of which is proliibited by Islam. For example, there can be no trade in wine,  swine, dead bodies of animals and idols. A devout Muslim merchant would not even traffic  in thin and transparent stuff for ladies because the use of such stuff by ladies is  unlawful. One cannot sell the carcass of an animal. He can, however, flay its skin which  can be used for making shoes and which can therefore, be sold, but not the flesh of the  dead animal. What is true of the usable skin of animals is also true of the tusks of an  elephant. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Prohibited forms of Business </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Monopoly business. As monopoly means concentration of  supply in one hand, it leads to exploitation of the consumers and the workers, it has,  therefore, been declared unlawful by the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him). Gigantic  trusts. cartels and monopolies should not exist in the Islamic society. The  monopoly-dominated economic order betrays lack of harmony between private and social good  and is, thus, a negation of the principle of maximum social advantage which the Islamic  society sets out to achieve. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Speculative business basd on selfish interest. Speculation  means buying something cheap in bulk at a time and selling it dear at another and, thus,  controlling the whole market to achieve personal gains. A close observation will reveal  that speculators are primarily interested in private gains regardless of the larger  interest of the society. These speculators try to create artificial scarcity of goods and  commodities and thereby create an inflationary pressure on the economy. As the poor masses  have to pay for this. Islam has condemned such speculative business. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Interest transactions. All transactions involving interest  are forbidden in Islam. Some people find it hard to submit to the injunction prohibiting  interest, because they think interest and profit earned in trade are similar. Capital  invested in trade brings an excess called profit; invested in banking it brings interest.  Why should one excess be considered lawful and the other unlawful? They fail to take note  of the basic difference between the two. Trade involves risk of loss. Also in its case, it  is not only the capital invested that brings profit which is equally the result of  initiative, enterprise and efficiency of the entrepreneur. Hence its rate cannot be  predetermined and fixed. Moreover, trade is productive. A person reaps a benefit after  undergoing labour and hardship. It creates conditions of full employment and economic  growth. It will also be noted that trade acts as one of the dominant factors in the  process of building up civilisation through co-operation and mutual exchange of ideas. The  spread of Islam and Islamic civilisation In the Far East has been mostly due to the  efforts of Muslim traders. Interest has no redeeming feature at all. The fixed rate of  profit which a person gets from a financial investment without any risk of loss and  without augmenting it with human labour creates in man the undesirable weakness of  miserliness and Shylockian selfishness and lack of sympathy. In the economic sphere it  initiates and aggravates crisis. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Rightly, therefore, has Islam strictly prohibited all  transactions based on it or involving it in some form or other. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Advancing money on interest, keeping deposits in a bank for  the sake of earning interest, or getting concessions in rates of goods or commodities  against advance payments of price, mortgaging and utilising an income-yielding property  against a certain sum, to be returned in full when the property is redeemed and investing  money in a trade against a predetermined and fixed rate of profit-are all unlawfnl  business transactions because they involve Riba (interest) in some form or the other. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Transactions similar (in nature) to gambling. The Arabic  equivalent to gambling is Maisir which literarily means&#8221; getting something too  easily&#8221;,&#8221; getting a profit without working for it&#8221;. The literal meaning of  the term explains the principle on account of which gambling is prohibited in Islam. Any  monetary gain which cornes too easily, so much so that one does not have to work for it,  is unlawful. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The most familiar form of gambling amang the Arabs in the  days of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) was gambling by casting of lots by means  of arrows drawn from a bag. Some were blank and those who drew them got nothing. Others  indicated prizes-big or small ones. Whether one got anything or nothing depended on pure  luck. unless there was fraud on the part of someone concerned. The principle on which  objection to gambling is based is that you gain what you have not earned, or lose on a  mere chance. Dice, lottery, prize bonds and betting on horse races are to be held within  the definition of gambling. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Munabadha and Mulamasa. Islam recognises barter trade  subject to the injunctions of the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah. In fact, Islam has closed all  doors of dishonesty and deceit in business dealings. It has prohibited all forms of  transactions which admit of fraud in the least degree. It has impressed on the traders  that defective and worthless goods should not be given in exchange for good ones, and if  there is a defect in the goods sold it must be pointed out and made manifest to the  purchaser. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:&#8221; The buyer and the  seller have the option of cancelling the contract as long as they have not separated;  then. if they both speak the truth and make manifest, their transaction shall be blessed,  and it they conceal and tell lies, the blessing of their transaction shall be  obliterated&#8221;. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Besides issuing the instructions which govern all forms of  trade, particularly barter trade, Islam has banned two forms of sale contract that were  prevalent before Islam. These were Munabadha and Mulamasa. In neither of these was the  purchaser offered an opportunity to examine the thing purchased. Munabadha means that the  seller should throw the cloth to the buyer before he has carefully examined it. The very  act of throwing the cloth will mean that the bargain has been struck. Mulamasa means  touching the cloth without examining it, ie. the buyer was just supposed to touch the  cloth to strike the bargain. Both these forms of transaction were prohibited because in  either case the purchaser got no opportunity to examine the things sold to him, and the  bargain was likely to prove unduly disadvantageous to one side. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In fact, Islam demanlds that goods and commodities for we  should go to the open market and the seller or his agents must be aware of the state of  the market before proposals are made for the purchase of goods or communities in bulk. He  should not be taken unawares lest advantage be taken of his ignorance of the state of the  market, and the prevailing prices. All this is ver clearly laid down by the Prophet (may  peace he upon him). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>As mentioned above, Islam tries to be fair to both parties  to a transaction. Any step on the part of one, that is advantageous to him and  disadvantageous to the other, is not permissible. The seller is expected to make the  defects (if any) in the goods manifest to the buyer, nor is the buyer expected to take  undue advantage of the ignorance of the seller. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Mozabana. It is the exchange of fresh fruits for dry ones  in a way that the quantity of the dry fruit is actually measured and fixed, but the  quantity of the fresh fruit to be given in exchange is guessed while it is still on the  trees (Mishkat, 2710). The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) has forbidden this  exchange because the quantity of the fruit on the trees cannot be definitely Determined  and the transaction is just a leap into the dark. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Mu&#8217;awama. It consists in selling the fruit on the trees for  a period of one, two or three years even before it has made its appearance. It is  prohibited because like Muzabana it is also a leap into the dark. Such transactions may  result in bitterness and frustration. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Bai&#8217; al-Gharar. It is to sell a thing which one doesn&#8217;t  have in one&#8217;s possession, nor expects to bring it under one&#8217;s control, e g. fish in the  river, or birds in the air. Possession is one of the basic conditions of a sale. One  cannot sell a thing which is not in one&#8217;s possession. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Bai&#8217; al-&#8216;Uryan. It is getting a thing against a nominal  advance on the condition that if the bargain is struck, the advance will be adjusted and  if the bargain is cancelled, the seller will riot return the advance. The advance being  nominal, the buyer has practically no liability. He will abide by the contract if he finds  it advantageous to him and will withdraw himself from it otherwise. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Bai&#8217; al-Mudtar. It is to buy a thing forcibly or to  purchase a thing when its owner is compelled under stress of want to dispose it of.  Instead of purchasing the thing, and taking undue advantage of the seller&#8217;s helplessness,  one should help him. Bai&#8217; alal-Bai&#8217; (sale over and above the sale of another). When one  person has sold goods to another, a third Person should not upset the bargain trying to  sell his own goods to the latter, offering them at lower rates or pointing out the defect  in the goods already sold to him by the former.&#8221; A Muslim should not purchase in  opposition to his brother, nor should he send a marriage proposal over and above the  proposal of another.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Bai&#8217; al-Hast (i. e. sale by means of pebbles). The  purchaser will tell the seller that when he will throw a pebble on his goods, the sale  contract will be confirmed or the seller tell the purchaser that on whatever thing a  pebble thrown by him falls will be sold to him. Sale contract is a serious matter and it  should not be accomplished by such hit-and-miss methods like throwing the pebbles on the  goods. A sale completed in this way may lead to injustice and hardship to one side and is  consequently prohibited. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Sale of unripe fruit and unripe corn. The Holy Prophet (may  peace be upon him), according to Hadrat Anas (Allah be pleased with him), has prohibited  the sale of grapes before they become dark and that of the corn before it ripens.  Similarly, he has forbidden the sale of raw dates. The fruit of the date palms should not  be sold until it becomes red or yellow. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Here is a brief account of the sale transactions prohibited  by Islam. If one ponders over these forms of transaction described above and described in  greater detail in&#8221; Kitab al-Buyu,&#8221; one can arrive at the following conclusions: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam insists upon absolute justice and fairplay in  business dealings. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>According to Islam, a person who sacrifices his faith, and  loses the good pleasure of his Lord to make a monetary gain has not made a good bargain. A  Muslim will not go in for such a bad bargain. A Muslim merchant is not a worshipper of the  Mammon with an inordinate love for money. He prizes faith, piety and righteousness above  all. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam does not believe in the view that all is fair in  business and that every kind of cleverness and deceit is justifiable in business  transactions. Islam regards business or commerce as an economic activity to be carried on  in a spirit of humanity. tarianism and justice. It does not approve of the cut-throat  competition. Indeed, the very concept is un-Islamic. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam expects the buyer and the seller to look upon each  other as Muslim brethren or fellow human beings, each trying to go all his way to help and  serve the other. It the seller happens to overcharge the buyer, he, instead of feeling  proud of his cleverness in doing so, should somehow compensate him for the excessive  payment received. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>All bargains that are clenched without giving the purchaser  a fair chance of examining the things are prohibited because this amounts to denying him a  right that was his due. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Forcible transactions or transactions in which the buyer  takes undue. advantage of the helplessness or misery of the seller are also discouraged. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam has prohibited traffic in wine, swine, dead bodies of  animals and other goods the use of which has been declared to be Haram (unlawful). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It has also forbidden trading in things that have a  debasing or vitiating influence on the Muslim society. </font></p>

As for Mukhabara it is this that a wasteland is given by a person to    another and he makes an investment in it and then gets a share in the produce. According    to him (Jabir), Muzabana is the sell of fresh dates on the tree for dry dates with a    measure, and Muhaqala in agriculture implies that one should sell the standing crop for    grains with a measure.</font></p>

Khadij said to Abdullah: I heard it from two uncles of mine and    they had participated in the Battle of Badr who narrated to the members of the family that    Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) forbade the renting of land. Abdullah said: I    knew it that the land was rented during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be    upon him).

Allah&#8217;s    Apostle (may peace be upon him) said to him: Where did you get these dates? I went with    two sa&#8217;s of (inferior dates) and bought one sa&#8217; of (these fine dates), for that is the    prevailing price (of inferior dates) in the market and that is the price (of the fine    quality of dates in the market), whereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said:    Woe be upon you! You have dealt in interest, when you decide to do it (i. e. exchange    superior quality of dates for inferior quality) ; so you should sell your dates for    another commodity (or currency) and then with the help of that commodity buy the dates you    like. Abu Sa&#8217;ad said: When dates are exchanged for dates (with different qualities) there    is the possibility (of the element of) interest (creeping into that) or when gold is    exchanged for gold having different qualities. I subsequently came to Ibn &#8216;Umar and he    forbade me (to do it), but I did not come to Ibn &#8216;Abbas; (Allah be pleased with them).

I said: It is, by the grace of    your prayer, all right. He said: Would you sell this (camel) to me? I felt shy (to say    him,&#8221; No&#8221; ) as we had no other camel for carrying water, but (later on) I said:    Yes, and to I sold it to him on the condition that (I would be permitted) to ride it until    I reached Madina.

I said to him: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, my father died (or he fell as a martyr), and I have    small sisters to (look after), so I did not like the idea that I should marry a woman who    is like them and thus be not able to teach them manners and look after them properly.

I    said: No, but, Allah&#8217;s Messenger, it is yours. He said: No, it can&#8217;t be, but sell it to    me. I said: Then give me an &#8216;uqaya of gold for I owe that to a person and then it would be    yours. He (the Holy Prophet) said: I take it (for an &#8216;uqiya of gold) and you reach Medina    on it. As I reached Medina, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to Bilal: Give    him an &#8216;uqiya of gold and make some extra payment too. He (Jabir) said: He gave me an    &#8216;uqiya of gold and made an addition of a qirat. He (Jabir) said: The addition made by    Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was with me (as a sacred trust for belssing) and    lay with me in a pocket until the people of Syria took it on the Day of Harra.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Sa&#8217;id b. Zaid b. &#8216;Amr b. Nufail (Allah be pleased with    them) reported that Arwi (bint Uwais) disputed with him (in regard to a part of the land)    of his hodse. He said: Leave it and take off your claim from it, for I heard Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: He who took a span of land without his right    would be made to wear around his neck seven earths on the Day of Resurrection. He (Sa&#8217;id    b. Zaid) said: O Allah, make her blind if she has told a lie and make her grave in her    house. He (the narrator) said: I saw her blind groping (her way) by touching the walls and    saying: The curse of Sa&#8217;id b. Zaid has hit me. And it so happened that as she was walking    in her house, she passed by a well in her house and fell therein and that be- came her    grave.</font></p>

Zaid that he had    seized some of the land belonging to her. She brought this dispute before Marwan b.    al-Hakam. Sa&#8217;id said: How could I take a part of her land, after what I heard from Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon&#8217;him)? He (Marwan) said: What did you hear from Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him)? He said: I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon    him) say: He who wrongly took a span of land would be made to wear around his neck seven    earths. Marwan said: I do not ask any evidence from you after this. He (Sa&#8217;id) said: O    Allah, make her blind if she has told a lie and kill her in her own land. He (the    narrator) said: She did not die until she had lost her eyesight, and (one day) as she was    walking in her land, she fell down into a pit and died.</font></p>

Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: The eldest one (eldest in regard to age should speak). So he kept quiet, and his companions (Muhayyisa and Huwayyisa) began to speak, and he (&#8216;Abd al Rahman) spoke along with them and they narrated to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) the murder of &#8216;Abdullah b. Sahl. Thereupon he said to them: Are you prepared to take fifty oaths so that you may be entitled (to blood-wit) of your companion (or your man who has murdered)? They said: How can we take an oath on a matter which we have not witnessed? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Then the Jews will exonerate themselves by fifty oaths. They said: How can we accept the oaths of people who are unbelievers? When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) saw that, he himself paid his blood-wit.</p>

Then they (Huwayyisa and Muhayyisa) spoke about the matter of their companion (murder of their cousin, &#8216;Abdullah b. Sahl). Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Let fifty (persons) among you take oath for levelling the charge (of murder) against a person amongst them, and he would be surrendered to you. They said: We have not witnessed this matter ourselves. How can we then take oath? He (the Holy Prophet) said: The Jews will exonerate themselves by the oaths of fifty of them. They said: Messenger of Allah, they are non-believing people. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) paid the blood wit for him. Sahl said: As one day I entered the fold a she-camel amongst those camels hit me with its leg.</p>

And Ya&#8217;la used to say: That was the most weighty of my deeds, in my opinion. Safwan said that Ya&#8217;la had stated: I had a servant; he quarrelled with another person, and the one bit the hand of the other. (&#8216;Ata&#8217; said that Safwan had told him which one had bitten the hand of the other.) So he whose hand was bitten drew ill from (the mouth) of the one who had bitten it and (in this scuffle) one of his foreteeth was also drawn out. They both came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and he declared his (claim for the compensation of) tooth as invalid.</p>

Dhu&#8217;l-Qa&#8217;da, Dhu&#8217;l- Hijja and Muharram, and also Rajab the month of Mudar which comes between Jumada and Sha&#8217;ban. He (the Holy Prophet) then said: which month is this?

You will soon meet your Lord and He will ask you about your deeds. So do not turn after me unbelievers (or misguided), some of you striking the necks of the others. Behold I let him who is present convey to him who is absent, for many a one whom a message is conveyed has a more retentive memory than one who hears.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Miswar b. Makhrama reported that &#8216;Umar b. Khattab consulted people about the diyat of abortion of an unboam child. Mughira b. Shu&#8217;ba said: I bear witness to the fact that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) gave judgment about it that a good quality of slave or female slave should be given for it. Thereupon &#8216;Umar said: Bring one who may bear witness to you. Then Muhammad b. Maslama bore witness to him.</p>
